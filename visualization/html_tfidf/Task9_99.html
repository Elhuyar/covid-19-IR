This study was approved by the ethics committee of the First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University. We thank all medical staff who are fighting against this public crisis. We also thank the hospital staff (see appendix pp 4-9 for a full list) for their efforts in collecting patient data. This study is supported by the China National Science Foundation In modern society, it is accepted that individuals have the right to die with dignity. Since 1976, in the USA, people who are incarcerated have a limited constitutional right to health care, consistent with the Eighth Amendment. At present, there are more than 2600 incarcerated men and women in the USA who have been sentenced to death, most of whom have less than a high school diploma or High School Equivalency Certificate (GED), and are disproportionately of minority racial or ethnic backgrounds (42% African-American representation on death row vs 13% African-American representation in the US census). 1 The combination of poor health status, social determinants of health, and paucity of adequate care provided in correctional facilities is driving a public health emergency, which is endangering the North American incarcerated population. We can expect the prevalence and burden of chronic illness to rise concomitantly with the growth of the ageing population in US prisons. 2 Data suggest that cancer is the leading cause of illness-related deaths in US state prisons. 2 In the absence of reform, the mass incarceration trends observed over the past three decades will substantially widen disparities, adversely affecting access to health care.","Another important feedback loop is present in our CLD: when the perceived number of infectious people begins to drop (due to control measures or the impaired ability to test and detect new cases, for example), personal and societal measures to control the infection will be relaxed, increasing transmission, and oscillating periods of reemergence of the disease and subsequent return of control measures may occur. System behaviour is caused by system structure [6] . Visualising the system can help us change the structural connections to achieve our goals. If desirable protective measures are separated from their dependence on the perceived number of infectious people, they could be used to pre-emptively reduce the risk of transmission in the absence of the infectious agent. Policies that reduce the number of interpersonal contacts and environmental contamination do not need to motivate people's own protective behaviours, and can therefore avoid the risk of outrage and stigma. Examples of such policies include promoting work from home, flexible or staggered working hours, increasing opportunities to prevent environmental contamination (e.g. better access to hand washing or sanitation facilities), increased cleaning of shared spaces [8] , mitigating economic pressure for people to work while infectious, natural ventilation [9] , and improving sanitation and food hygiene [10] . In common, these actions rely less on individuals' agency by providing a protective context. Finding ways to incorporate and sustain such changes could reduce the risk of future outbreaks, the incidence of seasonal influenza and other infections, and even the carbon footprints of travel and air conditioning. The rapid spread of COVID-19 demonstrates the need to support risk reduction through system change globally, not only to respond after new threats emerge. The sporadic nature of outbreaks means that in the time between outbreaks, it is not evident when the conditions in the system are conducive or resistant to the spread of infection. In responding to the COVID-19 epidemic, policymakers should aim to bring about protective structural system changes so that the readiness of society to prevent emerging infectious disease outbreaks is independent of the current perceived number of cases. In doing so, they can create a system that is intrinsically more resilient to new, and established, infectious agents. Systems thinking and methods can help achieve this.","In essence, during the current time of widespread anxiety around the COVID-19 pandemic [16], a pragmatic guide based on underlying risk stratification and resource utilization will help support our ethical duty of assuring access to timely and appropriate surgical care to our patients, while maintaining an unwavering stewardship for scarce resources and emergency preparedness. Figure 1 provides a tentative decision-making algorithm based on elective surgical indications and predicted perioperative utilization of critical resources, including the consideration for intra\u2212/postoperative blood product transfusions, estimated postoperative hospital length of stay, and the expected requirement for prolonged ventilation and need for postoperative ICU admission. ","The risks of EIDs are inherently dynamic and largely unpredictable. New threats persist, including the recent outbreak of a novel coronavirus COVID-19 emerging from Wuhan, China (4) Government leaders face formidable decisions about the provision of health security measures against outbreaks of these threats. Global actors are seeking to diminish the danger that these pathogens pose to the wellbeing of nations, regions, and the world. Given the range of potential biological threats, their unpredictability, and the limited resources available to address them, policymakers must necessarily prioritize their readiness efforts based on limited knowledge. All too often, they are forced to choose between priorities, and construct so-called limited lists of treatments, using testimony from teams of experts to inform these decisions. As history has shown, however, this approach leaves society vulnerable to unforeseen outbreaks. Therefore, a more rational approach is to develop a broad portfolio of vaccines in a coordinated manner, mitigating the future risk posed by unpredictable outbreaks of these diseases.","Crisis management and response: political unrest/regional instability/national disasters (evacuation potential) understanding of the security vulnerabilities, these few can cause substantial losses of assets. \u2022 Crisis management and response: domestic terrorism. risk exposures can occur at home and abroad. The security practitioner has the duty to qualify and manage threats and vulnerabilities. 15 Organizations that operate in nations where there are risks to employees and assets require constant monitoring. Optimal security operations must seek to assess the risks in various nations. They must further stay abreast of any changing conditions that could lead to threats to employees or expropriations of assets. In the event of an emergency, security planners must attempt to remove employers safely from harm's way. \u2022 Unethical business conduct. In many circumstances, one of the tasks for security operations is to play varying roles in drafting, monitoring, and enforcing an organizational code of ethical conduct. 16 \u2022 Identity theft. In a recent year almost 12 million persons were victimized by the effects from identity theft in the united States. The crime has no borders, so victims are found globally. Workplaces are impacted when merchandise is transported to perpetrators or their agents. 17 \u2022 Environmental/social pandemics (e.g., Ebola virus). ebola, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SArS), and other viral attacks impact the workplace, although immediate risks are few. Typically, organizations plan on how to conduct operations as close to normal as possible in the unlike event that a pandemic hits close to home. In 2014, security directors of global organizations prepared contingency plans in the event that operations or supply chain activity was interrupted by the ebola virus. \u2022 Crisis management and response: political unrest/regional instability/national disaster (evacuation potential). The supply chain can be shut down if a key material, part, or assembly cannot be delivered due to an interruption. Security practitioners have roles in assuring that, as far as possible, alternative resources are available. Similarly, some security programs have 24/7 active monitoring of global conditions where the organization operates. \u2022 Litigation: inadequate security. The reality or fear of legal action for negligence is one of the driving features in security management today. Security program operators are involved in a variety of activities related to these risks, including instituting procedures and controls to reduce such risks and preparing actions or defenses for legal cases. 18 \u2022 Fraud/white-collar crime. The term \"white-collar crime\" was coined by the sociologist edwin Sutherland, and signifies unlawful, nonviolent conduct committed by corporations and individuals. It includes theft, fraud, and other violations of trust, including embezzlement. embezzlement is the fraudulent appropriation of property by one lawfully entrusted with its possession. Frequently, this crime is committed by someone with a fiduciary responsibility within the organization, which he or she then abuses. The investigation and prevention of fraud (i.e., false representation or intentional perversion of truth to induce another to part with something valuable) is an important task in any organization.","Pharmacists are the most accessible healthcare providers, and so understanding the epidemiology of COVID-19, its transmission and how to prevent it spreading, and being aware of informative federal resources regarding COVID-19 strategies are important considerations. All pharmacy professionals should keep up to date, and be familiar, with the latest CoV prevention and treatment guidelines, which are rapidly changing. 1 Several resources are available to help pharmacists worldwide care for individuals and communities, such as the American Pharmacists' Association (APhA) resource centre webpage, which provides the latest information from federal agencies and a decision-tree document that can be used to assist pharmacists in talking to individuals with different levels of COVID-19 risk. The APhA has also recently issued a tool --Preparedness and Prevention Guidance during Coronavirus Pandemic --to help pharmacists be prepared. 3 For preparing clinicians to respond to health threats and emergencies related to disease outbreaks and disasters, the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC's) Clinician Outreach and Communication Activity (COCA) is a vital information source. 3 In addition, many reference documents are now being made available to pharmacists so they can have access to the latest updates regarding COVID-19 management. The American Society of Hospital Pharmacists (ASHP) has recently initiated a comprehensive online resource that includes most of the COVID-19-related pharmacy information and free, 60-day open access to ASHP drug information. 4 It should be noted that pharmacists should regularly review these pharmaceutical recommendations because changes are expected as information about the virus accumulates. Below are directions to some of these online resources: patients, they need to pay attention to protecting themselves. The World Health Organization (WHO) has recommended that healthcare staff wear appropriate eye protection, surgical masks, long-sleeved gowns and gloves when entering a room containing suspected or confirmed COVID-19-infected individuals. WHO has also recommended using a particulate respirator that is at least as protective as a US National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health-certified N95 when performing aerosol-generating procedures such as tracheal intubation, non-invasive ventilation, tracheostomy, cardiopulmonary resuscitation or manual ventilation before intubation or bronchoscopy). 5 However, self-isolation of pharmacists who have been in contact with suspected COVID-19 individuals are not obliged to wear these unless otherwise ordered by health protection professionals. 6","Radiation Oncologists will also have to prepare for treatment interruptions caused by development of COVID-19 in cancer patients. Patients who test positive for the novel coronavirus will, at a minimum, require a 14-day quarantine per CDC recommendations. 15 At the other end of the spectrum, cancer patients with immunosuppression may require hospitalization and isolation precautions, thereby preventing the continuation of radiation treatments. Data from a report of the clinical characteristics of patients with COVID-19 showed that 6.1% of patients required intensive care, mechanical ventilation or died. 16 Although it is yet unclear how the virus will behave in the US, the situations in China and Italy suggest the burden on hospitals and intensive care units will be significant. Additionally, this study demonstrated that pneumonia and lymphocytopenia were prominent at 91.1% and 83.2%, respectively, which would impact decisions to hold off on treatments pending improvements in the patient's clinical status and immune recovery. 16 These treatment interruptions would be of utmost concern in tumors for which treatment package time significantly impacts outcomes such as head and neck and cervical tumors. 17, 18 However, this is also of concern in lung tumors and other thoracic tumors, for both tumor control and the lungs potentially lying in the path of treatment beams. Treatments would likely need to be paused while monitoring the course of COVID-19 in this setting. Treatment delays may also be due strains on the healthcare system in the setting of a pandemic due to travel restrictions, availability of workforce, and/or lack of access to hospital care. 19 If possible, travel restrictions for the general public should be tailored for patients with cancer, such as being done currently in Italy. 20 Little data exists currently to guide radiation treatment decisions in the setting of a pandemic. However, we may borrow insight from the response of Radiation Oncology clinics during Hurricane Maria. As per Gay et al, mitigating the impact of a natural disaster on cancer patients requires 4 components or \"PCOC\": prepare, communicate, operate, compensate. 21 In preparing, consideration should be made for scenarios which may require delayed treatment starts, or shorter fractionation regimens (i.e. hypofractionation), given that COVID-19 poses a substantial immediate risk for elderly patients. Again, there is a paucity of data to guide these decisions and priority should be given to higher risk tumors (H&amp;N, Cervix, Lung, etc.), which are nicely referenced in the Hurricane Maria review. Overall, the immediate risk of COVID-19 will have to be weighed against the long-term risks associated with their specific cancer diagnosis.","An uncomplicated hernia is any type of hernia which either does not contain intestine or contains non-incarcerated intestine. A complicated hernia is any type of hernia which contains incarcerated or strangulated intestine.","Nosocomial infectious disease outbreaks are serious threats that can impose great stress on any given healthcare facility if not managed properly. This experience resulted in a deeper understanding of nosocomial MERS outbreaks and highlighted significant room for improvement. The lessons learned at KAMC-R have initiated a transformation process that will support the ongoing task of eliminating shortcomings and mitigating future outbreaks.","Although the scientific basis for these interventions might be robust, ethical considerations are multi faceted. 9 Importantly, political leaders must enact quarantine and social-distancing policies that do not bias against any population group. The legacies of social and economic injustices perpetrated in the name of public health have lasting repercussions. 10 Interventions might pose risks of reduced income and even job loss, disproportionately affecting the most disadvantaged populations: policies to lessen such risks are urgently needed. Special attention should be given to protections for vulnerable populations, such as homeless, incarcerated, older, or disabled individuals, and undocumented migrants. Similarly, exceptions might be necessary for certain groups, including people who are reliant on ongoing medical treatment.","Explicitly and transparently align prison health systems with the wider health and emergency planning systems, including transfer protocols for patients requiring specialised care. Isolate cases and contacts if required to control the spread of infection in prisons. However, special consideration of the potentially serious mental health effects of isolation in these settings is essential. 10, 11 In high-income countries, maintaining isolation without depriving incarcerated people of human contact might be possible. 12","Preparing for epidemic threats is not a static or binary (prepared or unprepared) exercise, but a dynamic state reflecting the constantly changing world. Countries prepare in different ways based on their interpretation of disease risks and international agreements such as the International Health Regulations (IHR). The IHR were introduced in 1969 to prevent spread of specific serious diseases between countries and set out preparedness measures at international borders to stop disease spread. The 2005 revisions to the IHR reflect changes across multiple dimensions, requiring countries to develop preparedness capacities to detect and respond to outbreaks where and when they occur, supported by international partners to respond when outbreaks cannot be contained locally. 5 However, disruptive factors have emerged at a greater pace over the past decade, creating a new ecology that requires novel strategies for preparedness. These factors include dealing with the increasing human population density and connectivity, harnessing novel data streams and new technological advances to manage epidemics, mitigating false information on social networks, to creating informal technical networks that can work together when political forces fail to do so.","It is well established that professional ethics forbids health-care staff from participating in any aspect of capital punishment. However, what of the incarcerated patient with cancer who is dying under the care of a physician with direct or indirect duties to the jurisdiction charged with judicial execution? What are the duties of the physician expected to provide palliative care to the incarcerated if the patient desires it? We argue that they are no different than those incumbent upon the physician and health-care staff in the community. The accepted framework of medicoethical principles requires that oncology practitioners consider pain relief and other principles of palliative","Antimicrobial stewardship programmes, involving physicians, pharmacists, infection preventionists and other practitioners with advanced training in infectious diseases (IDs), are vital in assuring the safety and quality of healthcare services, particularly during outbreaks of serious infection. As essential members of antimicrobial stewardship programmes, ID pharmacists have the opportunity to support emerging pathogen-response and planning efforts. The ID pharmacist can coordinate with the microbiology laboratory for the interpretation of, and action involving, COVID-19 test results, monitor compliance with institutional guidelines, prepare and implement local treatment protocols, monitor and manage drug shortages and help in investigations of new drug applications and uses. 13 Clinical and ID pharmacists need to familiarise themselves with all drug-related information that may be required in COVID-19 cases, including dosing and dose adjustment, drug/drug interactions, drug/food interactions, adverse effects, monitoring parameters and the pharmacokinetics of all drugs that may be used. They must also be well-prepared to provide the best available recommendations to all healthcare practitioners. Additionally, in light of the lack of a currently approved treatment for COVID-19, pharmacists working in the pharmaceutical supply chain should be prepared to manage any potential medication or pharmacy consumable shortages (such as protective personal equipments, intravenous bags and syringes), to work proactively on having a plan to judiciously use the current resources, and be prepared to face increased case loads or emergency scenarios.","The rapid and collaborative management of the first imported COVID-19 cases in France highlights the fact that the French healthcare system is adequately prepared to respond to such emerging diseases threats. However, this surveillance system is extremely time-consuming and requires considerable manpower. The data available on 12 February strongly suggest that human-to-human transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is frequent, with the reproduction number estimated at 2 to 3 [5,10-14]. Twenty-five countries have already reported imported cases from China, and several of them have described autochthonous transmission events [15]. In the case of further spread of SARS-CoV-2 worldwide, it would soon become impossible to detect all imported cases and trace their contacts. Especially the occurrence of large clusters in the same region would strongly impact on the local health authorities\u2019 capacities. The surveillance objectives would then need to evolve from containing the epidemic to mitigating its medical and societal impact.","With the experience of mitigating the outbreaks of SARS and avian influenza, what strategies can be applied in mitigating COVID-19 and future CoV outbreaks? Should veterinarians play more important roles in the prevention and control of emerging zoonoses in the future?","A number of structures, when torn, may incarcerate a segment of intestine (typically the small intestine), including intestinal mesentery, 20 the gastrosplenic ligament, 34 the broad ligament, 35 and the cecocolic ligament. 36 Horses with such incarcerations have signs typical of a horse with strangulating small intestine, including moderate to severe signs of abdominal pain, endotoxemia, absent gastrointestinal sounds, distended small intestine on per rectal palpation, nasogastric reflux, and serosanguinous abdominal fluid. However, the prognosis for many of these horses appears to be lower than for horses with other types of small intestinal strangulations. For example, in horses with small intestine entrapped in a mesenteric rent, only 7 of 15 horses were discharged from the hospital, and only 2 of 5 horses for which follow-up information was available survived long term (&gt;5 months). 20 Poor outcome may result from the difficulty in unentrapping incarcerated intestine, the degree of hemorrhage, and the length of intestine affected.","Data were collected using a self-administered questionnaire. The questionnaires were distributed and collected during the regular weekly residents' education activities. The questionnaire contained a brief description of the study's objectives and statements assuring participants of their anonymity and right to stop participating of their own volition. The questionnaire was adapted and modified, based on a review of the literature, from one used in a previous study by Wong et al. [7]. The questionnaire comprised two parts. The first part contained questions about participants' background information, including age, marital status, training level, and knowledge of MERS. The second part comprised four main sections that included an assessment of (1) work-related concerns, (2) non-work-related concerns, (3) the perceived impact of MERS on ERRPs, and (4) their preparedness for a MERS outbreak.","Both the United States (US) Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) have provided guidance on the conduct of clinical trials during the COVID-19 pandemic. The FDA document provides \"general considerations to assist sponsors in assuring the safety of trial participants, maintaining compliance with good clinical practice (GCP), and minimizing risks to trial integrity during the COVID-19 pandemic (1) .\" The NIH document outlines \"the flexibilities available to recipients conducting NIH-funded clinical trials and human subject studies, that are impacted by the declared public health emergency for COVID-19 (2) .\" While broadly applicable, neither document is specific to the conduct of HF clinical trials during this unprecedented and exceptionally challenging time. Thus, the present article specifically addresses HF clinical trials by outlining a number of guiding principles and possible trial conduct solutions for the COVID-19 pandemic. The authors emphasize that this statement does not constitute regulatory advice, and study sponsors and leaders should interact directly with regulatory authorities, both in the US and abroad, if applicable.","where E 0 is the given initial cumulative number of known cases and i n0 (E 0 ) and I 0 (E 0 ) are computed according to equations 10, assuring that the initial condition lies on the exponential trajectory. In the model variant with varied contact rate, r C = r C0 \u00d7 H/ (H + (daily new cases)), daily new cases are computed as r E I(t). Simulations of this model variant start from the same initial condition that lies on the exponential trajectory.","Although umbilical herniae are common in foals, strangulation of herniated bowel is rare. In one study, 6 of 147 (4%) horses with umbilical herniae had incarcerated intestine. 43 Clinical signs include a warm, swollen, firm, and painful hernia sac associated with signs of colic. The affected segment of bowel is usually small intestine, but herniation of cecum or large colon also has been reported. In rare cases, one may find a hernia that involves only part of the intestinal wall, called a Richter's hernia. In foals that have a Richter's hernia, an enterocutaneous fistula may develop. In one study, 13 of 13 foals with strangulating umbilical herniae survived to discharge, although at least 3 died of long-term complications. 44","The triage station was required to be located outside the entrance of the outpatient hall with highlighted signs. This location was chosen for better ventilation and more space, mitigating close contact among people by setting one-metre interval lines for queueing. The security guard and the nurse measure the temperature of the people on line using a mobile infrared thermometer. Tents are pitched for further investigation of suspected patients. One tent is for nonfebrile persons and the other is for febrile patients to enter. All people with mobile phone are required to register their identification and other basic information by scanning the QR code next to the queueing line before entry, reducing the time of collecting information, minimizing the risk of potential contamination by touching the pen and paper and also shortening the waiting time. Filling in the information manually is available, with the help of nurses, for people who cannot complete the task electronically. In the tent, a second time temperature measurement using a more precise infrared thermometer is undertaken, to further assess suspected patients and to minimize the risk of contact transmission to medical staff. Routine hand sanitizers are ready to be used at any time. Trained physicians and nurses wearing personal protective equipment (PPE) work together for initial assessment and the differential diagnosis of the fever. A simple, but crucial, questionnaire is designed to assist diagnosing patients (Figure 1 and Supplementary Figure 1) . [3, 6] General fever clinic and specific fever clinic for the suspected After assessment, patients with fever or cold-like symptoms with epidemiological history or suspected epidemiological history are referred to the 'COVID-2019 fever clinic'; other fever patients without epidemiological history are referred to the \"general fever clinic\". At the clinics the suspected febrile patient undergoes detailed history taking, physical examination, blood and other specimen collection and imaging. Usually, nasopharyngeal specimen are tested all of the febrile patients, regardless of epidemiological links, to ensure that cases are not mis-assigned at triage. Only trained staff are engaged in specimen collection to guarantee the quality of specimen. Extra backup room is kept to accommodate for any overflow of febrile patient. Besides, routine use of disinfectant wipes, disinfectant spray, UV light and air disinfecting machines ensure timely cleaning and sterilization. Hospitals are either redesigning and remodelling old buildings or quickly setting up temporary tents or barrack-like rooms at an open area for better classification and circuit of two passages and the three regions of standard fever clinic, dramatically reducing the risks of hospital cross infection.","To monitor and defeat further progression of the novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) infection, a strong public health vigilance has been adopted in Italy [1] . By March 18, 31,772 cases were confirmed, with 2,390 deaths [2] . The median age of patients who are infected is 63 years and more than twothirds of deaths have occurred in elderly patients (aged \u2265 70 years) [2] . Hospitals' work regimes have been re-prioritized, but Coronavirus does not really affect the cancer clinics. Although radiation oncologists are not fighting on the front line, they have to guarantee treatmentradiotherapy with or without concomitant chemotherapy ((C)RT) -and, in the meantime, protect patients from the COVID-19 infection. In this scenario, (C)RT has a crucial role in head and neck cancer (HNC) management. It is the mainstay of treatment for most of the HNC sites, because of its proven curative intent assuring an organ preservation strategy [3] [4] . HNC is a relatively rare cancer in Italy, with 9,300 new cases and 3,216 deaths described per year [5] . Most of the patients are diagnosed in a locally advanced stage disease and should receive treatment as soon as possible. Therefore, during this pandemic period, HNC patients represent a major clinical problem with treatment decision-making process. Due to the complexity in optimal strategy plan and patients' support care through treatment, the multidisciplinary team should weigh the risks and the benefits to patients in deciding whether to modify patients' work-up and treatment approach. We cannot provide specific guidance on any other protocol of therapy -at this time, no clinical HNC-specific data on COVID-19 are availablebut we can state that each decision requires an individualized risk/benefit assessment. The aim should be to protect HNC patients without compromising their oncologic outcome. It is paramount to stress open channels of communication between administrators, clinicians, patients and caregivers [6] . In order to assist shared decision-making, multidisciplinary team meetings should be promoted using web-platforms. A reasonable treatment strategy between anticancer therapy and epidemic prevention should be selected. It should be considered to: i) omit systemic therapy for patients \u2265 70 years or younger with co-morbidities, such as diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. On the one hand, the updated meta-analysis of chemotherapy in head and neck cancer (MACH-NC) did not show any survival benefit resulting from the addition of chemotherapy for elderly patients [3] . On the other hand, these relevant co-morbidities are linked to a higher risk of death in case of COVID-19 infection [7] . ii) omit cisplatin-based induction chemotherapy. A definitive benefit in overall survival with the incorporation of induction chemotherapy compared to standard (C)RT has not been proven in randomized studies [8] . iii) short overall treatment time. Definitive (C)RT should be limited to simultaneous integrated boost (SIB) techniques in the standard (5 fractions per week) or accelerated schedule (6 fractions per week), in order to achieve a 1-week reduction compared to sequential technique. SIB technique represents an optimum balance between tumor control and prevention of late toxicity excess [9] . iv) delay post-operative RT in patients with salivary gland tumors until 12 weeks after surgery. Time factor is not strictly linked to adverse effect in these cases [10] . v) develop an online surveillance plan. At present HNC patients deal with the double ordeals of disease and pandemic situation. Patients should be educated to properly identify those symptoms and signs that potentially signify a recurrence (increased local pain and difficulty in swallowing, unexplained weight loss and development of new lump in the head and neck region). For sure, patients should be informed regarding the Coronavirus symptoms (mainly fever, dyspnea and cough) and educated in proper hand washing and all other measures to limit viral transmission (avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth; cover your nose and mouth with a tissue when you cough or sneeze; clean and disinfect high touch surfaces regularly; stop shaking hands or kissing as a greeting; reduce exposure to sick contacts and large crowds). Psychological counseling should be paid attention to through seeking alternative schemes. It must be appreciated that this document is an attempt to provide practical suggestions on how to define a reasonable treatment strategy and mitigate the COVID-19 impact on HNC patients under the current pandemic conditions. It is necessary to offer adequate individualized treatment recommendations based on both the epidemic situation and the patient's own condition. We significantly hope to help HNC patients to survive this difficult period.","Vasovagal reactions often occur with short warning, during or immediately or after phlebotomy. Experienced phlebotomists know to look for lightheadedness, weakness, pallor, nausea, and diaphoresis. Excessive anxiety, often manifested by nervous talkativeness and hyperventilation, can precipitate a vasovagal reaction. Hyperventilation can result in respiratory alkalosis and hypocalcemia, which can help precipitate a vasovagal reaction. 123 In these instances, having the donor breathe into a paper bag may increase carbon dioxide levels, reversing the alkalosis and hypocalcemia. A calm, assuring demeanor by the phlebotomist will also do much to alleviate anxiety.","The report by Gilbert and colleagues 4 provides an important tool to map out the continental risk for the spread of COVID-19 in Africa, which should be used to inform a framework of action to prepare the continent for any potential importation and spread of COVID-19. First, collectively, Africa needs a unified continent-wide strategy for preparedness and response. The strategy must be comprehensive, and member states, donors, and partners should immediately commit to releasing financial resources to support country-customised implementation plans derived from the strategy. To help develop a common strategy that will allow for effective coordination, collaboration, and communication, the African Union Commission, Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC), and WHO, in partnership with African countries, have established the Africa Taskforce for Coronavirus Preparedness and Response (AFTCOR). The partnership has six work streams: laboratory diagnosis and subtyping; surveillance, including screening at points of entry and cross-border activities; infection prevention and control in healthcare facilities; clinical management of people with severe COVID-19; risk communication; and supply-chain management and stockpiles. Because mitigating the potential spread of COVID-19 in Africa will require rapid detection and containment, the laboratory work streams of AFTCOR, Africa CDC, and WHO are working closely to expeditiously scale up diagnostic testing capacity linked to enhanced surveillance and monitoring-eg, at the beginning of February, only two countries in Africa had the diagnostic capacity to test for COVID-19. However, as of Feb 25, 2020, more than 40 countries would have been capacitated to accurately diagnose COVID-19 infection, thanks to the coordination efforts of AFTCOR. 6 As testing becomes more available, it is possible that more cases might be detected. Second, any effective preparedness and response strategy for COVID-19 requires a committed political will; as such, the African Union Commission, Africa CDC, and WHO convened, on Feb 22, 2020, in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, an emergency meeting of all ministers of health of 55 member states to commit to acting fast and collectively to develop and implement a coordinated continent-wide strategy. AFTCOR taskforce was formed, and a continent-wide strategy was endorsed at the end of the emergency meeting, with a call for strong coordination of efforts. To prevent the occurrence of a social, health security, and economic tragedy, actions agreed at the emergency ministerial meeting will need to be acted on quickly, before any additional COVID-19 cases are introduced to the continent, and result in sustained human-tohuman transmission. The potential social, economic, and security devastation that COVID-19 could cause in Africa should be enough of an incentive for African governments to invest immediately in preparedness for the worst-case scenario. Third, commitment and release of financial resources from partners and donors before a crisis hits Africa will help anticipate demand and address supply chain management, mapping, and stockpiling of COVID-19 response needs, such as large quantities of personal protective equipment, gloves, surgical masks, coveralls, and hoods, and medical countermeasures like antiviral agents. Supplies of these items will be limited in Africa because of reduced manufacturing capacity.","Early in the SARS coronavirus outbreak, frontline health workers became infected, which amplified transmission to patients in hospitals where outbreaks were occurring. 4 Early evidence from the initial MERS outbreaks suggested that health workers were likewise being infected, but that their infections were less severe than those of patients in hospitals who became infected and had comorbidities such as diabetes or chronic respiratory disease. 5 Today, the epidemiology of both SARS and MERS viruses is mostly understood, and the same will be true for the current outbreak of 2019-nCoV if data continue to be freely shared and used to provide realtime guidance. These Articles and others being rapidly disseminated and shared will have a major role in assuring that this global collaboration occurs. ","The blockage/restriction of exportations can be feasible as preventing/mitigating strategies in specific circumstances. It is the case of all medicinal products for which the shortage has recently ended, and the supply is lower than a warming level and cannot adequately fulfil the National demand. Here again, the establishment of an exportation ban can be useful for high-impact products since the maintenance of National stocks directly influence the capability of healthcare systems to ensure patient access to therapy. For low-shortage-impact products, such strategies may be a too restrictive provision because of the negligible effects on the continuity of the care. Indeed, therapeutically equivalent medicinal products can be substituted with therapeutic alternatives without compromising the safety of patients. For mediumshortage-impact products, the adoption of exportation restrictions should be evaluated case-by-case based on the availability of other therapeutic options.","One can assess motility by monitoring a specific area for contractions over time. Ultrasonography is an accurate method of distinguishing strangulating versus nonstrangulating disorders of the small intestine. Strangulated small intestine has thicker small intestinal walls and larger intestinal diameter than in nonstrangulating disorders. Strangulating lesions have decreased motility in the incarcerated segments with normal motility elsewhere. 49 Cases of paralytic ileus or nonstrangulating obstruction have a diffusely decreased peristalsis, but not to the degree observed with strangulating lesions. 47, 49 One may diagnose some specific lesions of the small intestinal tract using ultrasonography. One may see ascarids in foals in cases of ascarid impaction 47 and epiploic foramen entrapments as edematous loops of small intestine found in the right cranial abdomen. 50 One may note small intestinal intussusceptions as targetlike lesions when viewed in cross sections. 51 The presence of bowel loops, stomach, or liver in the thoracic cavity indicates the presence of herniation through the diaphragm and should be confirmed using radiography or surgical exploration.","Despite major advances in prevention, treatment, and care, HIV infection is a substantial challenge to public health worldwide. In the USA, around 1\u00b71 million people are living with HIV. 91 The epidemic is generally concentrated in urban areas and disproportionately aff ects African-Americans, Latinos, and men who have sex with men (MSM). 91 Overall, incidence has remained stable for more than a decade, 92 with an estimated 47 500 new infections in 2010. 93 However, in young MSM, particularly young black MSM, rates of new infections have increased, 93 prompting targeted campaigns to help to engage with these populations. 94 Despite public health recommendations for routine HIV testing for people aged 13-64 years, 95 around 16% of people infected are unaware of their infection, 91 precluding access to life-prolonging treatment and increasing the risk of transmission to their sexual partners. With data showing that antiretroviral drugs reduce the risk of HIV transmission and acquisition, 96,97 prevention eff orts include treatment for people living with HIV and preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) for people who are HIV negative but at a substantial risk for HIV. Only 25% of the US population with HIV is virally suppressed, and improvements are needed at each stage of the continuum of care, with particular attention to disparities in race or ethnicity and age. 98 For example, young people are less likely to have their infection diagnosed or have viral suppression compared with other age groups. 98 To address the US epidemic, the National HIV/AIDS Strategy (NHAS) was released in 2010, with main goals to: reduce HIV incidence; increase access to care and improve health outcomes for people with HIV; and reduce HIV-related health disparities. 99 CDC's eff orts to advance the NHAS goals are focused on the combination of evidenced-based, cost-eff ective, and scalable prevention interventions for geographical areas and populations with the greatest burden of HIV. Expanded surveillance to monitor community CD4 cell counts and viral loads is also increasingly used to target high burden areas. 100 As new prevention options such as PrEP emerge, operational research will guide implementation of interventions, whether biomedical, behavioural, or structural, to strengthen eff orts to mitigate the US epidemic. 101","Ongoing research on antiviral treatment is promising. Just as for bacterial infection, combination therapy has been studied in influenza infection with different goals, such as preventing pathogen resistance, 119, 120 mitigating the inflammatory response, 121 or achieving synergy. 122, 123 There has been development of new compounds for the treatment of respiratory syncytial virus. These include a fusion inhibitor, which prevents the fusion of respiratory syncytial virus viral envelope with the host cell membrane, and a nucleoside analog, which prevents respiratory syncytial virus replication. 124, 125 SUMMARY Viral respiratory infection is common in pneumonia and is present in approximately 25% of patients with community-acquired pneumonia. It is also common in immunosuppressed patients, but the latter are susceptible not only to the usual community-acquired respiratory viruses but also to viruses of the Herpesviridae family. Recent data show that respiratory viruses are also identified in hospital-acquired infections. The clinical diagnosis of viral infection is challenging. Clinical prediction rules have been developed for the diagnosis of influenza infection but they showed only modest accuracy. Similarly, radiological studies are nonspecific. In the end, the diagnosis of viral infection relies on the recognition that respiratory viruses are commonly present in pneumonia, and on the systematic performance of viral microbiology studies, particularly nucleic acid amplifications tests. The treatment of influenza pneumonia is currently with a neuraminidase inhibitor. The treatment options for pneumonia caused by other viruses in immunocompetent patients with pneumonia are limited, and the data are largely anecdotal. In immunosuppressed patients with infection by respiratory syncytial virus or a virus of the Herpesviridae family, there are antiviral treatments available. There is ongoing research involved with the development and testing of new treatment strategies both for influenza and noninfluenza viruses.","If travel to developing countries is planned, assuring immunity is imperative, and accelerated schedules should be considered. Depending on the travel destination and itinerary, routine vaccinations may need to be accelerated to maximize protection, particularly against polio, diphtheria/tetanus/pertussis, and measles (for example, measles vaccination may be recommended for children younger than 12 months of age). 37 Guidelines for standard and accelerated schedules for routine childhood immunizations and special precautions and recommendations for immunocompromised children are available in the American Academy of Pediatrics, \"Red Book: 2003 Report of the Committee on Infectious Diseases,\" and on web sites of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). 37 Common Travel-Related Vaccines for Children The most recent requirements and recommendations for travel-related vaccinations by specific geographic destinations can be obtained from CDC, \"Health Information for International Travelers\" (the \"Yellow Book\"), and from CDC Travelers' Health Internet and other travel-related web sites 32 (see also Table 1 , International Travel Health Information Resources for web sites). The United States does not require arriving travelers to have any vaccinations for entry or return into the United States. Some other countries may require proof of vaccination against yellow fever for entry, especially if the traveler is arriving from a country where yellow fever is endemic. Yellow fever vaccine is available only from certified yellow fever vaccination centers; providers can refer to the following CDC yellow fever vaccine registry to locate certified centers in their areas: http://www2.ncid.cdc.gov/travel/yellowfever. Saudi Arabia requires meningococcal vaccine for travelers to the Hajj in Mecca. Some countries have required previous vaccination for cholera, but currently no countries require it, and the vaccine is not available in the United States. Table 2 provides general guidelines and indications for use of selected common travel-related vaccines, based on U.S. recommendations; World Health Organization (WHO) recommendations may differ. 32, 38 Hepatitis A is endemic in most of the world, and travelers are at risk in any area where sanitation is poor. Vaccination is recommended for pediatric travelers aged 2 years or older who will be visiting countries with intermediate to high endemicity (areas other than the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Western Europe, and Scandinavia). Studies have demonstrated that protective antibody titers 2 weeks after the patient has received the first dose of Hepatitis A vaccine range from 69 percent to 98 percent; after 4 weeks, protective antibody titers were present in 95 percent to 100 percent of vaccinees. Intramuscular immunoglobulin is recommended for immunoprophylaxis against hepatitis A in children younger than 2 years of age. In addition, for children 2 years of age or older who are departing less than 4 weeks after receiving a vaccination, immunoglobulin and vaccine can be given concurrently at different sites to ensure optimal protection.","Much less is known about the later events of influenza virus replication. The virion proteins are synthesized and transported to sites of virus budding. The glycoproteins NA and HA are inserted in the plasma membrane, as detailed above, whilst presumably because of trans-membrane crossing of 'ends' of these glycoproteins, matrix protein aligns itself on the internal side of the plasma membrane. It is assumed that there are specific sites of interaction between N P (containing the RNA and P protein complex) and M, which results in spontaneous formation of complete particles which then bud from the cell surface ( Fig. 7 .6). Obviously, many questions remain to be answered including the mechanism (if any) for assuring the correct amount of RNA per virion, the triggering process for budding and details of budding itself. It is considered that enzymatic activity of NA ensures release of virions (since inhibition of NA activity results in aggregates of virus at the cell surface) and absence of self aggregation via NA-HA bonding.","The South Korean experience with COVID-19 provides evidence that epidemics can be suppressed with less extreme measures than those taken by China [18] . It demonstrates the necessity of prompt identification and isolation of cases in preventing further spread [3, 4, 5] . Our analysis reveals potential roles of social distancing in mitigating the COVID-19 epidemic in South Korea. Even though social distancing alone may not be able to fully prevent the spread of the disease, its ability to flatten the epidemic curve (cf. Fig. 2B ,D) reduces burden for healthcare system and provides time to plan for the future [19] .","Generally, a donor must weigh at least 110 pounds to undergo routine donation. Standards allows donation of 10.5 mL of whole blood for every kilogram of donor weight, but most centers purchase blood bags with a premeasured amount of anticoagulant/preservative. These have a specified minimum and maximum amount of blood that can be collected for the anticoagulant and preservatives to function according to manufacturer's specifications. For this reason, the volume of whole blood donated is fairly constant: approximately 1 pint. Assuring that the donor is of the minimum weight is important because a smaller donor, with a smaller blood volume, will suffer greater relative stress to the circulatory system. This will increase the likelihood of an adverse reaction, possibly loss of consciousness or seizures. Underweight donors are particularly likely among younger individuals, who also have a higher incidence of adverse donation reactions than older individuals. 75, 76 Although the weight is generally noted from the history, it is wise to actually weigh those donors who appear to be underweight. There is no maximum weight for blood donation, but the donor's weight should not exceed the maximum capacity of the center's collection equipment.","Although the effects of self-imposed measures on mitigating and delaying the epidemic are similar (see Figure 4 269 and Figure 5) , not all explored efficacy values may be achieved for each measure. For instance, handwashing with 270 soap or using alcohol-based sanitizers may remove the virus completely leading to 100% efficacy. 19 For surgical 271 masks, their filtration efficiency has a wide range (0%-84%) and thus their actual efficacy is difficult to quantify. 21","However, in addition to the apparent threats the COVID-19 poses, both to single individuals and health systems, this epidemic hides subtle menaces, like the distraction effect. It is mandatory, especially in a finite resource system to balance the potential benefit of containment measures, such as postponing scheduled procedures, with negative health and social costs. Diverting the attention exclusively to the COVID-19 situation and overshadowing the everyday clinical practice may have substantial negative implications, especially for cancer patients. Reallocating an excessive amount of healthcare personnel, both nurses and doctors, to the COVID-19 triage and management may stretch an already fragile system and potentially leave uncovered some vital activities, such as treatment administration, surgeries and inpatient assistance. It is well established that delayed oncologic surgery may lead to disease progressions and result in tumors no longer resectable, leading to worse survival outcomes. The same goes for neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy regimens administered with suboptimal timing. It should be emphasized that we are talking about patients potentially cured by oncologic treatments. Therefore, any delay of these fundamental procedures, either intentional or due to shortage of personnel, should be avoided. The same risk is present for the people who have scheduled screening activities (e.g. screening mammography for the early diagnosis of breast cancer). People should be advised to maintain their scheduled appointments, if the procedure is feasible safely, or at least to promptly reschedule their appointment when the epidemic it is expected to slow its pace. For patients with advanced disease, as oncologists we know the enormous negative impact from disease progression in terms of both survival time and quality of life. The inability to deliver palliative care to patients unable to move from their homes and the management of treatment side effects are other significant concerns from a forced quarantine [5] . Patients with advanced disease, and no suggestive symptoms of COVID-19, should keep receiving planned chemotherapy or radiotherapy treatment, without unnecessary delays. Moreover, although postponing follow-up and cancer prevention appointments is a strategy to be considered, an excessive accumulation of visits or examinations risks burdening the national public health system over the next few months.","Great uncertainty remains regarding the epidemic peaks that might occur in various places where the virus has arrived due to factors such as environmental and social conditions and immunity levels of the population. These peaks are clearly related not only to the size of local populations but also to the disease reproduction number, which tells the mean number of secondary cases that are expected from an initial case in a susceptible population 2 . For public health stakeholders and their local surveillance teams to prepare mitigating strategies, an assessment of basic reproduction numbers can be quite helpful. Reproduction number estimates of COVID-19 have varied in different localities within ranges from 1.4 to 3.9  3  -  5 , with epidemic doubling time estimated at 6.4 days by Wu et al. 3  and 7.4 days by Li et al. 4  Clearly, peaks will also depend on eventual awareness of the local populations, prevention measures on surveillance and interventions taking place.","On December 31, 2019, a cluster of cases of \"pneumonia of unknown origin\" in people associated with the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market has been reported in Wuhan, China. Only a few days later, Chinese health authorities confirmed that this cluster was associated with a Novel Coronavirus 1 of them had comorbidities. Importantly, the patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) had a higher number of comorbidities(72.2%) than those not admitted to the ICU(37.3%). This suggests that complications may be a risk factor for adverse outcomes 4 . Assessing the prevalence of these chronic diseases is the basis for mitigating complications in patients with COVID-19 infections. However, the effort was hampered by the limited number of cases.","Behavior (Guitton, 2013) pinpointed the importance of virtual spaces to help understand human behavior in existential risk situations. What was then a mainly theoretical stance is now a reality. While information is central in dealing with the pandemic, it can also generate high levels of anxiety among the population. Fake news are more actual than even, and mitigating their propagation is potentially as important to preserve social peace as fighting the virus itself. With social isolation getting more and more drastic, social media and the Internet can allow us to maintain the social bounds necessary for people to stay united. Distance teaching can compensate the closing down of schools and universities. Telework can reduce some of the impacts of the crisis on economy. While technology (notably with the democratization of travelling) might have been one of the factors that made COVID-19 reach a pandemic status, technology -and particularly online technologies -will also be a key element for us to survive this crisis. Therefore, for all these reasons, cyberpsychology research should not stop. As researchers specializing in how technology impacts human behavior, it is our duty to stay active, and to work to help document all these aspects. It is our duty to help propose and find solutions to the problems elicited by this sanitary crisis.","Given that some people are now changing travel plans, organizers are cancelling conferences and other large public events, and hand sanitizer and other health \"safety\" and \"survival\" products are flying off the shelves, it is apparent that concern for personal safety is mounting as the number of COVID-19 cases continues to rise around the world. Health anxiety is one of the several psychological factors that will influence the way any given person responds to a viral outbreak (Taylor, 2019) , including COVID-19. As per our recent recommendations (Asmundson &amp; Taylor, 2020) , more research is needed to understand how individual difference factors, including health anxiety, specifically impact behaviour in response to COVID-19. This will take some time. In the meantime, basic knowledge of how high and low levels of health anxiety will impact behaviour as it relates to strategies for containing and mitigating viral spread is important for all decision-makers, health authorities, and health care professional and needs to be communicated to the public in an effort to curb maladaptive or irresponsible decisions that may negatively impact these efforts.","Otherwise, if ascertainment is assumed higher or not taken into account, very large reductions in transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 are needed to account for the observed data, with about 80% of infections prevented immediately after the lockdown and 90% after February 10. It should be emphasized that in no way do our results diminish the value of non-pharmaceutical public health interventions in mitigating the outbreak, nor do they underestimate the immense efforts of the Chinese people. Their bold, large-scale action undoubtedly alleviated an already very difficult situation, and likely succeeded in \"flattening the curve\" of the pandemic to the maximum possible extent.","COVID-19 presents a unique challenge to public health. Effective mitigation of the disease will require nontrivial efforts from a significant fraction of the world population, including social distancing and avoiding unnecessary interactions with others. No matter how stringently these measures are recommended, a fraction of people may not believe that they can or should act in ways that will limit the threat. The HBM is a model that has been used to study behaviors related to preventing or mitigating disease. It conceptualizes beliefs about disease as being comprised of the perception of the threat as severe and relevant, the perception of benefits of and barriers to acting, and the perception of one's intrinsic ability to act. As trusted, community-facing healthcare professionals, pharmacists are uniquely suited to bring about change in patient behaviors.Community pharmacists using HBM to reinforce COVID-19 mitigation behaviors should appropriately emphasize the severity and susceptibility of the threat, emphasize barriers to acting, help patients identify ways to overcome barriers to acting, and reinforce self-efficacy beliefs.","COVID-19 is a new -equal opportunity\u2016 virus. It is more infectious than H1N1 influenza responsible for the pandemic a mere decade ago. Rates of infection from COVID-19 are high as transmission can occur before the infector manifests symptoms, it is easily transmitted by droplet, and the entire world's population lacked immunity at its onset . Global public health initiatives are focused on preventing, containing, and mitigating the spread and severity of the disease.","In terms of the safety of patients, the department has taken a number of early actions to limit the 56 spread of coronavirus to and from patients while still allowing treatments to continue. A site visit to our 57 clinics by our institution's infection control team was highly valuable, and this experience directly led to 58 specific interventions that bolstered the continued treatment of patients while mitigating transmission risk. 59","In the past, investigators were linked to the resolution of specific losses. That's still true, but assignments faced by contemporary investigators are broader. Investigators today are much more likely to conduct evaluations to make sure that corporate policies are maintained, such as by assuring that licensing fees and payments are properly documented. Investigators are frequently integral in due diligence fact-finding (i.e., the vigilant care needed in a given situation) prior to acquiring an asset or related to litigation involving the organization. This category of contracted service continues to grow in importance for proprietary security programs. 4. Armored car services. ever since Washington perry Brink started his transport business with a horse and a wagon in the nineteenth century, customers have turned to outside organizations to physically move assets. In addition to transporting cash, these services may provide activities such as the servicing of automated teller machines (ATMs) and the transporting of high-value noncash assets such as jewelry and computer tapes and documents. They also handle aspects of cash management for financial organizations removing such services from traditional bank services. 5. Consultant and other services. When particular problems emerge, security operations managers often turn to consultants with special expertise in particular activities. Most major industries and most types of specific security concerns -for example, data protection and financial investigations -can retain the services of such persons or their organizations for a defined period of time to achieve the desired goals. Due to the shrinking of central staff management in the past 25 years, managerial resources were reduced and the use of outside consultants replaced in-house management capabilities on an as-needed basis. Meanwhile, other services are equally significant to organizations. For example, in the event of a loss of computer processing capability, an organization may turn to facilities that have compatible hardware that may be commandeered for immediate use. 6. Electronic security equipment and systems. To provide more control at less cost, managers turn to electronic security equipment, which can augment, supplement, and verify the actions of security personnel. Though smaller than personnel-intensive services, capital outlay for such equipment is growing steadily. The ways these funds are allocated are given as follows: a. Intrusion detection equipment. These devices and systems indicate the unauthorized passage of individuals into a protected area. b. Vehicle security systems. These products deter and detect the theft or removal of cars, trucks, vans, and other mobile conveyances. c. Computer security equipment. Because of the importance of data protection, systems to protect information assets are growing at a substantial rate and play an important role in loss deterrence for data systems. d. CC/IPTV equipment. Security operations increasingly use CC/IPTV systems to monitor, analyze, and record activities. (This is also called video surveillance technology.) e. Fire detection equipment. Facilities are required to use fire detection systems by codes, standards, insurance requirements, or common sense. f. Electronic article surveillance (EAS) systems. These systems are primarily used to control the losses of retail merchandise. However, eAS systems also may be applied to broader applications of assets control. g. Access control equipment. Systems to efficiently allow or deny entrance make an important contribution to operating a secure facility. This category is closely related technically to intrusion detection equipment. h. Secure telephone equipment. This equipment protects telephone and data transmissions from unauthorized interception. i. X-ray inspection equipment. X-ray impressions may identify the presence of weapons or contraband material hidden in packages or on persons. j. Metal detection equipment. These systems identify metal content hidden within packages or on persons. Wide applications are found at airport preboard screening and the checking of people and hand parcels entering at-risk locations. k. Biological, nuclear, and chemical detection. Still another way of identifying contraband is the use of technology to identify the chemical signatures of such materials. These may result in an alarm being sounded or in a security officer setting aside a suspicious object for further evaluation. 7. Mechanical security hardware. In addition to personnel and electronic devices, systems, and software, security operations often require the purchase and use of particular products and materials. Hence, any object or material that is not electronic is categorized as mechanical security hardware. This category also is substantial, and projected to grow along with construction needs. While electronic products and systems are in the spotlight, mechanical locks continue to have sufficient applications to assure their continuance. This category includes safes, vaults, glazing, and other products specifically marketed for their protective features. A door that is required to be intrusion-resistant would be included in this category; a normal door would not be. Locking devices including door locks, padlocks, deadbolts, latches, as well as security storage equipment such as safes and vaults and fire extinguishers, and related products are also included in this category.","Ertan was China\u2019s first dam built with international bids, and accounts for its largest World Bank loan (nearly $1 billion). Ertan is also China\u2019s first attempt to reach an \u201cinternational standard\u201d for managing resettlement of the 46,000 people displaced by its construction, and for mitigating adverse ecological impacts. Two panels of experts\u2014one to manage environmental issues and one to manage resettlement issues\u2014met frequently during the years of dam construction (1991\u20131999). Anthropologists, engineers, environmental biologists, geographers, resettlement managers, and a responsive dam construction authority worked to minimize disruption to human lives and to the area\u2019s fauna and flora. However, the sole international health specialist, who served on both panels, was permitted to focus on only one problem\u2014schistosome infection.","It is apparent from results generated by our simulation model that both the timing and strength of social distancing measures have a substantial effect in reducing the number of infected individuals in a pandemic situation. In reality, it is unlikely that the initial arrival of infectious cases into a community would be identified in a matter of a few days. This suggests that delays may be expected if waiting for diagnosis to occur before activation of mitigating measures. The modelling results suggest that even with a significant delay in invoking mitigation strategies, 10 weeks in the case of data presented in Figure 1 , this delay and consequential growth in case numbers may be countered by the scale of interventions adopted, by combining multiple robust social distancing measures.","Methods: The team used Maternal Health booklet for reference to formulate Port-A-Cath Care booklet which contained the information of self-assessment, postoperative wound care, infusion notes, principle of care after discharge to home and infusion record after discussions and allowed patients to understand the use and management of port-a-cath. Results: Patients' condition at home and present condition at admission would be understood through self-assessment of brochure after their admission to hospital; therefore, nurses could provide patients with timely access to relevant information and nursing intervention. Since the implementation of the study at a regional hospital in February, 2017, we found that completion rate of port-a-cath care guidance reached 100%; in addition, patient satisfaction scores increased from 3.31 to 4.1, with a significant improvement in suitability of nursing procedure and timeliness of nursing care. Conclusion: Although we worry that giving more information regarding port-a-cath to the patients and family members will increase probability of disputes occurrence between patients and hospital staff if the staff members don't follow the standard of care, it is necessary to incorporate patients and family numbers into the gatekeeper mode to have a better understanding of clinical quality and thereby enhance education training of practice staff to improve patient safety. Background: Effective control of tuberculosis (TB) requires a close partnership between private and public healthcare providers. An integrated web-based information system is vital and crucial for engaging all relevant healthcare providers in prevention, diagnosis and treatment of TB. Methods: A \"MONITOR\" information system was established in 2016 by Taiwan Centers for Disease Control (TCDC) with single entryway and enhanced capacity and flexibility. Main purpose of the system is to promote more rapid response and provide decision support. Information such as TB epidemiology, case management, treatment, DOTS rate, contact tracing coverage, TB clusters, TB statistics and laboratory data are included in the system. Information without personal data can be viewed online with access permission. Daily laboratory data including AFB-smear, culture, identification, drug susceptibility testing and the interferon-gamma release assay (IGRA) are automatically entered from different interface of diverse information systems in clinical settings and public health sectors. The system provides timely warnings of drug-resistant cases, IGRA-positive cases and high-risk populations to management staff according to their responsibilities. In addition, daily scheduled analyses of laboratory quality indicators, turnaround time and visualized profiles are updated automatically.","The majority of cases were reported in mainland China, followed by Italy, Iran, Spain and South Korea. 3 The common symptoms of COVID-19 include fever, cough, and shortness of breath. In severe cases, pneumonia may occur and ultimately lead to organ failure and even death. 4 Currently, there are no available vaccines or specific medicines for the treatment of COVID- 19 . In light of the outbreak, various treatment modalities have been considered, including traditional medicine, which has been widely used during the past epidemic outbreaks, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and H1N1 influenza. 5 To date, 2 countries, China and South Korea, have issued traditional medicine treatment guidelines on the prevention and treatment of COVID-19. Up to March 2020, there have been 7 versions of diagnosis and treatment guidelines issued by the National Health Commission of China 6 and 2 versions of guidelines issued in South Korea. 7 A recent systematic review suggested that \"Based on historical records and evidence of SARS and H1NI influenza prevention, Chinese herbal formula could be an alternative approach for the prevention of COVID-19 in high-risk populations\" 5 and it focused on prevention method but not treatment methods. Therefore, we aimed to systematically analyze ","Although this is not an exhaustive list of chemical additives capable of mitigating Salmonella or other biological hazards in animal feeds, it does give manufacturers an additional option to ensure finished product safety."],"title":["Cancer patients in SARS-CoV-2 infection: a nationwide analysis in China","A systems approach to preventing and

Prediction of the effectiveness of non-case-based interventions for mitigating, delaying or preventing the epidemic is urgent, especially for countries affected by the increased seasonal influenza activity. Methods: We developed a transmission model to evaluate the impact of self-imposed prevention measures (handwashing, mask-wearing, and social distancing) due to COVID-19 awareness and of short-term government-imposed social distancing on the peak number of diagnoses, attack rate and time until the peak number of diagnoses. Findings: For fast awareness spread in the population, self-imposed measures can significantly reduce the attack rate, diminish and postpone the peak number of diagnoses. A large epidemic can be prevented if the efficacy of these measures exceeds 50%. For slow awareness spread, self-imposed measures reduce the peak number of d...","COVID-19 is an acute respiratory disease that has been classified as a pandemic by the World Health Organization. Information regarding this particular disease is limited, however, it is known to have high mortality rates, particularly among individuals with preexisting medical conditions. Creating models to identify individuals who are at the greatest risk for severe complications due to COVID-19 will be useful to help for outreach campaigns in mitigating the diseases worst effects. While information specific to COVID-19 is limited, a model using complications due to other upper respiratory infections can be used as a proxy to help identify those individuals who are at the greatest risk. We present the results for three models predicting such complications, with each model having varying levels of predictive effectiveness at the expense of ease of implementation.","Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is infecting people throughout the world. It is probable that coronavirus disease (COVID-19) will be transmitted to people experiencing homelessness, which will become a major problem in particular in North America where there are sizable populations of people experiencing homelessness in nearly every metropolitan city in the USA and Canada. In the USA, more than 500 000 people were reported to be experiencing homelessness on any given night over the past decade (2007\u201319).1 The State of Homelessness in Canada 2016 report2 estimated 35 000 people are experiencing homelessness on any given night in Canada. People experiencing homelessness live in environments that are conducive to a disease epidemic. Many people experiencing homelessness live in congregate living settings\u2014be it formal (ie, shelters or halfway houses) or informal (ie, encampments or abandoned buildings)\u2014and might not have regular access to basic hygiene supplies...","","","In an era of global health threats caused by epidemics of infectious diseases and rising multidrug resistance, microbiology laboratories provide essential scientific evidence for risk assessment, prevention, and control. Microbiology has been at the core of European infectious disease surveillance networks for decades. Since 2010, these networks have been coordinated by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC). Activities delivered in these networks include harmonization of laboratory diagnostic, antimicrobial susceptibility and molecular typing methods, multicentre method validation, technical capacity mapping, training of laboratory staff, and continuing quality assessment of laboratory testing. Cooperation among the European laboratory networks in the past 7 years has proved successful in strengthening epidemic preparedness by enabling adaptive capabilities for rapid detection of emerging pathogens across Europe. In partnership with food safety authorities, inte...","","Abstract This chapter describes the source, access, extent, and quality of information available among pharmacists and pharmacy personnel in developing countries to practice effectively. Our world today witnesses huge advancements in the information-related technologies and in the amount of medicines information available and accessible by all healthcare providers as well as the public. Remaining in the front line as medicines information providers represents great challenge for pharmacists. Scientific biomedical journals represent the core source of our knowledge about medicines. Textbooks and books represent the cornerstone for a user who has no or little basic information about certain topic. Today, the Internet is the most commonly used source of information for a variety of uses and topics. The literature available in our hand indicates the presence of medicines information centers in a variety of countries from the developing world. Manufacturers of medicines usually represent an...","Objective The purpose of this study was to summarize 3 recent high-profile infectious disease threats that have affected the United States: severe acute respiratory syndrome, West Nile virus, and anthrax. Study design A systematic review was conducted with the use of Medline searches, searches of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website, and review by experts at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Results The 3 emerging infectious diseases pose very different threats: Severe acute respiratory syndrome is a newly identified pathogen that caused an international pandemic; the West Nile virus investigation involved an old pathogen that was identified in a new location; and the anthrax attacks involved the intentional introduction of a pathogen. Conclusion All 3 outbreaks highlight the importance of obstetrician-gynecologists keeping current with new information as it emerges. In this global environment, it is likely that novel disease threats will continue to eme...","Information about the open-access article 'Wuhan novel coronavirus 2019nCoV' in DOAJ. DOAJ is an online directory that indexes and provides access to quality open access, peer-reviewed journals.","The current state of much of the Wuhan pneumonia virus (COVID-19) research shows a regrettable lack of data sharing and considerable analytical obfuscation. This impedes global research cooperation, which is essential for tackling public health emergencies, and requires unimpeded access to data, analysis tools, and computational infrastructure. Here we show that community efforts in developing open analytical software tools over the past ten years, combined with national investments into scientific computational infrastructure, can overcome these deficiencies and provide an accessible platform for tackling global health emergencies in an open and transparent manner. Specifically, we use all COVID-19 genomic data available in the public domain so far to (1) underscore the importance of access to raw data and to (2) demonstrate that existing community efforts in curation and deployment of biomedical software can reliably support rapid, reproducible research during global health crises. A...","Information about the open-access article 'Statistics-Based Predictions of Coronavirus Epidemic Spreading in Mainland China' in DOAJ. DOAJ is an online directory that indexes and provides access to quality open access, peer-reviewed journals.","On January 20, 2020, the first COVID-19 case was confirmed in South Korea. After a rapid outbreak, the number of incident cases has been consistently decreasing since early March; this decrease has been widely attributed to its intensive testing. We report here on the likely role of social distancing in reducing transmission in South Korea. Our analysis suggests that transmission may still be persisting in some regions.","Disease outbreaks of international public health importance continue to occur regularly; detecting and tracking significant new public health threats in countries that cannot or might not report such events to the global health community is a challenge. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s (CDC) Global Disease Detection (GDD) Operations Center, established in early 2007, monitors infectious and non-infectious public health events to identify new or unexplained global public health threats and better position CDC to respond, if public health assistance is requested or required. At any one time, the GDD Operations Center actively monitors approximately 30\u201340 such public health threats; here we provide our perspective on five of the top global infectious disease threats that we were watching in 2012: (1) avian influenza A (H5N1), (2) cholera, (3) wild poliovirus, (4) enterovirus-71, and (5) extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis.","BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has been identified as the cause of an outbreak of respiratory illness in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China beginning in December 2019. As of 31 January 2020, this epidemic had spread to 19 countries with 11 791 confirmed cases, including 213 deaths. The World Health Organization has declared it a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. METHODS: A scoping review was conducted following the methodological framework suggested by Arksey and O\u2019Malley. In this scoping review, 65 research articles published before 31 January 2020 were analyzed and discussed to better understand the epidemiology, causes, clinical diagnosis, prevention and control of this virus. The research domains, dates of publication, journal language, authors\u2019 affiliations, and methodological characteristics were included in the analysis. All the findings and statements in this review regarding the outbreak are based on published information as listed in the references. ...","Abstract Health planning and policy seek to create a group of mutually interacting bodies to produce goods and services to meet the health needs of a population. Recent developments in the health status of the population are characterized by continuous improvement in life expectancy, chronic diseases which absorb 90% of total health care expenditure, differences in the causes of mortality (more than 70% mortality from cancer, heart and brain, and external causes). The new trends in health indicators define the current health policies and lead to the necessity of adapting the health system so as to meet the changing health needs of the population. Especially in the context of the changes in the epidemiological spectrum and the variability in the indices of morbidity and mortality, the focus is not only to further prolong life expectancy but also to improve life expectancy without chronic diseases and without disabilities and to reduce the avoidable mortality, the potential years of life...","The need to protect public health during the current COVID-19 pandemic has necessitated conference cancellations on an unprecedented scale. As the scientific community adapts to new working conditions, it is important to recognize that some of our actions may disproportionately affect early-career researchers and scientists from countries with limited research funding. We encourage all conference organizers, funders and institutions who are able to do so to consider how they can mitigate the unintended consequences of conference and travel cancellations and we provide seven recommendations for how this could be achieved. The proposed solutions may also offer long-term benefits for those who normally cannot attend conferences, and thus lead to a more equitable future for generations of researchers.","The use of viral agents for biological warfare has a long history, which predates their recognition and isolation by culture. Advances in viral culture and virus stabilization made during the second half of the twentieth century raised the level of concern by facilitating the large-scale production of viral agents for aerosol dissemination. Furthermore, the nucleic acid of many viruses, including some that are currently not threats, can be manipulated in the laboratory. Thus, the potential for genetic engineering and misuse of biotechnology is a serious threat. An effective defense against viral agents requires a comprehensive approach including restricting access to viral stocks, detecting deliberately induced disease outbreaks, rapid laboratory identification of viral agents in clinical specimens, preventing person-to-person transmission, using reliable decontamination procedures, and developing effective vaccines and antiviral drugs.","Summary The COVID-19 pandemics is posing unprecedented challenges and threats to patients and healthcare systems worldwide. Acute respiratory complications that require intensive care unit (ICU) management are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in COVID-19 patients. Patients with worst outcomes and higher mortality are reported to include immunocompromised subjects, namely older adults and polymorbid individuals and malnourished people in general. ICU stay, polymorbidity and older age are all commonly associated with high risk for malnutrition, representing per se a relevant risk factor for higher morbidity and mortality in chronic and acute disease. Also importantly, prolonged ICU stays are reported to be required for COVID-19 patients stabilization, and longer ICU stay may per se directly worsen or cause malnutrition, with severe loss of skeletal muscle mass and function which may lead to disability, poor quality of life and additional morbidity. Prevention, diagnosis and treat...","Abstract The aim is to diagnose COVID-19 earlier and to improve its treatment by applying medical technology, the \u201cCOVID-19 Intelligent Diagnosis and Treatment Assistant Program (nCapp)\u201d based on the Internet of Things. Terminal eight functions can be implemented in real-time online communication with the \u201ccloud\u201d through the page selection key. According to existing data, questionnaires, and check results, the diagnosis is automatically generated as confirmed, suspected, or suspicious of 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection. It classifies patients into mild, moderate, severe or critical pneumonia. nCapp can also establish an online COVID-19 real-time update database, and it updates the model of diagnosis in real time based on the latest real-world case data to improve diagnostic accuracy. Additionally, nCapp can guide treatment. Front-line physicians, experts, and managers are linked to perform consultation and prevention. nCapp also contributes to the long-term follow-up of pa...","Summary The Zika epidemic in the Americas has challenged surveillance and control. As the epidemic appears to be waning, it is unclear whether transmission is still ongoing, which is exacerbated by discrepancies in reporting. To uncover locations with lingering outbreaks, we investigated travel-associated Zika cases to identify transmission not captured by reporting. We uncovered an unreported outbreak in Cuba during 2017, a year after peak transmission in neighboring islands. By sequencing Zika virus, we show that the establishment of the virus was delayed by a year and that the ensuing outbreak was sparked by long-lived lineages of Zika virus from other Caribbean islands. Our data suggest that, although mosquito control in Cuba may initially have been effective at mitigating Zika virus transmission, such measures need to be maintained to be effective. Our study highlights how Zika virus may still be \u201csilently\u201d spreading and provides a framework for understanding outbreak dynamics. Vi...","","Surveillance is essential for communicable disease prevention and control. Traditional notification of demographic and clinical information, about individuals with selected (notifiable) infectious diseases, allows appropriate public health action and is protected by public health and privacy legislation, but is slow and insensitive. Big data\u2013based electronic surveillance, by commercial bodies and government agencies (for profit or population control), which draws on a plethora of internet- and mobile device\u2013based sources, has been widely accepted, if not universally welcomed. Similar anonymous digital sources also contain syndromic information, which can be analysed, using customised algorithms, to rapidly predict infectious disease outbreaks, but the data are nonspecific and predictions sometimes misleading. However, public health authorities could use these online sources, in combination with de-identified personal health data, to provide more accurate and earlier warning of infectio...","Practical relevance Weakness is recognized somewhat infrequently in cats, but is an important manifestation of neurological disease. The clinician must perform a complete neurological examination to determine the neuroanatomic basis for the weakness. As for all species, the neuroanatomic diagnosis allows the clinician to generate an appropriate differential diagnosis, to design a diagnostic plan, to prognosticate, and ultimately to develop a treatment plan. Clinical challenges The cause(s) of neurological weakness in the cat may be difficult to determine without access to advanced imaging modalities, cerebrospinal fluid analysis or electrodiagnostics. However, an accurate neuroanatomic diagnosis allows the clinician to pursue preliminary anomalous (vertebral anomalies), metabolic (eg, diabetes mellitus, electrolyte abnormalities) and neoplastic differentials via blood work, vertebral column and thoracic radiography, and abdominal ultrasound. Subsequently, referral to a specialty veteri...","The novel coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19)epidemic has brought serious social psychological impact to the Chinese people, especially those quarantined and thus with limited access to face-to-face communication and traditional social psychological interventions. To better deal with the urgent psychological problems of people involved in the COVID-19 epidemic, we developed a new psychological crisis intervention model by utilizing internet technology. This new model, one of West China Hospital, integrates physicians, psychiatrists, psychologists and social workers into Internet platforms to carry out psychological intervention to patients, their families and medical staff. We hope this model will make a sound basis for developing a more comprehensive psychological crisis intervention response system that is applicable for urgent social and psychological problems.","Abstract Objective To provide a general description of the roles and contributions of three pharmacists from the Regulatory Affairs program (RA) at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) who are involved in emergency preparedness and response activities, including the 2009 pandemic influenza A (H1N1) public health emergency. Setting Atlanta, GA. Practice description RA consists of a staff of nine members, three of whom are pharmacists. The mission of RA is to support CDC's preparedness and emergency response activities and to ensure regulatory compliance for critical medical countermeasures against potential threats from natural, chemical, biological, radiological, or nuclear events. Conclusion RA was well involved in the response to the H1N1 outbreak through numerous activities, such as submitting multiple Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) requests to the Food and Drug Administration, including those for medical countermeasures to be deployed from the Strategic National ...","Introduction The COVID 19 outbreak is posing an unprecedented challenge to healthcare workers. This study analyzes the geo temporal effects on disease severity for the 1,688 Chinese healthcare workers infected with COVID 19. Method Using the descriptive results recently reported by the Chinese CDC, we compare the percentage of infected healthcare workers in severe conditions over time and across three areas in China, and the fatality rate of infected healthcare workers with all the infected individuals in China aged 22 to 59 years. Results Among the infected Chinese healthcare workers whose symptoms onset appeared during the same ten day period, the percentage of those in severe conditions decreased statistical significantly from 19.7% (Jan 11 to 20) to 14.4% (Jan 21 to 31) to 8.7% (Feb 1 to 11). Across the country, there was also a significant difference in the disease severity among patients symptoms onset during the same period, with Wuhan being the most severe (17%), followed by Hu...","","To provide convenient access to epidemiological data on the coronavirus outbreak, we developed an R package, nCov2019 (https://github.com/GuangchuangYu/nCov2019). Besides detailed real-time statistics, it offers access to three data sources with detailed daily statistics from December 1, 2019, for 43 countries and more than 500 Chinese cities. We also developed a web app (http://www.bcloud.org/e/) with interactive plots and simple time-series forecasts. These analytics tools could be useful in informing the public and studying how this and similar viruses spread in populous countries.","This study examines publicly available online search data in China to investigate the spread of public awareness of the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak. We found that cities that suffered from SARS and have greater migration ties to the epicentre, Wuhan, had earlier, stronger and more durable public awareness of the outbreak. Our data indicate that forty-eight such cities developed awareness up to 19 days earlier than 255 comparable cities, giving them an opportunity to better prepare. This study suggests that it is important to consider memory of prior catastrophic events as they will influence the public response to emerging threats.","Overview Avian influenza is a disease of birds, caused by a type A influenza virus. The subtype H5N1 avian influenza occurs primarily in birds and infection varies from mild disease with little or no mortality to a highly fatal, rapidly spreading epidemic (highly pathogenic avian influenza). It is extremely rare for cats to be infected and there are only very few confirmed reports of the disease in cats in Europe. Infection Cats can be infected via the respiratory and oral routes (eg, by eating infected birds). The key precondition for infection is that the cat lives in an area where H5N1 virus infection has been confirmed in birds. Additionally, the cat should have had outdoor access to an environment where waterfowl is present, or contact with poultry or uncooked poultry meat, or close contact with an H5N1-infected, sick cat during the first week of infection. Clinical suspicion Clinical signs in cats may include fever, lethargy, dyspnoea, conjunctivitis and rapid death. Neurological...","Summary Emerging infectious diseases arising from livestock and wildlife pose serious threats to global human health, as shown by a series of continuous outbreaks involving highly pathogenic influenza, SARS, Ebola and MERS. The risk of pandemics and bioterrorism threats is ever present and growing, but our ability to combat them is limited by the lack of available vaccines, therapeutics and rapid diagnostics. The use of high bio-containment facilities, such as the CSIRO Australian Animal Health Laboratory, plays a key role studying these dangerous pathogens and facilitates the development of countermeasures. To combat diseases like MERS, we must take a holistic approach that involves the development of early biomarkers of infection, a suite of treatment options (vaccines, anti-viral drugs and antibody therapeutics) and appropriate animal models to test the safety and efficacy of candidate treatments.","","","Abstract At the end of December 2019, a novel coronavirus, 2019-nCoV, caused an outbreak of pneumonia spreading from Wuhan, Hubei province, to the whole country of China, which has posed great threats to public health and attracted enormous attention around the world. To date, there are no clinically approved vaccines or antiviral drugs available for these human coronavirus infections. Intensive research on the novel emerging human infectious coronaviruses is urgently needed to elucidate their route of transmission and pathogenic mechanisms, and to identify potential drug targets, which would promote the development of effective preventive and therapeutic countermeasures. Herein, we describe the epidemic and etiological characteristics of 2019-nCoV, discuss its essential biological features, including tropism and receptor usage, summarize approaches for disease prevention and treatment, and speculate on the transmission route of 2019-nCoV.","","Epidemic diseases are not a new phenomenon, but easy access to transport in the modern world has accelerated their spread. Perhaps some botanical understanding can help slow them down.","Importance: To predict the diagnosed COVID-19 patients and the trend of the epidemic in China. It may give the public some scientific information to ease the fear of the epidemic. Objective: In December 2019, pneumonia infected with the novel coronavirus burst in Wuhan, China. We aimed to use a mathematical model to predict number of diagnosed patients in future to ease anxiety on the emergent situation. Design: According to all diagnosis number from WHO website and combining with the transmission mode of infectious diseases, the mathematical model was fitted to predict future trend of outbreak. Setting: Our model was based on the epidemic situation in China, which could provide referential significance for disease prediction in other countries, and provide clues for prevention and intervention of relevant health authorities. Participants: In this retrospective, all diagnosis number from Jan 21 to Feb 10, 2020 reported from China was included and downloaded from WHO website. Main Outco...","Abstract Since December 2019, coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has spread rapidly from Wuhan, Hubei province, to other regions of China. To reduce and prevent cross-over infections in the interventional diagnosis and treatment of tumor patients. The Interventional Oncology Branch of the China Anti-Cancer Association organized specialists to compile the corresponding expert consensus. The consensus summarizes the critical points for COVID-19 prevention, focusing on the management of outpatients, inpatients, and interventional operating room in this particular time.","Since the middle of December 2019, human-to-human transmission of novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP, also called COVID-19) has occurred among close contacts [1]. After the outbreak on January 21, 2020, it was swiftly included among the Class B infectious diseases stipulated in the Law of the People\u2019s Republic of China on the Prevention and Control of Infectious Diseases, and measures for prevention and control of Class A infectious diseases were adopted. At 21:27 on February 12, 2020, the China News Network updated information to include epidemic data from the National Health Commission and official channels in Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan regions: the highest death rate was in Wuhan City (Table 1). Overload of inpatients at hospitals may play a negative role in the overall therapeutic effect and contribute to the death rateER -","SUMMARY The French public health institute is responsible for promoting and coordinating threats the detection and assessment of health risks, and for suggesting possible responses. Transmissible diseases affecting both human and animal health are the focus of surveillance networks. Early detection of potential infectious threats is based on the screening of \u201c alert signals \u201c identified through routine surveillance networks and other systems. The quality and accuracy of these signals is first verified, before assessing, through a multidisciplinary approach, the risk of introduction and dissemination. This article examines specific cases illustrating the process of detection, risk analysis and response, with respect to infectious threats that are endemic in tropical regions and have the potential to be imported into metropolitan France. For both novel pathogens and exotic diseases \u2014 which, not being endemic in France, are less well known \u2014 the analysis and response process must regularl...","Abstract On the Internet, there is a lot of open access information related to infectious diseases, e.g., official announcement, media news, bulletin boards, blogs, and other social media. If proper data retrieval and screening methods were applied on these Internet-based data, it would be very useful to improve the timeliness of early detection for infectious diseases. In China, we practice early warning using Internet-based data with routine intelligence screening assessment every day, and respond to any unusual event in a timely manner. Through this mechanism, the surveillance and early warning of Internet-based data for infectious disease and public health emergency plays an important supplemental role to the traditional surveillance systems.","Abstract Newly emerging viruses such as the Ebola virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-coronavirus, and the avian influenza virus are serious threats to public health and have become a global concern. The swine flu pandemic which occurred in 2009 reminded us of the Spanish flu that killed over 40 million people. Newly emerging viruses could be either a novel previously undescribed virus or a variant of a previously known virus. Examples of the novel viruses include HIV, the Ebola virus, and SARS viruses. Variants of previously described viruses are also called \u201cremerging viruses.\u201d They are mutants of known viruses but cause new epidemics with considerable virulence. The influenza virus that caused the 2009 swine flu pandemic was a variant of an existing virus.","COVID-19 threatens to overwhelm hospital facilities throughout the United States. We created an interactive, quantitative model that forecasts demand for COVID-19 related hospitalization based on county-level population characteristics, data from the literature on COVID-19, and data from online repositories. Using this information as well as user inputs, the model estimates a time series of demand for intensive care beds and acute care beds as well as the availability of those beds. The online model is designed to be intuitive and interactive so that local leaders with limited technical or epidemiological expertise may make decisions based on a variety of scenarios. This complements high-level models designed for public consumption and technically sophisticated models designed for use by epidemiologists. The model is actively being used by several academic medical centers and policy makers, and we believe that broader access will continue to aid community and hospital leaders in their ...","Background The novel coronavirus COVID19 has been classified by the World Health Organisation as a pandemic due to its worldwide spread. The ability of countries to contain and control transmission is critical in the absence of a vaccine. We evaluated a range of social distancing measures to determine which strategies are most effective in reducing the peak daily infection rate, and consequential pressure on the health care system. Methods Using COVID19 transmission data from the outbreak source in Hubei Province, China, collected prior to activation of containment measures, we adapted an established individual based simulation model of the city of Newcastle, Australia, population 272,409. Simulation of virus transmission in this community model without interventions provided a baseline from which to compare alternative social distancing strategies. The infection history of each individual was determined, as was the time infected. From this model generated data, the rate of growth in c...","The outbreak of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has thus far killed over 3,000 people and infected over 80,000 in China and elsewhere in the world, resulting in catastrophe for humans. Similar to its homologous virus, SARS-CoV, which caused SARS in thousands of people in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 might also be transmitted from the bats and causes similar symptoms through a similar mechanism. However, COVID-19 has lower severity and mortality than SARS but is much more transmissive and affects more elderly individuals than youth and more men than women. In response to the rapidly increasing number of publications on the emerging disease, this article attempts to provide a timely and comprehensive review of the swiftly developing research subject. We will cover the basics about the epidemiology, etiology, virology, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis, and prevention of the disease. Although many questions still requir...","Abstract In December 2019, the outbreak of the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in China spread worldwide, becoming an emergency of major international concern. SARS-CoV-2 infection causes clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus. Human-to-human transmission has been described with incubation times between 2-14 days, facilitating its spread via droplets, contaminated hands or surfaces. Early diagnosis, quarantine, and supportive treatments are essential to cure patients. We therefore reviewed the literature on all available information about the epidemiology, diagnosis, isolation and treatments of COVID-19. Treatments, including antiviral agents, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, corticosteroids, antibodies, convalescent plasma transfusion and vaccines, will be discussed in this article. Additionally, registered trials about treatment were listed to develop approaches for the current urgent demand for therapy.","SUMMARY Domestic animals can be complementary to experimental mice for studying certain aspects of immunology. For example, they can offer surgical access to the physiology of lymphoid organs in vivo, in utero immunisation for studies of immune system ontogeny, and the pathogenesis of infections in their natural target species.","Abstract To accomplish the goals of successful management practice, what\u2019s important has to be determined.
