There is the potential for molecular medicine to improve the workplace although inappropriate use will lead to discrimination. The public health issue of communicable diseases is being addressed through molecular medicine in more effective and early detection and a better understanding of pathogenesis. A threat from emerging and re-emerging infections requires multiple approaches but early and definitive detection will need nucleic acid based approaches. The non-communicable diseases are now a global world problem, particularly obesity. While molecular medicine is still to make a significant impact on this disorder some interesting findings are emerging about the role of genes in obesity. Ultimately, global health issues must include more efficient and environmentally sustainable strategies.

In this paper we look at the impact of a single short-term intervention on an epidemic. We see that if an intervention cannot be sustained long-term, it has the greatest impact if it is imposed once infection levels have become large enough that there is an appreciable number of infections present. For minimising the total number infected it should start close to the peak so that there is no rebound once the intervention is stopped, while to minimise the peak prevalence, it should start earlier, allowing two peaks of comparable size rather than one very large peak. In populations with distinct subgroups, synchronized interventions are less effective than targeting the interventions in each sub-population separately. We do not attem...","The 2009 influenza A (H1N1) pandemic highlighted the importance of quality hospital care of the severely ill, yet there is evidence that the impact of the 2009 pandemic was highest in low\u2010 and middle\u2010income countries with fewer resources. Recent data indicate that death and suffering from seasonal influenza and severe illness in general are increased in resource\u2010limited settings. However, there are limited clinical data and guidelines for the management of influenza and other severe illness in these settings. Life\u2010saving supportive care through syndromic case management is used successfully in high\u2010resource intensive care units and in global programs such as the Integrated Management of Childhood Illness (IMCI). While there are a variety of challenges to the management of the severely ill in resource\u2010limited settings, several new international initiatives have begun to develop syndromic management strategies for these environments, including the World Health Organization's Integrated M...","","We present a timely evaluation of the impact of lockdown on the 2019-nCov epidemic in Hubei province, China. The implementation appears to be effective in reducing about 60% of new infections and deaths, and its effect also appears to be sustainable even after its removal. Delaying its implementation reduces its effectiveness. However, the direct economic cost of such a lockdown remains to be seen and whether the model is replicable in other Chinese regions remains a matter of further investigation.","WHO's Eastern Mediterranean region (EMR) is facing emergencies on a scale that is perhaps unprecedented in its history. There is armed conflict in 12 of the region's 22 countries.1 , 2 The region's 680 million people3 represent 9% of the global population, yet the EMR is home to 43% of those who need humanitarian assistance4 and is the source of 64% of the world's refugees.5 The health effects of these crises are immense. Direct health consequences include trauma-related deaths and disability, gender-based violence, and mental disorders. Disruption of health systems contributes to increased morbidity and mortality from infectious diseases, malnutrition, obstetric complications, and non-communicable diseases (NCDs). Health indicators in the EMR are among the worst in the world.6 State fragility and conflict are among the biggest challenges to attainment of Sustainable Development Goal 3.7 Conflict is a global health security threat because affected countries are less able to prevent, de...","Abstract Management researchers and management practitioners increasingly appear to be talking past each other. A solution lies in understanding that interactive management education has an important role to play in bridging this divide, but for some reason this mode of academic exchange is often forgotten. Our paper broadens the stakeholder value perspective to explore how and why the interests of researchers and practitioners have diverged, before going on to present illustrative cases of programs attempting to bridge such differences. Current conditions suggest that the dissonance between different cycle-times of research and practice is not sustainable with the inevitable outcome of a shrinking commons. Generating new knowledge and propagating it rapidly through education and teaching-practice is an important way of disseminating higher-order research and findings. In a world where academic relevance is under threat, enabling academics to better cross such a divide is critical. Mar...","Background The novel coronavirus COVID19 has been classified by the World Health Organisation as a pandemic due to its worldwide spread. The ability of countries to contain and control transmission is critical in the absence of a vaccine. We evaluated a range of social distancing measures to determine which strategies are most effective in reducing the peak daily infection rate, and consequential pressure on the health care system. Methods Using COVID19 transmission data from the outbreak source in Hubei Province, China, collected prior to activation of containment measures, we adapted an established individual based simulation model of the city of Newcastle, Australia, population 272,409. Simulation of virus transmission in this community model without interventions provided a baseline from which to compare alternative social distancing strategies. The infection history of each individual was determined, as was the time infected. From this model generated data, the rate of growth in c...","BACKGROUND: Strategies are urgently needed to mitigate the risk of zoonotic disease emergence in southern China, where pathogens with zoonotic potential are known to circulate in wild animal populations. However, the risk factors leading to emergence are poorly understood, which presents a challenge in developing appropriate mitigation strategies for local communities. METHODS: Residents in rural communities of Yunnan, Guangxi and Guangdong provinces were recruited and enrolled in this study. Data were collected through ethnographic interviews and field observations, and thematically coded and analysed to identify both risk and protective factors for zoonotic disease emergence at the individual, community and policy levels. RESULTS: Eighty-eight ethnographic interviews and 55 field observations were conducted at nine selected sites. Frequent human\u2013animal interactions and low levels of environmental biosecurity in local communities were identified as risks for zoonotic disease emergence...","BACKGROUND: Rapid triaging, as in the current COVID-19 pandemic, focuses on age and pre-existing medical conditions. In contrast, preoperative assessments use cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) to categorise patients to higher and lower risk independent of diagnostic labels. Since CPET is not feasible in population-based settings, our aims included evaluation of a triage/screening tool for cardiorespiratory risk. METHODS: CPET-derived anaerobic thresholds were evaluated retrospectively in 26 patients with pulmonary arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) who represent a challenging group to risk-categorise. Pulmonary AVM-induced hypoxaemia secondary to intrapulmonary right-to-left shunts, anaemia from underlying hereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasia and metabolic equivalents derived from the 13-point Veterans Specific Activity Questionnaire (VSAQ) were evaluated as part of routine clinical care. Pre-planned analyses evaluated associations and modelling of the anaerobic threshold and p...","The 2019-2020 influenza sentinel surveillance data exhibits unexpected trends. Typical influenza seasons have a small herald wave, followed by a decrease due to school closure during holidays, and then a main post-holiday peak that is significantly larger than the pre-holiday wave. During the 2019-2020 influenza season, influenza-like illness data in the United States appears to have a markedly lower main epidemic peak compared to what would be expected based on the pre-holiday peak. We hypothesize that the 2019-2020 influenza season does have a lower than expected burden and that this deflation is due to a behavioral or ecological interaction with COVID-19. We apply an intervention analysis to assess if this influenza season deviates from expectations, then we compare multiple hypothesized drivers of the decrease in influenza in a spatiotemporal regression model. Lastly, we develop a mechanistic metapopulation model, incorporating transmission reduction that scales with COVID-19 risk ...","Abstract The people of rural and periurban India depend on backyard farming system for poultry meat and eggs. It is used by weaker sections of society, such as marginal farmers as insurance against crop failure, for ready cash and to ensure basic economic returns and the empowerment of women and children. However, backyard farming does not appear to be a promising strategy to achieve the poverty reduction until the production level is increased. The major constraint in increasing the production in backyard birds is microbial infection due to lack of biosecurity knowledge among the farmers. The mitigation of the microbial infection depends on the detection of the infection route and its prevention. The source of microbial infection (Salmonella, Escherichia coli) and their dissemination through the eggs in backyard flocks kept in different agroclimatic zones of West Bengal, a major egg producing state in India, was identified. The pattern of virulence gene specially associated with urina...","Abstract Due to the pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 in China, almost all avoidable activities in China are prohibited since Wuhan announced lockdown on January 23, 2020. With reduced activities, severe air pollution events still occurred in the North China Plain, causing discussions regarding why severe air pollution was not avoided. The Community Multi-scale Air Quality model was applied during January 01 to February 12, 2020 to study PM2.5 changes under emission reduction scenarios. The estimated emission reduction case (Case 3) better reproduced PM2.5. Compared with the case without emission change (Case 1), Case 3 predicted that PM2.5 concentrations decreased by up to 20% with absolute decreases of 5.35, 6.37, 9.23, 10.25, 10.30, 12.14, 12.75, 14.41, 18.00 and 30.79 \u03bcg/m3 in Guangzhou, Shanghai, Beijing, Shijiazhuang, Tianjin, Jinan, Taiyuan, Xi'an, Zhengzhou, Wuhan, respectively. In high-pollution days with PM2.5 greater than 75 \u03bcg/m3, the reductions of PM2.5 in Case 3 were 7...","We developed a computational tool to assess the risk of novel coronavirus outbreaks outside China. We estimate the dependence of the risk of a major outbreak in a country from imported cases on key parameters such as: (i) the evolution of the cumulative number of cases in mainland China outside the closed areas; (ii) the connectivity of the destination country with China, including baseline travel frequencies, the effect of travel restrictions, and the efficacy of entry screening at destination; (iii) the efficacy of control measures in the destination country (expressed by the local reproduction number Rloc). We found that in countries with low connectivity to China but with relatively high Rloc, the most beneficial control measure to reduce the risk of outbreaks is a further reduction in their importation number either by entry screening or travel restrictions. Countries with high connectivity but low Rloc benefit the most from policies that further reduce Rloc. Countries in the midd...","In March 2020, Coronavirus Disease 2019 originating from Wuhan, China, has become pandemic. Based on epidemic data from China we constructed and constrained a simple Susceptible-Infected-Infectious-Excluded (SIIE) model. The model is characterized by only three parameters: average incubation period, contact rate rC, and exclusion rate rE. These two rates control the daily multiplication coefficient \u03b2 describing epidemic growth in its early exponential phase, during which the number of excluded (confirmed) individuals grows as E = E0 exp(\u03b1,t) with \u03b1 = ln\u03b2. The rates can be modified by non-therapeutic interventions: rC can be reduced by quarantine, while rE can be increased by efficient testing, enabling isolation of infectious individuals. In order to contain exponential epidemic growth, quotient rC/rE has to be reduced to 1. Based on the model, we estimate that the quarantine imposed in China on January 23, 2020 resulted in about 50-fold reduction of this quotient, allowing to terminat...","Background: In December 2019, an outbreak of novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) emerged in Wuhan, China and has swiftly spread to other parts of China and a number of oversea countries. Our aim is to evaluate the effectiveness of the evolution of interventions and self-protection measures, estimate the risk of partial lifting control measures and predict the epidemic trend of the virus in mainland China excluding Hubei province based on the published data and a novel mathematical model. Methods: A novel COVID-19 transmission dynamic model incorporating the intervention measures implemented in China is proposed. We parameterize the model by using the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method and estimate the control reproduction number Rc, as well as the effective daily reproduction ratio Re(t), of the disease transmission in mainland China excluding Hubei province. Results: The estimation outcomes indicate that the control reproduction number is 3.36 (95% CI 3.20-3.64) and Re(t) has dro...","The impact of the drastic reduction in travel volume within mainland China in January and February 2020 was quantified with respect to reports of novel coronavirus (COVID-19) infections outside China. Data on confirmed cases diagnosed outside China were analyzed using statistical models to estimate the impact of travel reduction on three epidemiological outcome measures: (i) the number of exported cases, (ii) the probability of a major epidemic, and (iii) the time delay to a major epidemic. From 28 January to 7 February 2020, we estimated that 226 exported cases (95% confidence interval: 86,449) were prevented, corresponding to a 70.4% reduction in incidence compared to the counterfactual scenario. The reduced probability of a major epidemic ranged from 7% to 20% in Japan, which resulted in a median time delay to a major epidemic of two days. Depending on the scenario, the estimated delay may be less than one day. As the delay is small, the decision to control travel volume through res...","The impact of the drastic reduction in travel volume within mainland China in January and February 2020 was quantified with respect to reports of novel coronavirus (COVID-19) infections outside China.

The cause of SARS was identified as a novel coronavirus (CoV). The existence of asymptomatic seroconvertors and the detection of the SARS-CoV RNA in plasma during the course of infection all suggest that SARS could, as least theoretically, be transmitted by transfusion. An estimate of the risk of SARS transmission through blood transfusion will contribute to decisions concerning blood safety monitoring and may be useful in the design of strategies to decrease the risk of transfusion-transmitted infections. Study design and methods Case onset dates from the 2003 Shenzhen SARS epidemic and investigational results from Taiwan on viremia in humans are used to estimate the number of cases that were viremic throughout the epidemic. Estimates of the asymptomatic-to-clinically confirmed SARS-CoV infection ratio, the proportion of asymptomatic inf...","Background: To explore the cellular immunity and cytokines status of NCP patients and to predict the correlation between the cellular immunity levels, cytokines and the severity of patients. Methods: 123 NCP patients were divided into mild and severe groups. Peripheral blood was collected, lymphocyte subsets and cytokines were detected. Correlation analysis was performed on the lymphocyte subsets and cytokines, and the differences between the indexes of the two groups were analyzed. Results: 102 mild and 21 severe patients were included. Lymphocyte subsets were reduced in two groups. The proportion of CD8 + T reduction in the mild and severe group was 28.43% and 61.9%, respectively; The proportion of B cell reduction was 25.49% and 28.57%; The proportion of NK cell reduction was 34.31% and 47.62%; The detection value of IL-6 was 0 in 55.88% of the mild group, mild group has a significantly lower proportion of patients with IL-6 higher than normal than severe group; There was no signifi...","This case study is the first to be developed in the Middle East region to document what happened during the response to the 2013 MERS outbreak in Qatar. It provides a description of key epidemiologic events and news released from a prime daily newspaper and main Emergency Risk Communication (ERC) actions that were undertaken by public health authorities. Using the Crisis and Emergency Risk Communication (CERC) theoretical framework, the study analyzes how the performed ERC strategies during the first days of the outbreak might have contributed to the outbreak management. Methods: MERS-CoV related events were chronologically tracked, together with the relevant stories that were published in a major newspaper over the course of three distinct phases of the epidemic. The collected media stories were then assessed against the practiced emergency risk communication (ERC) activities during the same time frame. Results: The Crisis &amp; Emergency Risk Communication (CERC) framework was partially ...","Summary In the USA, infectious diseases continue to exact a substantial toll on health and health-care resources. Endemic diseases such as chronic hepatitis, HIV, and other sexually transmitted infections affect millions of individuals and widen health disparities. Additional concerns include health-care-associated and foodborne infections\u2014both of which have been targets of broad prevention efforts, with success in some areas, yet major challenges remain. Although substantial progress in reduction of the burden of vaccine-preventable diseases has been made, continued cases and outbreaks of these diseases persist, driven by various contributing factors. Worldwide, emerging and reemerging infections continue to challenge prevention and control strategies while the growing problem of antimicrobial resistance needs urgent action. An important priority for control of infectious disease is to ensure that scientific and technological advances in molecular diagnostics and bioinformatics are we...","Background: The COVID-19 outbreak containment strategies in China based on non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) appear to be effective. Quantitative research is still needed however to assess the efficacy of different candidate NPIs and their timings to guide ongoing and future responses to epidemics of this emerging disease across the World. Methods: We built a travel network-based susceptible-exposed-infectious-removed (SEIR) model to simulate the outbreak across cities in mainland China. We used epidemiological parameters estimated for the early stage of outbreak in Wuhan to parameterise the transmission before NPIs were implemented. To quantify the relative effect of various NPIs, daily changes of delay from illness onset to the first reported case in each county were used as a proxy for the improvement of case identification and isolation across the outbreak. Historical and near-real time human movement data, obtained from Baidu location-based service, were used to derive the i...","Abstract Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) has emerged as a coronavirus infection of humans in the past 5 years. Though confined to certain geographical regions of the world, infection has been associated with a case fatality rate of 35%, and this mortality may be higher in ventilated patients. As there are few readily available animal models that accurately mimic human disease, it has been a challenge to ethically determine what optimum treatment strategies can be used for this disease. We used in-vitro and human ex-vivo explant cultures to investigate the effect of two immunomodulatory agents, interferon alpha and cyclosporine, singly and in combination, on MERS-CoV replication. In both culture systems the combined treatment was more effective than either agent used alone in reducing MERS-CoV replication. PCR SuperArray analysis showed that the reduction of virus replication was associated with a greater induction of interferon stimulated genes. As these therape...","ABSTRACTZoonotic coronaviruses (CoVs) are significant threats to global health, as exemplified by the recent emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)1. Host immune responses to CoV are complex and regulated in part through antiviral interferons. However, the interferon-stimulated gene products that inhibit CoV are not well characterized2. Here, we show that interferon-inducible lymphocyte antigen 6 complex, locus E (LY6E) potently restricts cellular infection by multiple CoVs, including SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Mechanistic studies revealed that LY6E inhibits CoV entry into cells by interfering with spike protein-mediated membrane fusion. Importantly, mice lacking Ly6e in hematopoietic cells were highly susceptible to murine CoV infection. Exacerbated viral pathogenesis in Ly6e knockout mice was accompanied by loss of hepatic and splenic immune cells and reduction in global antiviral gene pathways...","Motivated by the rapid upsurge of COVID-19 cases in the United States beginning March 2020, we forecast the disease spread and assess the effectiveness of containment strategies by using an estalished network-driven epidemic dynamic model. Our model is initialized using the daily counts of active and confirmed COVID-19 cases across the US. Based on our model predictions for the March 14-16 timeframe, the national epidemic peak could be expected to arrive by early June, corresponding to a daily active count of \u2248 7% of the US population, if no containment plans are implemented. Epidemic peaks are expected to arrive in the states of Washington and New York by May 21 and 25, respectively. With a modest 25% reduction in COVID-19 transmissibility via community-level interventions, the epidemic progression could be delayed by up to 34 days. Wholesale interstate traffic restriction is ineffective in delaying the epidemic outbreak, but it does desynchronize the arrival of state-wise epidemic pe...","If COVID-19 containment policies fail and social distancing measures cannot be sustained until vaccines becomes available, the next best approach is to use interventions that reduce mortality and prevent excess infections while allowing low-risk individuals to acquire immunity through natural infection until population level immunity is achieved. In such a situation, allowing some infections to occur in lower-risk groups might lead to an overall greater reduction in mortality than trying to protect everyone equally.","Background: A novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) emerged in Wuhan City, China, at the end of 2019 and has caused an outbreak of human-to-human transmission with a Public Health Emergency of International Concern declared by the World Health Organization on January 30, 2020. Aim: We aimed to estimate the potential risk and geographic range of Wuhan novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) spread within and beyond China from January through to April, 2020. Methods: A series of domestic and international travel network-based connectivity and risk analyses were performed, by using de-identified and aggregated mobile phone data, air passenger itinerary data, and case reports. Results: The cordon sanitaire of Wuhan is likely to have occurred during the latter stages of peak population numbers leaving the city before Lunar New Year (LNY), with travellers departing into neighbouring cities and other megacities in China. We estimated that 59,912 air passengers, of which 834 (95% UI: 478 - 1349) had 2019-nCoV i...","A recombinant severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) lacking the envelope (E) protein is attenuated in vivo. Here we report that E protein PDZ-binding motif (PBM), a domain involved in protein-protein interactions, is a major determinant of virulence. Elimination of SARS-CoV E protein PBM by using reverse genetics caused a reduction in the deleterious exacerbation of the immune response triggered during infection with the parental virus and virus attenuation. Cellular protein syntenin was identified to bind the E protein PBM during SARS-CoV infection by using three complementary strategies, yeast two-hybrid, reciprocal coimmunoprecipitation and confocal microscopy assays. Syntenin redistributed from the nucleus to the cell cytoplasm during infection with viruses containing the E protein PBM, activating p38 MAPK and leading to the overexpression of inflammatory cytokines. Silencing of syntenin using siRNAs led to a decrease in p38 MAPK activation in SARS-CoV infected c...","AbstractRNA knockdown in vivo carries significant potential for disease modelings and therapies. Despite the emerging approaches of CRISPR/Cas9-mediated permanent knock out of targeted genes, strategies targeting RNA for disruption are advantageous in the treatment of acquired metabolic disorders when permanent modification of the genome DNA is not appropriate, and RNA virus infection diseases when pathogenic DNA is not available (such as SARS-Cov-2 and MERS infections). Recently, Cas13d, a family of RNA-targeting CRISPR effectors, has been shown to accomplish robust down-regulation of cellular RNAs in mammalian cells in vitro. Among the various Cas13d subtypes, CasRx (RfxCas13d) showed the most potent RNA knockdown efficiency in HEK293T cells. However, the RNA-targeting activity of Cas13d still needs to be verified in vivo. In this study, the CasRx system was demonstrated to efficiently and functionally knock down genes related to metabolism functions, including Pten, Pcsk9 and lncLst...","BACKGROUND: In December 2019, a novel strain of SARS-CoV-2 emerged in Wuhan, China. Since then, the city of Wuhan has taken unprecedented measures and efforts in response to the outbreak. METHODS: We quantified the effects of control measures on population contact patterns in Wuhan, China, to assess their effects on the progression of the outbreak. We included the latest estimates of epidemic parameters from a transmission model fitted to data on local and internationally exported cases from Wuhan in the age-structured epidemic framework. Further, we looked at the age-distribution of cases. Lastly, we simulated lifting of the control measures by allowing people to return to work in a phased-in way, and looked at the effects of returning to work at different stages of the underlying outbreak. FINDINGS: Changes in mixing patterns may have contributed to reducing the number of infections in mid-2020 by 92% (interquartile range: 66-97%). There are benefits to sustaining these measures unti...","After the spread of SARS-CoV-2 epidemic out of China, evolution in the pandemic worldwide shows dramatic differences among countries. In Europe, the situation of Italy first and later Spain has generated great concern, and despite other countries show better prospects, large uncertainties yet remain on the future evolution and the efficacy of containment, mitigation or attack strategies. Here we applied a modified SEIR compartmental model accounting for the spread of infection during the latent period, in which we also incorporate effects of varying proportions of containment. We fit data to quarantined populations in order to account for the uncertainties in case reporting and study the scenario projections for the 17 individual regions (CCAA). Results indicate that with data for March 23, the epidemics follows an evolution similar to the isolation of 1.5 percent of the population and if there were no effects of intervention actions it might reach a maximum over 1.4M infected around A...","Background Chloroquine and Hydroxychloroquine have been found to be efficient on COV-19, and reported to be efficient in Chinese patients infected by this virus. We evaluate the role of Hydroxychloroquine on respiratory viral loads. Patients and methods Patients were included in a single arm protocol to receive 600mg of hydroxychloroquine daily and their viral load in nasal swabs was tested daily. Depending on their clinical presentation azithromycin was added to the treatment. Untreated patients from another center and cases refusing the protocol were included as negative control. Presence and absence of virus at Day-6 was considered the end point. Results Twenty cases were treated in this study and showed a significant reduction of the viral carriage at D-6 compared to controls, and much lower than reported average carrying duration of untreated patients in the literature. Azithromycin added to Hydroxychloroquine was significantly more efficient for virus elimination. Conclusion : Hy...","Background: In December 2019, an outbreak of new type of coronavirus named COVID-19 occurred in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. In a very short time, this virus spread rapidly over China, greatly threatening public health and economic development. The Chinese government acted quickly and implemented a series of strategies to prevent diffusion of this disease. We therefore sought to evaluate the effects of these Chinese strategies for controlling the spread of COVID-19. Methods: From the data of cumulative confirmed cases from provincial Health Commission websites of China, we performed model fitting and calculated the growth speed of cumulative confirmed patients. We further analyzed the time when this growth speed, the rate of the number of new cases, reached its maximum (Speedmax). Comparing different times to Speedmax of different areas in China, we calculated the dates at which the growth speed began to decline in different areas. Also, The number of plateaus were analyzed. Results: ...","ABSTRACTCOVID-19, SARS, and MERS are featured by fibrinolytic dysfunction. To test the role of the fibrinolytic niche in the regeneration of alveolar epithelium, we compared the self-renewing capacity of alveolar epithelial type 2 (AT2) cells and its differentiation to AT1 cells between wild type (wt) and fibrinolytic niche deficient mice (Plau\u2212/\u2212 and Serpine1Tg). A significant reduction in both proliferation and differentiation of deficient AT2 cells was observed in vivo and in 3D organoid cultures. This decrease was mainly restored by uPA derived A6 peptide, a binding fragment to CD44 receptors. The proliferative and differential rate of CD44+ AT2 cells was greater than that of CD44\u2212 controls. There was a reduction in transepithelial ion transport in deficient monolayers compared to wt cells. Moreover, we found a marked suppression in total AT2 cells and CD44+ subpopulation in lungs from brain dead patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and a mouse model infected by...","","Summary Use of a fit-tested N95 or FFP2 mask is recommended to protect against transmission of airborne pathogens. This poses considerable logistic problems when preparing for, or dealing with, an epidemic. Some of these problems might be overcome by use of a compact reusable high-efficiency particulate air filtering mask that can be cut to size. We carried out a randomised controlled cross-over study to compare the efficacy of such a mask (Totobobo, Dream Lab One Pte Ltd, Singapore) with fit-tested N95 masks (1860 or 1860s or 1862; 3M, St Paul, MN, USA) in 22 healthy volunteers. The median (interquartile range) reduction in airborne particle counts was significantly higher [193-fold (145\u2013200)] for N95 masks than for Totobobo masks [135-fold (83\u2013184)] (P &lt;0.05). There was no statistically significant difference between the proportion of subjects achieving a reduction of \u2265100-fold between N95 (19/22) and Totobobo (16/22) masks. We conclude that use of the Totobobo mask without fit testi...","Currently, there has been an increasing socioeconomic impact of zoonotic pathogens transmitted from animals to humans worldwide. Recently, in the Arabian Peninsula, including in Saudi Arabia, epidemiological data indicated an actual increase in the number of emerging and/or reemerging cases of several viral zoonotic diseases. Data presented in this review are very relevant because Saudi Arabia is considered the largest country in the Peninsula. We believe that zoonotic pathogens in Saudi Arabia remain an important public health problem; however, more than 10 million Muslim pilgrims from around 184 Islamic countries arrive yearly at Makkah for the Hajj season and/or for the Umrah. Therefore, for health reasons, several countries recommend vaccinations for various zoonotic diseases among preventive protocols that should be complied with before traveling to Saudi Arabia. However, there is a shortage of epidemiological data focusing on the emerging and reemerging of zoonotic pathogens tran...","Abstract Background Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine have been found to be efficient on SARS-CoV-2, and reported to be efficient in Chinese COV-19 patients. We evaluate the role of hydroxychloroquine on respiratory viral loads. Patients and methods French Confirmed COVID-19 patients were included in a single arm protocol from early March to March 16th, to receive 600mg of hydroxychloroquine daily and their viral load in nasopharyngeal swabs was tested daily in a hospital setting. Depending on their clinical presentation, azithromycin was added to the treatment. Untreated patients from another center and cases refusing the protocol were included as negative controls. Presence and absence of virus at Day6-post inclusion was considered the end point. Results Six patients were asymptomatic, 22 had upper respiratory tract infection symptoms and eight had lower respiratory tract infection symptoms. Twenty cases were treated in this study and showed a significant reduction of the viral carr...","The COVID-19 pandemic has led to unprecedented strain on intensive care unit (ICU) admission in parts of the world. Strategies to create surge ICU capacity requires complex local and national service reconfiguration and reduction or cancellation of elective activity. Theses measures require time to implement and have an inevitable lag before additional capacity comes on-line. An accurate short-range forecast would be helpful in guiding such difficult, costly and ethically challenging decisions. At the time this work began, cases in England were starting to increase. Here we present an attempt at an agile short-range forecast based on published real-time COVID-19 case data from the seven National Health Service commissioning regions in England (East of England, London, Midlands, North East and Yorkshire, North West, South East and South West). We use a Monte Carlo approach to model the likely impact of current diagnoses on regional ICU capacity over a 14 day horizon. Our model is design...","Abstract Nitric oxide is an important molecule playing a key role in a broad range of biological process such as neurotransmission, vasodilatation and immune responses. While the anti-microbiological properties of nitric oxide-derived reactive nitrogen intermediates (RNI) such as peroxynitrite, are known, the mechanism of these effects are as yet poorly studied. Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) belongs to the family Coronaviridae, was first identified during 2002-2003. Mortality in SARS patients ranges from between 6 to 55%. We have previously shown that nitric oxide inhibits the replication cycle of SARS-CoV in vitro by an unknown mechanism. In this study, we have further investigated the mechanism of the inhibition process of nitric oxide against SARS-CoV. We found that peroxynitrite, an intermediate product of nitric oxide in solution formed by the reaction of NO with superoxide, has no effect on the replication cycle of SARS-CoV, suggesting that the inhibiti...","Background: The rapid global spread of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is unprecedented. The outbreak has quickly spread to more than 100 countries reporting over 100,000 confirmed cases. Australia reported its first case of COVID-19 on 25th January 2020 and has since implemented travel restrictions to stop further introduction of the virus. Methods: We analysed daily global COVID-19 data published by the World Health Organisation to investigate the spread of the virus thus far. To assess the current risk of COVID-19 importation and local spread in Australia we predict international passenger flows into Australia during 2020. Findings: Our analysis of global data shows that Australia can expect a similar growth rate of reported cases as observed in France and the United States. We identify travel patterns of Australian citizens/residents and foreign travellers that can inform the implementation of new and the alteration of existing travel restrictions related to COVID-19. Interpretation...","Background. Administration of convalescent plasma may be of clinical benefit for treatment of severe acute viral respiratory infections. However, no clear evidence exists to support or oppose convalescent plasma use in clinical practice. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the evidence of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in the convalescent plasma for the treatment of severe influenza. Methods. Healthcare databases were searched in February 2020. All records were screened against the eligibility criteria. Data extraction and risk of bias assessments were undertaken. The primary outcome was case fatality rates by influenza. Results. We identified 5 RCTs of severe influenza. The pooled analyses showed no evidence for a reduction in mortality (Odds Ratio (OR) 1.06; p = 0.87; I2 = 35%). We also found non significant reductions in days in ICU and hospital, and days on mechanical ventilation. There seemed to have a biological benefit of increasing HAI titer levels...","Abstract Feed for livestock animals have been under increased scrutiny as a vector for pathogenic bacteria leading to human illnesses. Control of these pathogenic bacteria in animal feeds can be controlled via physical and chemical means. Physical methods can include thermal processing, including irradiation, pelleting, and extrusion. Chemical mitigation can be accomplished through the inclusion of various additives, including formaldehyde, organic acids, essential oils, or medium chain fatty acids. While physical and chemical interventions can help mitigate risk of pathogens contaminating finished animal feeds, the implementation of a biosecurity plan at the feed mill can help prevent pathogens from entering or spreading throughout the facility.","Background: Affected by a Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak, Since December 2019, there have been more than 76,000 cases of COVID-19 in China, causing more than 3,000 medical staff infections. Due to COVID-19 spreads quickly, is highly contagious, and can be fatal in severe cases, and there are no specific medicines, it poses a huge threat to the life and health of nurses and has a large impact on their emotional responses and coping strategies. Methods: This study conducted an online questionnaire survey from February 1 to 9, 2020 to investigate the current state of emotional responses and coping strategies of nurses and college nursing students in Anhui Province. This study used a modified Brief COPE (Carver, 1997) and a emotional responses scale. Results: The results found that women showed more severe anxiety and fear than men. Participants from cities showed more anxiety and fear than participants from rural, but rural participants showed more sadness than urban partic...","Summary Background In December, 2019, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a novel coronavirus, emerged in Wuhan, China. Since then, the city of Wuhan has taken unprecedented measures in response to the outbreak, including extended school and workplace closures. We aimed to estimate the effects of physical distancing measures on the progression of the COVID-19 epidemic, hoping to provide some insights for the rest of the world. Methods To examine how changes in population mixing have affected outbreak progression in Wuhan, we used synthetic location-specific contact patterns in Wuhan and adapted these in the presence of school closures, extended workplace closures, and a reduction in mixing in the general community. Using these matrices and the latest estimates of the epidemiological parameters of the Wuhan outbreak, we simulated the ongoing trajectory of an outbreak in Wuhan using an age-structured susceptible-exposed-infected-removed (SEIR) model for several ...","Background: The city of Wuhan is the epicenter of the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak and a central Chinese hub for transportation and industry. Mass migration prior to the Chinese New Year may have accelerated the spread of COVID-19 across China. This analysis investigated the temporal relationship between daily outbound traffic from Wuhan and the incidence of COVID-19 in 31 Chinese provinces during January-February 2020. Methods: We collected incidence of confirmed COVID-19 cases from National and Provincial Health Committee reports from January 10 to February 29, 2020. Volume of outbound traffic from Wuhan to other provinces was measured by Baidu Migration Index, a widely used metric that tracks migration based on cellphone location. We used cross-correlation function and autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model to examine time-lagged association between traffic volume and COVID-19 incidence by province. Contributors to the provincial variation in the temp...","Abstract Background The safety of performing spinal anaesthesia for both patients and anaesthetists alike in the presence of active infection with the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is unclear. Here, we report the clinical characteristics and outcomes for both patients with COVID-19 and the anaesthetists who provided their spinal anaesthesia. Methods Forty-nine patients with radiologically confirmed COVID-19 for Caesarean section or lower-limb surgery undergoing spinal anaesthesia in Zhongnan Hospital, Wuhan, China participated in this retrospective study. Clinical characteristics and perioperative outcomes were recorded. For anaesthesiologists exposed to patients with COVID-19 by providing spinal anaesthesia, the level of personal protective equipment (PPE) used, clinical outcomes (pulmonary CT scans), and confirmed COVID-19 transmission rates (polymerase chain reaction [PCR]) were reviewed. Results Forty-nine patients with COVID-19 requiring supplementary oxygen before sur...","Objectives: To study the effectiveness of noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) in the treatment of acute respiratory failure (ARF) in severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), and the associated infection risk. Methods: All patients with the diagnosis of probable SARS admitted to a regional hospital in Hong Kong from March 9 to April 28, 2003, and who had SARS-related respiratory distress complications were recruited for NIPPV usage. The health status of all health-care workers working in the NIPPV wards was closely monitored, and consent was obtained to check serum for coronavirus serology. Patient outcomes and the risk of SARS transmission to health-care workers were assessed. Results: NIPPV was applied to 20 patients (11 male patients) with ARF secondary to SARS. Mean age was 51.4 years, and mean acute physiology and chronic health evaluation II score was 5.35. Coronavirus serology was positive in 95% (19 of 20 patients). NIPPV was started 9.6 days (mean) from symptom o...","An ongoing novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia infection outbreak called COVID-19 started in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, in December 2019. It both spread rapidly to all provinces in China and started spreading around the world quickly through international human movement from January 2020. Currently, the spatiotemporal epidemic transmission patterns, prediction models, and possible risk analysis for the future are insufficient for COVID-19 but we urgently need relevant information, particularly from the global perspective. We have developed a novel two-stage simulation model to simulate the spatiotemporal changes in the number of COVID-19 cases and estimate the future worldwide risk. Based on the connectivity of countries to China and the country's medical and epidemic prevention capabilities, different scenarios are generated to analyze the possible transmission throughout the world and use this information to evaluate each country's vulnerability to and the dynamic risk of COVID..."],"title":["Chapter 6 Public Health, Communicable Diseases and Global Health","The timing of one-shot interventions for epidemic control","Clinical care for severe influenza and other severe illness in resource\u2010limited settings: the need for evidence and guidelines","Opinion: Sustainable development must account for pandemic risk","Lockdown may partially halt the spread of 2019 novel coronavirus in Hubei province, China","Responding to health emergencies in the Eastern Mediterranean region in times of conflict","Teaching-practice as a critical bridge for narrowing the research-practice gap","The Effectiveness of Social Distancing in Mitigating COVID-19 Spread: a modelling analysis","A qualitative study of zoonotic risk factors among rural communities in southern China","Triage assessment of cardiorespiratory risk status based on measurement of the anaerobic threshold, and estimation by patient-reported activity limitation","Assessing the interactions between COVID-19 and influenza in the United States","Chapter 14 Biosecurity Strategies for Backyard Poultry: A Controlled Way for Safe Food Production","Severe air pollution events not avoided by reduced anthropogenic activities during COVID-19 outbreak","Risk assessment of novel coronavirus COVID-19 outbreaks outside China","Impact of the contact and exclusion rates on the spread of COVID-19 pandemic","Risk estimation and prediction by modeling the transmission of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) in mainland China excluding Hubei province","Assessing the Impact of Reduced Travel on Exportation Dynamics of Novel Coronavirus Infection (COVID-19)","Assessing the impact of reduced travel on exportation dynamics of novel coronavirus infection (COVID-19)","Theoretically estimated risk of severe acute respiratory syndrome transmission through blood transfusion during an epidemic in Shenzhen, Guangdong, China in 2003","Characteristics of lymphocyte subsets and cytokines in peripheral blood of 123 hospitalized patients with 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP)","How Do the First Days Count?

Core to our argument are strategies for resilience building against biological hazards and pandemic. We reiterate our assertion that there is a lack of early and rapid actions from the DRR-related organisations, despite the SFDRR's call for building resilience including from biological hazards. The SFDRR's ultimate goal is a substantial reduction of risk and losses, coupled with laying the essential foundations for rapid and sustained recovery and sustainable development. We hope the evidence we have added shows the crisis of COVID-19 could be used to make 2020 a \"super year\" of great progress on these goals.","To mitigate the risk of quality-failures, the EMA promoted the application of the quality-by-design and quality risk assessment principles to the manufacturing of medicinal products (EMA, 2015a (EMA, ,b, 2017 . The rationalization of pharmaceutical manufacturing and the control strategies can be derived from a better knowledge of the product and process. The traditional quality control process has been generally based on the testing of most critical parameters and manufacturing steps can impact on the quality of the intermediates or the final medicinal product. The control setpoints and operating ranges are, therefore, fixed based on the experiments carried out in the pharmaceutical development, and their change should be notified/authorized by a Regulatory Authority as post-approval change. The application of a modern pharmaceutical quality system promotes a systematic and continuous evaluation, understanding and refining of the formulation and the manufacturing process by the identification of the critical material attributes and process parameters and by the determination of the existing functional relationship between such factors and the responses (i.e. quality profile of the products). However, effective pharmaceutical quality systems require close collaboration between the MAH and their suppliers of raw materials to promote a more rational definition of the critical quality attributes of the drug product and to improve the production resilience. The implementation of the quality risk management plan, including shortage-specific prevention and management plan, was proposed to enhance the resilience of manufacturers to shortages, (ISPE, 2014; PDA, 2014; Panzitta et al., 2017) . For example, Panzitta and co-workers proposed a qualitative risk assessment based on a classification of different risk factors, causing a shortage in the manufacturing process (Panzitta et al., 2017) . Based on the resulting risk ranking, the manufacturer can define proper strategies to prevent shortage (e.g., increase of the raw material suppliers, expansion of the material stocks). However, some measures may not apply to all the situation since their high impact on economic sustainability. For example, the maintenance of large material stockpiles or the expansion of the suppliers' number, with the relative increase of inspections and audits, might be not sustainable for manufacturers of the low-price drug products. For these considerations, the adoption of the preventing tools proposed by the stakeholders' associations (PDA, 2014; ISPE, 2014) could be carried out gradually by the MAHs based on both the shortage impact of a product on the treated patients and the economic sustainability for the MAHs production.","The intervention was associated with a significant and sustainable decrease in the use of 3GC. Use decreased from 178.9 before to 68.7 DDD/1000 pd. The intervention resulted in a mean estimated reduction of total antibiotic use of \u2212375.0 DDD/1000 pd, which is equivalent to a 27% reduction. Total antibiotic use showed no significant month to month change before and after the intervention. Piperacillin and piperacillin/tazobactam showed a significant increase in level of 64.4 DDD/1000 pd and continued to increase by 2.3 DDD/1000 pd per month after the intervention. The intervention was not associated with a significant quarterly change in the RD of K. pneumoniae and E. coli resistant to 3GC. In contrast, the reduced use of 3GC and the switch to piperacillin was followed by a continuous increase in the RD of E. coli resistant to piperacillin by 0.5 per 1000 pd per quarter and by a continuous decrease of P. aeruginosa resistant to piperacillin of 0.1 per quarter.","Finally, by placing global health, health emergencies, and infectious disease governance at the top of the UN hierarchy, the opportunity to establish greater policy coherence across the entire landscape of global governance mandates and instruments could be better realized by a UN Global Health Panel. This includes ensuring that all member states, UN agencies, and non-state partners are aligned under SDG goals 3.b (supporting R&amp;D for infectious diseases), 3.c (ensuring a sustainable health workforce in developing countries) and 3.d (strengthening capacity for risk reduction and management of global health risks), all factors critical in preventing and responding to infectious disease outbreaks. This in turn could translate to better funding, strengthening, and implementation of the IHR and the WHO R&amp;D Blueprint, while also supporting wider adoption of the WHO Global Code of Practice on the International Recruitment of Health Personnel [69, 70]. Additionally, other global health governance mechanisms can also be championed at highest levels of political engagement, including proposed instruments such as the biomedical R&amp;D treaty and the Framework Convention for Global Health, which could bolster the normative powers of WHO [29, 71, 72]. This could establish a strengthened global health governance system, a step that is needed to ensure that global health and infectious disease outbreaks are given their rightful priority in the ec\ufeffhelons of foreign policy and international affairs.","AAHL's mission is to be prepared to quickly and effectively respond to any new emerging infectious disease that may emerge. It does so by working with government and industry to assist in responding quickly to stop threats in their tracks and provide sustainable management strategies. We are exploring new technologies for detection, surveillance, diagnosis and response, and we will continue preparing for the next human pandemic.","Currently, no antiviral therapy has yet been proven useful for SARS. Attempts to test potential anti-SARS agents using antiviral antibodies, entry inhibitors, proteinase inhibitors, calpain inhibitors, ribavirin (nucleoside analogues), interferons, and short interfering RNAs were riddled with contradictory reports from different laboratories. The lack of clinical trials also prevented the reaching of a conclusive agreement for effective anti-SARS strategies (reviewed by Weiss et al.61). Nevertheless, human convalescent-phase plasma seemed to shorten hospitalization without adverse effects if it is administered as an immunotherapy to SARS patients early in the course of infection.62 With the finding that recovered SARS patients have higher and more sustainable levels of neutralizing antibodies when compared to those who had succumbed to the disease,63 monoclonal antibodies for passive immunization were also obtained using phage-display antibody libraries and immortalization of B cells from convalescent SARS patients.64,65","WHO gives high priority to food safety, quality and consumer protection programs and food safety is an essential public health function. WHO aims to develop sustainable, integrated food-safety systems for reduction of health risks from the entire food chain. Food safety, in fact, is an essential activity and an integral part of any public health programme (WHO, 2000) . Food-borne diseases (FBD) result in substantial burden on healthcare systems, trade and tourism, market access; and reduce economic productivity and threaten livelihood. But FBDs generally go undetected, mostly due to lack of communication among the human, veterinary, agriculture, and food sectors.","E. Meyer, M. Lapatschek, A. Bechthold, G. Schwarzkopf, D. Monnet, P. Gastmeier, F. Schwab (Freiburg, Munich, DE; Stockholm, SE; Berlin, DE) Objective: To test whether a reduction of third-generation cephalosporin (3GC)use has a sustainable positive impact on the high endemic prevalence of 3GC-resistant K. pneumoniae and E. coli in a surgical intensive care unit (ICU). Intervention: Switch from 3GC to piperacillin in combination with a b-lactamase-inhibitor as standard therapy for peritonitis and other intraabominal infections in 7/2004. Methods: Segmented regression analysis of interrupted time series was used to analyse antibiotic consumption and resistance data 30 months before and 30 after the intervention. Antimicrobial usage density (AD) was expressed as daily defined doses (DDD) and normalised per 1000 patient-days. The proportion of resistant isolates (RP) is calculated by dividing the number of resistant isolates by the total number of the isolates of this species tested against this antibiotic multiplied by 100. The resistance densities (RD) are expressed as the number of resistant isolates of a species/1000 pd.","In 2005 three areas of coordination were defined: (1) social integration; (2) adequate and sustainable pensions; and (3) high-quality sustainable health-care and long-term care, which merged into a single social OMC. 17 In 2008, the EU further enhanced the OMC as a fundamental tool of social development and revised the term to \"Social OMC.\"","A key measurable goal for the success of health policy is assessing Universal Health Coverage, including access to effective and safe medicines and other health targets within the UN's Sustainable Development Goals. Ensuring that all countries have sustainable and widely accessible health resources is vital to achieving Universal Health Coverage: ie provision of health services for all when needed without suffering undue financial hardship [8] .","It is of course important to consider health policy implications both for developed countries and the less developed world. The United Nations Sustainable Development Goals [3] aim for fair and sustainable health at every level globally: from protecting the planet to achieving long-term health, peace and prosperity in local communities. These goals have important public health implications and require coordinated national and international action on economic, environmental and social development.","Sustainability is a broad concept and is considered to be ambiguous because it means different things to different people at different periods of time. As a consequence there are many different definitions of sustainable agriculture; however, most of them are connected to the three pillars of sustainability: society, economy, and environment. For example, Reganold et al. (2001) summarized this concept as \"to be sustainable, a farm must produce adequate yields of high quality, be profitable, protect the environment, conserve resources, and be socially responsible in the long term.\"","In deciding whether an intervention is sustainable policy maker could formulate an answer to this question: \"if infection rates are the same or higher at some future time, and would increase if they were dropped, would you be willing to maintain the intervention in place?\" If so, then the intervention is sustainable. If the answer is \"no\", and the intervention will be abandoned at some future time regardless of the new infection profile, then this is a one-shot intervention, and it should be held in reserve until it will have more impact.","is the (which was not peer-reviewed) The copyright holder for this preprint . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.20.20040055 doi: medRxiv preprint Figure 1 : Ten week delay epidemic curve for Perth. Figure 1 illustrates the growth in cases prior to intervention activation (the increasing green curve) and how the activation of the robust combined strategies at week ten rapidly reduces the number of daily cases, from approximately day 79 onwards. All individual interventions are seen to lower the peak daily number of cases, with a 70% reduction in community cases (CCR70, long dashed blue) being the most effective in reducing the peak, followed by increased case isolation (CI, purple). A less \"strict\" community contact reduction of 50% (CCR50, dotted blue), 90% workplace absenteeism (WN90, dashed yellow), and 30% community contact reduction (CCT30, solid blue) are single interventions which are increasingly less effective in reducing the daily infection peak. Figures 2 and 3 present the epidemic curves for infectious cases with one and five week activation delays, respectively. For these short activation delay scenarios both combined intervention strategies are effective in preventing an epidemic occurring, both green lines are flat. However, this assumes that these robust intervention strategies are continued indefinitely. 70% communitywide contact reduction is the most effective single intervention measure and increasing case isolation and a 50% reduction in community contact are also seen to be highly effective in reducing the growth in case numbers and delaying the epidemic peak.","Our results have important implications for the ongoing COVID-19 epidemic. If an intervention definitely cannot be sustained for an extended period of time, then it is best if it is \"held in reserve\" until depletion of susceptibles has reduced the effective reproductive number enough that the one-shot intervention will have maximal impact. However, we must exercise care in determining that an intervention cannot be sustained. The uncertainty about the case fatality rate remains high [9] , and at the higher end of the plausible values, the tolerance of the population for drastic interventions may be significant. Thus what might appear to be an unsustainable intervention may in fact be sustainable if we have a better understanding of the case fatality rate. An additional consequence of our results which is applicable to sustainable interventions is that the expression \"better late than never\" applies quite strongly for interventions.","Similar to outbreaks of other respiratory pathogens (1) (2) (3) (4) , syndromic airport screening at arrival of travellers from regions with a high risk of human-to-human transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is unlikely to prevent a sufficient proportion of infected travellers to prevent global spread (5, 6) . Sensitising arriving travellers to the symptoms and risk of SARS-CoV-2 and to encourage selfisolation as well as rapidly seeking for medical assistance via telephone which in turn will trigger tracing and quarantine of contacts, may have a more pronounced effect and is currently implemented in many transport hubs. However, with increasing numbers of infected travellers contact tracing is unlikely to be sustainable for long because of the immensely resourceintensive nature of contact tracing and hence is similarly unlikely to prevent local transmission in the long term (7) .","Travel bans and social distancing measures are effective public health tools to control epidemic diseases (2), and Australia successfully delayed the introduction of the 1918 pandemic by 1 year and reduced the total mortality compared to other countries (3) . However, travel bans are not sustainable indefinitely, and a careful risk analysis needs to be done comparing the health and economic consequences of alternative scenarios. The epidemic in China peaked on February 5 th and has declined since (4) . The risk of importation of COVID-19 cases through travel from an affected country is proportional to the volume of travel from that country and their prevalence of infection at that time point. We aimed to estimate the impact of the implementation of the travel ban on China from February 1 st 2020 on the epidemic trajectory in Australia, as well as the impact of lifting the ban completely or partially from the 8 of March.","Fighting against 2019-nCoV would be a long process, due to the three characteristics of this epidemics (long incubation period, asymptomatic infection, and high-false-negative-rate diagnosis) [6] . The transmission of 2019-nCoV is naturally (exponentially) growing in Japan and Singapore, increasing the risk of a global outbreak. Even after this transmission wave, 2019-nCoV might come back in every winter. As such, proportionate control is especially important for sustainable protect human from the infectious diseases.","Translation of research evidence to programme and policy agenda has been a major constraint to ensure evidence-based practices. Genereux, Lafontaine and Eukelbosh [15] identified some key determinants that facilitate knowledge-to-action strategies for better community health risk preparedness. The team argued that blending traditional and modern approaches, fostering community engagement, cultivating relationships, investing in preparedness and recovery, putting knowledge into practice, and availability of human and financial resources are key successful factors for integrating expertise and research in disaster management practice. Yet, a lack of emergency preparedness often exacerbates the underlying community health risks in resource-deficit minority-based areas in times of crisis and emergencies. Ho, Chan, Lam et al. [16] showed indicators capturing perceived water security in the non-emergency/normal period might not be associated with Health-EDRM preparedness attitude and coping ability in a water-stressed rural context of PRC China. Chan, Lam, Lo et al. [17] showed food-labelling and perceptions of food-related health risk might be influenced by face-to-face health education interventions and should be considered as a core emergency preparedness and health risk reduction management strategy to strengthen bottom-up resilience in minority communities. Kamara, Akombi, Agho et al. [18] conducted a systematic review of resilience and well-being evidence in southern Africa and showed disaster risk reduction interventions that were based only on Western modelled or scientific warning systems might undervalue traditional warning insights and undermine intrinsic and community capacities. To strengthen resilience and well-being outcomes, efforts should be invested to ensure household, community/indigenous knowledge, and government-level capabilities are harnessed. Public health planning models might be instrumental in facilitating the planning for Health-EDRM-related risk reduction efforts in both emergency and non-emergency situations [19,20].","While the methods described here may help mitigate the shortcomings of vaccine investment, they also suggest that a more sustainable long-term solution lies in aligning the incentives for wealthier stakeholders with the incentives of those people most vulnerable to EIDs. Indeed, this alignment is prudent for the former group, as under outbreak conditions their health security may be at risk, even in places where EIDs are unlikely to emerge (19) , as the recent Zika and Ebola outbreaks illustrate.","The third stage of the outbreak focused on reducing clusters of cases, thoroughly controlling the epidemic, and striking a balance between epidemic prevention and control, sustainable economic and social development, the unified command, standardized guidance, and scientific evidence-based policy implementation. For Wuhan and other priority areas of Hubei Province, the focus was on patient treatment and the interruption of transmission, with an emphasis on concrete steps to fully implement relevant measures for the testing, admitting and treating of all patients. Wuhan and Hubei Province continue to strictly control traffic transitions, such as controlling entrances and exits, and other provinces in China are also trying to prevent the risk of imported cases from other countries.","Lastly, increased zoonotic pathogens surveillance, particularly influenza, during the Hajj season, increased infection control interventions, screening, and quarantine of suspected cases, provision of adequate medical treatment, sustainable awareness, increased education and training of target groups at high risk (e.g., doctors, nurses, veterinarians, and animal workers such as farmers and abattoir workers, etc.) are of great importance to reduce the burden of zoonoses among Saudi Arabian localities. Fortunately, in collaboration with three organizations\u2014including the MOH in Saudi Arabia, the USA Centers for Disease Control and prevention, and the WHO\u2014a successful preparedness plan during the Hajj season was put in place to vaccinate all pilgrims before leaving their home countries [68]. Altogether, there is an urgent need for collaborative surveillance and intervention plans for the control of zoonotic pathogens in Saudi Arabia.","The country's functional capacity is well advanced and sustainable at all levels of health systems. the use of independently verified data would be useful (eg, external assessments such as joint external evaluations) for a review of this nature, this limitation is minimised by the fact that SPAR data has been shown to correlate strongly with externally evaluated data such as the Joint External Evaluation results. 21 Several factors affect the emergence and spread of an infectious disease outbreak within countries and between regions, including the strength of IHR capacities at the national and subnational levels, adherence to infection prevention and control measures, climate-related pressures, and the density of populations. 8, 16, 22 When an outbreak is caused by an airborne pathogen, population density or crowding is known to directly affect spread of infection. 22 Analysis of other risk variables associated with tackling an infectious disease outbreak and managing health emergencies would benefit understanding of existing country capacities, including vulnerabilities due to socioeconomic conditions, comorbid conditions, and lack of health infrastructure, which we did not take into account.","The persistence of MERS-CoV and Ebola virus disease draw attention to a global failure by public health systems to adequately assess and respond to such outbreaks, because of an absence of proper risk assessment and communication, transparency, and serious intent to defi ne and control the outbreaks. In light of the shortcomings in existing public health surveillance capacity and infrastructures, a revised long-term strategy that addresses global governance of public health is needed. Recent statements from the G20 Summit in Brisbane, Australia, and from the World Bank Group suggest that world leaders are learning the lesson of the consequences of failure to invest in prevention, detection, and initiation of rapid aggressive early responses. Experiences from Ebola virus disease and MERS-CoV outbreaks show that all governments and WHO urgently need to implement a well-fi nanced and well-managed response system in a sustainable way, well before the next infectious disease crisis emerges. In addition to the existing appropriate global priority focus on the Ebola virus disease, we need to ensure that MERS-CoV is not forgotten. Proactive surveillance, research into the epidemiology and pathogenesis, and development of new drugs and vaccines for all emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases that potentially threaten global health security 15 should be maintained. There is no room for complacency.","We simulated two types of control strategy: suppression and mitigation. Both types of strategy were modelled by reduction in the transmission coefficient, resulting in a proportional reduction in the reproduction number with control (Rc). This is a very simple control model which assumes that transmission rates from pre-symptomatic, unconfirmed symptomatic and confirmed symptomatic infections are all reduced by a constant factor. This describes society-wide control interventions, such as social distancing, hygiene measures, and lockdowns. It does not account for control measures that specifically target confirmed cases, such as case isolation. These could be modelled by a larger reduction in transmission rates for confirmed cases; we did not attempt this but it could be included in future model refinements to investigate the dependence of control efficacy on testing. The magnitude of the reduction in Rc was calibrated by comparisons with international data on case trajectories ( Fig. 2 ) and modelling studies for the UK and US outbreaks (Ferguson et al 2020) . The latter study assumed that interventions would have a similar impacts as they do with seasonal influenza. We then simulated suppression strategies by a fixed reduction in Rc for a period of 400 days. We simulated mitigation strategies by dynamic changes in Rc aimed at keeping the demand on the healthcare system under capacity (i.e. current infections under 40,000). In all cases, control began at t = 42 days after exposure of the initial seed infections. Table 1 . Estimates for the hospitalisation rate, ICU admission rate and case fatality rate (CFR) for New Zealand. These were calculated from the age-specific rates published by CDC (2020) combined with the age structure of New Zealand's population (StatsNZ). These values assume that NZ has a similar healthcare system, rates of underlying health conditions, and Covid-19 testing rates as the US. Note that our model uses lower values than these estimates, which is reasonable because the model parameters represent rates per infection, which will be lower than rates per confirmed case if some infections are asymptomatic, subclinical or otherwise undiagnosed. ","Risk factors for the disease in humans are incompletely understood [21], although MERS is proposed to be a zoonotic disease. Dromedary camels have been implicated due to reports that some confirmed cases were exposed to camels. In the Middle East, confirmed cases of MERS-CoV have arisen as sporadic, familial, or hospital clusters [13, 22\u201326]. Although human-to-human transmission of MERS-CoV has been identified in many European, African, and Middle Eastern countries, [27\u201330] a genomic analysis of the Riyadh MERS-CoV isolates suggested that there were three genetically distinct lineages of MERS-CoV; therefore, it was unlikely that the Riyadh infections were the result of a single, continuous chain of human-to-human transmission [15, 31, 32]. A recent study provided further evidence of non-sustainable transmission among humans and suggested that transmission within Saudi Arabia was dependent on contact with an animal reservoir or animal products [14]; however, no animal reservoir has yet been identified. While contact with camels has been reported, these reports were limited to only the primary cases [22, 33\u201337]. The MERS-CoV was related with a strain of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) that caused an outbreak in 29 countries in 2002\u20132003. This outbreak was characterized by 8273 cases and 775 deaths, with the majority of cases in Hong Kong [16]. As was determined for the SARS-CoV during its pre-pandemic stage, the MERS-CoV has likely been repeatedly transmitted from an unknown animal host to humans in the past year [17\u201320].","Tailored and sustainable approaches should be adopted in a different situation, striking a balance among the control of infection and death number, confining epidemic regions, and maintaining socioeconomic vitality. ","Telehealth offers a tool to provide accessible, quality care and maintain connectivity while practicing social distancing. Thoughtful implementation 3,4,5 of telehealth now allows for sustainable and scalable practice beyond the current crisis.","This response is one of the swiftest, coordinated global responses to an emerging infectious disease the world has seen in modern times, but is it the appropriate response, will it be effective and is it sustainable?","We present a timely evaluation of the impact of 'lockdown' on the 2019-nCov epidemic in Hubei province, China. The implementation appears to be effective in reducing about 60% of new infections and deaths, and its effect also appears to be sustainable even after its removal.","Also, this research work will contribute significantly to recent research findings by Nesteruk (2020) and Ming and Zhang (2020) as well as inform government, non-government organizations as well as policy maker's decision on sustainable policies to prevent the spread of the disease based on specific age groups of the active population.","\u201cAll forms of malnutrition have a common denominator: food systems that fail to provide all people with healthy, safe, affordable and sustainable diets. Changing this will require action across food systems \u2013 from production and processing, through trade and distribution, pricing, marketing, and labelling, to consumption and waste. All relevant policies and investments must be radically re-examined,\u201d Branca said.","\u2022 To improve environmental hygiene, a national system of sanitation should be created to provide population access to adequate sanitation measures given the current unsanitary conditions in hospitals sustainable care and development and nosocomial infection management. The government and the director of the hospital should emphasize the role of rational design of the wards and hospital layout and balance the costs and benefits in prevention of infection.","The start of a new decade provides an excellent opportunity to reflect on current needs and gaps in healthcare. It is also timely to consider national and international readiness to meet these challenges, including future watching for the new and unexpected for health and disease, both as regards problems and solutions. These considerations are vital to ensure effective and sustainable development and delivery of health policy and technology over the next decade and beyond.","is the (which was not peer-reviewed) The copyright holder for this preprint . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.25.20043711 doi: medRxiv preprint Outputs from the tool will allow planners to examine how increases in acute and critical resources available for COVID-19 patients can impact healthcare system sustainability. Further, the tool can inform the required intensity for non-pharmaceutical societal interventions like physical distancing based on a healthcare system's proximity to the sustainable threshold.","WHO's Eastern Mediterranean region (EMR) is facing emergencies on a scale that is perhaps unprecedented in its history. There is armed conflict in 12 of the region's 22 countries. 1,2 The region's 680 million people 3 represent 9% of the global population, yet the EMR is home to 43% of those who need humanitarian assistance 4 and is the source of 64% of the world's refugees. 5 The health effects of these crises are immense. Direct health consequences include trauma-related deaths and disability, gender-based violence, and mental disorders. Disruption of health systems contributes to increased morbidity and mortality from infectious diseases, malnutrition, obstetric complications, and non-communicable diseases (NCDs). Health indicators in the EMR are among the worst in the world. 6 State fragility and conflict are among the biggest challenges to attainment of Sustainable Development Goal 3. 7 Conflict is a global health security threat because affected countries are less able to prevent, detect, and respond to disease outbreaks. More than 70% of disease outbreaks worldwide occur in fragile and conflict-affected settings. 8 Yemen has experienced the largest cholera outbreak in history. 9 During the second half of 2019, there were six concurrent disease outbreaks in Sudan. 10 Wild polio virus returned to Syria due to conflict, 11 while Afghanistan and Pakistan are two of three countries where the virus remains endemic. 12 The average International Health Regulations (IHR) core capacity score is much lower for the 12 conflict-affected countries than for the other countries in the region, 6 placing them at greater risk of spread and public health consequences of the ongoing outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and other epidemic-prone diseases. WHO's global COVID-19 strategic preparedness and response plan 13 therefore prioritises countries with weak health systems for technical and operational support from international partners. COVID-19 has already affected ten countries in the region, as of Feb 28, 2020, including Afghanistan, Iraq, and Pakistan.","Due to the large amount of information production and publication during the current Coronavirus crisis, serious concerns have been raised over people's excessive information consuming. \u201cIf information consumption grows, it can cause a loss of tranquility, confusion and can concern the human mind, rather than being a facilitator of life. Therefore, as humans respect the limits about use of water, food, and air, they must also rationally limit their consumption of information; otherwise they will encounter phenomena known as the information obesity, and the information diet will be a rational solution to this phenomenon\u201d (3). The concept of Information Diet was introduced by Clay Johnson for the first time. He believes consumers should take responsibility for the type of information they consume, likewise the rational consumption of food. He also argues that there must be a sustainable news movement, like a sustainable food movement that has already started in the US. In other words, people and even governments are not capable of dealing with the media to a great extent, but people can create their own information diets, like food diet. Therefore, information consumers are advised to consume information in a limited way. However, they must demand complete and credible news, not news that is based on emotional content and full of advertisements\u201d (4). In the present Coronavirus crisis, some people spend most of their time studying related information regarding Covid-19 in written and virtual media; Meanwhile, they are unwilling to spend time exercising at home, talking to their families, playing with their children or doing other useful tasks such as studying, watching movies and so on. To seriously address these problems in the Coronavirus crisis, not only people must have optimum consumption of appropriate information, but also consuming information should comply with specific terms and conditions. For example, children should not be exposed to the news related to the Coronavirus, because this information increases anxiety and causes other psychological problems among them. The elderly is also vulnerable to the spread of information, and should be provided with reliable and limited information, and they should not be given the ongoing news. On the other hand, individuals should be able to distinguish between high quality and poor quality information, since much of the information regarding Covid-19 is invalid and is produced and published for economic, political, social, and in general profitable purposes (disinformation). Nowadays, information is being provided every day, and by contemplating on and reviewing the publication of statistics related to the Coronavirus crisis on websites, blogs, social media, television and satellite channels etc., it can be understood that the overload of information has already occurred. Hence, providing people with all kinds of health literature is the only option. Although people may not have the ability to control the production and supply of the information nowadays, each of them must control the extent and type of the information which they consume. Therefore, in order to achieve a comprehensive information diet in societies, people need to be equipped with the knowledge and skills of health information literacy, media health literacy, media literacy and health literacy. Currently these trainings can only be delivered through the mass media. Delivering these skills requires specific knowledge and skills which health information professionals (medical librarians) poses, and they can train other people in the society through mass media relying on their abilities.","It is clear that the threat of COVID-19 outbreak is not limited to any single country or region. The response, control, and prevention of novel infectious diseases require strong and sustainable international collaborative work and data sharing. Further research is imperative to fill the knowledge gaps on COVID-19. In addition to expertise in the fields of medicine, public health, and computer science, the contribution of environmental scientists in collaborative research is urgently warranted for combating the infectious disease threat at a global scale.","One could take a deep breath or three before the start of a readout session or between each case or spend 30 to 60 seconds in deep breathing on bathroom breaks, after reading e-mail updates or news, or before starting a meeting. Such small changes may seem inconsequential and futile in the face of immense pressures. Small changes, however, have the advantage of being doable and sustainable. Over time, anchoring deep breathing and other micropractices into our existing habits can help build more wellness into our lives.","This crisis-driven expanded interest in vaccines to address epidemic threats is encouraging, but there is still much work to be done. There needs to be a viable, sustainable business model that will align the financial incentives of stakeholders to encourage the necessary investment in vaccine development (19, 20) . While governments and international agencies have striven to create incentives to attract additional private sector investment in vaccine development, these efforts have so far failed in attracting sufficient capital to enhance preparedness against the world's most deadly emerging pathogens (21) .","Three major international organisations, WHO, the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), and the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE), have started to put this vision into practice by consolidating a formal partnership to combat human-animal-environment health risks, strengthening their joint action in May, 2018. A year later, as a result of this partnership, they released a guide (Taking a multisectoral, one health approach: a tripartite guide to addressing zoonotic diseases in countries) that provides principles and best practices to assist countries in achieving sustainable and functional collaboration at the human-animal-environment interface.","Current estimates of case fatality rate (not to be confused with infection fatality rate) range from 0.7% in China outside of Hubei province to around 2% in much of the world, to around 5.8% in Wuhan [8] . These estimates may depend on what proportion of cases are identified, and whether the health system is over capacity. With such high fatality rates, our tolerance for drastic interventions should increase. Thus an intervention that would be considered one-shot for the 2009 H1N1 pandemic which had a low fatality rate might be considered sustainable for the COVID-19 epidemic.","Heterogeneity between CT features and RT-PCR results was found in COVID-19, especially in some recovered patients who obtained negative RT-PCR results. Our study highlights that RT-PCR and chest CT should be considered the key determinants in the clinical diagnosis and management of COVID-19 patients, such as the discharge criteria. Furthermore, long-term follow-up studies are essential in COVID-19 patients after obtaining negative RT-PCR results, especially in patients with sustainable abnormal indexes and with progression of chest CT manifestations. author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.","Using an online tool, healthcare systems can estimate the maximum daily number of incident COVID-19 cases which could be managed based on age-based case distribution and severity and the number of maximally available acute and critical care resources.

Customers now demand better quality care and more attention to maintain or improve their overall health. Evidence has shown that challenges and gaps exist in community pharmacy practice. In developing countries, the functions of community pharmacists must be redefined and reoriented. A paradigm shift in the mind-set and practices of pharmacists is urgently needed.","The health-care system must be sustainable in order to be able to offer services on the one hand, and on the other hand to be sufficient to meet the health-care needs of the population. The health system must be efficient and its operations must: (1) abide by the fundamental economic principle of scarcity of resources; and (2) take into account the documented finding that the health system affects the state of health of the population much less than expected. Consequently, resources can be allocated to other public policies that indirectly benefit health and quality of life for the population under an unwavering long-term perspective.","Our analysis shows clearly that a one-shot intervention is much more effective if implemented once the number of infections is reasonably large. This pattern is consistent for well-mixed populations and for metapopulations. In the metapopulation model, the intervention is significantly more effective when the timing in each subgroup is based on the infection levels in that group as opposed to synchronized across the population. Our analysis also shows that if a sustainable transmission-reducing intervention has not yet been implemented once the 16 .

Then we discuss results from those mathematical models. Finally we discuss the implications of these results. A particularly important point to raise is that for an infection like COVID-19 with a relatively high proportion of severe cases, we need to think carefully about an intervention before we decide that it is not sustainable. In the Appendix we develop some mathematical theory explaining the mechanism underlying the effect in more detail.","Critically ill-patients admitted to ICUs are highly susceptible to infections because of predisposing illnesses and the use of invasive procedures, and are therefore exposed to high antibiotic pressure. The high and increasing prevalence of antibiotic resistant bacteria among patients admitted to European hospitals in addition to high antibiotic consumption and shortcomings in infection control measures increase the risk of significant outbreaks caused by antibiotic-resistant pathogens among the critically ill. In countries with previously low resistance levels (Scandinavia, Finland and the Netherlands), the frequency of multidrug resistance (MDR), particularly MRSA, may increase rapidly if surveillance and measures to combat outbreaks fails. The need for an early warning system of emerging and/or increasing antibiotic resistance for local, national and international use is apparent. A programme for continuous yearly registration of antibiotic use, resistance and clinical practices with automatic feedback through a website was developed for use in ICUs. It was launched as \"CARE-ICU\" in 2005. Antibiotics to which &gt;90% of isolates of a species were susceptible were defined as treatment alternatives (TA90) which is a novel index of susceptibility to measure the magnitude of MDR. Thirty four ICUs in 8 countries participated in the large pilot during 2005. The median yearly admissions and admission days were 551 and 2595 respectively. There were four important main findings in this first report from CARE-ICU. First, antibiotic consumption varied widely from 348 to 4992 DDD1000 with a relatively high median consumption of 1254 DDD1000. Second, levels of antibiotic resistance was very high in many settings but varied also greatly between species, ICUs and countries and the finding that more than half of all participating ICUs had no or only one treatment alternative (TA90) for P. aeruginosa with at least 90% susceptibility to aminoglycoside, ceftazidime, ciprofloxacin and carbapenem was alarming. Third, there was a lack of rooms for isolation precautions and cohort care for patients colonised or infected with alert organism. Four, antibiotic guidelines including routines for discontinuation of antibiotics, was available in some of the high antibiotic consuming ICUs but with low compliance which shows the need for more effective tools for change of prescription behaviour and a sustainable surveillance of compliance to guidelines in general."],"title":["Building resilience against biological hazards and pandemics:
