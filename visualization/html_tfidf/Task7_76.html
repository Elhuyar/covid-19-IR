In order to take advantage of these developments it is important to be able to identify disease markers. Many new high-throughput genomics and proteomics technologies are being implemented to identify candidate disease markers. These technologies include protein microarrays, next-generation DNA sequencing and mass spectrometry platforms. Such methods are particularly important for elucidating the repertoire of molecular markers in the genome, transcriptome, proteome and metabolome of patients with diseases such as cancer, autoimmune diseases, and viral infections, resulting from the disruption of many biological pathways. These new technologies have identified many potential disease markers. These markers are expected to be valuable to achieve the promise of truly personalized medicine.","The outbreak of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in Wuhan, December 2019, and continuously poses a serious threat to public health. Our previous study has shown that cytokine storm occurred during SARS-CoV-2 infection, while the detailed role of cytokines in the disease severity and progression remained unclear due to the limited case number. In this study, we examined 48 cytokines in the plasma samples from 53 COVID-19 cases, among whom 34 were severe cases, and the others moderate. Results showed that 14 cytokines were significantly elevated upon admission in COVID-19 cases. Moreover, IP-10, MCP-3, and IL-1ra were significantly higher in severe cases, and highly associated with the PaO2/FaO2 and Murray score. Furthermore, the three cytokines were independent predictors for the progression of COVID-19, and the combination of IP-10, MCP-3 and IL-1ra showed the biggest area under the curve (AUC) of the...","Abstract On the Internet, there is a lot of open access information related to infectious diseases, e.g., official announcement, media news, bulletin boards, blogs, and other social media. If proper data retrieval and screening methods were applied on these Internet-based data, it would be very useful to improve the timeliness of early detection for infectious diseases. In China, we practice early warning using Internet-based data with routine intelligence screening assessment every day, and respond to any unusual event in a timely manner. Through this mechanism, the surveillance and early warning of Internet-based data for infectious disease and public health emergency plays an important supplemental role to the traditional surveillance systems.","AbstractIn 2015, the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) reached the Republic of Korea through nosocomial transmission and was the largest epidemic outside of the Arabian Peninsula. To date, despite various strategies to identify CoV interventions, only limited therapeutic options are available. To address these unmet medical needs, we used a South Korean MERS-CoV clinical isolate and screened 5,406 compounds, including United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drugs and bioactive molecules, for their activity against the isolate. The primary assay confirmed 221 hits by dose-response curve analysis and identified 54 hits with a therapeutic index (TI) greater than 6. Time-of-addition studies with 12 FDA-approved drugs demonstrated that 8 and 4 therapeutics act on the early and late stages of the viral life cycle, respectively. Among the drugs were e.g., three cardiotonic agents (ouabain, digitoxin, digoxin) with a TI greater than 100, an anti-malaria ...","Abstract There are many diseases for which a microbial aetiology is suspected. The hypothesis that a disease has an infectious cause is supported by: clinical features (similar to those of known infectious diseases, e.g. fever, leucocytosis), epidemiology (case clustering in time or location), histology (inflammation of affected tissues, e.g. granulomata) or characteristic microbial structures, treatment (clinical response to antimicrobial treatment), and prevention of disease by vaccines targeting microbial antigens. Proof that a microbe causes a disease requires more rigorous evidence. Future attempts to identify novel microbes associated with human disease may use sequence-based approaches. High-throughput sequencing may allow identification of unique microbial nucleic acid sequences in a background of host DNA. The complete sequencing of the human genome and multiple microbial genomes make this approach more feasible. DNA microarrays are also likely to be used in the search for nov...","","A newly identified novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) is causing pneumonia-associated respiratory syndrome across the world. Epidemiology, genomics, and pathogenesis of the SARS-CoV-2 show high homology with that of SARS-CoV. Current efforts are focusing on development of specific antiviral drugs. Therapeutic neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) against SARS-CoV-2 will be greatly important therapeutic agents for the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Herein, the host immune responses against SARS-CoV discussed in this review provide implications for developing NAbs and understanding clinical interventions against SARS-CoV-2. Further, we describe the benefits, challenges and considerations of NAbs against SARS-CoV-2. Although many challenges exist, NAbs still offer a therapeutic option to control the current pandemic and the possible re-emergence of the virus in the future, and their development therefore remains a high priority.","Pathogenesis of sepsis includes complex interaction between pathogen activities and host response, manifesting highly variable signs and symptoms, possibly delaying diagnosis and timely life-saving interventions. This study applies traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) Zheng diagnosis in patients with severe sepsis and septic shock to evaluate its adaptability and use as an early predictor of sepsis mortality. Three-year prospective observational study enrolled 126 septic patients. TCM Zheng diagnosis, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II score, and blood samples for host response cytokines measurement (tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1, Interleukin-6, Interleukin-8, Interleukin-10, Interleukin-18) were collected within 24 hours after admission to Intensive Care Unit. Main outcome was 28-day mortality; multivariate logistic regression analysis served to determine predictive variables of the sepsis mortality. APACHE II score, frequency of Nutrient-phase heat, and Qi-Xu and Yang...","Abstract Molecular analysis of respiratory viruses and the host response to both infection and vaccination have transformed our understanding of these ubiquitous pathogens. Polymerase chain reaction for the rapid and accurate diagnosis of viral infections has led to a better understanding of the epidemiology and impact of many common respiratory viruses and resulted in better patient care. Over the past decade a number of new respiratory viruses including human metapneumovirus and new coronaviruses have been discovered using molecular techniques such as random primer amplification, pan-viral array and next generation sequencing. Analysis of the host transcriptional response during respiratory viral infection using in-vitro, animal models and natural and experimental human challenge have furthered the understanding of the mechanisms and predictors of severe disease and may identify potential therapeutic targets to prevent and ameliorate illness.","Deletion of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) envelope (E) gene attenuates the virus. E gene encodes a small multifunctional protein that possesses ion channel (IC) activity, an important function in virus-host interaction. To test the contribution of E protein IC activity in virus pathogenesis, two recombinant mouse-adapted SARS-CoVs, each containing one single amino acid mutation that suppressed ion conductivity, were engineered. After serial infections, mutant viruses, in general, incorporated compensatory mutations within E gene that rendered active ion channels. Furthermore, IC activity conferred better fitness in competition assays, suggesting that ion conductivity represents an advantage for the virus. Interestingly, mice infected with viruses displaying E protein IC activity, either with the wild-type E protein sequence or with the revertants that restored ion transport, rapidly lost weight and died. In contrast, mice infected with mutants lacking IC acti...","Background. Administration of convalescent plasma may be of clinical benefit for treatment of severe acute viral respiratory infections. However, no clear evidence exists to support or oppose convalescent plasma use in clinical practice. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the evidence of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in the convalescent plasma for the treatment of severe influenza. Methods. Healthcare databases were searched in February 2020. All records were screened against the eligibility criteria. Data extraction and risk of bias assessments were undertaken. The primary outcome was case fatality rates by influenza. Results. We identified 5 RCTs of severe influenza. The pooled analyses showed no evidence for a reduction in mortality (Odds Ratio (OR) 1.06; p = 0.87; I2 = 35%). We also found non significant reductions in days in ICU and hospital, and days on mechanical ventilation. There seemed to have a biological benefit of increasing HAI titer levels...","Publisher Summary Proteomics is a promising approach for the study of viruses allowing a better understanding of disease processes and the development of new biomarkers for diagnosis and early detection of disease, thus accelerating drug development. Viral proteomics has included the analysis of viral particles to determine all proteins that compose the infectious virus, the examination of cellular proteins associated with a single viral protein in the hopes of determining all the functions of that viral protein, or the determination of cellular proteins induced or altered during a particular disease state. Viral particles of human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) and Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus/human herpesvirus 8 (KSHV/HHV-8) have been recently examined. During the herpesviral replicative cycle, different viral particles are formed. For HCMV, this includes mature, infectious virions, noninfectious enveloped particles, and dense bodies. A proteome database of B-lymphoblastoid cell l...","ABSTRACT In December 2019, a novel coronavirus, named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), emerged from China causing pneumonia outbreaks, first in the Wuhan region of China and then spread worldwide because of its probable high transmission efficiency. Owing to the lack of efficient and specific treatments and the need to contain the epidemic, drug repurposing appears to be the best tool to find a therapeutic solution. Chloroquine, remdesivir, lopinavir, ribavirin and ritonavir have shown efficacy to inhibit coronavirus in vitro. Teicoplanin, an antibiotic used to treat staphylococcal infections, previously showed efficacy to inhibit the first stage of the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) viral life cycle in human cells. This activity is conserved against SARS-Cov-2, thus placing teicoplanin as a potential treatment for patients with this virus.","Predicting vaccine efficacy remains a challenge. We used a systems vaccinology approach to identify early innate immune correlates of antibody induction in humans receiving the Ebola vaccine rVSV-ZEBOV. Blood samples from days 0, 1, 3, 7, and 14 were analyzed for changes in cytokine levels, innate immune cell subsets, and gene expression. Integrative statistical analyses with cross-validation identified a signature of 5 early innate markers correlating with antibody titers on day 28 and beyond. Among those, IP-10 on day 3 and MFI of CXCR6 on NK cells on day 1 were independent correlates. Consistently, we found an early gene expression signature linked to IP-10. This comprehensive characterization of early innate immune responses to the rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine in humans revealed immune signatures linked to IP-10. These results suggest correlates of vaccine-induced antibody induction and provide a rationale to explore strategies for augmenting the effectiveness of vaccines through manipulatio...","DNA microarrays may be used to identify microbial species present in environmental and clinical samples. However, automated tools for reliable species identification based on observed microarray hybridization patterns are lacking. We present an algorithm, E-Predict, for microarray-based species identification. E-Predict compares observed hybridization patterns with theoretical energy profiles representing different species. We demonstrate the application of the algorithm to viral detection in a set of clinical samples and discuss its relevance to other metagenomic applications.","Viral infections are common causes of respiratory tract disease in the outpatient setting but much less common in the intensive care unit. However, a finite number of viral agents cause respiratory tract disease in the intensive care unit. Some viruses, such as influenza, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), cytomegalovirus (CMV), and varicella-zoster virus (VZV), are relatively common. Others, such as adenovirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-coronavirus, Hantavirus, and the viral hemorrhagic fevers (VHFs), are rare but have an immense public health impact. Recognizing these viral etiologies becomes paramount in treatment, infection control, and public health measures. Therefore, a basic understanding of the pathogenesis of viral entry, replication, and host response is important for clinical diagnosis and initiating therapeutic options. This review discusses the basic pathophysiology leading to clinical presentations in a few common and rare, but important, viruses found in ...","We plotted daily data on the frequencies of keywords related to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) from WeChat, a Chinese social media. Using 'Feidian', Chinese abbreviation for SARS, may detect the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in 2019 two weeks earlier. WeChat offered a new approach to early detect disease outbreaks.","Exotic and emerging viral pathogens associated with high morbidity and mortality in humans are being identified annually with recent examples including Lujo virus in southern Africa, Severe Fever with Thrombocytopenia Syndrome virus in China and a SARS-like coronavirus in the Middle East. The sporadic nature of these infections hampers our understanding of these diseases and limits the opportunities to design appropriate medical countermeasures against them. Because of this, animal models are utilized to gain insight into the pathogenesis of disease with the overall goal of identifying potential targets for intervention and evaluating specific therapeutics and vaccines. For these reasons it is imperative that animal models of disease recapitulate the human condition as closely as possible in order to provide the best predictive data with respect to the potential efficacy in humans. In this article we review the current status of disease models for highly pathogenic and emerging viral p...","","Abstract: Objective: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an escalating global epidemic caused by SARS-CoV-2, with a high mortality in critical patients. Effective indicators for predicting disease severity in SARS-CoV-2 infected patients are urgently needed. Methods: In this study, 43 COVID-19 patients admitted in Chongqing Public Health Medical Center were involved. Demographic data, clinical features, and laboratory examinations were obtained through electronic medical records. Peripheral blood specimens were collected from COVID-19 patients and examined for lymphocyte subsets and cytokine profiles by flow cytometry. Potential contributing factors for prediction of disease severity were further analyzed. Results: A total of 43 COVID-19 patients were included in this study, including 29 mild patients and 14 sever patients. Severe patients were significantly older (61.9+/-9.4 vs 44.4+/-15.9) and had higher incidence in co-infection with bacteria compared to mild group (85.7%vs27.6%)...","Background: Community responses are important for outbreak management during the early phase when non-pharmaceutical interventions are the major preventive options. Therefore, this study aims to examine the psychological and behavioral responses of the community during the early phase of the COVID-19 epidemic in Hong Kong. Method: A cross-sectional online survey was launched within 36 hours after confirmed COVID-19 cases were first reported. Councilors of all 452 district council constituency areas were approached for survey dissemination. Respondent demographics, anxiety level, risk perception, sources to retrieve COVID-19 information, actual adoption and perceived efficacy of precautionary measures were collected. Result: Analysis from 1715 complete responses indicated high perceived susceptibility (89%) and high perceived severity (97%). Most respondents were worried about COVID-19 (97%), and had their daily routines disrupted (slightly/greatly: 98%). The anxiety level, measured by ...","There is a high mortality and long hospitalization period for severe cases with 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pneumonia. Therefore, it makes sense to search for a potential biomarker that could rapidly and effectively identify severe cases early. Clinical samples from 28 cases of COVID-19 (8 severe cases, 20 mild cases) in Zunyi District from January 29, 2020 to February 21, 2020 were collected and otherwise statistically analysed for biochemical markers. Serum urea, creatinine (CREA) and cystatin C (CysC) concentrations in severe COVID-19 patients were significantly higher than those in mild COVID-19 patients (P&lt;0.001), and there were also significant differences in serum direct bilirubin (DBIL), cholinesterase (CHE) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) concentrations between severe and mild COVID-19 patients (P&lt;0.05). Serum urea, CREA, CysC, DBIL, CHE and LDH could be used to distinguish severe COVID-19 cases from mild COVID-19 cases. In particular, serum biomarkers, including...","Background: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a worldwide pandemic since mid-December 2019, which greatly challenge public medical systems. With limited medical resources, it is a natural strategy, while adopted, to access the severity of patients then determine the treatment priority. However, our work observes the fact that the condition of many mild outpatients quickly worsens in a short time, i.e. deteriorate into severe/critical cases. Hence, it has been crucial to early identify those cases and give timely treatment for optimizing treatment strategy and reducing mortality. This study aims to establish an AI model to predict mild patients with potential malignant progression. Methods: A total of 133 consecutively mild COVID-19 patients at admission who was hospitalized in Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital from January 3 to February 13, 2020, were selected in this retrospective IRB-approved study. All mild patients at admission were categorized into groups with or without m...","Abstract Management researchers and management practitioners increasingly appear to be talking past each other. A solution lies in understanding that interactive management education has an important role to play in bridging this divide, but for some reason this mode of academic exchange is often forgotten. Our paper broadens the stakeholder value perspective to explore how and why the interests of researchers and practitioners have diverged, before going on to present illustrative cases of programs attempting to bridge such differences. Current conditions suggest that the dissonance between different cycle-times of research and practice is not sustainable with the inevitable outcome of a shrinking commons. Generating new knowledge and propagating it rapidly through education and teaching-practice is an important way of disseminating higher-order research and findings. In a world where academic relevance is under threat, enabling academics to better cross such a divide is critical. Mar...","Abstract As the global COVID-19 pandemic escalates there is a need within radiation oncology to work to support our patients in the best way possible. Measures are required to reduce infection spread between patients and within the workforce. Departments need contingency planning to create capacity and continue essential treatments despite a reduced workforce. The #radonc community held an urgent online journal club in March 2020 to discuss these issues and create some consensus on urgent next steps. There were 121 global contributors. This document summarises these discussions around themes of infection prevention, rationalisation of workload and working practice in the presence of infection","Viruses are evolving at an alarming rate, spreading and inconspicuously adapting to cutting-edge therapies. Therefore, the search for rapid, informative and reliable diagnostic methods is becoming urgent as ever. Conventional clinical tests (PCR, serology, etc.) are being continually optimized, yet provide very limited data. Could high throughput sequencing (HTS) become the future gold standard in molecular diagnostics of viral infections? Compared to conventional clinical tests, HTS is universal and more precise at profiling pathogens. Nevertheless, it has not yet been widely accepted as a diagnostic tool, owing primarily to its high cost and the complexity of sample preparation and data analysis. Those obstacles must be tackled to integrate HTS into daily clinical practice. For this, three objectives are to be achieved: (1) designing and assessing universal protocols for library preparation, (2) assembling purpose-specific pipelines, and (3) building computational infrastructure to s...","Rapid diagnostics, vaccines and therapeutics are important interventions for the management of the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak. It is timely to systematically review the potential of these interventions, including those for Middle East respiratory syndrome-Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV, to guide policymakers globally on their prioritization of resources for research and development. A systematic search was carried out in three major electronic databases (PubMed, Embase and Cochrane Library) to identify published studies in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Supplementary strategies through Google Search and personal communications were used. A total of 27 studies fulfilled the criteria for review. Several laboratory protocols for confirmation of suspected 2019-nCoV cases using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) have been publ...","Abstract To investigate the ocular manifestations of patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and to monitor the possible ocular complications arising from the treatment regimen with high-dose systemic corticosteroid drugs. Design Prospective, observational cohort case series. Methods Ninety eyes from 45 patients with the diagnosis of SARS during an epidemic outbreak in Hong Kong were analyzed. Relevant medical and ophthalmic histories were taken. Ophthalmic examinations, including best-corrected visual acuity, intraocular pressure, slit-lamp, and indirect ophthalmoscopy examination, were performed at baseline and at 2-month and 3-month follow-up. Setting Faculty practice in university hospital. Results Only two patients had mild elevated intraocular pressure at baseline and at subsequent follow-up. There was no loss of visual acuity, cataract progression, or increased cup\u2013disk ratio. Fundus examinations were unremarkable in all patients. Conclusions Our study did not dem...","Abstract A novel coronavirus designated as 2019-nCoV first appeared in Wuhan, China in late December 2019. Dozens of people died in China, and thousands of people infected as 2019-nCoV continues to spread around the world. We have described the discovery, emergence, genomic characteristics, and clinical diagnostics of 2019-nCoV.","Coronavirus disease is an emerging infection caused by a novel coronavirus that is moving rapidly. High resolution computed tomography (CT) allows objective evaluation of the lung lesions, thus enabling us to better understand the pathogenesis of the disease. With serial CT examinations, the occurrence, development, and prognosis of the disease can be better understood. The imaging can be sorted into four phases: early phase, progressive phase, severe phase, and dissipative phase. The CT appearance of each phase and temporal progression of the imaging findings are demonstrated.","This year marks the 15th anniversary of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in Canada and the 100th anniversary of the 1918 Spanish influenza pandemic. These, and other recent public health events, provide an opportunity for us to review and reflect on the evolution of Canada\u2019s public health emergency response over the past 15 years\u2014from SARS, to the 2009 H1N1 pandemic influenza, to Ebola virus and Zika virus disease. Key lessons have been learned and milestones achieved that have shaped and sharpened our response approach and structures. While SARS was a wake-up-call to strengthen infection prevention and control capacity in health care settings and led to the formation of the Public Health Agency of Canada, it also strengthened our Federal/Provincial/Territorial (FPT) senior-level governance and led to agreements for pan-Canadian mutual aid and infectious disease information sharing. As well, our collective public health laboratory capacity has been strengthened through ongoing ...","Abstract To accomplish the goals of successful management practice, what\u2019s important has to be determined. This chapter looks at the evolution of security as a management activity. The growth of services, products, and systems is provided. Most important security threats are presented.","Coronaviruses (CoVs) are a group of enveloped, single-stranded positive genomic RNA viruses and some of them are known to cause severe respiratory diseases in human, including Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and the ongoing coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19). One key element in viral infection is the process of viral entry into the host cells. In the last two decades, there is increasing understanding on the importance of the endocytic pathway and the autophagy process in viral entry and replication. As a result, the endocytic pathway including endosome and lysosome has become important targets for development of therapeutic strategies in combating diseases caused by CoVs. In this mini-review, we will focus on the importance of the endocytic pathway as well as the autophagy process in viral infection of several pathogenic CoVs inclusive of SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and the new CoV named as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-C...","MERS-CoV infection is an emerging infectious disease with a high mortality rate. The exact incidence and prevalence of the disease is not known as we do not have yet reliable serologic tests. The diagnosis of MERS-CoV infection relies on detection of the virus using real-time RT-PCR. Currently, the origin of the virus and the source is not known and future studies are needed to elucidate possible sources and the best therapeutic options.","","Background: To explore the cellular immunity and cytokines status of NCP patients and to predict the correlation between the cellular immunity levels, cytokines and the severity of patients. Methods: 123 NCP patients were divided into mild and severe groups. Peripheral blood was collected, lymphocyte subsets and cytokines were detected. Correlation analysis was performed on the lymphocyte subsets and cytokines, and the differences between the indexes of the two groups were analyzed. Results: 102 mild and 21 severe patients were included. Lymphocyte subsets were reduced in two groups. The proportion of CD8 + T reduction in the mild and severe group was 28.43% and 61.9%, respectively; The proportion of B cell reduction was 25.49% and 28.57%; The proportion of NK cell reduction was 34.31% and 47.62%; The detection value of IL-6 was 0 in 55.88% of the mild group, mild group has a significantly lower proportion of patients with IL-6 higher than normal than severe group; There was no signifi...","A recombinant severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) lacking the envelope (E) protein is attenuated in vivo. Here we report that E protein PDZ-binding motif (PBM), a domain involved in protein-protein interactions, is a major determinant of virulence. Elimination of SARS-CoV E protein PBM by using reverse genetics caused a reduction in the deleterious exacerbation of the immune response triggered during infection with the parental virus and virus attenuation. Cellular protein syntenin was identified to bind the E protein PBM during SARS-CoV infection by using three complementary strategies, yeast two-hybrid, reciprocal coimmunoprecipitation and confocal microscopy assays. Syntenin redistributed from the nucleus to the cell cytoplasm during infection with viruses containing the E protein PBM, activating p38 MAPK and leading to the overexpression of inflammatory cytokines. Silencing of syntenin using siRNAs led to a decrease in p38 MAPK activation in SARS-CoV infected c...","","Public health professionals are considering how molecular medicine applications can impact on preventive medicine and health provision enabling interventions to start earlier. There is the potential for molecular medicine to improve the workplace although inappropriate use will lead to discrimination. The public health issue of communicable diseases is being addressed through molecular medicine in more effective and early detection and a better understanding of pathogenesis. A threat from emerging and re-emerging infections requires multiple approaches but early and definitive detection will need nucleic acid based approaches. The non-communicable diseases are now a global world problem, particularly obesity. While molecular medicine is still to make a significant impact on this disorder some interesting findings are emerging about the role of genes in obesity. Ultimately, global health issues must include more efficient and environmentally sustainable strategies. Molecular technologie...","Zoonotic viruses that emerge from wildlife and domesticated animals pose a serious threat to human and animal health. In many instances, mouse models have improved our understanding of the human immune response to infection; however, when dealing with emerging zoonotic diseases, they may be of limited use. This is particularly the case when the model fails to reproduce the disease status that is seen in the natural reservoir, transmission species or human host. In this Review, we discuss how researchers are placing more emphasis on the study of the immune response to zoonotic infections in the natural reservoir hosts and spillover species. Such studies will not only lead to a greater understanding of how these infections induce variable disease and immune responses in distinct species but also offer important insights into the evolution of mammalian immune systems. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The online version of this article (doi:10.1038/nri3551) contains supplementary material, which...","","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a respiratory disorder caused by the highly contagious SARS-CoV-2. The immunopathological characteristics of COVID-19 patients, either systemic or local, have not been thoroughly studied. In the present study, we analyzed both the changes in the cellularity of various immune cell types as well as cytokines important for immune reactions and inflammation. Our data indicate that patients with severe COVID-19 exhibited an overall decline of lymphocytes including CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, B cells, and NK cells. The number of immunosuppressive regulatory T cells was moderately increased in patients with mild COVID-19. IL-2, IL-6, and IL-10 were remarkably up-regulated in patients with severe COVID-19. The levels of IL-2 and IL-6 relative to the length of hospital stay underwent a similar \"rise-decline\" pattern, probably reflecting the therapeutic effect. In conclusion, our study shows that the comprehensive decrease of lymphocytes, and the elevation of IL...","The observations that Lymphopenia is common in severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) patients and that peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) could be infected by SARS-CoV indicate that PBMC could be useful in identifying the gene expression profile in convalescent patients and tracing the host response to SARS-CoV infection. In this study, the altered genes expressions in the PBMC of convalescent SARS patients were investigated with suppression subtractive hybridization (SSH). We found that genes encoded by mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) were obviously upregulated, while mitochondria were now found to be closely connected with antiviral immunity. The identification of a viral gene, M, in SSH cDNA library shows the long-term existence of SARS-CoV in vivo. In addition, some oxidative stress sensitive genes, heat shock proteins, transcription factors, and cytokines showed remarkable elevation. Thin-section electron microscope shows increased lysosome-like granule and mitochondria in PBMC...","","Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV, is an acute infectious disease with significant mortality. A typical clinical feature associated with SARS is pulmonary fibrosis and associated lung failure. In the aftermath of the SARS epidemic, although significant progress towards understanding the underlying molecular mechanism of the infection has been made, a large gap still remains in our knowledge regarding how SARS-CoV interacts with the host cell at the onset of infection. The rapidly changing viral genome adds another variable to this equation. We have focused on a novel concept of microRNA (miRNA)\u2013mediated host\u2013virus interactions in bronchoalveolar stem cells (BASCs) at the onset of infection by correlating the \u201cBASC\u2013microRNome\u201d with their targets within BASCs and viral genome. This work encompasses miRNA array data analysis, target prediction, and miRNA\u2013mRNA enrichment analysis and develops a complex interaction map among disease-related factors...","Respiratory viruses have emerged and re-emerged in humans for hundreds of years. In the recent past avian and animal influenza viruses have caused human disease ranging from conjunctivitis to respiratory illnesses, including the 2009\u201310 A(H1N1)pdm09 pandemic. Coronaviruses, human metapneumovirus (hMPV) and enteroviruses have also impacted humans globally. Since the likely public health impacts are common, plans and policies for intervention strategies can be developed, encompassing early detection through surveillance and diagnostics, as well as treatment and prevention through clinical and non-clinical interventions. The global comprehensiveness of these varies according to differing resources, competing health priorities and the causative agent, yet, irrespective of this, activities must be proportional to the threat. Pandemics and severe epidemics enable policies to be tested and gaps identified.","Abstract Antibodies to SARS-Coronavirus (SARS-CoV)-specific B cell epitopes might recognize the pathogen and interrupt its adherence to and penetration of host cells. Hence, these epitopes could be useful for diagnosis and as vaccine constituents. Using the phage-displayed peptide library screening method and purified Fab fragments of immunoglobulin G (IgG Fab) from normal human sera and convalescent sera from SARS-CoV-infected patients as targets, 11 B cell epitopes of SARS-CoV spike glycoprotein (S protein) and membrane protein (M protein) were screened. After a bioinformatics tool was used to analyze these epitopes, four epitope-based S protein dodecapeptides corresponding to the predominant epitopes were chosen for synthesis. Their antigenic specificities and immunogenicities were studied in vitro and in vivo. Flow cytometry and ELISPOT analysis of lymphocytes as well as a serologic analysis of antibody showed that these peptides could trigger a rapid, highly effective, and relativ...","Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is an emerging infectious viral disease characterized by severe clinical manifestations of the lower respiratory tract. The pathogenesis of SARS is highly complex, with multiple factors leading to severe injury in the lungs and dissemination of the virus to several other organs. The SARS coronavirus targets the epithelial cells of the respiratory tract, resulting in diffuse alveolar damage. Several organs/cell types may be infected in the course of the illness, including mucosal cells of the intestines, tubular epithelial cells of the kidneys, neurons of the brain, and several types of immune cells, and certain organs may suffer from indirect injury. Extensive studies have provided a basic understanding of the pathogenesis of this disease. In this review we describe the most significant pathological features of SARS, explore the etiological factors causing these pathological changes, and discuss the major pathogenetic mechanisms. The latter incl...","Abstract Bronchiolitis is the number one cause of hospitalization in infants during the first year of life. Clinical guidelines recommend primarily supportive care and discourage use of pharmacotherapies and diagnostics. However, there continues to be widespread use of non-recommended therapies and variation in the use of therapeutic interventions among hospitals in the United States. Here we review evidence-based management of this common disease in order to optimize resource utilization, decrease healthcare costs, and decrease unnecessary hospitalization. Current evidence does not support the routine use of chest radiographs, viral testing or laboratory evaluation in children with bronchiolitis. In addition, routine administration of bronchodilators, including albuterol and nebulized epinephrine, corticosteroids and hypertonic saline are not recommended for infants and children with bronchiolitis. Intravenous or nasogastric hydration and nutritional support, supplemental oxygen, and ...","With the spread of novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) pneumonia, chest high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) has been one of the key diagnostic tools. To achieve early and accurate diagnostics, determining the radiological characteristics of the disease is of great importance. In this small scale research we retrospectively reviewed and selected six cases confirmed with 2019-nCoV infection in West China Hospital and investigated their initial and follow-up HRCT features, along with the clinical characteristics. The 2019-nCoV pneumonia basically showed a multifocal or unifocal involvement of ground-glass opacity (GGO), sometimes with consolidation and fibrosis. No pleural effusion or lymphadenopathy was identified in our presented cased. The follow-up CT generally demonstrated mild to moderate progression of the lesion, with only one case showing remission by the reducing extent and density of the airspace

The application of potent antiviral treatments to prevent the progression to T cell exhaustion in susceptible patients may thus be critical to their recovery. We have read with great interest the successful application of Remdesivir to curing a COVID-19 patient in the US, and to clinical trials indicates that it may have significant potential as such an antiviral. 35, 36 Taken together, we conclude that T cells are decreased and exhausted in patients with COVID-19. Cytokines such as IL-10, IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 might directly mediate T cell reduction. Thus, new therapeutic measures are needed for treatment of ICU patients, and may even be necessary early on to preempt disease progression in higher-risk patients with low T cell counts.","Proteomic analysis has provided a unique tool for the identification of diagnostic biomarkers, evaluation of disease progression, and drug development [93, 94] . It is also an important approach for clinical diagnostics. In fact, early diagnosis of disease could be possible through the use of unique protein profiles, consisting of a panel of biomarkers that serves as a surrogate marker of disease. Novel diagnostic tests may be generated through proteomic discoveries, and many more proteins can be identified as potential drug targets. These biomarkers are likely to serve multiple purposes, including the assessment of drug efficacy and drug toxicity, and diagnosis. We will review the various methodologies used for viral diagnostics and discuss the advantages and disadvantages of each technique.","the role of CT to predict disease progression in patients with NCP. Previous study showed that the MuLBSTA score can early warn the mortality of viral pneumonia, which included lymphopenia and multilobe infiltration. 22 Our findings were consistent with theirs but more quantitatively in terms of imaging evaluation of lung involvement. Like SARS and MERS, some NCP patients progressed rapidly at about 10-14 days after onset likely dues to the cytokine storm in the body as evidenced by increased plasma proinflammatory cytokines. 11, 23 Our results further revealed the significant association between inflammatory markers and CT characteristics, especially for C-reactive protein and CT severity score, which indicated the potential value of CT to estimate pulmonary inflammation and lung damage. Furthermore, the predictive significance of NLR and CT severity score was confirmed only in nonimported patients outside Wuhan. Among the imported patients from Wuhan, the elder had higher risk to develop severe illness. However, the reason for this discrepancy between imported and nonimported patients remains to be elucidated.","Current methods for the diagnosis of HCC rely on serological markers such as \u2423-fetoprotein (AFP) [97] and certain liver enzymes as well as Des gamma carboxyprothrombin (DCP) [98] . This type of diagnosis lacks the sensitivity to detect HCC at an early stage when therapy can be more effective. To find markers of disease progression, 2DE was employed to resolve and compare proteins present in serum obtained from individuals infected with HBV or HCV and with varying risks for the development of HCC [99, 100] . In several studies, proteins expressed at different levels among diseased individuals as compared to those of healthy ones were identified as markers for disease progression as well as proteins with different N-glycosylation patterns [99] [100] [101] . In another study, 2D-MS was also employed to analyze altered plasma proteins due to SARS-CoV infection. Thirtyeight different plasma proteins from SARS patients were identified, most of which were associated with acute phase proteins [23] .","In conclusion, this study provides a correlation between clinical parameters and disease severity of COVID-19 patients. Our study of mild and severe patients demonstrates that these clinical parameters, including ESR, D-D, age, ALB and IL6 are closely related with the disease progression of COVID-19 patients. Among these parameters, ESR has the best performance and can be used as an effective indicator to predict the severity of disease. Our study may help to identify severe COVID-19 patients in early stage, in order to provide supportive treatment and reduce the mortality.","Patients with severe sepsis show substantial abnormalities in several biomarkers of inflammation and coagulation. These abnormalities have been inconsistently correlated with syndrome severity, because of both a major heterogeneity in the sources of infections (lung, abdomen, urine, . . . ) and variability in causative microorganisms. Communityacquired pneumonia (CAP) is the most common cause of communityacquired severe sepsis in ICU, and represents a well characterised disease with protocolised treatments. Hence, analysis of biomarkers in this homogeneous population may be important to define disease severity and candidates for new therapeutic approaches. Subgroup analysis of results from the OPTIMIST study of tifacogin in severe sepsis patients revealed a decrease in mortality in sCAP patients treated with tifacogin who had a documented microbiological infection and who were not concurrently treated with heparin. A trend toward reduced mortality was also seen in sCAP patients with procalcitonin 2 ng/mL (Laterre et al, Critical Care, submitted) and in the overall severe sepsis population with evidence of active coagulation (PF 3nM) at baseline (Opal et al. IDSA 2004) who were treated with tifacogin. These results warranted further investigation, and led to the initiation of the CAPTIVATE study of tifacogin in 2100 patients with sCAP. Moreover, resolution of the human genome has led to the discovery of new genomics biomarkers associated with sCAP mortality. It is hoped that by investigating both genomics markers and \"classic\" biomarker level changes over the clinical course of the disease, that it will be possible in the future to predict which patients are at potential risk of decompensation, and which patients are most likely to benefit from early treatment such as tifacogin. Candida albicans is the main species associated with OPC but nonalbicans are increasing, while mutiresistant Candida albicans and nonalbicans strains have emerged. These changes are a consequence of long term prescriptions of narrow spectrum antifungal agents and repeated prescriptions of oral systemic antifungal agents. Moreover, in this heavily treated immunocompromised population, it is important to limit the potential for drug-drug interactions. Therefore, national and international guidelines have been issued and recommend using a local antifungal therapy with a spectrum extended to all Candida species as first line treatment of OPC. In clinical practice, the treatment compliance of the immunocompromised patients represents a challenge and should be favoured by a local antifungal agent easy to use. ","The primary pathology observed at autopsy of patients that succumbed to infection was diffuse alveolar damage Franks et al., 2003; Hwang et al., 2005; Nicholls et al., 2003) . The lungs of patients that died in the early phases of the disease contained hyaline membranes, edema, fibrin exudates, small vessel thrombi, loss and sloughing of pneumocytes, and a mixed cellular infiltrate of lymphocytes, macrophages, and polymorphonuclear leukocytes. Multinucleated giant cells that carried markers for macrophages and pneumocytes were frequently present. At later phases of the disease, a histologic picture of an organizing pneumonitis and consolidation, with type II pneumocyte hyperplasia, squamous metaplasia, and bronchiolitis obilterans, was found. The association of worsening clinical progression with declining virus loads and the onset of an immunological response, plus the presence of markedly elevated cytokines levels suggested that severe lung damage was largely immunopathological in nature (Beijing Group of National Research Project for SARS, 2003; Cameron et al., 2007; He et al., 2006; Nicholls et al., 2003; Peiris et al., 2003a; Wong et al., 2004a) .","progression. Combinations of the three cytokines showed the highest AUC of 0.943, of IP-10 and IL-1ra (0.923) ( Figure 3 ). Furthermore, we analyzed the serial change of improvement of the disease, and became moderate cases (cases 4, 10, 12 and 14) or 1 2 5 discharged from hospital (cases 3, 5, 6 and 10). These results indicated that these 1 2 6 three cytokines could be considered as biomarkers to predict disease progression and 1 2 7 outcome of SARS-CoV-2 infections.","RSV is highly infectious and nearly all children have serological evidence of infection by the end of their second year. It is not known why some infected infants develop severe disease, whereas the majority have mild symptoms. In response to infection, the host produces a complex mixture of cytokines and other inflammatory mediators with anti-viral but also potentially pathological properties. Various clinical and experimental observations indicate that certain patterns of host response are associated with severe disease, but it has been extremely difficult to prove that these are causal determinants, rather than just correlates, of clinical outcome. To better understand the association between clinical response to infection (phenotype) and specific genes, genetic association studies need to be done. Genetic association studies can be done using a genome approach or using candidate genes. It has been estimated that genomic approaches would require study of at least 200,000 markers in several thousand subjects, a project which would cost many millions of dollars. For this reason candidate gene approaches are used by most groups.","The final topic that will covered, albeit briefly, is the ethics of a control group. Assessment of vaccine efficacy is dependent upon being able to compare vaccine recipients to those receiving placebo. During the Ebola outbreak, late phase vaccine and therapeutic trials were complicated as to consensus of what constituted an adequate control arm against which to measure efficacy and whether it was ethical to even include a control arm [62] . The competing needs of therapeutic intervention versus proof of therapeutic efficacy stymied decision making. As one cannot predict efficacy a priori, the need to control for response related to vaccine is imperative. The compromise reached as part of the ring vaccination trial was to randomize primary cases into immediate versus delayed (by the 21 day incubation period for Ebola) groups. The study met study goals and was terminated early [3] .","For any outbreak, the faster the identification, the faster and more robust the response. BARDA is supporting work to improve diagnostics with the goal of recognizing illness before any symptoms develop. This may include wearable diagnostics or biosensors. The high mortality associated with human infections with novel coronaviruses MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV and avian influenza strains (influenza A(H5N1) and A(H7N9)) have raised questions about the possible role of a dysregulated immune response, a so called \"cytokine storm\", in the pathogenesis of severe respiratory disease. As some patients may not respond to typical anti-pathogen therapeutics (e.g. antivirals), BARDA is pursuing therapeutics which target the host in order to modify the immune/host response. More work needs to be done to identify these host targets and develop therapeutics towards the dysregulated immune response. The field also needs better diagnostics to guide treatment as over-suppression of the immune response can be just as dangerous as over-stimulation.","Methods to measure intestinal transit time include barium studies with and without food, ultrasonography (including pulsed Doppler measurements), breath hydrogen following carbohydrate administration, and using visual (e.g., carmine red dye, chromic oxide) or chemical markers that are excreted in the urine after absorption (e.g., sulfasalazine, acetaminophen, nitrofurantoin, PABA-UDCA). 19 Results are quite variable and often the methodologies do not correlate well as results are variable with both the composition of the test diet and stress affecting transit rates as much as disease. Intestinal transit is best studied with wireless motility capsule system and scintigraphy, but again the diet composition and stress affect the result. Measurement of myoelectrical activity either in vivo or in vitro is impractical in clinical practice.","In this study, we found enhanced IgM levels at early stage, and high levels were more frequently found in patients with severe disease. IgG levels increased at late stage, whereas high levels of IgG were frequently found in patients with severe disease. These results indicated that beside the antiviral efficacy, the antibody response might be associated with secondary antibody-mediated organ damage. Using NLR and IgG levels detected in sera at late stage, we develop a combined immune response phenotype, which could predict disease severity and the outcome of COVID-19 patient. To our knowledge, this is the first in the literatures to combine indicators from innate and acquired immunity to predict disease severity and outcome.","Rapid identification of the causative agents for HFMD, together with the pathogens responsible for co-infection, can help clinical management by focusing attention on the possible complications. It is also important with regards to predicting the severity of the outbreak and initiating appropriate public health interventions. The nucleotidebased RT-PCR methods have been developed and are now used in many clinical laboratories (de Crom et al., 2011 , Guney et al., 2003 , Watkins-Riedel et al., 2002 . Effective and accurate virological 6 . Inflammatory cytokines expression in mild and severe HFMD cases. Eight different cytokines were detected, and 7 cytokines were much higher in severe group than in mild group. As those cytokines to some extent represent the strength of immune response in HFMD, this result suggested the immune response in severe cases was enhanced.","Ovarian cancer is diagnosed at an advanced clinical stage -- when the ovarian cancer cells have metastasised from the ovary to the pelvis, peritoneal cavity or other distant sites -- in more than two-thirds of women [61]. The five-year survival rate for these late-stage patients is 35-40 per cent, despite the best possible surgical and chemotherapeutic treatment. If, however, ovarian cancer is detected while it is still confined to the ovary (stage I) and treated appropriately, the five-year survival rate is optimistic (95 per cent). Unfortunately, early-stage ovarian cancer is difficult to detect because patients are frequently asymptomatic and few reliable tumour markers exist. Thus, the development of dependable serum markers for the early detection of ovarian cancer would improve the survival rate of women facing this disease. At the NCI-FDA Clinical Proteomics Program, a proteomics approach is being used for the early detection of a variety of cancers, as well as non-neoplastic diseases such as infectious diseases, autoimmune diseases, vascular diseases, prenatal diagnosis and transplantation rejection [44,62]. Several clinical trials are being planned, including the first of its kind for ovarian cancer. The identification of specific and sensitive molecular markers for epithelial ovarian cancer is a priority of the NCI-FDA Clinical Proteomics Program (Table 2), and this proposed trial has the potential to develop the first reliable screening test for ovarian cancer, if the protein signature that was identified in a preliminary study of women with a high risk of developing the disease can be applied to screening women in the general population.","ARDS progression involves the production of TNF, another early response cytokine, and IL-6, which exerts its function in a more sustained manner accumulating during the disease [63]. We found that after SARS-CoV infection, these patterns of cytokine expression were clearly reproduced. TNF and IL-6 accumulated to higher levels in the lungs of animals infected with the wt virus displaying IC activity compared to the mutant lacking ion conductivity. IL-1\u03b2 enhances the production of TNF, and IL-6 is stimulated by both cytokines providing an integrated amplified inflammatory response, detrimental for pulmonary function [63]. Elevated amounts of these cytokines have been reported in bronchoalveolar lavages of SARS-CoV patients [79]. Therefore, the enhanced amounts of active IL-1\u03b2 found in the animals infected with the wt virus may explain the increased levels of TNF and IL-6, which leads to severe pathology. It is important to note that the increased damage found in pulmonary epithelia infected with the virus displaying E protein IC activity may not be explained by a higher virus production, as suppression of E protein IC activity rendered similar growth in mice lungs during the analyzed time points. SARS-CoV early replication may be a relevant issue in the induction of pathology. We cannot exclude early replicative defects for the N15A mutant in mice, delaying virus growth during the first hours post-infection. Nevertheless, alternative explanations are also possible, as it has been described that some mutations at SARS-CoV S gene conferred increased virulence without affecting growth within mice, even at early times. This increased pathogenesis was mainly dependent on an exacerbated host response to the viral infection [74]. Accordingly, the enhanced inflammatory response triggered by E protein ion channel proficient viruses may be a major pathology inducer.","Currently, its application in CCP is garnering much attention [14,19\u201323]. Several clinical trials reported that conventional treatments combined with GLED exhibits more prominent therapeutic effects for CCP than conventional treatments alone [24\u201351]. However, the scientific evidence has not been systematically reviewed. In the present study, we conducted a meta-analysis to investigate the clinical efficacy and safety of GLED for CCP, in order to provide the best available evidence for clinical practice and further research planning on CCP treatment.","Regardless of the particular mechanism through which we attempt to characterize the 339 changes in diagnostic sensitivity and specificity, our results demonstrate (in both theory 340 and practice) how these dynamics may be incorporated into epidemiological modeling 341 efforts and how the results may translate into a more accurate understanding of infectious 342 disease dynamics. 343 344 Some studies have been able to assess the impact of public health announcement-or 345 media-driven behavioral change with regard to disease risk and diagnosis (e.g. (Sharma et 346 al. 2003) ). It is clear that we will need to develop better models that explicitly capture the 347 major factors that can effect change in public behavior regarding health care and 348 diagnosis. While it may be impossible to accurately assess the impact of behavioral 349 changes in health care seeking behavior for past epidemics, one possible course of action 350 going forwards would be to ask physicians, hospitals and laboratories to record and report 351 the number of tests performed in addition to merely the number of cases positively 352 diagnosed, regardless of acknowledge threat of outbreaks. 353 354 These models and insights may also be of critical use our collective ongoing efforts to 355 understand and predict the progression of COVID-19. Not only do we provide the 356 obvious alternations to the standard epidemic predictions for error rates in testing, we 357 also provide a mechanism by which to correct our understanding of 0 R based on changes 358 in access to tests of various sensitivities and specificities over time.

There is however currently a lack of understanding of what is available in the early phase of 2019-nCoV outbreak. The systematic review describes and assesses the potential rapid diagnostics, vaccines and therapeutics for 2019-nCoV, based in part on the developments for MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.","Investigating prognostic markers for severe patients are required to supply important information for early therapeutic strategy.","Disease improvement or favorable clinical outcome included full recovery and discharge, progression from critical/severe to non-severe disease status, PCR positive to negative, and/or maintenance of non-severe status. Disease progression or unfavorable clinical outcome included death, progression from non-severe to severe/critical disease status or severe to critical status, and/or maintenance of severe or critical status.","The availability of the virus' genetic sequence and initial data on the epidemiology and clinical consequences of the 2019-nCoV infections are only the first steps to understanding the threat posed by this pathogen. Many important questions remain unanswered, including its origin, extent, and duration of transmission in humans, ability to infect other animal hosts, and the spectrum and pathogenesis of human infections. Characterising viral isolates from successive generations of human infections will be key to updating diagnostics and assessing viral evolution. Beyond supportive care, 17 no specific coronavirus antivirals or vaccines of proven efficacy in humans exist, although clinical trials of both are ongoing for MERS-CoV and one controlled trial of ritonavir-boosted lopinavir monotherapy has been launched for 2019-nCoV (ChiCTR2000029308). Future animal model and clinical studies should focus on assessing the effectiveness and safety of promising antiviral drugs, monoclonal and polyclonal neutralising anti body products, and therapeutics directed against immunopathologic host responses.","MERS-CoV infection was fatal in 2 of the 3 patients described in our report. The high mortality rate associated with MERS-CoV infection increasingly appears to be due to the under-diagnosis of mild and asymptomatic cases as a result of the restrictive case definition put forward by WHO. 16 All 3 patients in our report had fever, cough, shortness of breath, pulmonary infiltrates on chest xrays, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia and rises in serum creatinine kinase and alanine transaminase. All these are relatively common clinical features amongst patients with MERS-CoV infection ( Table 1 ). Many of these were also seen in patients affected by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) outbreak in 2003; however, the 2 diseases have distinctly different infectivity patterns. 25 Although not necessarily diagnostic, the presence of these findings without an alternative explanation should prompt earlier consideration of MERS-CoV infection and initiation of appropriate investigations. It should be noted that collating data from small reports in order to understand the clinical features of an emergent infection has numerous selfevident limitations. A global, collaborative effort among clinicians and scientists studying this disease is needed to develop and identify more predictive diagnostic and prognostic markers. 26 A number of knowledge gaps remain in relation to MERS-CoV infection. These include identification of its source and intermediate host and better understanding of the pathogenesis, infectivity and risk factors. Further work is also needed to optimize MERS-CoV diagnostic assays and to identify the most effective therapeutic interventions. The existing number of cases globally over the past 2 years is relatively small to address all these areas.","is the (which was not peer-reviewed) The copyright holder for this preprint . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.19.20033175 doi: medRxiv preprint which was consistent with the elevated serum pro-inflammatory cytokines observed in COVID-19 patients. 13, 14 Meanwhile, serum levels of some laboratory indexes such as total bilirubin, creatinine and hypersensitive troponin I were increased in patients on admission. This trend was more obvious in patients with severe or critical illness, indicating signs of organ damage. Though the pathological mechanism of COVID-19 is yet to be defined, direct attacks from SARS-CoV-2 and organ damage caused by excessive inflammatory response (cytokines storm) might be responsible for the pathogenesis of disease progression. 14 Secondary infection, another main complication in this study, appeared mostly in non-survivors, indicating an important booster of disease progression.","It is becoming well appreciated that innate immune responses to pathogens are patterned and stereotyped. With the advent of DNA microarrays, researchers are now in a position to examine the host-pathogen relationship systematically in much greater detail than had been possible previously. For example, it is possible to document how a cell, tissue, or organ \"sees\" a pathogen from the viewpoint of gene expression responses. The temporal features of the interactions between the host and the pathogen can be characterized, prognostic markers of outcome can be studied, and novel therapeutic interventions can be identified and tested.","The copyright holder for this preprint . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03. 28.20045997 doi: medRxiv preprint hospitals immediately after a positive diagnostic test. Self-referred patients are more likely to have severe symptoms that cause them to seek emergency medical help. Likewise, other hospitals are more likely to test patients who have more pronounced symptoms, thus creating an inherent bias in the patient sample. Therefore, the cohort may not accurately represent patients with mild or asymptomatic COVID-19. These results need to be further validated with patients who are hospitalized for different severities of illness. In conclusion, traditional early warning scores and organ injury markers do not help to predict severity and mortality in patients with COVID-19. Here, we have developed and validated a clinical prediction model using readily available clinical markers which is able to accurately predict mortality in people with COVID-19. This model can therefore be used in current pandemic regions to identify patients who are at risk of severe disease at an early enough stage to initialize intensive supportive treatment and to guide discussions between clinicians, patients and families. It has the potential to be used throughout the world following additional validation .

Here we have presented an initial analysis of RNA sequence conservation across betacoronaviruses and current SARS-CoV-2 sequences, predictions for structured and unstructured domains of the viral RNA genome, and homology-derived secondary structure models for classic structured elements of the SARS-CoV-2 genome: the 5\u00b4 UTR, the frame-shifting element, and the 3\u00b4 UTR. Our hope is that these steps will provide a useful starting point for efforts to develop antivirals and diagnostics that depend on targeting either structured or unstructured viral genomic regions.","TCM has own characteristics such as holistic concept, balance of Yin and Yang, syndrome differentiation and treatment, strengthening the body resistance to eliminate pathogenic factors. TCM has thousands of years of experience in regulating the body and enhancing the resistance to epidemic diseases, with unique insights and prevention and control experience. For mild and common patients, the early intervention of TCM can effectively prevent the disease from transforming into severe and critical disease. In the severe cases, TCM has won time for rescuing them by improving symptoms (http://www.scio.gov.cn/xwfbh/ xwbfbh/wqfbh/42311/42560/index.htm). Treatment practice of COVID-19 showed that early intervention of TCM is important way to improve cure rate, shorten the course of disease, delay disease progression and reduce mortality rate. Furthermore, the reason why TCM works is not only to inhibit the virus, but might block the infection, regulate the immune response, cut off the inflammatory storm, and promote the repair of the body. Moreover, the prevention and control measures of COVID-19 fully reflect the ideology of \"preventive treatment of disease\". Apart from the epidemic diseases recorded in the Han Dynasty should be isolated, the preventive measures of TCM also include psychology, sports, diet, medication, etc.","While it is clear that viral infections are an important cause of pediatric ARDS, the exact disease burden remains unknown. With more definitive diagnostic criteria, clinicians now have a wide array of research possibilities regarding pediatric ARDS, both retrospective and prospective. Further studies to expand our understanding of viral-induced pediatric ARDS will be of great benefit, both in understanding the epidemiology and viral-specific treatment options available. In addition, an improved comprehension of viral transmission, pathogenicity, and host response will be particularly important in times of pandemics, either from known or novel viruses. Finally, continued efforts in prevention and treatment of viral infections will likely be of greatest advantage to decrease viral progression to pediatric ARDS.","Adjuvant: a molecule that potentiates the host immune response to an antigen. Agonist: a molecule that triggers a physiological response when bound to its receptor. Autoimmune disease: a condition in which the immune system produces antibodies that attack the healthy tissues of the host. Caspase-recruitment domain (CARD): a motif found in many proteins involved in inflammation and apoptosis that mediates homotypic interactions between two proteins. Cytokines: small proteins released by cells to communicate with other cells. Gain-of-function (GOF) mutation: a type of mutation in a gene that results in an altered protein exhibiting a new function or an increased activity. Helicase: a protein capable of unwinding nucleic acids through the hydrolysis of ATP. Homotypic interaction: interaction through similar domains found in interacting protein partners. Immunostimulant: a molecule capable of boosting the immune response. Inflammasome: an intracellular multiprotein complex that triggers inflammatory responses through the activation of the thiol protease, caspase 1. It notably results in the production of mature interleukin (IL)-1b and IL-18, and induces cell death by pyroptosis. Interferon (IFN): a subgroup of cytokines produced by host cells in response to infections that act on the infected cell or surrounding cells to trigger the induction of genes encoding proteins with antiviral activities. Melanoma differentiationassociated protein 5 (MDA5): a cytoplasmic PRR that senses viral RNA or viral RNA intermediates, and whose activation leads to cytokine production. Panhandle: a form of secondary structure found in RNA molecules arising from pairing of complementary sequences in the 3 0 and 5 0 ends. MDA5-targeted strategies suffer from the limited availability and diversity of pharmacologically usable ligands. However, important functional divergences between RIG-I and MDA5 have recently been reported, potentially providing new therapeutic opportunities. We address here the recent concepts and remaining gaps in our knowledge regarding the similarities and differences of RIG-I and MDA5 ligands and their signaling and biological functions. We highlight how such knowledge should be considered in the choice and design of specific and potent nucleic acid agonists, and discuss options for targeting RIG-I and/or MDA5 to achieve the best antiviral and immunomodulatory response for therapeutic and vaccine adjuvant development.","In a recent review of the effectiveness of various interventions aimed at changing the clinical practice of physicians, 38 the authors reported that there was evidence that educational outreach visits, posted reminders, interactive educational meetings, and other multifaceted interventions were effective in improving the transfer of new information into clinical practice. Passive interventions, such as mailing out new recommendations, were generally not found to be effective, even though they are the methods most commonly applied. Interventions that relied on audits or other forms of feedback were found to have variable effectiveness. Grol et al 39 characterized the features that were more likely to be associated with a change in primary care practice by physicians. An important finding was that recommendations with a strong evidence base were more likely to be effective than consensus statements.","The currently known viruses of the species Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus may be as (poorly) representative for this particular species as the few individuals that we selected to represent H. sapiens in Fig. 1 . It is thus reasonable to assume that this biased knowledge of the natural diversity of the species Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus limits our current understanding of fundamental aspects of the biology of this species and, as a consequence, our abilities to control zoonotic spillovers to humans. Future studies aimed at understanding the ecology of these viruses and advancing the accuracy and resolution of evolutionary analyses 41 would benefit greatly from adjusting our research and sampling strategies. This needs to include an expansion of our current research focus on human pathogens and their adaptation to specific hosts to other viruses in this species. To illustrate the great potential of species-wide studies, it may again be instructive to draw a parallel to H. sapiens, and specifically to the impressive advancements in personalized medicine in recent years. Results of extensive genetic analyses of large numbers of individuals representing diverse populations from all continents have been translated into clinical applications and greatly contribute to optimizing patient-specific diagnostics and therapy. They were instrumental in identifying reliable predictive markers for specific diseases as well as genomic sites that are under selection. It thus seems reasonable to expect that genome-based analyses with a comparable species coverage will be similarly insightful for coronaviruses. Also, additional diagnostic tools that target the entire species should be developed to complement existing tools optimized to detect individual pathogenic variants (a proactive approach). Technical solutions to this problem are already available; for example, in the context of multiplex PCR-based assays 42 . The costs for developing and applying (combined or separate) species-and virus-specific diagnostic tests in specific clinical and/or epidemiological settings may help to better appreciate the biological diversity and zoonotic potential of specific virus species and their members. Also, the further reduction of time required to identify the causative agents of novel virus infections will contribute to limiting the enormous social and economic consequences of large outbreaks. To advance such studies, innovative fundraising approaches may be required.","There are many examples in the literature where non-traditional animal models have been highly informative for our understanding of the host responses to pathogens [3] . For example, we are using bats to study several emerging viruses such as Hendra virus, and ferrets, which are widely accepted as an excellent model for influenza infection; they are naturally susceptible to infection with human influenza viruses and the disease pathology they develop resembles that of humans infected with influenza. Furthermore, by studying the pathogen in its natural host, we may be able to devise efficient control measures in that host, thereby disrupting their transmission to humans. This has important implications for predicting, preventing and controlling spillover events and for the development of novel therapeutics and diagnostics.","In order to explore the relationship between tested blood markers and disease conditions in COVID-19 patients, we first randomly selected 5 death cases and monitored dynamic changes in blood tests for each patient from Among all factors, LYM% showed the most significant and consistent trend ( Fig.1F ), indicating that this indicator might reflect the disease progression. In addition, we also investigated the indicators reflecting liver, kidney and myocardial functions. Significant changes in these indicators were usually accompanied by organ failure and cytokine storm syndromes (data not shown), which occurred at the end of disease course and thus could not reflect disease progression. Therefore, we only focused on lymphopenia in COVID-19 in the present study.","1. Predict its role in disease pathogenesis; 2. Find regions in the genome suitable for rapid diagnostics via NAT, and","The encouraging early results from the DNA microarray technology has inspired the development of a variety of array-based platforms [38-42] and contributed to the development of a system-wide study of proteins -- the field of modern pro-teomics. Traditionally, two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-D PAGE) with mass spectrometry has been the basis of proteomic technology [43]. Although this technique has provided rich information about individual proteins, its clinical usefulness for the study of the proteome is limited. The limitations of this technique for clinical diagnostics are primarily due to low sample throughput compared with other techniques. Additionally, there are technical challenges relating to the reproducibility of the 2-D gels, the relatively low numbers of proteins that can be resolved on each gel and the limited sensitivity (ie low abundant proteins are not easily identified). Modern proteomics technology, as discussed in several recent reviews, is developing quickly and is focused on mass spec-trometry-based serum pattern profiling and protein micro-arrays in continuing efforts to discover new molecular markers and therapeutic targets in human cancer [44-46]. The use of serum proteomic pattern analysis has created diagnostic signatures for ovarian [47,48], breast [49], prostate [50] and liver cancers [51]. In the Laboratory of Pathology at the National Cancer Institute (NCI), in collaboration with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), this proteome-based strategy is being used for early detection of ovarian cancer in high-risk women. Preliminary data is so encouraging that the technology is on track to enter clinical trials in the very near future [47]. For women living with the spectre of an aggressive disease, such as ovarian cancer, a reliable screening test would represent a major step forward in the diagnostic capabilities of the physicians who treat them.","Human RSV consists of subgroups A and B and primarily infects humans. The RSV genome encodes 11 different proteins involved in transmission, infection, evasion of host response, and replication (86). Infection is typically restricted to respiratory epithelial cells, including both type I and type II alveolar pneumocytes, from the trachea to the level of bronchioles. Infection leads to epithelial and interstitial inflammation with progression to inflammatory infiltrates and epithelial sloughing (87). After infection and viral replication, RSV causes epithelial cells to fuse, forming a syncytium from which the virus spreads from cell to cell (88). Those infected epithelial cells are then destroyed, releasing inflammatory cytokines and chemokines that ultimately attract additional inflammatory cells and degrade capillary integrity (89). Disruption of the alveolar\u2013capillary barrier results in leakage of plasma proteins into interstitial tissue and within the alveoli, finally interfering with surfactant function (90). With an understanding of the pathophysiologic process of RSV, it is no surprise that progression to ARDS is a potential end point.","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an emerging outbreak caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). According to updated statistics released by the World Health Organization (WHO), COVID-19 has already affected over 110,000 people from over 100 countries worldwide, causing N3800 deaths. 1 In up to 15% of infected patients the clinical course of this pathology may be complicated by the onset of a severe form of intestinal pneumonia, which may then progress towards acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and/or multi organ failure (MOF) and death. 2 People with underlying cardiovascular disease are among the highest risk individuals for severe disease and death. Importantly, among the COVID-19 knowledge gaps are laboratory and diagnostics issues as well as the clinical management of severe and critically ill patients. 3 Since major cardiac complications have been reported to develop in a considerable number of patients with pneumonia, 4 we performed an analysis of the current scientific literature to investigate whether the measurement of cardiac troponin I (cTnI) or cardiac troponin T (cTnT) may help predict clinical severity in patients with COVID-19.","In addition to viral pathogenicity, disease severity of influenza A (H1N1) virus infection is also closely associated with host response (107). In both healthy patients and those with comorbidities, influenza A (H1N1) virus can lead to an exaggerated inflammatory response with dysregulation of local and systemic chemokine and cytokine production (108, 109). In a study specifically in the pediatric population, Takano et al. found a positive correlation with disease severity and elevated levels of serum interferon gamma, several interleukin types, and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) (110). Some studies suggest that these elevations may be adequate immune response to infection (111), but further exploration of the inflammatory response in influenza A (H1N1) virus infection is likely to yield development of potential interventions to prevent disease progression to ARDS.","\u2022 Fill gaps in understanding of the natural history of infection to better define the period of infectiousness and transmissibility; more accurately estimate the reproductive number in various outbreak settings and improve understanding the role of asymptomatic infection. \u2022 Comparative analysis of different quarantine strategies and contexts for their effectiveness and social acceptability \u2022 Enhance and develop an ethical framework for outbreak response that includes better equity for access to interventions for all countries \u2022 Promote the development of point-of-care diagnostic tests \u2022 Determine the best ways to apply knowledge about infection prevention and control in health-care settings in resource-constrained countries (including identification of optimal personal protective equipment) and in the broader community, specifically to understand behaviour among different vulnerable groups \u2022 Support standardised, best evidence-based approach for clinical management and better outcomes and implement randomised, controlled trials for therapeutics and vaccines as promising agents emerge \u2022 Validation of existing serological tests, including those that have been developed by commercial entities, and establishment of biobanks and serum panels of well characterised COVID-19 sera to support such efforts \u2022 Complete work on animal models for vaccine and therapeutic research and development include some identified by the global community and by the Research and Development Blueprint Scientific Advisory Group. The STAG-IH emphasises the importance of the continued rapid sharing of data of public health importance in medical journals that provide rapid peer review and online publication without a paywall. It is sharing of information in this way, as well as technical collaboration among clinicians, epidemiologists, and virologists, that has provided the world with its current understanding of COVID-19.","A metagenomic approach is deemed most helpful when heterogeneous infections share an identical clinical presentation [58] or when genetic markers of antibiotic resistance are in question [50]. Data supplied using NGS also augment diagnostics of respiratory infections: whereas modern multiplex molecular assays reveal the etiology of respiratory infections in approximately 40\u201380% of cases [58,59,60,61,62], metagenomics successfully tackles this limitation [63].","This study specifically shows a holistic picture of the current research in response to the outbreak of COVID-19. We conducted a topic-based bibliometric study to address two questions \"What is the CoVs research interested in?\" and \"Where are we with our research about COVID-19?\". An LDA-based model was used to identify the hotspots and their difference between COVID-19 and other CoV infections in a quantitative way. Generally, eight main research areas are identified, i.e., clinical characterization, pathogenesis research, therapeutics research, epidemiological study, virus transmission, vaccines research, virus diagnostics, and viral genomics. The results also indicate that studies in diagnostics, therapeutics, vaccines, viral genomics, and pathogenesis are urgently needed to minimize the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak. As COVID-19 can be considered a recent emerged disease, we characterize a 'snapshot' of this field at an early stage in its development. Our findings can potentially aid governments and the research community in understanding recent development of the research field, optimizing research topic decision, and monitoring new scientific or technological activities.","In conclusion, our results showed that higher NLR and CT severity score on admission were independent risk factors for short-term progression in patients with NCP. The CT findings in patients with NCP were associated with inflammatory levels and both them have the potential to predict disease progression. Imported and nonimported patients outside Wuhan should be managed equally, and early admission is required for avoiding severe pulmonary damage. CT severity score 6 (4-10) 6 (3-9) 10 (7-15) 0.003 COPD, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; CT, computed tomography; GGO, ground-glass opacities; NCP, 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia; NLR, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio.","ILI is defined by the CDC as fever of 100 \u2022 F and a cough and/or a sore throat without a known cause other than influenza (CDC 2020) . Defining ILI as a cluster of symptoms rather than a specific disease or diseases is necessary for keeping track of case counts, as well as for important analysis and forecasting (Osthus and Moran 2019). However, the cluster of symptoms known as ILI is caused by many under-lying pathogens (Taylor 2017 , Galindo-Fraga 2013 . Positive diagnosis is a prerequisite for accurate treatment. To respond to this need and to gain a finer-grained understanding of ILI that will contribute to a practical foundation for advances in diagnostics and interventions, we here review the literature for parameter values. We then compare the dynamics of five common upper respiratory viruses implicated in ILI: influenza, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), rhinovirus, human coronavirus (HCoV), and adenovirus.","Recent advances in understanding the pathogenesis of Ebola and the role of proinflammatory cytokines has led to the use of some recombinant products that block the progression of the inflammatory cascade to DIC in some animal models. Nonetheless, this approach has not been used in humans as of 2007.","Under the FDA's traditional approval pathway, a demonstration of vaccine effectiveness is based on a clinical disease end point (e.g., prevention of disease) or, alternatively, an accepted correlate of protection. In addition to these programs, the FDA's regulations provide for expedited pathways for licensure. Accelerated approval, 21 CFR \u00a7601.40, may be granted for certain biological products that have been studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating a serious or lifethreatening disease or condition and that provide meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing treatments. Such an approval is based on adequate and well-controlled clinical trials establishing that the product has an effect on a surrogate end point that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit or on a clinical end point that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit. Approval under this pathway is subject to the requirement that the sponsor study the biological product further, to verify and describe its clinical benefit, where there is uncertainty as to the relation of the surrogate end point to clinical benefit. Of note, the FDASIA of 2012 provided that evidence to support an end point is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit to include \"epidemiological, pathophysiological, therapeutic, pharmacologic, or other evidence developed using biomarkers, for example, or other scientific methods or tools.\" In other words, FDASIA expanded the scope of available end points that can be used to demonstrate that a product qualifies for accelerated approval, but do not affect the quantity and quality of evidence needed to demonstrate substantial evidence of effectiveness or safety.","The MCV and MCA parameters correspond to the first portion of the characteristic V-shaped pupillometric response (Figure 4) and are considered the most sensitive markers of cholinergic activity [78]. Therefore, the MCA and secondarily the MCV are the best PLR predictors to discriminate between healthy individuals and patients with Alzheimer\u2019s or Parkinson\u2019s disease [57,72]. A significant increase in latency has been observed for subjects with Parkinson\u2019s disease [57,58,59]; however, this was not observed consistently in those with Alzheimer\u2019s disease [54,56,72]. Additionally, Bittner et al. examined the pupil\u2019s response under repetitive light stimulation, which is systematically unstable in normal patients [54]. However, these changes were not observed in patients with Alzheimer\u2019s disease.","Since the outbreak of COVID-19, this new disease and its causative virus have drawn major global attention. Scientists and physicians worldwide have been conducting a major campaign to understand this new emergent disease and its epidemiology in an effort to uncover possible treatment regimens, discover effective therapeutic agents, and develop vaccines. Figure 4 shows the total number of journal articles related to COVID-19 or SARS-CoV-2 published each week from the last week of 2019 through the week of February 24, 2020. Over 500 journal articles were published electronically or in print during this period, and the number of published articles has increased each week since the week of January 13, 2020. Although a large portion of these articles are about clinical manifestations and treatment options, an increasing number of studies are focused on elucidation of virus structure, virus transmission mechanisms/dynamics, as well as identification of antiviral agents and accurate diagnostics for virus detection. These trends reflect immense interest and desire from the scientific community, including both academic and industrial organizations as well as clinicians, to identify new methods to halt the progression of this epidemic disease and to prevent infection and transmission in the future.","As SARS emerged as a disease of unknown etiology, empirical therapeutic options were initially tested including broad spectrum antivirals and immunomodulators such as ribavirin, intravenous immune globulin, type 1 interferon, SARS convalescent plasma, and corticosteroids. However, in the absence of controlled clinical trials, no conclusions can be drawn on the efficacy of these interventions."],"title":["Reduction and Functional Exhaustion of T Cells in Patients with
