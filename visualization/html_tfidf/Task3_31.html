We implement a machine learning approach to select instrumental variables that strongly predict virus transmission among the rich exogenous weather characteristics. Our 2SLS estimates show that the stringent quarantine, massive lockdown and other public health measures imposed in late January significantly reduced the transmission rate of COVID-19. By early February, the virus spread had been contained. While many socioeconomic factors mediate the virus spread, a robust government response since late January played a determinant role in the containment of the virus. We also demonstrate that the actual population flow from the outbreak source poses a higher risk to the destination than other factors such as geographic proximity and similarity in economic conditions. The results have rich implications for ongoing global effor...","Summary Emerging and re-emerging zoonoses are a significant public health concern and cause considerable socioeconomic problems globally. The emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1, avian influenza H7N9, and severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS), and the re-emergence of rabies, brucellosis, and other zoonoses have had a significant effect on the national economy and public health in China, and have affected other countries. Contributing factors that continue to affect emerging and re-emerging zoonoses in China include social and environmental factors and microbial evolution, such as population growth, urbanization, deforestation, livestock production, food safety, climate change, and pathogen mutation. The Chinese government has devised new strategies and has taken measures to deal with the challenges of these diseases, including the issuing of laws and regulations, establishment of disease reporting systems, im...","Middle East Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is a novel coronavirus discovered in 2012 and is responsible for acute respiratory syndrome in humans. Though not confirmed yet, multiple surveillance and phylogenetic studies suggest a bat origin. The disease is heavily endemic in dromedary camel populations of East Africa and the Middle East. It is unclear as to when the virus was introduced to dromedary camels, but data from studies that investigated stored dromedary camel sera and geographical distribution of involved dromedary camel populations suggested that the virus was present in dromedary camels several decades ago. Though bats and alpacas can serve as potential reservoirs for MERS-CoV, dromedary camels seem to be the only animal host responsible for the spill over human infections.","Background: Community responses are important for outbreak management during the early phase when non-pharmaceutical interventions are the major preventive options. Therefore, this study aims to examine the psychological and behavioral responses of the community during the early phase of the COVID-19 epidemic in Hong Kong. Method: A cross-sectional online survey was launched within 36 hours after confirmed COVID-19 cases were first reported. Councilors of all 452 district council constituency areas were approached for survey dissemination. Respondent demographics, anxiety level, risk perception, sources to retrieve COVID-19 information, actual adoption and perceived efficacy of precautionary measures were collected. Result: Analysis from 1715 complete responses indicated high perceived susceptibility (89%) and high perceived severity (97%). Most respondents were worried about COVID-19 (97%), and had their daily routines disrupted (slightly/greatly: 98%). The anxiety level, measured by ...","Objective: To investigate psychological and behavioral responses to the threat of SARS-CoV-2 infections and their associations with public perceptions in China Design: Cross sectional population-based telephone survey via random digital dialing between 1 and 10 February, 2020 Setting: Wuhan (the epicentre and quarantined city), and Shanghai (a typical major city with close transportation link with Wuhan) Participants: Random sample of 510 residents in Wuhan and 501 residents in Shanghai aged above 18 Main outcome measures: Anxiety (measured by the 7-item generalized anxiety disorder [GAD-7] scale), recommended and avoidance behaviors (engaged in all six behaviors such as increasing surface cleaning and reducing going out). Results: The prevalence rates of moderate or severe anxiety (score \u226510 on GAD-7) were 32.7% (n=167) among Wuhan participants and 20.4% (n=102) among Shanghai participants. 78.6% (n=401) of Wuhan participants and 63.9% (n=320) of Shanghai participants had carried out ...","Emerging infectious diseases, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Zika virus disease, present a major threat to public health(1\u20133). Despite intense research efforts, how, when and where new diseases appear are still a source of considerable uncertainty. A severe respiratory disease was recently reported in Wuhan, Hubei province, China. As of 25 January 2020, at least 1,975 cases had been reported since the first patient was hospitalized on 12 December 2019. Epidemiological investigations have suggested that the outbreak was associated with a seafood market in Wuhan. Here we study a single patient who was a worker at the market and who was admitted to the Central Hospital of Wuhan on 26 December 2019 while experiencing a severe respiratory syndrome that included fever, dizziness and a cough. Metagenomic RNA sequencing(4) of a sample of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from the patient identified a new RNA virus strain from the family Coronaviridae, which is designated here ...","BACKGROUND: SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) was identified as the etiological agent of SARS, and extensive investigations indicated that it originated from an animal source (probably bats) and was recently introduced into the human population via wildlife animals from wet markets in southern China. Previous studies revealed that the spike (S) protein of SARS had experienced adaptive evolution, but whether other functional proteins of SARS have undergone adaptive evolution is not known. RESULTS: We employed several methods to investigate selective pressure among different SARS-CoV groups representing different epidemic periods and hosts. Our results suggest that most functional proteins of SARS-CoV have experienced a stepwise adaptive evolutionary pathway. Similar to previous studies, the spike protein underwent strong positive selection in the early and middle phases, and became stabilized in the late phase. In addition, the replicase experienced positive selection only in human patients, ...","Bats in the EU have been associated with several zoonotic viral pathogens of significance to both human and animal health. Virus discovery continues to expand the existing understating of virus classification, and the increased interest in bats globally as reservoirs or carriers of zoonotic agents has fuelled the continued detection and characterisation of new lyssaviruses and other viral zoonoses. Although the transmission of lyssaviruses from bat species to humans or terrestrial species appears rare, interest in these viruses remains, through their ability to cause the invariably fatal encephalitis\u2014rabies. The association of bats with other viral zoonoses is also of great interest. Much of the EU is free of terrestrial rabies, but several bat species harbor lyssaviruses that remain a risk to human and animal health. Whilst the rabies virus is the main cause of rabies globally, novel related viruses continue to be discovered, predominantly in bat populations, that are of interest pure...","Emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases, such as SARS, MERS, Zika and highly pathogenic influenza present a major threat to public health1\u20133. Despite intense research effort, how, when and where novel diseases appear are still the source of considerable uncertainly. A severe respiratory disease was recently reported in the city of Wuhan, Hubei province, China. At the time of writing, at least 62 suspected cases have been reported since the first patient was hospitalized on December 12nd 2019. Epidemiological investigation by the local Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) suggested that the outbreak was associated with a sea food market in Wuhan. We studied seven patients who were workers at the market, and collected bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) from one patient who exhibited a severe respiratory syndrome including fever, dizziness and cough, and who was admitted to Wuhan Central Hospital on December 26th 2019. Next generation metagenomic RNA sequencing4 identifie...","Abstract The global outbreak in 2002\u20132003 of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) posed a serious threat to public health and had a significant impact on socioeconomic stability. Although the global outbreak of SARS has been contained, there are serious concerns over its re-emergence and bioterrorism potential, and up to date, no specific treatment exists for this disease. Here we review the progress of studies on the pathogenesis of the disease, in particular, studies on the molecular level.","","Abstract Background Anecdotal reports of mood disorder following infection with common respiratory viruses with neurotropic potential have been in existence since the last century. Nevertheless, systematic studies on the association between these viruses and mood disorders are lacking. Methods Influenza A, B and coronavirus antibody titers were measured in 257 subjects with recurrent unipolar and bipolar disorder and healthy controls, by SCID. Pearson's \u03c7\u00b2 tests and logistic regression models were used to analyze associations between seropositivity for coronaviruses, influenza A and B viruses and the following: a) history of recurrent mood disorders b) having attempted suicide in the past c) uni- vs. bi-polarity and d) presence of psychotic symptoms during mood episodes. Results Seropositivity for influenza A (p =0.004), B (p &lt;0.0001) and coronaviruses (p &lt;0.0001) were associated with history of mood disorders but not with the specific diagnosis of unipolar or bipolar depression. Serop...","Currently, there has been an increasing socioeconomic impact of zoonotic pathogens transmitted from animals to humans worldwide. Recently, in the Arabian Peninsula, including in Saudi Arabia, epidemiological data indicated an actual increase in the number of emerging and/or reemerging cases of several viral zoonotic diseases. Data presented in this review are very relevant because Saudi Arabia is considered the largest country in the Peninsula. We believe that zoonotic pathogens in Saudi Arabia remain an important public health problem; however, more than 10 million Muslim pilgrims from around 184 Islamic countries arrive yearly at Makkah for the Hajj season and/or for the Umrah. Therefore, for health reasons, several countries recommend vaccinations for various zoonotic diseases among preventive protocols that should be complied with before traveling to Saudi Arabia. However, there is a shortage of epidemiological data focusing on the emerging and reemerging of zoonotic pathogens tran...","Unprecedented measures have been adopted to control the rapid spread of the ongoing COVID-19 epidemic in China. People's adherence to control measures is affected by their knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) towards COVID-19. In this study, we investigated Chinese residents' KAP towards COVID-19 during the rapid rise period of the outbreak. An online sample of Chinese residents was successfully recruited via the authors' networks with residents and popular media in Hubei, China. A self-developed online KAP questionnaire was completed by the participants. The knowledge questionnaire consisted of 12 questions regarding the clinical characteristics and prevention of COVID-19. Assessments on residents' attitudes and practices towards COVID-19 included questions on confidence in winning the battle against COVID-19 and wearing masks when going out in recent days. Among the survey completers (n=6910), 65.7% were women, 63.5% held a bachelor degree or above, and 56.2% engaged in mental l...","Con el crecimiento de los viajes internacionales y la inmigraci\u00f3n, en Espa\u00f1a ha aumentado el n\u00famero de pacientes con enfermedades infecciosas importadas, muchas de ellas desde zonas tropicales o subtropicales. Paralelamente tambi\u00e9n se ha multiplicado el n\u00famero de publicaciones cient\u00edficas de autores espa\u00f1oles sobre infecciones importadas causadas por par\u00e1sitos, hongos, micobacterias, bacterias o virus. El riesgo que representan para la salud p\u00fablica es bajo, aunque para su correcta prevenci\u00f3n y su control es importante facilitar el acceso universal a la asistencia sanitaria y a unas condiciones socioecon\u00f3micas dignas, as\u00ed como mantener una formaci\u00f3n cl\u00ednica y epidemiol\u00f3gica actualizada del personal sanitario. Estas medidas a escala nacional deben compaginarse con las iniciativas internacionales de control global de estas infecciones. In Spain, owing to the rise of international travels and immigration, the number of patients with imported infectious diseases has increased, many of them...","The current outbreak of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) poses an unprecedented global health and economic threat to interconnected human societies. Until a vaccine is developed, strategies for controlling the outbreak rely on aggressive social distancing. These measures largely disconnect the social network fabric of human societies, especially in urban areas. Here, we estimate the growth rates and reproductive numbers of COVID-19 in US cities from March 14th through March 19th to reveal a power-law scaling relationship to city population size. This means that COVID-19 is spreading faster on average in larger cities with the additional implication that, in an uncontrolled outbreak, larger fractions of the population are expected to become infected in more populous urban areas. We discuss the implications of these observations for controlling the COVID-19 outbreak, emphasizing the need to implement more aggressive distancing policies in larger cities while also with preserving...","The 2019-2020 influenza sentinel surveillance data exhibits unexpected trends. Typical influenza seasons have a small herald wave, followed by a decrease due to school closure during holidays, and then a main post-holiday peak that is significantly larger than the pre-holiday wave. During the 2019-2020 influenza season, influenza-like illness data in the United States appears to have a markedly lower main epidemic peak compared to what would be expected based on the pre-holiday peak. We hypothesize that the 2019-2020 influenza season does have a lower than expected burden and that this deflation is due to a behavioral or ecological interaction with COVID-19. We apply an intervention analysis to assess if this influenza season deviates from expectations, then we compare multiple hypothesized drivers of the decrease in influenza in a spatiotemporal regression model. Lastly, we develop a mechanistic metapopulation model, incorporating transmission reduction that scales with COVID-19 risk ...","The recent outbreak of COVID-19 in Mainland China is characterized by a distinctive algebraic, sub-exponential increase of confirmed cases with time during the early phase of the epidemic, contrasting an initial exponential growth expected for an unconstrained outbreak with sufficiently large reproduction rate. Although case counts vary significantly between affected provinces in Mainland China, the scaling law t^\u03bc is surprisingly universal, with a range of exponents \u03bc = 2.1 \u00b1 0.3. The universality of this behavior indicates that, in spite of social, regional, demographical, geographical, and socio-economical heterogeneities of affected Chinese provinces, this outbreak is dominated by fundamental mechanisms that are not captured by standard epidemiological models. We show that the observed scaling law is a direct consequence of containment policies that effectively deplete the susceptible population. To this end we introduce a parsimonious model that captures both, quarantine of sympto...","Two months after it was firstly reported, the novel coronavirus disease COVID-19 has already spread worldwide. However, the vast majority of reported infections have occurred in China. To assess the effect of early travel restrictions adopted by the health authorities in China, we have implemented an epidemic metapopulation model that is fed with mobility data corresponding to 2019 and 2020. This allows to compare two radically different scenarios, one with no travel restrictions and another in which mobility is reduced by a travel ban. Our findings indicate that i) travel restrictions are an effective measure in the short term, however, ii) they are ineffective when it comes to completely eliminate the disease. The latter is due to the impossibility of removing the risk of seeding the disease to other regions. Our study also highlights the importance of developing more realistic models of behavioral changes when a disease outbreak is unfolding.","Abstract The current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia pandemic, caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus, is spreading globally at an accelerated rate, with a basic reproduction number (R0) of 2 \u2013 2.5, indicating that 2 \u2013 3 persons will be infected from an index patient. A serious public health emergency, it is particularly deadly in vulnerable populations and communities in which healthcare providers are insufficiently prepared to manage the infection. As of March 16, 2020, there are more than 180,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19 worldwide, with over 7,000 related deaths. The SARS-CoV-2 virus has been isolated from asymptomatic individuals, and affected patients continue to be infectious two weeks after cessation of symptoms. The substantial morbidity and socioeconomic impact have necessitated drastic measures across all continents, including nationwide lockdowns and border closures. Pregnant women and their fetuses represent a high-risk populat...","During the current COVID-19 pandemic, testing kit and RNA extraction kit availability has become a major limiting factor in the ability to determine patient disease status and accurately quantify prevalence. Current testing strategies rely on individual tests of cases matching restrictive diagnostic criteria to detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA, limiting testing of asymptomatic and mild cases. Testing these individuals is one effective way to understand and reduce the spread of COVID-19. Here, we develop a pooled testing strategy to identify these low-risk individuals. Drawing on the well-studied group testing literature, modeling suggests practical changes to testing protocols which can reduce test costs and stretch a limited test kit supply. When most tests are negative, pooling reduces the total number of tests up to four-fold at 2% prevalence and eight-fold at 0.5% prevalence. At current SARS-CoV-2 prevalence, randomized group testing optimized per country could double the number of tested ind...","Certain bat species serve as natural reservoirs for pathogens in several key viral families including henipa-, lyssa-, corona-, and filoviruses, which may pose serious threats to human health. The Common Vampire Bat (Desmodus rotundus), due to its abundance, sanguivorous feeding habit involving humans and domestic animals, and highly social behavioral ecology, may have an unusually high potential for interspecies disease transmission. Previous studies have investigated rabies dynamics in D. rotundus, yet the diversity of other viruses, bacteria, and other microbes that these bats may carry remains largely unknown. We screened 396 blood, urine, saliva, and fecal samples from D. rotundus captured in Guatemala for 13 viral families and genera. Positive results were found for rhabdovirus, adenovirus, and herpesvirus assays. We also screened these samples for Bartonella spp. and found that 38% of individuals tested positive. To characterize potential for interspecies transmission associated...","The ongoing COVID-19 outbreak has expanded rapidly throughout China. Major behavioral, clinical, and state interventions are underway currently to mitigate the epidemic and prevent the persistence of the virus in human populations in China and worldwide. It remains unclear how these unprecedented interventions, including travel restrictions, have affected COVID-19 spread in China. We use real-time mobility data from Wuhan and detailed case data including travel history to elucidate the role of case importation on transmission in cities across China and ascertain the impact of control measures. Early on, the spatial distribution of COVID-19 cases in China was well explained by human mobility data. Following the implementation of control measures, this correlation dropped and growth rates became negative in most locations, although shifts in the demographics of reported cases are still indicative of local chains of transmission outside Wuhan. This study shows that the drastic control mea...","Objective: Establishing a social contact data sharing initiative and an interactive tool to assess mitigation strategies for COVID-19. Results: We organized data sharing of published social contact surveys via online repositories and formatting guidelines. We analyzed this social contact data in terms of weighted social contact matrices, next generation matrices, relative incidence and R0. We incorporated location-specific isolation measures (e.g. school closure or telework) and capture their effect on transmission dynamics. All methods have been implemented in an online application based on R Shiny and applied to COVID-19 with age-specific susceptibility and infectiousness. Using our online tool with the available social contact data, we illustrate that social distancing could have a considerable impact on reducing transmission for COVID-19. The effect itself depends on assumptions made about disease-specific characteristics and the choice of intervention(s). Keywords: social contact ...","We present here several variants of a mathematical model to explore three main issues related to SARS-CoV-2 spread in scenarios similar to those present in Mexico and elsewhere in Latin America. We explore the consequences for travel inside a given region, in this case Mexico, particularly focusing on airplane transportation but attempting to give a gross approximation to terrestrial movement since this is the main form of population movement across geographical areas in the country; then we proceed to study the effect of behavioral changes required to lower transmission by lowering the contact rate and infection probability and lastly, we explore the consequences of disease spread in a population subject to social isolation.These models are not suitable for predictive purposes although some rough predictions can be extracted from them. They are presented as a tool that can serve to explore plausible scenarios of spread and impact, effectiveness and consequences of contention and mitig...","Abstract Background Randomized trials have shown that the major antihypertensive drug classes are similarly effective to reduce mortality, but whether these drug class difference exists in clinical practice has been scarcely explored. This study evaluated the association between antihypertensive drug class, all-cause mortality and deaths due to diabetes or renal disease in real-life clinical settings. Methods A clinical database in Hong Kong included all patients who were prescribed their first-ever antihypertensive agents between 2001 and 2005 from the public healthcare sector. All patients were followed up for five years, and grouped according to the initial antihypertensive prescription. The associations between antihypertensive drug class, all-cause mortality or combined diabetes and renal mortality, respectively, were evaluated by Cox proportional hazard models. Results From 218,047 eligible patients, 33,288 (15.3%) died within five years after their first-ever antihypertensive pr...","BACKGROUND: Strategies are urgently needed to mitigate the risk of zoonotic disease emergence in southern China, where pathogens with zoonotic potential are known to circulate in wild animal populations. However, the risk factors leading to emergence are poorly understood, which presents a challenge in developing appropriate mitigation strategies for local communities. METHODS: Residents in rural communities of Yunnan, Guangxi and Guangdong provinces were recruited and enrolled in this study. Data were collected through ethnographic interviews and field observations, and thematically coded and analysed to identify both risk and protective factors for zoonotic disease emergence at the individual, community and policy levels. RESULTS: Eighty-eight ethnographic interviews and 55 field observations were conducted at nine selected sites. Frequent human\u2013animal interactions and low levels of environmental biosecurity in local communities were identified as risks for zoonotic disease emergence...","Abstract Housing preweaned dairy calves in pairs rather than individually has been found to positively affect behavioral responses in novel social and environmental situations, but concerns have been raised that close contact among very young animals may impair their health. In previous studies, the level of social contact permitted in individual housing has been auditory, visual, or physical contact. It is unclear how these various levels of social contact compare with each other and to pair housing, when their effects on behavior and health are considered, and whether the timing of pair housing has an effect. To investigate this, 110 Holstein calves (50 males, 60 females) in 11 blocks were paired according to birth date. Within 60h of birth, each pair of calves was allocated to 1 of 5 treatments: individual housing with auditory contact (I), individual housing with auditory and visual contact (V), individual housing with auditory, visual, and tactile contact (T), pair housing (P), or...","The independent risk factors to predict mortality of critical severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) were investigated. One hundred and two patients diagnosed with critical SARS were admitted to hospitals of Shanxi Province, from March 7, 2003 to June 4, 2003. The patients were prospectively studied after admission to access their short term outcomes and the risk factors associated with adverse outcomes, defined as death. All the demographic and clinical characteristics were studied and univariate and multivariate Logistic regression were employed to access the risk factors. The results showed that of the 102 cases, 23 patients died, with a crude mortality rate of 22.5%. Multivariate Logistic regression revealed that age above 50 [odds ratio (OR) 1. 10, 95% confidence internal (CI) 1.03 to 1.16,P=0.004], lymphopenia at early stage (OR 14.62, 95% CI 1.78 to 11.97,P=0.01) were independently associated with mortality. On the other side, psychotherapy (OR 0.01, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.06,P&lt;0.00...","Background With evidence of sustained transmission in more than 190 countries, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been declared a global pandemic. As such, data are urgently needed about risk factors associated with clinical outcomes. Methods A retrospective chart review of 323 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in Wuhan was conducted. Patients were classified into three disease severity groups (non-severe, severe, and critical), based on their initial clinical presentation. Clinical outcomes were designated as favorable and unfavorable, based on disease progression and response to treatments. Logistic regression models were performed to identify factors associated with clinical outcomes, and logrank test was conducted for the association with clinical progression. Results Current standard treatments did not show significant improvement on patient outcomes in the study. By univariate logistic regression model, 27 risk factors were significantly associated with clinical outcomes. ...","Background Traditional infection control policies have focused on engineering controls, specific protocols, and personal protective equipment (PPE). In light of the variable success in protecting health care workers (HCWs) from Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2003, organizational and individual factors related to self-protective behavior in health care settings may also play an important role. Methods A critical review of the literature was conducted, directed at understanding what organizational and individual factors are important in protecting HCWs from infectious diseases at work. Results Organizational factors, such as a positive safety climate, have been associated with increased HCW adherence to universal precautions. There is some evidence that appropriate training of HCWs could be effective in changing HCW behavior if appropriate follow-up is applied. Very little research into these factors has been conducted with regard to preventing exposures to respiratory tract...","Aims: Corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has rapidly become the most severe public health issue all over the world. Despite respiratory symptoms, hepatic injury has also been observed in clinical settings. This study aimed to investigate the risk factors involved with hepatic injury in the patients with COVID-19. Methods: A total of 85 hospitalized patients who were diagnosed with COVID-19 in Beijing Youan Hospital were retrospectively analyzed. According to liver function, they were divided into ALT normal group (n=52) and ALT elevation group (n=33). Clinical features and laboratory data were compared between the two groups. The independent risk factors for liver injury were analyzed. Results: There were 33 patients with hepatic injury in our study, accounting for 38.8% (33/85). The patients in ALT elevation group were older than those in ALT normal group. The levels of lactic acid, CRP, myoglobin, and neutrophils were significantly higher in ALT elevation group. The lymphocytes and...","Summary Objectives Data on prognostic factors among children with severe pneumonia are scarce in middle-income countries. We investigated prognostic factors for an adverse outcome among children admitted to the H\u00f4pital d\u2019Enfants de Rabat, Morocco with World Health Organization-defined clinically severe pneumonia (CSP). Methods Children aged 2\u201359 months admitted to the hospital and fulfilling the CSP definition were recruited into this 13-month prospective study. A poor prognosis was defined as death, a need for intensive care, or a Respiratory Index of Severity in Children (RISC) score \u22653. Multivariate logistic regression was performed to ascertain independent predictive factors for a poor prognosis. Results Of the 689 children included in this analysis, 55 (8.0%) required intensive care and 28 died (4.0%). Five hundred and two (72.8%) children were classified as having a good prognosis and 187 (27.2%) as having a poor prognosis. A history of prematurity (odds ratio (OR) 2.50, 95% conf...","BACKGROUND: Knowledge of risk factors for symptomatic human coronavirus (HCoV) infections in children in community settings is limited. We estimated the disease burden and impact of birth-related, maternal, household, and seasonal factors on HCoV infections among children from birth to 6 months old in rural Nepal. METHODS: Prospective, active, weekly surveillance for acute respiratory infections (ARIs) was conducted in infants over a period of 3 years during 2 consecutive, population-based randomized trials of maternal influenza immunization. Midnasal swabs were collected for acute respiratory symptoms and tested for HCoV and other viruses by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction. Association between HCoV incidence and potential risk factors was modeled using Poisson regression. RESULTS: Overall, 282 of 3505 (8%) infants experienced an HCoV ARI within the first 6 months of life. HCoV incidence overall was 255.6 (95% confidence interval [CI], 227.3\u2013286.5) per 1000 person-years...","Background Notwithstanding the clinical hallmarks of COVID-19 patients were reported, several critical issues still remain mysterious, i.e., prognostic factors for COVID-19 including extrinsic factors as viral load of SARS-CoV-2 and intrinsic factors as individual's health conditions; myocarditis incidence rate and hallmarks. Methods Demographic, epidemiologic, radiologic and laboratory data were collected by medical record reviews of adult hospitalized patients diagnosed as COVID-19. Cycle threshold (Ct) value data of real-time PCR (RT-PCR) were collected. The time duration was from 21 January to 2 March, 2020. Pulmonary inflammation index (PII) values were used for chest CT findings. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to identify independent severity risk factors. RESULTS In total, 84 hospitalized adult patients diagnosed as COVID-19 were included, including 20 severe and 64 nonsevere cases. The viral load of the severe group was significantly higher than that of the ...","Abstract Background Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) is a major infectious disease which has affected the Middle Eastern countries, especially the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) since 2012. The high mortality rate associated with this disease has been a major cause of concern. This paper aims at identifying the major factors influencing MERS recovery in KSA. Methods The data used for analysis was collected from the Ministry of Health website, KSA. The important factors impelling the recovery are found using machine learning. Machine learning models such as support vector machine, conditional inference tree, na\u00efve Bayes and J48 are modelled to identify the important factors. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis is also carried out to identify the significant factors statistically. Result The main factors influencing MERS recovery rate are identified as age, pre-existing diseases, severity of disease and whether the patient is a healthcare worker or not. In spit...","In a patient with acute respiratory illness (cough, sputum production, chest pain, and/or dyspnea), the need for chest imaging depends on the severity of illness, age of the patient, clinical history, physical and laboratory findings, and other risk factors. Chest radiographs seem warranted when one or more of the following are present: age \u2265 40; dementia; a positive physical examination; hemoptysis; associated abnormalities (leukocytosis, hypoxemia); or other risk factors, including coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, or drug-induced acute respiratory failure. Chest CT may be warranted in complicated cases of severe pneumonia and in febrile neutropenic patients with normal or nonspecific chest radiographic findings. Literature on the indications and usefulness of radiologic studies for acute respiratory illness in different clinical settings is reviewed.","Background China is running a national level antivirus campaign against the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). Strict control measures are being enforced in either the populated areas and remote regions. While the virus is closed to be under control, tremendous economic loss has been caused. Methods and findings We assessed the pandemic risk of 2019-nCoV for all cities/regions in China using the random forest algorithm, taking into account the effect of five factors: the accumulative and increased numbers of confirmed cases, total population, population density, and GDP. We defined four levels of the risk, corresponding to the four response levels to public health emergencies in China. The classification system has good consistency among cities in China, as the error rate of the confusion matrix is 1.58%. Conclusions The pandemic risk of 2019-nCoV is dramatically different among the 442 cities/regions. We recommend to adopt proportionate control policy according to the risk level to reduce...","Background: Since the outbreak of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in China, respiratory manifestations of the disease have been observed. However, as a fatal comorbidity, acute myocardial injury (AMI) in COVID-19 patients has not been previously investigated in detail. We investigated the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients with AMI and determined the risk factors for AMI in them. Methods: We analyzed data from 53 consecutive laboratory-confirmed and hospitalized COVID-19 patients (28 men, 25 women; age, 19-81 years). We collected information on epidemiological and demographic characteristics, clinical features, routine laboratory tests (including cardiac injury biomarkers), echocardiography, electrocardiography, imaging findings, management methods, and clinical outcomes. Results: Cardiac complications were found in 42 of the 53 (79.25%) patients: tachycardia (n=15), electrocardiography abnormities (n=11), diastolic dysfunction (n=20), elevated myocardial enzymes (n=...","Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is a great public health concern globally. Although 83% of the globally confirmed cases have emerged in Saudi Arabia, the spatiotemporal clustering of MERS-CoV incidence has not been investigated. This study analysed the spatiotemporal patterns and clusters of laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV cases reported in Saudi Arabia between June 2012 and March 2019. Temporal, seasonal, spatial and spatiotemporal cluster analyses were performed using Kulldorff\u2019s spatial scan statistics to determine the time period and geographical areas with the highest MERS-CoV infection risk. A strongly significant temporal cluster for MERS-CoV infection risk was identified between April 5 and May 24, 2014. Most MERS-CoV infections occurred during the spring season (41.88%), with April and May showing significant seasonal clusters. Wadi Addawasir showed a high-risk spatial cluster for MERS-CoV infection. The most likely high-risk MERS-CoV annual spatiotempora...","Background: The 2019 Coronavirus (COVID-19) has turned into a global pandemic with unprecedented challenges for the global community. Understanding the state of the disease and planning for future trajectories relies heavily on data on the spread and mortality. Yet official data coming from various countries are highly unreliable: symptoms similar to common cold in majority of cases and limited screening resources and delayed testing procedures may contribute to under-estimation of the burden of disease. Anecdotal and more limited data are available, but few have systematically combined those with official statistics into a coherent view of the epidemic. This study is a modeling-in-real-time of the emerging outbreak for understanding the state of the disease. Our focus is on the case of the spread of disease in Iran, as one of the epicenters of the disease in the first months of 2020. Method: We develop a simple dynamic model of the epidemic to provide a more reliable picture of the st...","Respiratory virus infections in hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) recipients are a major cause of morbidity and mortality. While respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), human metapneumonvirus, parainfluenzaviruses, and influenza viruses are well known for their potential to cause fatal pneumonia, information is emerging only recently on the significance of the newly discovered viruses such as human coronaviruses NL63 and HKU1, and human bocavirus. Lymphopenia seems to be the most recent risk factors for progression to lower respiratory tract disease. Airflow obstruction is another complication of respiratory virus infections after HCT, and data to date indicate this complication may occur following parainfluenza virus and RSV infection. Infection control procedures are key for prevention. Unfortunately, there are no randomized treatment studies, which make the interpretation of the literature on interventions difficult. This article reviews the spectrum of pathogens, epidemiology, risk fa...","Abstract Risk factors associated with Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection outcome were established by analyses of WHO data from September 23, 2012 to 18 June 2018. Of the 2220 reported cases, 1408 cases, including 451 MERS-CoV deaths, were analyzed. The case fatality rate was 32% (95% CI: 29.4\u201334.5). Compared to MERS patients \u226430 years old, those with &gt;30 years had the adjusted odds ratio estimate for death of 2.38 [95% CI: 1.75\u20133.22]. This index was 1.43 [95% CI: 1.06\u20131.92] for Saudi patients in comparison to non-Saudi; 1.76 [95% CI: 1.39\u20132.22] for patient with comorbidity in comparison to those without comorbidity; 0.58 [95% CI: 0.44\u20130.75] for those who had close contact to a camel in the past 14 days and 0.42 [95% CI: 0.31\u20130.57] for patients with &gt;14 days with onset of signs and hospital admission compared to patients with \u226414 days.","Summary Background Since December, 2019, Wuhan, China, has experienced an outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Epidemiological and clinical characteristics of patients with COVID-19 have been reported but risk factors for mortality and a detailed clinical course of illness, including viral shedding, have not been well described. Methods In this retrospective, multicentre cohort study, we included all adult inpatients (\u226518 years old) with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 from Jinyintan Hospital and Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital (Wuhan, China) who had been discharged or had died by Jan 31, 2020. Demographic, clinical, treatment, and laboratory data, including serial samples for viral RNA detection, were extracted from electronic medical records and compared between survivors and non-survivors. We used univariable and multivariable logistic regression methods to explore the risk factors associated with in-hosp...","Since late December 2019 a new epidemic outbreak has emerged from Whuhan, China. Rapidly the new coronavirus has spread worldwide. China CDC has reported results of a descriptive exploratory analysis of all cases diagnosed until the 11th February 2020, presenting the epidemiologic curves and geo-temporal spread of COVID-19 along with case fatality rate according to some baseline characteristics, such as age, gender and several well-established high prevalence comorbidities. Despite this, we intend to increase even further the predictive value of that manuscript by presenting the odds ratio for mortality due to COVID-19 adjusted for the presence of those comorbidities and baseline characteristics such as age and gender. Besides, we present a way to determine the risk of each particular patient, given his characteristics. We found that age is the variable that presents higher risk of COVID-19 mortality, where 60 or older patients have an OR = 18.8161 (CI95%[7.1997; 41.5517]). Regarding c...","OBJECTIVE: Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is an emerging and easily clustering infectious disease. We describe an outbreak of SARS in a chest ward of a medical center in southern Taiwan and seek to identify the risk factors of those SARS patients who required mechanical ventilation. We focus on previous health patients. DESIGN: This retrospective case series was collected during the SARS outbreak. Degrees of severity were established, based on whether intubation and mechanical ventilation was necessary. SETTING: A 2500-bed medical center in southern Taiwan. PATIENTS: Forty-four patients exhibited symptoms that met the modified World Health Organization (WHO) definition of SARS. These included of three subgroups: health-care workers (n=16), relatives (n=14), and patients already admitted for other ailments (n=14). Of these, 20 eventually required mechanical ventilation. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Laboratory analyses showed statistically significant differences between intubated...","Abstract Background: A new virus broke out in Wuhan, Hubei, China, and was later named 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). The clinical characteristics of severe pneumonia caused by 2019-nCoV are still not clear. Objectives: The aim of this study was to explore the clinical characteristics and risk factors of the severe pneumonia caused by the 2019-nCoV in Wuhan, China. Method: The study included patients hospitalized at the central hospital of Wuhan who had been diagnosed with a pneumonia caused by the novel coronavirus. Clinical features, chronic co-morbidities, demographic data, laboratory examinations, and chest computed tomography (CT) scans were reviewed through electronic medical records. SPSS was used for data analysis to explore the clinical characteristics and risk factors of the patients with the severe pneumonia. Results: A total of 110 patients diagnosed with 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia were included in the study, including 38 with severe pneumonia and 72 with non-sev...","Objective: The 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) epidemic has raised international concern. Mental health is becoming an issue that cannot be ignored in our fight against it. This study aimed to explore the prevalence and factors linked to anxiety and depression in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Methods: A total of 144 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 were included in this study. We assessed depression and anxiety symptoms using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), and social support using the Perceived Social Support Scale (PSSS) among patients at admission. Multivariate linear regression analyses were performed to identify factors associated with symptoms of anxiety and depression. Results: Of the 144 participants, 34.72% and 28.47% patients with COVID-19 had symptoms of anxiety or depression, respectively. The bivariate correlations showed that less social support was correlated with more anxious (r=-0.196, p&lt;0.05) and depressive (r=-0.360\uff0cp&lt;0.05) symptoms among...","Abstract An emerging infectious disease (EID) is defined as a disease caused by a pathogen that has not been observed previously within a population or geographic location. Viruses are a major cause of EIDs, particularly \u2212ssRNA viruses. Many variables are involved in the emergence or reemergence of viruses. These can be classified into human factors, environmental/ecological factors, and viral factors and include urbanization, globalization, weather and climate change, and the genetic composition of the virus. The great majority of emerging viral diseases are zoonoses, notably transmitted by arthropods and nonhuman mammals. Flaviviruses include several notable vector-transmitted viruses, while rodents and bats are thought to be the natural reservoirs of arenaviruses and filoviruses, respectively. This chapter discusses several notable outbreaks of emerging and reemerging viruses, including the 2014\u201315 outbreak of Ebolavirus in West Africa.","As at 27 January 2020, 42 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) cases were confirmed outside China. We estimate the risk of case importation to Europe from affected areas in China via air travel. We consider travel restrictions in place, three reported cases in France, one in Germany. Estimated risk in Europe remains high. The United Kingdom, Germany and France are at highest risk. Importation from Beijing and Shanghai would lead to higher and widespread risk for Europe."],"title":["Impacts of social and economic factors on the transmission of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in

This is the start of the first of three stages in disease emergence described by Morse et al. [13 ] , and it is at this stage that surveillance of potential reservoirs at known hot spots [8 ] might provide the first enigmatic indication of the potential to spill over to infect humans and thus lead to that early crosstransmission event.","A main objective of this paper is to quantify the effect of various social and economic factors in mediating the transmission rates of the virus, which may help identify potential behavioral and socioeconomic risk factors for infections. For within city transmissions, we consider the mediating effect of population density, degree of economic development, number of doctors, and environmental factors such as temperature, wind and rain. To measure the spread of the virus from Wuhan, we include an estimate of the number of people traveling from Wuhan. The empirical model including these mediating variables is as follows,","The first case of inequalities can be attributed to behavioral and quality of life factors that depend on the socioeconomic level (unemployment, housing conditions, level of education, crime, alcohol, tobacco, food or work conditions affected by the social and professional status of the inhabitants). In the second case, the disparities should be attributed to the allocation of health-care resources that affect health service use (high costs, inability to participate in the costs, waiting time for a medical operation, availability of expert medical opinion doctors with specific experience and expertise, new technologies in micro-robotics or biotechnology, specialized staff for home health-care, complete and fast diagnostic procedures with subsequent effective treatment, etc.).","The severity of disease caused by lyssaviruses means that the potential for cross species transmission events (CSTs) is of significance to human and animal populations [6]. For the rabies virus, spill over events are considered as those that result in dead-end infection, whilst CSTs result in the sustained onward transmission of the virus in the new host. Spill over from bats species appears common for RABV in the Americas, whilst events involving the other lyssaviruses across the Old World appear to be rare. Whilst spill over events for lyssaviruses have been reported, host switching events are far rarer and have only been described for RABV in the Americas [5,7,8,9]. The factors involved in CSTs with the sustained onward transmission of the virus remain undefined, and endeavours to identify specific amino acid substitutions facilitating virus adaptation to new host species have been, on the most part, unsuccessful. Kuzmin et al. (2012) observed that for sustainability within a bat population, a Serine at position 242 in the viral G protein appeared to predominate, and that contrastingly, an Alanine/Threonine substitution at position 242 appears to facilitate RABV sustainability within the carnivore population [10,11]. Intensive characterisation of the genetics within viral populations, including quasispecies, may elucidate the molecular mechanisms that facilitate lyssavirus adaption, however opportunities to genetically characterise such events are rare. ","Surveillance programmes for bat lyssaviruses commonly report a diverse range of wild bat species apparently participating in the epizootiology of lyssaviruses. Spill over between ecologically distinct species appears to be common, with the divergence dates for viral clades often measured as evolutionarily recent events (i.e., &lt;1000 years) [88,138,139,140]. The sheer diversity of bat species associated as potential reservoir hosts to different lyssavirus species suggests historic spill over events and the subsequent maintenance of disease in novel hosts. This would have ultimately promoted new disease reservoirs and the speciation of lyssaviruses. From a host perspective, factors such as the fundamental ecology of roost choice by individual temperate bats, which may fall within geographical locations consistent with what is now defined as the EU, have mediated intraspecific and interspecific transmission events. ","Countries at the highest risk of importation, based on the current epidemic situation in China, had moderate to high capacity scores; however, these scores might correspond to different contributions to the mean SPAR indicators, reflecting different aspects of a country's functional capacity. For example, South Africa had the maximum score for laboratory capacity (100), but a low score in risk communication (20) . Conversely, Nigeria had a low score in the laboratory capacity (27) and the maximum score in the IHR Coordination capacity (100). Conversely, countries with the lowest SPAR capacity score (ie, Kenya, Tanzania, and Ghana) had moderate to low importation risk. The evaluation of additional factors (ie, demographic, socioeconomic, and political factors) included in the IDVI that might influence the overall potential effect of an unfolding epidemic identified several countries that had a significant impor tation risk with a low to medium IDVI, such as Nigeria, Ethiopia, Egypt, and Algeria. The risk of importation from other points of entry, such as seaports, was not evaluated.","All constructs of the HBM are underpinned by an individual's background and experiences. Thus, the community pharmacist should bear in mind the patient's demographic characteristics, socioeconomic status, and knowledge base. These things will interact directly with the constructs that comprise individual belief. In the United States, for example, persons of lower socioeconomic standing may not have access to all of the tools needed to overcome all perceived barriers to action. Persons of differing ethnic backgrounds may react differently to calls for social distancingdue to varying cultural attitudes and norms regarding interpersonal interactions. An exhaustive list of how all modifying factors may interact with other HBM constructs in the context of COVID-19 is beyond the present scope, though some thoughts on modifying factors will be provided when discussing other constructs of the HBM. As community members themselves, community pharmacists are uniquely positioned to understand how these factors may impact their patients. Community pharmacists are encouraged to consider how their patients' perspectives on COVID-19 may differ from their own, and to modify communication strategies accordingly.","Both SPAR and Joint External Evaluation metrics were designed to quantify each country's functional capacity, without accounting for other indirect factors that might compromise the control of emerging epidemics, such as demographic, environmental, socioeconomic, and political conditions. The Infectious Disease Vulnerability Index (IDVI) was introduced as a synthetic metric of vulnerability to account for these factors. 18 Another indicator, the INFORM Epidemic Risk Index, was developed by the EU Joint Research Centre in collaboration with WHO, to account for different combined effects of each country's epidemic transmission risk, infrastructure, vulnerability, and coping capacity. 19 For African countries where data were available, a multivariate analysis of these indicators showed a high correlation between SPAR and Joint External Evaluation indicators, and between IDVI and INFORM Epidemic Risk Index (appendix p 3). Given their coverage and complementarity, we selected SPAR and IDVI for our analysis. Both SPAR and IDVI indicators range from zero to 100, with increasing levels of capacity and decreasing vulnerability, respectively.","Briefly, the factors that this committee identified were the following: human demographics and behavior; technology and industry; economic development and land use; international travel and commerce; microbial adaptation and change; and the breakdown of public health measures. It is notable that five of these six factors are social factors that are consequences of changes in society. Even microbial adaptation and change, such as the development of antimicrobial resistance as a response to selective pressure, has a large behavioral dimension. This is partly a response to a technical innovation -the development of antimicrobials -and partly a response to a behaviorthe prescribing of those antimicrobials. Of course, one dimension of this factor is the nonselective and improper prescribing of antimicrobials. This has several dimensions: The prescription of antibiotics when none are needed, the prescription of broad-spectrum antibiotics when narrowspectrum antibiotics are sufficient, the free availability of antibiotics in many developing countries on the street and in pharmacies where no prescription is needed, and the free use of late-generation antibiotics in the food industry to promote the growth of cattle, chickens, and other animals intended for human consumption. So, in fact, all of the six factors of emergence are social and behavioral in nature.","Indeed, epidemiologic evidence should be linked with the seasonal time during the year for different zoonoses, and/or with any symptoms related to zoonotic infections that occur on the mainland a few years earlier. Up to date ecological factors on evolutionary issues, social movements, economic, and epidemiological mechanisms affecting zoonotic pathogens\u2019 or their persistence and emergence, are not yet well understood. However, studies on the ecological, socioeconomic, and health issues are needed to assess the sustainability and acceptability of measures by breeders, as well as information that ensures appropriate slaughtering or consumption practices, which will decrease the risk of infection to humans [200]. Due to these facts about the ecological cascade and evolutionary perspectives, authorities can provide valuable insights into pathogen ecology and can inform zoonotic disease control programs; and thus evaluate their global effect in terms of actual disease and its socioeconomic correlations.","Although public attention often focuses on CDC's infectious diseases and preparedness activities, most Americans will die from chronic diseases, such as heart disease, cancer, chronic lower respiratory diseases, and stroke. Common underlying risk factors for these conditions include tobacco use, uncontrolled hypertension, poor diet, physical inactivity, and high blood cholesterol. Surveillance systems supported by CDC, including the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, and the National Health Interview Survey, measure the prevalence of these conditions and risk factors and track these data over time. The Million Hearts Initiative, led by CDC and including other federal partners, aims to prevent 1 million heart attacks and strokes between 2012 and 2017 through a combination of public health interventions (reduction of smoking and intake of trans fat and sodium) and clinical interventions (improved blood pressure control and hypertension management, increasing aspirin use for high-risk individuals). CDC also leads the National Diabetes Prevention Program, a public-private partnership to prevent or delay the onset of type 2 diabetes in persons with pre-diabetes.","We find that the stringent quarantine and public health measures imposed in late January significantly decreased the transmission rate of COVID-19. By early February, the spread of the virus had been contained in China. While many socioeconomic factors moderate the spread of the virus, the actual population flow from the source poses a higher risk to the destination than other factors such as geographic proximity and similarity in economic conditions. Our analysis contributes to the existing literature in two aspects. First, our analysis is connected to the economics and epidemiologic literature on the influencing factors of and ways of preventing the spread of infectious diseases. Existing studies find that reductions in interpersonal contact from holiday school closings (Adda, 2016) , reactive school closure (Litvinova et al., 2019) , public transportation strikes (Godzinski and Suarez Castillo, 2019) , strategic targeting of travelers from high-incidence locations (Milusheva, 2017) , and paid sick leave to keep contagious workers at home (Barmby and Larguem, 2009, Pichler and Ziebarth, 2017) can reduce the prevalence of influenza.","The emergence of MERS-CoV nearly 10 years after SARS-CoV disappearance has shown that pathogenic coronaviruses may continue to spill over from zoonotic sources into the human population. Surveillance studies of viruses in animal species, including bats, rodents, and livestock, will help us to understand the potential human pathogens that exist in the environment before they can spill over human population. There are no antiviral medications available to treat MERS-CoV infections and the patient management is purely symptomatic. There is a need to develop vaccines and therapeutic strategies to prepare for the emerging coronaviruses. The sooner we understand the dynamics of current threats, the more we will be better equipped to save people from infection and disease.","A second type of primary prevention is antimicrobial prophylaxis, often referred to as chemoprophylaxis. Use of effective chemoprophylaxis requires that the infectious agent be susceptible to the antimicrobial drug used. As a primary prevention strategy, it may be used before or after exposure to prevent infection. Examples of chemoprophylaxis in the postexposure setting include erythromycin after exposure to pertussis; rifampin after N. meningitidis; amantadine, rimantadine, zanamir, or oseltamivir after influenza A virus; and zidovudine after HIV exposure. Use of antiretroviral drugs by HIV-infected pregnant women has been shown to substantially reduce the risk of perinatal HIV infection. 128 Prophylaxis against surgical wound infections with broad-spectrum coverage before surgery and prophylaxis of neonates against ophthalmia neonatorum are examples of chemoprophylaxis used in the hospital setting. In such situations, chemoprophylaxis is origin, socioeconomic status, and geographic location. For example, persons born outside the United States are at increased risk for infectious diseases such as tuberculosis and for being chronic carriers of infections such as hepatitis B. Screening programs targeted to these populations, with subsequent interventions such as isoniazid prophylaxis for persons with M. tuberculosis infection or immunization of susceptible household contacts of HBV carriers, can serve as important community-based strategies to prevent infectious disease occurrence. [115] [116] [117] Another example of defining risk at the community level is assessing behavior that increases the risk for specific diseases, such as injection drug use as a risk behavior for acquiring HIV or HCV infection. Education and drug treatment programs targeted to this population can serve as an important disease prevention and control strategy. Finally, assessing the population of species-specific mosquitoes and viability of local breeding sites can provide a risk assessment of the likelihood of vector-borne disease transmission (e.g., West Nile virus infection). 118, 119 In developing control programs, the feasibility of a strategy also needs to be assessed. Feasibility is dependent on the sociodemographic factors of the population involved. For example, high immunization rates can clearly prevent the occurrence of infectious diseases. In the United States, immunizations should be readily available; however, in the late 1980s, numerous large outbreaks of measles occurred in U.S. inner-city populations because of low immunization rates. 120 A variety of sociodemographic factors contributed to these low rates, such as inadequate access to medical care and other barriers to immunization. Until such barriers are removed and control strategies are developed to specifically target at-risk populations, adequate control of vaccinepreventable diseases in the United States cannot be accomplished. 121 Cost and availability of resources also need to be considered when developing control strategies. Adequate water treatment facilities and distribution systems in developing countries would do much to eliminate the spread of cholera. However, in many countries, resources to build and develop such facilities are not available. Consequently, control strategies need to be focused on simpler, less expensive methods, such as boiling water or improving water storage in the home.","With globalisation of human movement, increased density of human populations, climate change and loss of natural habitats, there is increased risk of interaction between species, and within species. This allows the emergence of infectious diseases by increased contact and cross-species transmission, as well as movement of infectious agents into geographic regions where they have not been found before. These types of drivers are discussed in the review by Heffernan (2018) , whilst the potential for spill-over between different hosts is highlighted in the systematic literature search by Glennon et al. (2018) .","In spite of these positive changes over the long term, there is little understanding within enrolled participants of the transmission mechanisms and ecology of zoonotic pathogens that currently circulate in animal populations in the region. This is of particular concern in rural communities where close contact with bats and rodents was reported, and zoonotic pathogens have been detected in the widely distributed animal populations with the potential to spill over into the human population.20,32\u201335 In addition, rural residents may face a higher risk because of their limited access to quality healthcare facilities for proper diagnosis and treatment compared with urban residents.36","Numerous viruses exist in European bat species, some of which currently no effective human or animal vaccines are available. Vaccination of bats, through their protected status in the EU is unlikely to ever be a viable option although developments in vaccine applications for chiroptera may have future applications in preventing the disease in wild bat populations [162]. For lyssaviruses, the OIE and WHO have targeted 2030 for the elimination of dog-mediated human rabies. It is possible that should this be achieved, the spill over of bat lyssaviruses may become more evident and host switching events may occur with pathogens for which there is no vaccine protection. Certainly, the recent detection of highly divergent lyssaviruses (LLEBV) and filoviruses (LLOV) in bats across the EU poses potential the risk to human populations, especially as vaccines or antiviral drugs against these viruses do not exist. Further studies are required to understand: the mechanisms of both maintenance and transmission of viral pathogens within bat populations; the zoonotic potential of viral pathogens detected in bats; and the risk of host switching events that may impact on human and animal health.","Of all the past and present (and probably also future) emergent infectious diseases, those caused by pathogens transmitted by arthropod vectors are the most sensitive to climate and most commonly assumed to have been driven by climate change. There is, however, no a priori reason to expect the rates of each system's biological and demographic processes to respond to changing patterns of temperature and moisture stress in ways that inevitably increase the risk of human (or livestock) infection. A prerequisite of reliable early warnings about the future is a system-specific explanation of the past. Tick-borne encephalitis (TBE), one of the two most widespread, prevalent and medically significant vector-borne diseases in Europe, will be presented as a case study. Epidemiological data at fine temporal and spatial resolution record major upsurges in incidence over recent decades. The timing, degree and abruptness of these upsurges differ markedly between countries, and even between districts within countries. A significant discontinuity in temperature conditions in 1989 across Europe could have created a generally more permissive environment for TBE virus transmission by improving the circumstances necessary for larval and nymphal stages of the tick to co-feed on rodents. The pattern of climate change, however, is too uniform within and between countries to provide the sole, or even the most important, explanation for the extreme spatio-temporal heterogeneity in TBE epidemiology. Instead, a nexus of interacting factors affecting both the risk of infection and exposure of humans to that risk, and each differing in force in space and time, is a more powerful model. Analysis of the situation in Central and Eastern Europe has established that many of these factors were driven by the socioeconomic changes associated with the end of Soviet rule, and include climate, land cover, land use, wildlife, agricultural practices, industrial activities, (un)employment and income. Western and Nordic Europe must be incorporated to achieve a coherent pan-European explanation. The same principles may apply to the periodic epidemics of Crimea-Congo haemorrhagic fever.","human pathogen in advance of a spill-over event. This is observed in the data. The 449","Containment measures in the COVID-19 outbreak have focused on identifying, treating, and isolating infected people, tracing and quarantining their close contacts, and promoting precautionary behaviors among the general public. Therefore, the psychological and behavioral responses of the general population play an important role in the control of the outbreak. Previous studies have explored on this topic in various culture settings with SARS, 4, 5, 6 pandemic influenza A(H1N1), 7, 8, 9, 10 and influenza A(H7N9). 11, 12, 13 Cultural differences are evident in public responses. 14, 15 Behavioral changes are also associated with government involvement level, perceptions of diseases, and the stage of the outbreak, and these factors vary by diseases and settings. 4, 5, 8, 16 The current COVID-19 outbreak provides a unique platform to study behavioral changes for two main reasons. First, government engagement in the control of the outbreak has been unprecedented, for example, locking down Wuhan and surrounding cities, building new hospitals to treat infected patients in Wuhan within two weeks, extending holidays and school closure, deploying thousands of medical staff to heavily affected areas, and running intense public messaging campaigns. Second, the public are faced with rather mixed information, partly because knowledge of the newly emerging disease is evolving with the course of the outbreak. For example, the national technical protocols for COVID-19 released by the National Health Commission have been updated five times within a month. Both features might result in different public responses towards the outbreak. In this study, we aimed to investigate psychological and behavioral responses to the threat of COVID-19 outbreak and to examine public perceptions associated with the response outcomes in mainland China.","Travellers are at increased risk to engage in sexual risk behaviour. Leaving the ''social control'' of the home country behind, making new acquaintances and maybe increased consumption of, e.g. alcohol might lower the threshold for sexual encounters with unknown partners. Reported rates of casual sexual experiences during travel vary from 5% to 51% [31] . In an Australian study only 34% of male travellers to Thailand stated not intending to have sex [32] . Men and women do not differ in their willingness to get to know new partners, but in their behaviour. Men more often pay for sex and, similarly to middle aged women, they are more likely to have sex with local partners. Younger women have sexual contacts more likely with fellow travellers and expatriates. Factors that are associated with a higher rate of casual sexual encounters in an individual include higher socioeconomic status, travelling alone or with people of the same gender, history of multiple sexual partners at home and repeated visits to a region [33] .","Most significantly, the DHQ exists to protect the transfusion recipient. The driving force for much of the DHQ involves screening for transfusion-transmissible infectious diseases. The greatest danger exists for diseases in which an undetected, asymptomatic carrier state exists at the time of donation. Often there are geographic or behavioral indicators that place a donor at increased risk for transmitting these diseases. The DHQ seeks to identify these risk factors to reduce the chance of disease transmission.","Cities are predicated on extensive and intense socioeconomic interactions. Many of their measurable properties -from the size of their economies, to their crime rates, to the prevalence of certain infectious diseases -are mediated by socioeconomic interactions. These interactions are subject to well known scaling effects, which are magnified by city population size (7) . All of these relationships are tied to socioeconomic networks with average degree (number of social connections per capita) that increases approximately as a power law of city size k(N ) = k 0 N \u03b4 , with \u03b4 1/6 (7, 8) .","Keeping the uncertainty considerations in mind (but not graphed due to clutter), Figure 4 shows results based on best-fit parameters. If our best case scenario on the reduction of contacts and benefits of seasonality for containment hold, the number of infected cases will peak soon at approximately 494,000 (90% CI: 274K-813K), and will go down later on. This optimistic scenario will still lead to over a million infections and some 58,000 deaths (90% CI: 32K-97K) by the end of June. The less aggressive scenarios point to continued spread of the epidemic. A reduction in contagion is realized only when reproduction number remains below one as a result of natural contact reduction in response to recent deaths, government interventions that reduce contacts, and seasonality. Among these three, the first (behavioral response) is endogenous to recent death rate. When death rate comes under control (due to the combination of all those factors), our model assumes the contract rate rebounds, weakening the first channel. Economic pressures, normalization of death, and behavioral modeling after the more risk seeking (or those already recovered and thus presumably immune) could all weaken the behavioral response when the perceived risks have faded. The increased contact would then, with a delay, bring up the death rate close to levels sustaining a reproduction number around or slightly above one. This creates a strong attractor in the dynamics where in steady state contact rate is high enough to sustain the contagion but not so high to lead to the rapid infection of all the population. Therefore it is only with strong weather and/or government interventions that reduced reproduction number brings the epidemic under control. This dynamic offers a cautionary tale against declaring victory early in the fight against the epidemic. However the actual magnitude of such rebound effect is not known in this setting and our data offers no guidance on the relevant parameters. Therefore these results are only qualitatively suggestive but not quantitatively reliable.","Inevitably, the health sectors are primarily reactive to these events, acting to save lives as well as undertake surveillance and control. The drama and panic typically fade into history with the substantial costs being absorbed by ordinary people, international financial systems, and tax bases, making life go on as normal, but not quite. The frequency, severity, and financial impacts of these events are growing, and the world can no longer afford to just wait and see, especially because prevention of these threats is in theory relatively simple and where addressed has resulted in a cessation of risk. The best example being Nipah virus, where separation of pig farms from fruit agriculture, and by the same measure, fruit bats, has substantially reduced the potential for Nipah virus spill over. Bats have always had viral populations, and despite close association with humans for millennia, this has not resulted in pandemics until recent times.","Inevitably, the health sectors are primarily reactive to these events, acting to save lives as well as undertake surveillance and control.

The estimations of R 0 are expected to vary substantially per locality depending on how public health officials communicate the risk to the general public, general beliefs and (dis)information available to the population, and other socioeconomic and environmental factors affecting contact rates. Our goal with this investigation was to develop the SEYAR mean field estimate, which can be applied to different locations to provide a measure of the potential impact of the disease.","Complications of coccidioidomycosis include pneumonia and disseminated disease [71] . Symptoms include cough, fever, and erythema nodosum [72] . Erythema nodosum has been reported to be a marker of good outcome in pregnant women [73] . Dissemination of disease in pregnancy is a controversial topic. Historically, dissemination was reported to be 40 to 100 times more frequent in pregnancy [74] . Caldwell and colleagues [72] found the incidence of dissemination in pregnancy to be 9%, three times the rate of the nonpregnant population. In their series, 23/32 recovered without treatment, and there were no deaths. Risk factors include living in an endemic area, smoking, older age, diabetes, and low socioeconomic status [71] . Treatment is with amphotericin B.","The special issue also touches on risk behaviors among marginalized populations. Wang and Shuanglong [16] explored generational differences in smoking, alcohol and dietary consumption behaviours among British minorities. They found that the second generation of migrants is more likely to smoke and consume alcohol and less likely to eat fruits and vegetables than white British, and identified a need for targeting second-generation ethnic minorities adopting unhealthy lifestyles. Pallesen et al. [17] conducted a study of the feasibility of a participatory intervention for improving dietary behaviour among ethnic minority women in Denmark. They reported that minority women of lower socioeconomic backgrounds easily engaged with a culturally relevant and acceptable cardiovascular disease prevention intervention, which positively motivated healthy dietary behaviour, and showed that, with the correct engagement, marginalized groups can have reduced dietary risks. Dearle et al. [18] also explored cultural factors related to risk for NCDs, examining knowledge and attitudes towards diabetes among Fijians. They investigated attitudes towards a traditional diet, the influence of family members, community beliefs, and awareness of diabetes, and found that effective intervention should incorporate cultural values and practices, emphasizing the essential role of family networks and church groups in conveying health messages. ","If the capacity of the hepatic lymphatics is exceeded, then lymph, high in protein, oozes from the hepatic capsule, presumably from the extensive lymphatic plexus there, and it may spill from the efferent lymphatics that pass from the porta hepatis to the cisterna chyli. In hepatic ascites, these efferent lymphatics become very large, numerous, and thick-walled.","Cytomegalovirus (CMV) causes congenital infections of newborns and can result in systemic disease in HIV and immunosuppressed patients. It is seen in the endothelial cells forming prominent intranuclear inclusions which spill into the cytoplasm where they form granular hematoxyphilic clusters. The CMV virus causes obvious cytomegaly in the cells it infects. All herpes viruses have an identical electron microscopic appearance of spherical, 120 nm, membrane-coated particles.","In humans, overt disease was given the name Middle East respiratory syndrome, with the acronym MERS. From intermittent animal-to-human spill-over events, the MERS-CoV spreads sporadically among people, causing more severe disease among older adults, especially males, with pre-existing diseases. The spread of MERS-CoV among humans has often been associated with outbreaks in hospitals, with around 20 % of all cases to date involving healthcare workers (HCWs).","International tourists who traveled abroad reached over 1.1 billion in 2014, and have been constantly increasing. The development of airline networks enables infectious pathogen to spread globally in a few days. Such typical situation was evident for the outbreak of SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) in 2003, when the unknown pathogen, which was later revealed to be a novel coronavirus, was disseminated from China to at least 17 countries within a week via air travel of infected patients. The recent outbreak of MERS coronavirus in Korea (2015) was also caused by a returnee from the Middle East. Spread of emerging viruses is indirectly related to socioeconomic problems including civil wars, an increase of refugees, and natural disasters. These human factors always compromise human health and increase the risk for emerging/re-emerging infectious diseases. ","An insufficiency of passenger data (eg, reason for travel [tourism vs business], nationality, age, sex, and socioeconomic status) also prevent us from accounting for different risk exposure of travellers to China. Travel flow data to estimate risk have already been validated against confirmed imported cases, 8 indicating that homogeneous assump tions on travellers' profiles and risk of exposure in China are enough to explain the exportations reported so far.","The preparedness and emergency response facilities available in laboratories include fire extinguishers for fire emergency response procedures. Wellmaintained spill kits are also available to handle chemical spills. The waste produced by laboratories has already been segregated, labeled, and stored according to type and then disposed of by a third party to prevent environmental pollution in the higher education institution area. Similar best practices have been previously observed in chemical safety and security baseline study. 18 ","Shanghai respondents carried out all six precautionary behaviors due to the outbreak. Wuhan residents were significantly more responsive than their Shanghai counterparts in the two aforementioned outcomes. Our results suggested that perceived risk and severity of the disease as well as information reliability were important factors associated with the psychological and behavioral responses.","The highest coefficient predictor in the model for Influenza A segment 1, which codes for the 303 PB2 polymerase gene, is a motif which represents a mammalian amino acid substitution 304 experimentally observed in a mouse model 24 . This mammalian adaptation was identified as 305 relevant to the temperature sensitivity of the polymerase in H5N1. The reversion of the avian 306 conformation containing the glutamic acid residue, to the mammalian conformation containing 307 offers another angle for interpretation, especially in regards to identifying possible spill-over or 353","Particularly, the COVID-19 pandemic has a different characterization in each country in which it has spread due to differences in surveillance capabilities of public health systems, socioeconomic factors, and environmental conditions. During the initial growth of an epidemic, Anderson et al. (16) derived the following formula to determine R 0 :","Before going to the main regression model, we also perform correlation test to examine whether multi-collinearity happens in our dataset or not. Table 2 represents the correlation among our variables. The socioeconomic factors have the lower correlated values while the mask features exhibit the strong correlation. Therefore, we are very cautious about multi-collinearity.","Addressing premature mortality and low growth of healthy years of life requires the development of measures for the prevention and health education that relate, for example, to smoking, alcoholism, poor diet and obesity, lack of exercise, sexually transmitted diseases, cancer screening, and generally changing health behavior that is affected by modern lifestyle, socioeconomic, and cultural factors.","All specimens must be pre-packed to prevent breakage and spillage. Specimen containers should be sealed with Parafilm s and placed in ziplock bags. Place enough absorbent material to absorb the entire contents of the Secondary Container (containing Primary Container) and separate the Primary Containers (containing specimen) to prevent breakage. Send specimens with cold packs or other refrigerant blocks that are self-contained, not actual wet ice. This prevents leaking and the appearance of a spill. When large numbers of specimens are being shipped, they should be organized in a sequential manner in boxes with separate compartments for each specimen.","There are different susceptibilities to the 2019-Novel Coronavirus in different regions of China as well as different regions of the world. However, as this is the second coronavirus emerging from China, it is unlikely that herdimmunity is lower in this region of the world, than in others. Immunogenetics and socioeconomic factors however, may potentially contribute to differences in susceptibilities to the disease.","Several theories of Nipah virus\u2019 emergence have been posited (Davies and Unam, 1999; Mohd Shahwahid and Othman, 1999; Field et al., 2001; Chua et al., 2002; Motavalli, 2004). Ecological theories of emergence include hypotheses that fire haze from slash-and-burn agriculture negatively affected fruiting trees and led bats to seek out fruit trees planted around pig farms. Though the ecosystem-scale drivers of bat foraging behavior are poorly understood, certainly the proximity of fruit trees and intensive pig farms allowed bats and pigs to come into close contact, which allowed spill-over of the Nipah virus from its reservoir host into domestic pigs, and then to humans.","Research on safe types of socioeconomic contact and exchange is therefore paramount so that we can succeed in controlling this outbreak while maintaining livelihoods, socioeconomic capacity, and mental health. This can in principle be done through approaches that make the most of emerging, real-time data to create context appropriate suppression strategies at local, regional, national, and global levels.","The country's functional capacity is well advanced and sustainable at all levels of health systems. the use of independently verified data would be useful (eg, external assessments such as joint external evaluations) for a review of this nature, this limitation is minimised by the fact that SPAR data has been shown to correlate strongly with externally evaluated data such as the Joint External Evaluation results. 21 Several factors affect the emergence and spread of an infectious disease outbreak within countries and between regions, including the strength of IHR capacities at the national and subnational levels, adherence to infection prevention and control measures, climate-related pressures, and the density of populations. 8, 16, 22 When an outbreak is caused by an airborne pathogen, population density or crowding is known to directly affect spread of infection. 22 Analysis of other risk variables associated with tackling an infectious disease outbreak and managing health emergencies would benefit understanding of existing country capacities, including vulnerabilities due to socioeconomic conditions, comorbid conditions, and lack of health infrastructure, which we did not take into account.","Infections that spill over into humans from an external reservoir have the potential to cause epidemics with substantial morbidity and mortality, particularly if there is limited pre-existing immunity in the host population [1, 2]. However, novel pathogens do not always transmit efficiently when first introduced into human populations. Outbreaks of infections such as Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) [3, 4] and monkeypox [5] have generally occurred as \u2018stuttering chains\u2019 of transmission [6], generating a relatively small number of linked clusters of cases without evidence of sustained transmission. Infections such as influenza A(H5N1) [7] and A(H7N9) [8] also appear to be subcritical at present, having so far failed to transmit efficiently between humans.","Socioeconomic factors may also contribute to transmission, associated with poor health care. One example is the 2014 West Africa Ebola virus outbreak, first-line health care workers were infected, because of lack of knowledge as well as the unavailability of proper personal protective equipment (Kilmarx et al., 2014) . Person-to-person transmission during the 2001 Bangladesh NiV outbreak was also thought to be a result of poverty-induced sharing of eating utensils and food with the infected person (Br\u00fcssow, 2012) .","Those involved in transporting specimens should be trained in safe handling practices and spill decontamination. Spills of small volume of blood/body fluids (&lt;10 ml) are cleaned with chlorine containing (5000mg/L) disinfecting wipes, while for large volume spills, higher concentrations of chlorine containing disinfectant (10,000 mg/L) or peroxyacetic acid is used. Bronchoscopes should be disinfected with 0.23% of peroxyacetic acid followed by high level of disinfection in an automatic washing and disinfection machine if available, and sterilized finally with ethylene oxide (14) . Wherever possible, dedicated medical equipment should be available while caring for patients with known or suspected COVID-19. All non-dedicated, non-disposable, medical equipment used for patient care should be disinfected according to manufacturer's policy (7, 8) .","Zoonosis contributes to the majority of emerging disease in the last 30 years, many of them originated from wildlife animals. 51e55 The story of SARS is just one of such examples that spectacularly demonstrated the seamless evolution of a bat virus into a human pathogen responsible for one of the most severe global pandemic outbreaks in modern history of mankind. In general, pathogens carried by wildlife reservoir animals usually do not cause clinical symptoms and they lie dormant until they spill over into and cause diseases in domestic animals or humans. Classical outbreak response measures, such as those deployed during the SARS outbreaks, are still useful, but no longer sufficient for early detection and prevention of major infectious disease outbreaks in the 21st century.","\"influenza-like illness\" symptoms of rapid onset, fever, cough, headache, and myalgia. Despite a coordinated system to provide influenza vaccine (flu shots) each fall, influenza is implicated in as many as 20,000 deaths each year. 8, 9, 63 Psychosocial Influences Common colds are influenced by a variety of biological, psychological, and social factors. Numerous cross-sectional and prospective epidemiological studies have provided relatively consistent findings. [14] [15] [16] Colds occur most frequently among infants and children, and among adults in contact with them. Children who are in preschool daycare have more colds than those who are not, but have fewer colds during subsequent school years. 64, 65 While moderate regular exercise protects against infection, excess activity, such as running a marathon, increases risk temporarily. 31, [66] [67] [68] Poor mental health has been shown to be associated with increased risk. 69, 70 Stress, both acute and chronic, is known to increases ARI risk. [71] [72] [73] Sheldon Cohen first demonstrated this by showing that perceived stress predicted not only whether volunteers would become sick when exposed to rhinovirus, but whether and to what extent they would shed virus. [74] [75] [76] Childhood socioeconomic status, 77 number and quality of social relationships, 78 and negative emotion 79, 80 have also been shown to predict viral shedding, as well as severity and duration of cold symptoms. Subsequent studies have corroborated these findings. 62, 71, [81] [82] [83] [84] Building on this background, my research team conducted a randomized trial finding that training people in mindfulness-based stress reduction can lead to substantive reductions in ARI illness episodes. [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] An earlier study by Dr. Rakel and I on placebo effects and the influence of doctor-patient interaction indicated that empathetic patient-oriented clinicians may be able to positively influence common cold outcomes. 85 The common cold is an excellent example of how the mind and body interact. Stress can increase susceptibility while social support can reduce incidence. Perceived empathy of caregivers may also reduce illness severity and duration."],"title":["Reservoirs and vectors of emerging viruses","Impacts of social and economic factors on the transmission of
