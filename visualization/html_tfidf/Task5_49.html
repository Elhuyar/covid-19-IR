The ZStat Flu, QuickVue Influenza, and Binax Now FluA and FluB are currently CLIA-waived which allows for in-clinic testing. The features of the different assays have been summarized recently (Nicholson et al., 2003) . Unfortunately, reported sensitivities and specificities of these various tests cannot be directly compared, since different 'gold standards', source populations, sample types (fresh versus frozen; nasal versus throat), and operators (i.e. research laboratory versus clinical laboratory versus physician office) were used to evaluate each test. Use of a particular rapid diagnostic test for influenza should be determined according to the level of identification needed (influenza A or B versus influenza A and B), price, CLIA status, specimen type, staff familiarity with methods, turn-around-time, and relative sensitivity and specificity of the test. Additionally, the predictive value depends on the prevalence of disease. For example, if the sensitivity and specificity of the test was 80%, and the prevalence of influenza was 5%, the positive predictive value (PPV) of the test would be 17%; if the prevalence was 20%, the PPV would be 50%. Rapid testing is best used in individuals with a strong pre-test probability of influenza during the influenza season. When clinically important (for example, in hospitalized patients), negative rapid test results should be confirmed by culture.","Enhancing the quality of bundle care in patients with Ventilator associated pneumonia through crossdisciplinary teamwork Wan-Ling Hsu, Ni-Huang Lin, Yi-Hsuan Chen. Department of Nursing, Taipei Tzu Chi Hospital, Buddhist Tzu Chi Medical Foundation Background: Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) commonly occurs in intensive care unit patients who have a tracheal tube. In Taiwan, approximately 13.7-25.3% of hospitalized patients contract VAP, which has a mortality rate of 20-33%. Hospital infection control center reported the VAP infection rate in our medical intensive care units was 1.17\u2030 in 2015, which was higher than the nationwide in medical centers (0.6\u2030) and which has steadily increased. Accordingly, hospitalization days and medical costs in Taiwan have risen. For this study, we collaborated with the infection control center, respiratory therapist team, information management center, and medical quality management center to develop and implement a bundle care intervention to reduce the VAP infection rate. Methods: A medical intensive care unit that has 45 patient beds and which averages a 96.4% occupancy rate was adopted for this study. Through cross-team cooperation and brainstorming, we analyzed several crucial factors related to VAP, and developed a VAP bundle care scale by referring to previous studies for investigating medical employees' knowledge of VAP bundle care procedures. The results showed that their knowledge varied, and that they did not adopt consistent care standards or have adequate daily assessment tools. In response, we invited external infection control experts to train hospital medical personnel on how to provide bundle care, modify daily VAP care standards (e.g., raising bedhead to 30\u00b0-45\u00b0, adopting daily sedation cessation, using 0.2-0.12% chlorhexidine gluconate for oral care, draining ventilators water, and washing hands), provide training, develop a daily care assessment form, and establish an information sharing platform. Results: In this study, we modified VAP bundle care standards and the medical team enhanced their knowledge of VAP bundle care through classroom learning and digital training videos. Through visual management and reminders from an information system, the accuracy of the VAP bundle care increased from 44.6% to 95.9%. Moreover, the VAP infection rate reduced from 1.17\u2030 to 0.44\u2030. We found that when bedheads were raised to 30\u00b0-45\u00b0, alert conscious patients could not fall asleep and experienced sacrum pain; accordingly, these patients refused this care procedure.","During crises, health care resources should be allocated in an ethical, rational, and structured way to do the greatest good for the greatest number of patients. Hospitals and health systems must set aside a \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d mentality and focus on how best to accommodate the patients likely to benefit the most from care. Specifically, a plan that outlines what services and types of procedures will be provided (for example, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation) and what will not (for example, elective cases) must be developed. Accordingly, clinical guidelines for use (or denial) of scarce services, such as mechanical ventilation and critical care, should be outlined, in consultation with ethics and medical staff. A protocol that defines how patients will be triaged for admission, observation, early discharge, and quarantine is important. Hospitals should anticipate that normal staffing ratios and some standards of care are unlikely to be maintained; plans for contingency and crisis standards that lay out a legal and ethical framework for care decisions, including who will make decisions, how, and under what circumstances, must be readied. At Michigan Medicine, scarce resource guidelines have not only been developed, but portions have been revised and circulated to staff to ensure agreement and buy-in for execution.","Given the lack of a general awareness and understanding of an EUA before the 2009 H1N1 public health emergency declaration, the CDC EUA website serves as an educational resource for health care providers and the general public by posting essential information regarding legal and regulatory aspects of an EUA, specific product-related information, and answers to potential questions regarding acquisition and administration of product. RA was also involved in the development of an electronic system through which health care providers may request peramivir under the EUA, which has facilitated access to this medical countermeasure for hospitals around the nation.","A 1918-type pandemic would likely disrupt supply chains and cause severe shortages in supplies and equipment. In fact, we have already seen this with prior influenza epidemics. 13 Of note, the COVID-19 outbreak significantly disrupted Chinese manufacturing in February 2020 and resulted in the worst monthly production numbers ever recorded in China. 17 Given the potential volume of patients, the lack of resources and likely shortages of material and personnel, we may need to use crisis standards of care in order to accommodate all the additional patients. 8, 18 We may be forced to clean and re-use equipment that is typically disposable. We may need to change our standards of care, expand the responsibilities of unqualified or underqualified personnel and change our practices. 18 Will this be good medicine? I think the answer is clearly no. As noted above, crowding in the ED results in prolonged time to antibiotics, increased mortality and generally poorer care and outcomes. 5, 6, 7 However, we will do our best, with what we have, to save as many lives as possible.","The accreditation standards can be used effectively to guide the surgical teams in the transformation of the specialty. The 17 standards are divided into nine subsections that relate to the activities of the teams. The subsections represent the continuum of clinical care as well as aspects related to learning. Within the subsections and standards are opportunities for surgeons and surgical teams to use the standards to effectively deliver services and to continuously improve patient care.","In 2001, the CCHSA introduced the Achieving Improved Measurement (AIM) Accreditation Programme. The Canadian approach to accreditation is a rigorous peer review process comprised of a self-assessment against a set of standards, an on-site survey and follow-up action on recommendations that arise from the survey. In Canada, the process occurs over a three-year cycle. The standards are national in scope and allow for both standardisation and benchmarking against similar organisations throughout Canada. The standards were developed and are updated using a broadly based consultation process with input from healthcare professionals across Canada. The standards address patient care issues within a quality framework that defines the programme. The quality framework is applicable to the organisation as a whole and is based on four quality dimensions: Responsiveness, System Competency, Client/Community Focus and Work-life. The quality dimensions represent a balanced scorecard relevant to healthcare organisations within which organisations may structure their quality improvement initiatives. Surgery and all other care teams function within this framework. While the quality framework underpins the accreditation programme, it also forms a basis for delivery of acute care services such as surgery.","In 2017, a National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care survey reported ED patient visits reached over 138 million in that year. 3 That was a 21% increase from 113.9 million visits in 2003 and an average annual growth of 1.7% per year. That number represents 42.8% of the entire U.S. population of 329 million. 4 These high volumes and the resulting crowding in the ED do and continue to compromise care. Of note, prior studies have shown that ED crowding is linked to increased patient mortality, decreased patient satisfaction and treatment delays. [5] [6] [7] In addition to the daily crowding issues, U.S. disaster preparedness is currently in poor condition. The ED is the frontline medical response to any disaster and, yet, it is already stretched to its limit. Currently, one of the federal government's strategies to deal with a J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f potentially overwhelming catastrophic disaster that outstrips resources is to engage in -crisis standards of care.\u2016 8, 9 That is, if overwhelmed, the federal government has advised states to create guidelines for hospitals to allocate scarce resources to save the greatest number of lives. 8, 9 Such strategies are to be utilized in only the most dire of situations (e.g., severe pandemic, catastrophic event) in which medical resources are completely outstripped. Our current problem with ED volumes predisposes the system to cross this threshold during a disaster.","A key success factor for creating an architecture for public health applications is that the application must be useful to a surveillance officer. If surveillance officers cannot change the surveillance targets in a timely manner, they cannot meet their public health objectives. Therefore, the architecture, in order to be successful, must be flexible enough to allow both existing and new applications the ability to adapt to new surveillance targets so that surveillance officers can collect and analyze their data efficiently. In the ALPHA architecture, the data elements and data types collected within IDSS were easily modified after the surveillance officer required different data elements. Also, in another application, the Canadian Tuberculosis Reporting System (CTBRS), we were able to adapt to a set of different disease data forms. In both cases, the changes were made through configuration without modifying the underlying code. Another key to the success of an architecture for public health applications is that the applications should assist users to enter or retrieve data efficiently so they can spend less time on administrative tasks and more time on their primary work (e.g., health care professionals spend more clinical time with patients, surveillance officers and analysts spend more time analyzing data). In the ALPHA architecture, feedback from the surveillance analysts has indicated this objective has been met, since they now have the ability to configure access to specific disease elements.","There are efforts among regional plant protection organizations (RPPOs) to harmonize quarantine standards between the member countries. There are nine RPPOs (Asian and Pacific PPO; Caribbean Plant Protection Commission; Comite de Sanidad Vegetal del Cono Sur; Comunidad Andina; European and Mediterranean PPO (EPPO); InterAfrican Phytosanitary Council; Near East PPO; North American PPO; Organismo Internacional Regional de Sanidad Agropecuaria and Pacific PPO (Roy, 2011) ). There are also efforts at harmonizing certification standards across some of the RPPOs, such as for fruit trees and grapevines in NAPPO countries, and the EPPO countries have adopted certification schemes for 20 crops (Roy, 2011; EPPO website) . These RPPO-developed standards are often a minimum standard that is required, but member countries can require a more stringent standard internally. Although this is happening at the international level, there are many cases where the harmonization of certification programs within countries has not happened. In countries where these programs are regulated at the province or state level, there are often significant differences between the certification standards. For example, in the United States some states require that the G1 plants for some crops be maintained within protected culture (screenhouse) to minimize vector transmission of pathogens, whereas other states do not require that same level of protection. Also, the type and level of testing required at each level in the certification scheme can vary between states. There is an effort underway to harmonize certification standards for some of the fruit crops across the United States. As these programs are developed, they are looking at certification schemes in other countries and RPPOs with the goal of harmonizing standards on a broader scale if possible.","Of note, these amendments to the FD&amp;C Act also renewed the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) that was first enacted in 1992, and authorized the FDA to collect user fees from companies. These fees enabled FDA to hire additional reviewers and support staff and upgrade its information technology systems. In return for these additional resources, the FDA agreed to certain review performance goals, such as completing reviews of new drug applications and biologics license applications (BLAs) and taking regulatory actions on them in predictable timeframes. These changes revolutionized the drug approval process in the United States and enabled FDA to speed the application review process for new drugs and biologics without compromising the FDA's high standards for demonstration of safety, efficacy, and quality. ","The mission of RA is to support the critical task of ensuring availability and use of medical countermeasures that are essential to CDC's preparedness and emergency response programs. RA executes this mission by ensuring regulatory compliance regarding critical medical countermeasures against potential threats from natural, chemical, biological, radiological, or nuclear (CBRN) events. To enable rapid and effective response during emergency events that require appropriate use of medical countermeasures, many of which are only available through CDC, RA is responsible for ensuring that appropriate regulatory mechanisms such as Investigational New Drug (IND) applications, Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) requests, and Investigational Device Exemptions (IDEs) required for deployment and use of medical countermeasures are in place. RA also provides regulatory expertise to CDC subject matter experts and principal investigators regarding use of medical products (e.g., drugs, biologics, devices) for both nonresearch and research purposes.","Under the EUA for N95 respirators, FDA authorized four models of respirators for use by the general public to help reduce the wearer's exposure to airborne germs during the public health medical emergency. (\"General public\" is a broad term and includes people performing work-related duties.) If respirators are used for people performing work-related duties, employers must comply with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's Respiratory Protection Standard (29 CFR 1910.134; see www.osha.gov for more information). The EUAs for oseltamivir and zanamivir allow the approved products to be used for unapproved indications. The EUAs allow these products to be used in patients who are symptomatic for more than 2 days and in patients who have complicated illness requiring hospitalization. The EUA for oseltamivir also extended product use to include an unapproved population by authorizing and providing dosing recommendations for pediatric patients younger than 1 year of age. Additionally, given the potential product shortage, the EUAs allowed extended use of certain lots of oseltamivir and zanamivir products beyond their labeled expiry dates based on FDA review of supportive stability and potency data (additional details regarding expired product available at www. In addition to the development and submission of the above EUA requests, RA created the CDC EUA website (www.cdc.gov/ h1n1flu/eua) to provide essential information relating to FDAissued EUAs and to organize all of the EUA-related materials for educating outside audiences such as state/local health de-SPECIAL FEATURE PHARMACISTS AND REGuLATORy AFFAIRS AT CDC partments, health care personnel, and the general public about EUAs. At the time of this writing, it has received more than 360,000 visits and was still being viewed daily.","It is increasingly important that surgeons and surgical programmes engage in the elements of a learning organisation if effective surgical care is to be delivered. The accreditation standards relating to planning of services and population health have been of particular importance recently because of the changes in surgery. Many hospital beds have been taken out of service in Canada despite growing volumes of surgery. This has been enabled due to the explosive growth of day surgery and minimally invasive surgery. The decrease in bed complements has also made it necessary for surgical teams to use care maps (clinical pathways) based on the application of best practices for efficient movement of patients through surgical units. Continuous quality improvement, research and the application of new methods and programmes are hallmarks of modern surgical practice and benchmarking is widely used to compare local practices with peer organisations.","In the CMS guidance, 1 many restrictions that have roadblocked telehealth adoption for decades have been removed to promote \"good faith use of telehealth\" in these unprecedented times. To preserve both patient and society's trust, medical communities must hold our standards for professionalism and quality care high. Adherence to state regulations, 2 thorough clinical intake, clear and consistent video connectivity and images, documentation, patient education and transparency, care coordination, data security, and patient privacy should remain a top priority, even in times of crisis. If a non-HIPAA compliant platform is used initially, conversion to a HIPAA-compliant platform should be encouraged as soon as possible.","Synopsis: The emergency preparedness and response activities of three pharmacists from the Regulatory Affairs program (RA) at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) are described. RA helps ensure availability and use of medical countermeasures that are essential to preparedness and emergency response programs at CDC by ensuring regulatory compliance of medical countermeasures against potential threats from natural, chemical, biological, radiological, or nuclear events. RA responded to the 2009 pandemic influenza A (H1N1) outbreak by submitting multiple Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) requests to the Food and Drug Administration, including those for medical countermeasures to be deployed from the Strategic National Stockpile, and developing the CDC EUA website.","Several different regulatory approaches can be applied to hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) such as those derived from cord blood, peripheral blood, and bone marrow. The regulatory approach taken for a specific product is determined by the clinical use and method of manufacturing of the HSC product. For both umbilical cord blood and unrelated allogeneic peripheral blood stem cells, the FDA has called for data to determine the feasibility of regulating some of the lower risk uses of HSCs through a standards-based approach. 2 This proposed approach requires cell-processing establishments to register, ensure that they meet standards for safety, and use FDA-approved donor screening test kits. Finally, autologous or allogeneic cord blood, peripheral blood, or bone marrow stem cell products will be regulated under IND if more than minimal manipulation occurs, the cell product is combined with a drug or device, or the intended use is considered to be nonhomologous. Although the field of stem cell biology has produced evidence that stem cell activity for a variety of lineages can be demonstrated in cord blood, peripheral blood, or bone marrow cell preparations, the FDA will regard use of these products for anything beyond hematopoietic reconstitution as nonhomologous use until a clearer scientific picture emerges.","Background: Catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTI) are the most common health care-associated infections (HAI) in medical intensive care units (MICU), accounting for 30-40% of all HAI. CAUTIs prolong hospital stay and exacerbate mortality rate. According to the 2016 nosocomial infection records provided by the Infection Control Center of Taipei Tzu Chi Hospital, the infection density of CAUTIs in MICU was elevated to 4.17\u2030 and medical costs increased. Therefore, the collaboration practice team assembled from Infection Control Center and Center of Quality Management promote the bundle care intervention. Methods: The collaborating team surveyed the bundle care intervention through brainstorming and cause-and-effect analysis. After reviewing literatures, the team investigated the current states of indwelling catheter implementation of three aspects: the \"care knowledge,\" \"placement,\" and \"care checklist.\" Different understandings of the bundle care process were survey for medical team. The completion rate of accurate catheter care calculated from nursing team scoring. Daily evaluation instruments for catheter placement and care investigated. Finally, the team invited external infection control experts to MICU for intervention measures of bundle care implementation, standards of the placement and daily care, professional training sessions, instructional films for placement, daily care for patients, and a digitized platform for daily care evaluation. The team expected that these measures would alleviate the CAUTI rate. Results: The research team enhanced health care professionals' knowledge of bundle care intervention for CAUTI through revised standard operating procedures of indwelling catheter placement and care, lecture instructions, and self-learning via instructional films. Furthermore, this study ensured accurate implementation through an objective structured clinical examination (OSCE), group discussions, and subsequent audits. The CAUTI infection rate was decreased from 4.17\u2030 to 1.68\u2030, indicating the effectiveness of the intervention.","The FDA's CBER regulatory review staff consists of an internal multidisciplinary team of scientists, medical officers, and regulatory and public health professionals. To stay current on scientific advances and biotechnologies, the team is involved in a dynamic exchange of information with the outside scientific community through laboratory research and collaborations, participation in workshops and seminars, and engagement with national partners. The FDA also relies on the expertise of formal advisory committees, which include experts in the fields of vaccinology, microbiology, infectious diseases, immunology, biostatistics, epidemiology, and clinical trial design. In addition, CBER works closely with its counterparts in other U.S. government agencies within the Department of Health and Human Services and the U.S. Public Health Service (PHS), such as the National Vaccine Program Office, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the NIH, and the Health Resources and Services Administration. The CDC is responsible, among its other duties, for epidemiologic surveillance of disease and for support of immunization programs. Its Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices makes recommendations for vaccine use. The Director of the National Vaccine Program Office coordinates vaccine efforts throughout the PHS and other governmental agencies. The NIH is responsible for conducting and providing funds for a wide variety of biomedical research. The Health Resources and Services Administration is responsible for managing the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program. Other important collaborators inside the U.S. government involved in vaccine activities include the U.S. Department of Defense, and the Department of Veterans Affairs. Additionally, CBER works closely with its multilateral partners, notably the Pan American Health Organization and the World Health Organization (WHO), to provide assistance in regulatory capacity building. CBER has been very active in supporting the WHO's Developing Countries' Vaccine Regulators Network and the WHO's African Regional Office-led African Vaccine Regulatory Forum. As a WHO Collaborating Center, CBER contributes to a range of activities, including establishment of physical and written standards, implementation of WHO international standards, strengthening global regulatory systems, and serving as the National Regulatory Authority (NRA) of reference for WHO's vaccine prequalification program. CBER experts also contribute as members of several WHO Advisory Committees including the Global Advisory Committee on Vaccine Safety, the Polio Research Committee, the HIV Vaccine Advisory Committee, and the Expert Committee on Biological Standardization. CBER is an Essential Regulatory Laboratory in WHO's Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System. In addition, the FDA has confidentiality arrangements with many NRAs around the globe, allowing it to share information as part of its regulatory processes. These arrangements have strengthened interactions between the regulatory authorities and have contributed to improving the promotion and protection of public health globally.","Congress passed the Consumer Safety Act of 1972 and transferred regulatory authority from NIH to FDA for the administration of the 1944 PHS Act. In 1972, the Division of Biologics Standards, which was charged with administering and enforcing Section 351 of the PHS Act, was transferred by the Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare to the FDA, and became the Bureau of Biologics. Once administrative responsibility for the regulation of biologicals was transferred from NIH to FDA, the FDA announced its intention to require that all new biologicals satisfy the additional standards of safety and efficacy mandated in the Drug Amendments Act of 1962. This resulted in the transfer of the regulations pertaining to biologics from Part 73 of Chapter I of Title atric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective.","The Sphere Handbook, a collection of rights-based guidelines for humanitarian response, is the foremost authority on minimum standards for humanitarian assistance [7]. However, despite the indisputable evidence for the efficacy of hand hygiene for reducing both bacterial and viral pathogen transmission, humanitarian WASH standards are based on evidence pertaining to the prevention of illnesses transmitted by the faecal-oral route, with the focus on hand hygiene proximate to latrines [5, 8]. And yet, latrines in crisis settings are often shared and distant from residential shelters, conferring a high risk of gender-based violence [9]. Gender-based violence around latrines is an important deterrent for accessing latrine-adjacent handwashing stations, particularly for hand hygiene to prevent respiratory pathogen transmission.","The government encourages the development of diagnostic reagents, vaccines, and medicines as well as prophylactic equipment (e.g., infrared thermometers). China's national vaccine regulatory system was confirmed to meet WHO standards in 2011 [34]. China has developed SARS, H5N1, H1N1, and H7N9 vaccines (Table 1) and became the first country to use an H1N1 vaccine [35]. China now produces oseltamivir (like Tamiflu\u00ae) and peramivir (like Rapivab\u00ae), obviating the need to import antivirals [35].","Member States have defined common objectives emanating from the Lisbon Strategy as well as monitoring indicators and analytical tools through the Progress Program to improve the capabilities of comparative analysis, knowledge transfer, mutual learning, better coordination, and strategic planning. The directions of the OMC for social protection and the basic indicators of an ongoing pan-European research should be expanded and revised regularly as for example, the indicators of material deprivation (digital exclusion), of affluent households, life expectancy, and the transition from work to retirement. 18 The directions of the OMC as an intergovernmental cooperation method on accessible, quality and sustainable health-care, and long-term care, focus on the following: l Access for all to adequate health-care and long-term care, ensuring that the need for care does not lead to poverty and financial dependency while at the same time addressing inequalities related to access to care and the results of health services. l Quality in health-care and long-term health care and adjustment, including preventive care, to the changing needs and preferences of society and individuals, primarily through the development of quality standards that meet international best practices and through the development of a higher sense of responsibility among health professionals and patients and recipients of care. l Sustainability of adequate and quality health-care and long-term care through the rational use of resources and mainly through appropriate incentives for users and providers, good governance and coordination between care systems and public and private entities. Long-term sustainability and quality also require the promotion of a healthy and active lifestyle as well as the existence of good human resources for the health-care sector.","Emergency use authorization (EUA) is another regulatory mechanism by which the FDA can accelerate the availability of vaccines and other pharmaceutical products. Under an EUA, the FDA can authorize the use of an unapproved product or the unapproved use of an approved product when an emergency or a potential emergency exists. Section 564(b)(1) of the Federal FD&amp;C Act was amended by the Project BioShield Act of 2004 to allow the Secretary of Health and Human Services (Secretary) to authorize the introduction into interstate commerce of a drug, device, or biological product intended for use in an actual or potential emergency. Before an EUA may be issued by FDA, the Secretary must declare an emergency justifying the authorization based on:","Within Canadian healthcare organisations, surgery is accredited as an acute care service or as an acute care service within a regional health district. In larger hospitals or healthcare regions, subspecialties may be accredited using the same standards. Surgery representatives also frequently participate in Critical Care teams, Cancer Care teams and Ambulatory Care teams, reflecting the changes that have transformed surgical practice recently.","Improve the integrity of oral care for nurses in the prevention of ventilator-associated pneumonia Shwu-Hwa Leu 1 *, Mei-Ju Su 1 , Li-Yao You 1 , Shu-Chun Chang 1 , Yueh-Chen Fu 1 , Hsia-Ling Wu 1 , Li-Chu Li 1 , Chin-Yu Chen 2 , Tzu-Ping Shih 2 , Wen-Chih Wu 3 , Cho-ching Sun 4 Background: The use of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) for the intensive care unit quality indicators to monitor important items,not only will extend the hospital stay will increase the cost of medical care (Ashraf &amp; Ostrosky-Zeichner, 2012), so there is a systematic introduction to prevent the combination of care, remodel the correct concept of staff care, the implementation of unified and more effective care measures in the combined care, but also to respirator patients with oral care is more important, Expect effective prevention of VAP, improve patient cleaning and comfort, in order to enhance the professional care and service quality. In April 2016, The team used technical audit and observation methods. The average correct rate of nursing staff was 73.3%, and the integrity of oral care was only 68.7%. First, the newly transferred personnel to protect the lack of awareness (19.7%); Second, the lack of appropriate care products can be used (21.8%);Third, there is no relevant care operation check mechanism and standard operating practices (16.2%), so the purpose of this project is to improve the integrity of oral care to 95%. Methods: In order to improve the integrity of oral care for nursing staff, improvement measures are made every month from June to September, 2016. 1. Participate in TRM competition and external expert clinical guidance. 2. Improved care products and equipment, use multi-functional aspiration toothbrush,oral denture and 0.2% Chlorhexidine oral cleaning gel to mouthwash. 3. System to prevent the prevention of VAP care standards: revised special oral care technology, and develop the use of breathing apparatus operating instructions. 4. Implementation of VAP care check and reward: internal check, outside the hospital inspection counseling, Bundle protection angel recognition and implementation of the incentive system. Results: June 2016-May 2017prevention of VAP care integrity check results care integrity 99.4%, Nurses' knowledge of oral care increased from 81.2% to 100%; And maintain VAP zero case. Conclusion: Since the introduction of modular care, the unit has been effective in preventing infection and significantly improving peer awareness and care skills. Effective teamwork can increase the efficiency of the work, in the process of care, while buy and use the new improved care products, not only more convenient and effective; the current hospital has been promoted to the implementation of the respiratory care ward, To share the unit to promote the implementation of experience, in order to achieve the purpose of maintaining patient safety and improve the quality of medical services.","The COVID19 pandemic has driven rapid change management for many healthcare settings nationally. These rapid changes have caused many healthcare systems, including our own, to move from Conventional capacity, to Contingency capacity delivery in a matter of weeks. It is hoped that Contingency capacity in addition to federal, state, and local government recommendations for social distancing and other measures to reduce transmission, will help avoid a need for Crisis care. However, it is important to develop a strategy for delivery of palliative care in both the Contingency capacity and Crisis capacity. This document details the UW Medicine's experience with Palliative Care Response Planning and we offer this approach for other institutions to adopt and adapt to their local setting. This strategy has several important limitations. First, we describe the strategy for a single healthcare system with a relatively mature palliative care program. Certain aspects of this strategy may not generalize to other locations. Second, this strategy is undergoing constant modifications and is a work in progress. However, we thought that it would be useful to share it with others early given the rapid expansion of this pandemic. Finally, it is important to acknowledge that this strategy is a plan that has not been fully implemented. We are actively using the conventional and some of the contingency capacity approaches, but some contingency and all crisis capacity strategies have not been tested.","Policies and guidelines should also mention implementation of a comprehensive respiratory protection program for respirator use, which includes selection of certified respirators, training and fit checking and testing, and inspection, maintenance and storage ( Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) 2002 ). Certified respirators should be used in healthcare settings and certification processes should be managed by a regulatory body, for example in the US the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health regulates the certification process under regulation 42 CFR 84 ( National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) 1995 ). Similarly, in Europe, the European Norm standard ( European Directive ) and in Australia, AS/ NZS 1716 standard regulates respirator use ( Standards Australia Limited/Standards New Zealand 2012 ). All guidelines, except the WHO and the Australian guidelines, briefly discuss the need for fit testing but do not provide detail on fit testing procedures. The WHO and the Australian guidelines do not mention fit testing and instead mention fit check (or seal-check) which is not equivalent to fit testing. All guidelines however highlight the importance of training for respiratory (and other personal protective equipment) use.","The issues of continuity of care are well addressed by the accreditation standards and have an impact on all types of surgical practice. Transition to home with appropriate follow-up of day surgery patients is addressed in the standards. CQI projects reported include follow-up telephone contact and the impact on re-admission to emergency rooms, programmes to reduce post-operative nausea and vomiting, and pain control. The importance of continuity of care by house staff has been well documented and include benefits for residents, improved patient compliance and decreased healthcare costs. 16","Following the attacks of September 11, 2001, and the 2001 anthrax events, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) increased efforts for the procurement and development of medical countermeasures for CBRN threats. Consequently, CDC's role as the lead agency responsible for preparedness and response to public health emergencies involving bioterrorism Category A agents (e.g. smallpox, botulism, anthrax, plague, viral hemorrhagic fevers, tularemia) and other emerging public health threats (e.g. avian influenza, 2009 pandemic influenza A [H1N1], monkeypox, severe acute respiratory syndrome) also expanded. One of the notable expansions has been the management of medical countermeasures for these CBRN and emerging threats. The medical countermeasures stockpiled in CDC's Strategic National Stockpile consist of drugs, biologics, and devices. These medical countermeasures can be used for the treatment, mitigation, or prevention of serious or life-threatening conditions/diseases resulting from CBRN or other potential public health threats. Many of these medical countermeasures are considered investigational products (i.e., unapproved products or unapproved uses of approved products) by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Moreover, additional medical countermeasures for CBRN and public health threats that are under development or are being considered for procurement are investigational and are not anticipated to have FDA approval prior to stockpiling. Therefore, these investigational medical countermeasures require FDA-regulated mechanisms such as IND applications, IDE applications, EUA requests, or other FDA-regulated applications for receipt into stockpile and for deployment and use in response to a potential or actual public health event. As a result of this expansion, it became essential for CDC to prepare and submit, in a timely manner, high-quality IND and IDE documents to FDA. RA is the entity within CDC responsible for centralizing and ensuring CDC's consistency in submissions and communications with FDA. RA fulfills its responsibilities of ensuring appropriate regulatory mechanisms for stockpiling, deployment, and use of investigational medical countermeasures. Additionally, RA ensures compliance with laws and regulations (applicable parts under Code of Federal Regulations Title 21) enforced by FDA, which are delivered through the specific activities of but not limited to coordinating, drafting, reviewing, submitting, and maintaining the applications regulated by FDA [e.g., IND, IDE, EUA, 510(k)]. These activities ensure that the deployment and use of Strategic National Stockpile investigational medical countermeasures and other medical countermeasures only available through CDC (e.g., therapeutics for rare diseases in the United States such as parasitic and tropical diseases) adhere to FDA regulations.","Generation of RNA transcript standards for qRT-PCR validation A barrier to implementing and validating qRT-PCR molecular assays for SARS-CoV-2 detection was the availability of virus RNA standards. As the full length SARS-CoV-2 RNA is considered as a biological safety level 2 hazard in the US, we generated small RNA transcripts (704-1363 nt) from the non-structural protein 10 (nsp10), RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), non-structural protein 14 (nsp14), envelope (E), and nucleocapsid (N) genes spanning each of the primer and probe sets in the China CDC 7 , US CDC 6 , Charit\u00e9 5 , and HKU 4 assays ( Fig. 1A ; Table 1; Supplemental Tables 1-2 ) 10 . By measuring PCR amplification using 10-fold serial dilutions of our RNA transcript standards, we found the efficiencies of each of the nine primer-probe sets to be above 90% ( Fig. 1B ) , which match the criteria for an efficient qRT-PCR assay 11 . Our RNA transcripts can thus be used for assay validation, positive controls, and standards to quantify viral loads: critical steps for a diagnostic assay. Our protocol to generate the RNA transcripts is openly available 10 , and any clinical or research diagnostic lab can directly request them for free through our lab website ( www.grubaughlab.com ). (A) We reverse-transcribed RNA transcript standards for the non-structural protein 10 (nsp10), RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), non-structural protein 14 (nsp14), envelope (E), and nucleocapsid (N) genes to be used for validation of nine primer-probe sets used in SARS-CoV-2 qRT-PCR assays. (B) We generated standard curves for nine primer-probe sets with 10-fold dilutions .

Without the adaptation of existing standards, mitigation plans will fall short of health and human rights obligations in outbreak response. Crisis-affected community engagement is integral in pandemic planning, in order to maximize the real-world effectiveness of efficacious interventions. Transparent and credible information-sharing mechanisms are increasingly essential when pandemics threaten vulnerable populations [10]. Diplomacy bridging long-standing mistrust of public health and biomedical interventions and facilitating engagement with contentious actors is a necessary component of effective health governance in complex crisis settings [2]. Interventions tailored to the needs of crisis-affected populations, delivered with transparent information, in the context of inclusive governance practices, are urgently needed in the global response to the COVID-19 pandemic.","Oxygen bottles, regulators and masks must meet minimum safety standards set by the regulatory authorities, and the oxygen must be of 'aviation' quality, which is a higher specification than 'medical' quality. ","The FDA's CBER is the national regulatory authority in the United States charged with the regulation of biological products including vaccines. These regulations cover not only the methods and establishment standards pertaining to the manufacture of a biological product to assure that the product is safe and meets the quality and purity characteristics that are claimed by the manufacturer, but also requirements for performing clinical trials (i.e., 21 CFR \u00a7312).","National regulatory authorities stipulate the minimum scale and standard of all equipment to be carried on aircraft operating under their jurisdiction, which includes emergency medical equipment. These standards stipulate the minimum requirement, although in practice many airlines carry considerably more equipment.","Improvement of ventilator-associated pneumonia bundle care through teamwork in an intensive care unit Yu-Hsia Wang*, Li-Hsueh Chen, Nai-Zhen Hou. Department of Nursing, Tainan Municipal Hospital Background: With a mortality rate approaching 35-90%, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) accounts for 13-18% of health care-associated infections (HCAIs). Patients receiving mechanically assisted ventilation have more risks for acquiring pneumonia compared with patients not receiving ventilatory support and the risk for acquiring pneumonia increased 1% per day. Prevention is better than cure. Therefore, caring for patients on mechanical ventilators is especially important. It's expected that implementation care bundles improved HCAIs rates and ensure high care quality. Methods: Care bundles including care of ventilator circuit, daily assessment of sedation, oral hygiene, head of the bed elevation to 30-45\u00b0, intermittent subglottic secretion drainage, and drain from ventilator circuit was implemented from January, 2015. The incidence of VAP was higher than other hospitals during initial implementation stage and the causes were lack of knowledge of care bundle strategies, low implementation rate, lack of unified mouthwash ingredients, lack of standards and auditing practice, low correction rate (50%) in care practice. For strengthening implementation of infection control measures, the changes in institutions, management, and human behavior were needed, hence the measures included education programs, evidence-based research, innovative approach, VAP guideline and audits through multidisciplinary team work. Results: Care quality improved. In addition, staff's knowledge about VAP increased from 70% to 100% and accuracy and implementation of care achieving 100% via audit. The analysis of control chart for monitoring rate of VAP indicated that the process was under control with dramatic improvement by comparison with other hospitals. The other benefits included higher rate of ventilator weaning and lowered infection rate. Conclusion: The use of teamwork builds safety culture and contributes to further promote compliance with care bundles. The changes in institute, management and staff's behavior not only improve quality of health care but also assure patient safety, and benefits of hospitals, health workers and government.","As shown in Fig. 5 , a hypothetical decision tree may link the possibility to import or block the exportation to the shortage impact score established with the constant part of the algorithm (Fig. 2) . For high/ medium impact medicinal products, the importation should be allowed during an ongoing shortage. In the case of high-impact products, fast authorization procedures should also be adopted to speed up the importation from other EU (parallel imports) or extra-EU countries with similar pharmaceutical quality standards to the EU, from which the medicine can be exported without any ripple effect. On the other side, it may not be convenient in the case of low-shortage-impact products, since therapeutic alternatives are available at the National level, and they may worsen the shortage situation in other European countries. However, the importation of medicinal products should always be allowed in exceptional cases, such as a substantial reduction of the National supply of all therapeutically equivalents or specific patients' needs justified by their clinical conditions (e.g., allergies to excipients, rare metabolic diseases). Moreover, a similar decision tree can also be used to support National Competent Authorities in the adoption of regulatory pathways such as Art. 126a of Directive 2001/83/EC to ensure the availability of medicines in a specific market, particularly for those with a high shortage impact on public health.","The International Plant Protection Convention (IPPC) is an international agreement on plant health to which 181 countries are signatories. The Secretariat of the IPPC is provided by the Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations. The IPPC has the mission to protect cultivated and wild plants by preventing the introduction and spread of pests and pathogens. They develop standards (International Standards for Phytosanitary Measures (ISPMs)) that are recognized by participating countries and provide for science-based standards for the safe movement of plants and plant products. As an example, ISMP No. 28 (Anonymous, 2007b) provides recognized standard treatments to eliminate plant pathogens and pests, including fumigation, cold treatment, heat treatment, and irradiation; and ISMP No. 31 (Anonymous, 2008) provides agreed on sampling levels that participating countries use when shipping plants or plant products internationally to protect against movement of quarantine pests and pathogens. The IPPC develops standards for range of issues related to plant protection. Once the standards are approved by the IPPC member countries, they become an ISMP.","Anti-IgG and anti-IgM antibodies were detected using Human SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM Chemiluminescence Analysis (CLIA) Assays panel (Shenzhen YHLO Biotech Co.,Ltd., Shenzhen, China) and the high-speed CLIA system iFlash 3000 (Shenzhen All rights reserved.

Literature reviews that hospitalized patients CAUTI high medical-related infections the highest, accounting for about 36%. According to the empirical medical literature, it can be seen that the combination of care measures can effectively reduce CAUTI, so the unit to promote the prevention of urinary tract infection combined care measures, hoping to reduce the rate, to provide high-quality medical care. Methods: Started implementation of CAUTI Care Bundle in January 2015 for all patients with catheters. According to the literature, five nursing measures were established: (1) Daily assessment of whether the catheter can be removed; (2) Hand hygiene should be performed when care of the catheter; (3) Daily check the catheter for fixation; (4) Confirm the catheter drainage system to maintain a closed, sterile and smooth; (5) Clean the urethra with soap or water every day. Use checklist daily to check whether or not all care is performed. Through the establishment of consensus, operational standards revision, improvement of care tools and education and training and other intervention measures to implement. Through the audit mechanism and CAUTI detection, the results of feedback units to discuss and improve. Results: Between January 2015 and December 2015, urinary tract infection is still the most common infection site in the intensive care unit, accounting for 57.14% (4/7), slightly lower than the intervention before the 1.68%. In the case of no significant difference between the date of hospitalization and the previous year, the number of indwelling catheters decreased from 2264 days to 2060 days. CAUTI decreased from 4.05\u2030 to 1.46\u2030. Conclusion: The Care bundle is effective in reducing CAUTI while improving health care-related infections and improving patient safety. Enhance the intensive care unit to prevent health-associated infection.","is the (which was not peer-reviewed) The copyright holder for this preprint . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.23.20039446 doi: medRxiv preprint care workers, in the NQU and NBU facilities, preventing health care worker infections. Health care workers were closely monitored and screened for COVID-19 suggesting the value in implementing IPC protocols that maintain airborne isolation standards including respiratory protection and include routine systematic environmental cleaning and disinfection of patient care areas and surrounding environments. ","Several recent publications have addressed the issue of expansion of intensive care in an epidemic [31] [32] [33] . Rubinson and colleagues [32] have recommended modifying usual standards of care, termed ''emergency mass critical care practices,'' to maximize the number of patients treated. Others feel that over-stretching resources and deploying unfamiliar staff may backfire and result in staff infection, as well as a standard of care too poor to be of value. However, most investigators agree that there is a need to develop some surge capacity in response to an epidemic. Preparations include stockpiling positive pressure ventilators and medical supplies, adapting general hospital beds for critical care delivery, augmenting and training staff, enhancing infection control measures, and conducting preparedness exercises. To this end, many local, state, and national bodies have developed such stockpiles and disaster management plans. It is incumbent that all critical care practitioners be aware of these resources and plans . The Appendix lists resources for pandemic influenza planning and preparedness.","Certification standards vary widely among crops and regulatory authorities. The viruses included in a certification program can vary from country to country or state to state. An excellent example is grapevines where certification in Italy includes more viruses than programs in Germany or France; or grapevine certification in Washington State is different from California. Some of these differences are due to environmental considerations, where infection by a pathogen may cause severe disease in one setting, such as crown gall in grapevine in New York State, but be latent or symptomless under different environmental conditions, such as crown gall in grapevine in California. Attempts to harmonize certification schemes across boundaries to facilitate trade of plants without increasing trade in plant pathogens will require certification programs to account for disease expression by pathogens in areas where the certified plants may be sold, rather than only where the nursery stock is produced. In the United States, where certification programs are regulated by individual states, there are efforts underway in multiple crops (blueberry, grapevines, hops, Rubus, strawberry, and fruit trees) to develop a single certification standard that all states with programs for that crop would adopt. If successful, this in essence would provide a national program for certification of these crops. As this process is developing, there is an ongoing communication with trading partners to harmonize these standards as much as possible with their certification programs to facilitate international trade.","Licensed establishments are inspected at least every 2 years. The purpose of the inspection is to determine whether licensed products are manufactured and tested as described in the license application and in accordance with applicable regulations. Manufacturers who fail to meet product standards or who are not in compliance with CGMPs may have their licenses suspended or revoked, depending on the nature of the potential health hazards created. The major issues observed during inspections can be categorized in three major areas: (1) process-related issues, (2) quality unit-related issues, and (3) facility-and production environment-related issues. Some examples of process validation issues include lack of documentation of time limits for major steps in the production process, lack of validation of rework or reprocessing steps in the manufacturing process, and lack of data to support in-process specifications. Quality unit-related issues include the appropriate reporting of out-of-specification results and process deviations (including adequate investigations into causes), appropriate documentation of product release, and adequate training of personnel. Facility and production monitoring concerns include controlling production environments by appropriately monitoring heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) system performance and microbial quality (e.g., pressure differentials, appropriate sampling sites, and frequency of sampling). Other concerns pertaining to the facility include adequate cleaning, sanitization, storage, and changeover procedures for multiproduct areas and equipment. If the inspection team finds CGMP deficiencies in an already licensed facility, the team may remain in the facility until they have achieved an audit that provides confidence in the ability of the firm to reproducibly manufacture a safe and potent product.","CDC has been tasked by HHS with the critical oversight of ensuring availability and use of medical countermeasures against CBRN and emerging threats. RA, in coordination with CDC subject matter experts, supports this task by initiating and developing protocols, executive summaries, fact sheets and related supportive documents required for regulatory mechanisms, such as INDs, EUAs, and IDEs. RA serves as CDC's authorized representative on submissions to FDA and as CDC's representative at HHS Integrated Product Team Meetings (i.e., smallpox, anthrax, botulism, radiation/nuclear) and participates at HHS EUA Working Group meetings.","The standards and criteria in this subsection include the framework for patient safety, safe and effective delivery of medications, adverse event reporting and management and crisis management. It also includes the patient and family role and responsibilities in the service delivery plan.","One of the greatest challenges in emerging epidemics is uncertainty amongst HCW about transmission risks, and fear of becoming a victim of the outbreak disease. ICU is a high-risk area where a larger number of ''high transmission risk'' procedures are performed. Clear concise communication and leadership are critical to tackle stress, fear, fake news and mistrust during the crisis [32] . Staff morale is vulnerable and emotional support should be proactively made available. Frontline staff must be made to feel safe by constant exposure to clear protocols and rigorous training. Expansion of critical care beds to cope with increased numbers of patients by opening more ICU beds, and converting wards and other monitored areas for ICU provision is often recommended in outbreak disaster plans. However, experience from SARS-CoV showed that rapid and excessive expansion may overwhelm staff, lead to excess infections in HCW, and compromise care [33] . Thus, expansion should be matched by safe staffing to guarantee an appropriate quality of care and staff safety, which necessarily limit expansion. It has been suggested by an expert consensus group with first-hand experience of outbreak expansion that this is realistically limited to a maximum of 50-100% of baseline capacity [34] . Alternatively, restricting normal critical care to provide only core and essential provisions, may allow greater expansion and more patients to have limited life sustaining interventions under conditions of limited resources [35] . Should these measures be overwhelmed, individual patient triage and appropriate rationing of ICU care will be required to provide greatest benefit for the Editorial / Anaesth Crit Care Pain Med xxx (2020) xxx-xxx greatest number of patients [36, 37] . A structured triage approach incorporating triage admission criteria that can adapt to the scale of crisis, are fluid and adaptable depending on the evolution of the outbreak and change in response to resource pressures is necessary. A process of development and implementation that provides transparency, an appeal mechanism, documentation of decisions and that is culturally and socially sensitive is recommended [34] .","Numerous authors have described approaches to disaster preparedness and responses for events such as natural disasters and pandemics to guide decision-making about use of resources to allow the greatest good for the greatest number. Many of these approaches use a continuum of medical care scenarios including Conventional care, Contingency care and Crisis care. [5] [6] [7] These proposals highlight that the primary objective in a disaster is to remain in conventional and contingency care in order to avoid crisis care, which will compromise patient outcomes. In conventional care, usual resources and level of care are provided. 5 In contingency care, the goal is to provide functionally equivalent care adapted from usual practices with approaches such as boarding critical care patients in post-anesthesia care areas.","1.

The focus of accreditation is to help organisations understand what they are doing well and what opportunities are available for improvement. The Canadian approach to accreditation is a rigorous peer review process comprised of a self-assessment against a set of standards, an on-site survey and follow-up action on recommendations that arise from the survey. The accreditation standards can be used effectively to guide the surgical teams in the transformation of the specialty. The 17 standards that are used to evaluate surgical teams relate to the activities that represent the continuum of clinical care as well as aspects related to learning.

Setting Atlanta, GA. Practice description RA consists of a staff of nine members, three of whom are pharmacists. The mission of RA is to support CDC's preparedness and emergency response activities and to ensure regulatory compliance for critical medical countermeasures against potential threats from natural, chemical, biological, radiological, or nuclear events. Conclusion RA was well involved in the response to the H1N1 outbreak through numerous activities, such as submitting multiple Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) requests to the Food and Drug Administration, including those for medical countermeasures to be deployed from the Strategic National ...","Abstract Medicine shortages have been spreading in European countries. In many cases, the unavailability of medicinal products has a substantial impact on the capability of National Healthcare Systems in ensuring the continuity of care. Shortages originate from multifactorial causes. In particular, they can be due to supply-related factors (e.g., manufacturing issues, regulatory issues, logistics, distribution) and demand-related ones (e.g., fluctuating drug demand, parallel market, tendering, price and reimbursement policies). However, some extraordinary geopolitical events (e.g., Brexit) may also affect medicines\u2019 availability. The capability of European Regulatory Authorities and other stakeholders, which are involved in the pharmaceutical distribution chain and the healthcare assistance services, to define suitable problem-solving strategies has been limited for years by the fragmentation of the European regulatory framework, starting from the lack of a univocal definition of a med...","Abstract Introduction The COVID-19 pandemic is stressing healthcare systems throughout the world. Significant numbers of patients are being admitted to the hospital with severe illness, often in the setting of advanced age and underlying co-morbidities. Therefore, palliative care is an important part of the response to this pandemic. The Seattle area and UW Medicine have been on the forefront of the pandemic in the US. Methods UW Medicine developed a strategy to implement a palliative care response for a multi-hospital healthcare system that incorporates conventional capacity, contingency capacity, and crisis capacity. The strategy was developed by our palliative care programs with input from the healthcare system leadership. Results In this publication, we share our multi-faceted strategy to implement high-quality palliative care in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic that incorporates conventional, contingency, and crisis capacity and focuses on the areas of the hospital caring for ...","The recent spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) exemplifies the critical need for accurate and rapid diagnostic assays to prompt public health actions. Currently, several quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) assays are being used by clinical, research, and public health laboratories for rapid detection of the virus. However, it is currently unclear if results from different tests are comparable. Our goal was to evaluate the primer-probe sets used in four common diagnostic assays available on the World Health Organization (WHO) website. To facilitate this effort, we generated RNA transcripts to create standards and distributed them to other laboratories for internal validation. We then used these RNA transcript standards, full-length SARS-CoV-2 RNA, and RNA-spiked mock samples to determine analytical efficiency and sensitivity of nine primer-probe sets. We show that all primer-probe sets can be used to detect SARS-CoV-2, ...","ABSTRACT \u2022 ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY and improved surgical techniques have led to new therapeutic uses for allografts. \u2022 DISEASE TRANSMISSION via allograft tissue transplants has prompted federal intervention in the tissue banking industry and resulted in federal regulations. \u2022 NEW STANDARDS from the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations became effective July 1,2005, and apply to all hospitals that store or implant allograft tissues. These standards include mandatory policies on all aspects of hospital transplantation programs, including tissue ordering, receipt, storage, issuance, and record keeping. AORN J 82 (November 2005) 806\u2013814.","Abstract This paper describes a proposed Strategic Vaccine Facility (SVF) to provide a capability to the UK to deal with new and emerging disease threats. It would underpin the vaccine manufacturing industry by developing expertise and technology to enable rapid manufacture of small batches of vaccines for emergency use against agents, such as bioterrorist agents and emerging diseases. It would have a rare ability to work with dangerous pathogens under containment, allowing the production of inactivated and live vaccines, which would be difficult in a conventional plant. The facility's output will include vaccine candidates and manufacturing protocols for transfer to industry, small vaccine batches for emergency use or clinical trials, and vaccine reference standards. It would also be available for manufacturing small batches of experimental and public health vaccines for the UK and the developing world, allowing clinical trials to be undertaken against key diseases.","Abstract Concept of \u201crisk analysis\u201d in food safety management needs to be understood to assess, manage, and communicate risks for proper implementation of food safety policies, food laws, and standards, in a country. Science-based approaches, which are an integral part of risk analysis to improve modern food safety systems, are intimately linked to processes such as good quality practices. Risk analysis strengthens the ability of traditional food safety systems to meet current challenges. Risk analysis is just one part of an effective food safety system. Other components of food safety system like food safety policies, food legislation, food inspection, laboratory analysis, epidemiological surveillance of food-borne diseases, monitoring systems for chemical and microbiological contamination in foods, and information, education and communication, also need to be improved continuously. \u201cFood safety controls\u201d are now being replaced by \u201crisk-based controls\u201d in all stages of food production...","The number of confirmed COVID-19 cases admitted in hospitals is continuously increasing in the Philippines. Frontline health care workers are faced with imminent risks of getting infected. In this study, we formulate a theoretical model to calculate the risk of being infected in health care facilities considering the following factors: the average number of encounters with a suspected COVID-19 patient per hour; interaction time for each encounter; work shift duration or exposure time; crowd density, which may depend on the amount of space available in a given location; and availability and effectiveness of protective gears and facilities provided for the frontline health care workers. Based on the simulation results, we recommend the following: (i) decrease the rate of patient encounter per frontline health care worker, e.g., maximum of three encounters per hour in a 12-hour work shift duration; (ii) decrease the interaction time between the frontline health care worker and the patient...","As the Coronavirus (COVID-19) expands its impact from China, expanding its catchment into surrounding regions and other countries, increased national and international measures are being taken to contain the outbreak. The placing of entire cities in \u2018lockdown\u2019 directly affects urban economies on a multi-lateral level, including from social and economic standpoints. This is being emphasised as the outbreak gains ground in other countries, leading towards a global health emergency, and as global collaboration is sought in numerous quarters. However, while effective protocols in regard to the sharing of health data is emphasised, urban data, on the other hand, specifically relating to urban health and safe city concepts, is still viewed from a nationalist perspective as solely benefiting a nation\u2019s economy and its economic and political influence. This perspective paper, written one month after detection and during the outbreak, surveys the virus outbreak from an urban standpoint and adva...","BACKGROUND: A novel coronavirus of zoonotic origin (2019-nCoV) has recently been identified in patients with acute respiratory disease. This virus is genetically similar to SARS coronavirus and bat SARS-like coronaviruses. The outbreak was initially detected in Wuhan, a major city of China, but has subsequently been detected in other provinces of China. Travel-associated cases have also been reported in a few other countries. Outbreaks in health care workers indicate human-to-human transmission. Molecular tests for rapid detection of this virus are urgently needed for early identification of infected patients. METHODS: We developed two 1-step quantitative real-time reverse-transcription PCR assays to detect two different regions (ORF1b and N) of the viral genome. The primer and probe sets were designed to react with this novel coronavirus and its closely related viruses, such as SARS coronavirus. These assays were evaluated using a panel of positive and negative controls. In addition, ...","Summary Indoor ventilation with good air quality control minimises the spread of airborne respiratory and other infections in hospitals. This article considers the role of ventilation in preventing and controlling infection in hospital general wards and identifies a simple and cost-effective ventilation design capable of reducing the chances of cross-infection. Computational fluid dynamic (CFD) analysis is used to simulate and compare the removal of microbes using a number of different ventilation systems. Instead of the conventional corridor air return arrangement used in most general wards, air return is rearranged so that ventilation is controlled from inside the ward cubicle. In addition to boosting the air ventilation rate, the CFD results reveal that ventilation performance and the removal of microbes can be significantly improved. These improvements are capable of matching the standards maintained in a properly constructed isolation room, though at much lower cost. It is recomme...","Abstract Objective MERS-CoV infection is uncommonly identified among patients visiting healthcare facilities &amp; we were vigilant in screening all patients entering our hospital to prevent cross infection among patients, visitors &amp; healthcare providers and aiming to prevent potential outbreaks with MERS-CoV infection. In spite of our efforts on practicing Failure Mode Effect Analysis for MERS-CoV infection management we ended up having an outbreak with MERS-CoV. Based on our experience, we actively implemented policies, procedures &amp; practices on early identification &amp; appropriate isolation practices along with supplemental infection prevention &amp; control measures for preventing future outbreaks at our healthcare facility. Methods Retrospectively we analyzed our failure in preventing the outbreak of MERS-CoV infection among our hospitalized patients by identifying the outbreak &amp; actively intervening as a team to control the outbreak with the support of Hospital Higher management, Administr...","Abstract The goal of syndromic surveillance is the earlier detection of epidemics, allowing a timelier public health response than is possible using traditional surveillance methods. Syndromic surveillance application for public health purposes has changed over time and reflects a dynamic evolution from the collection, interpretation of data with dissemination of data to those who need to act, to a more holistic approach that incorporates response as a core component of the surveillance system. Recent infectious disease threats, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), avian influenza (H5N1) and pandemic influenza (H1N1), have all highlighted the need for countries to be rapidly aware of the spread of infectious diseases within a region and across the globe. The International Health Regulations (IHR) obligation to report public health emergencies of international concern has raised the importance of early outbreak detection and response. The emphasis in syndromic surveillance ...","Abstract Background With its epicenter in Wuhan, China, the COVID-19 outbreak was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO). While many countries have implemented flight restrictions to China, an increasing number of cases with or without travel background to China are confirmed daily. These developments support concerns on possible unidentified and unreported international COVID-19 cases, which could lead to new local disease epicenters. Methods We have analyzed all available data on the development of international COVID-19 cases from January 20th, 2020 until February 18th, 2020. COVID-19 cases with and without travel history to China were divided into cohorts according to the Healthcare Access and Quality Index (HAQ-Index) of each country. Chi-square and Post-hoc testing were performed. Results While COVID-19 cases with travel history to China seem to peak for each HAQ-cohort, the number of non-travel related COVID-19 cases seem to continuously increase in the HAQ-c...","INTRODUCTION: There is little research on emergency care delivery in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). To facilitate future research, we aimed to assess the set of key metrics currently used by researchers in these settings and to propose a set of standard metrics to facilitate future research. METHODS: Systematic literature review of 43,109 published reports on general emergency care from 139 LMICs. Studies describing care for subsets of emergency conditions, subsets of populations, and data aggregated across multiple facilities were excluded. All facility- and patient-level statistics reported in these studies were recorded and the most commonly used metrics were identified. RESULTS: We identified 195 studies on emergency care delivery in LMICs. There was little uniformity in either patient- or facility-level metrics reported. Patient demographics were inconsistently reported: only 33% noted average age and 63% the gender breakdown. The upper age boundary used for paediatric ...","Background: A recently emerging respiratory disease named coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has quickly spread across the world. This disease is initiated by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) and uncontrolled cytokine storm, but it remains unknown as to whether a robust antibody response is related to clinical deterioration and poor outcome in laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients. Methods: Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM antibodies were determined by chemiluminescence analysis (CLIA) in COVID-19 patients from a single center in Wuhan. Median IgG and IgM levels in acute and convalescent-phase sera (within 35 days) for all included patients were calculated and compared among severe and nonsevere patients. Immune response phenotyping based on late IgG levels and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) was characterized to stratify patients with different disease severities and outcome. Laboratory parameters in patients with different immune response phenotypes and ...","The rapid spread of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) presents China with a critical challenge. As normal capacity of the Chinese hospitals is exceeded, healthcare professionals struggling to manage this unprecedented crisis face the difficult question of how best to coordinate the medical resources used in highly separated locations. Responding rapidly to this crisis, the National Telemedicine Center of China (NTCC), located in Zhengzhou, Henan Province, has established the Emergency Telemedicine Consultation System (ETCS), a telemedicine-enabled outbreak alert and response network. ETCS is built upon a doctor-to-doctor (D2D) approach, in which health services can be accessed remotely through terminals across hospitals. The system architecture of ETCS comprises three major architectural layers: (1) telemedicine service platform layer, (2) telemedicine cloud layer, and (3) telemedicine service application layer. Our ETCS has demonstrated substantial benefits in terms of the effective...","An outbreak of a novel coronavirus, named SARS-CoV-2, that provokes the COVID-19 disease, was first reported in Hubei, mainland China on 31 December 2019. As of 20 March 2020, cases have been reported in 166 countries/regions, including cases of human-to-human transmission around the world. The proportions of this epidemics is probably one of the largest challenges faced by our interconnected modern societies. According to the current epidemiological reports, the large basic reproduction number, R_0 ~ 2.3, number of secondary cases produced by an infected individual in a population of susceptible individuals, as well as an asymptomatic period (up to 14 days) in which infectious individuals are undetectable without further analysis, pave the way for a major crisis of the national health capacity systems. Recent scientific reports have pointed out that the detected cases of COVID19 at young ages is strikingly short and that lethality is concentrated at large ages. Here we adapt a Microsc...","","Abstract Context In 2012, the French Infectious Diseases Society (French acronym SPILF) initiated the \u201cCoordination of epidemic and biological risk\u201d (SPILF-COREB - Emergences [SCE]) group to support the readiness and response of healthcare workers (HCWs) to new alerts. Objective To present the SCE group, its functioning, and the main support it provided for frontline HCWs. Methods A multidisciplinary group of heads of infectious disease departments from reference hospitals was created to build a network of clinical expertise for care, training, and research in the field of epidemic and biological risk (EBR). The network developed a set of standardized operational procedures (SOPs) to guide interventions to manage EBR-suspect patients. Results A working group created the SOP aimed at frontline HCWs taking care of patients. Priority was given to the development of a generic procedure, which was then adapted according to the current alert. Five key steps were identified and hierarchized: ...","With the increasing threat of pandemic influenza and catastrophic bioterrorism, it is important for intensive care providers to be prepared to meet the challenge of large-scale airborne epidemics causing mass casualty respiratory failure. The severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak exposed the vulnerability of health care workers and highlighted the importance of establishing stringent infection control and crisis management protocols. Patients who have acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome who require mechanical ventilation should receive a lung protective, low tidal volume strategy. Controversy remains regarding the use of high-frequency oscillatory ventilation and noninvasive positive pressure ventilation. Standard, contact, and airborne precautions should be instituted in intensive care units, with special care taken when aerosol-generating procedures are performed.","","ABSTRACT THE CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL and Prevention has published updated guidelines for isolation precautions that outline how health care workers can prevent the transmission of infectious agents to their patients and to themselves. THE GUIDELINES RE-EMPHASIZE standard precautions, which guide clinicians in the use of appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE), depending on the expected type of exposure. Respiratory hygiene/cough etiquette is incorporated into infection control practices as a new component of standard precautions. THE ARTICLE PROVIDES information on the new guidelines as well as information on newly emerging patho gens and methods to prevent disease transmission in health care settings.","School closures have been enacted as a measure of mitigation during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic due to their ability to reduce transmission. It has been shown that school closures could cause absenteeism amongst healthcare workers with dependent children, but there is a need for detailed high-resolution analysis of the relationship between school closures and healthcare worker absenteeism to inform local community preparedness. We provide national- and county-level simulations of school closures and absenteeism across the United States. At the national level, we estimate the projected absenteeism rate to range from 7.5% to 8.6%, and the effectiveness of school closures to range from 172 to 218 fewer hospital beds used per 100,000 people at peak demand. At the county-level, we find substantial variations of projected absenteeism and school closure effects, ranging from 2.0% to 18.6% absenteeism and 88 to 280 fewer hospital beds used per 100,000 people at peak demand. We also find sign...","The microarray is a platform with wide-ranging potential in biodefence. Owing to the high level of throughput attainable through miniaturization, microarrays have accelerated the ability to respond in an epidemic or crisis. Extending beyond diagnostics, recent studies have applied microarrays as a research tool towards understanding the etiology and pathogenicity of dangerous pathogens, as well as in vaccine development. The original emphasis was on DNA microarrays, but the range now includes protein, antibody and carbohydrate microarrays, and research groups have exploited this diversity to further extend microarray applications in the area of biodefence. Here, we discuss the impact and contributions of the growing range of microarrays and emphasize the concepts that might shape the future of biodefence research.","Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection has claimed hundreds of lives and has become a global threat since its emergence in Saudi Arabia in 2012. The ability of MERS-CoV to evade the host innate antiviral response may contribute to its severe pathogenesis. Many MERS-CoV-encoded proteins were identified to have interferon (IFN)-antagonizing properties, which correlates well with the reduced IFN levels observed in infected patients and ex vivo models. In this study, we fully characterized the IFN-antagonizing property of the MERS-CoV M protein. Expression of MERS-CoV M protein suppressed type I IFN expression in response to Sendai virus infection or poly(I:C) induction. This suppressive effect was found to be specific for the activation of IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) but not nuclear factor-\u03baB. MERS-CoV M protein interacted with TRAF3 and disrupted TRAF3\u2013TBK1 association leading to reduced IRF3 activation. M proteins from MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV have three highl...","DNA microarrays may be used to identify microbial species present in environmental and clinical samples. However, automated tools for reliable species identification based on observed microarray hybridization patterns are lacking. We present an algorithm, E-Predict, for microarray-based species identification. E-Predict compares observed hybridization patterns with theoretical energy profiles representing different species. We demonstrate the application of the algorithm to viral detection in a set of clinical samples and discuss its relevance to other metagenomic applications.","Background. The clinical presentation of 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCov) infected pneumonia (NCIP) resembles that of other etiologies of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). We aimed to identify clinical laboratory features to distinguish NCIP from CAP. Methods. We compared the ability of the hematological and biochemical features of 84 patients with NCIP at hospital admission and 316 patients with CAP. Parameters independently predictive of NCIP were calculated by multivariate logistic regression. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were generated and the area under the ROC curve (AUC) was measured to evaluate the discriminative ability. Results. Most hematological and biochemical indexes of patients with NCIP were significantly different from patients with CAP. Nine laboratory parameters were identified to be highly predictive of a diagnosis of NCIP by multivariate analysis. The AUCs demonstrated good discriminatory ability for red cell distribution width (RDW) with ...","Objective: Establishing a social contact data sharing initiative and an interactive tool to assess mitigation strategies for COVID-19. Results: We organized data sharing of published social contact surveys via online repositories and formatting guidelines. We analyzed this social contact data in terms of weighted social contact matrices, next generation matrices, relative incidence and R0. We incorporated location-specific isolation measures (e.g. school closure or telework) and capture their effect on transmission dynamics. All methods have been implemented in an online application based on R Shiny and applied to COVID-19 with age-specific susceptibility and infectiousness. Using our online tool with the available social contact data, we illustrate that social distancing could have a considerable impact on reducing transmission for COVID-19. The effect itself depends on assumptions made about disease-specific characteristics and the choice of intervention(s). Keywords: social contact ...","Over the past several decades, we have witnessed the emergence of many new infectious agents, some of which are major public threats. New and emerging infectious diseases which are both transmissible from patient-to-patient and virulent with a high mortality include novel coronaviruses (SARS-CoV, MERS-CV), hemorrhagic fever viruses (Lassa, Ebola), and highly pathogenic avian influenza A viruses, A(H5N1) and A(H7N9). All healthcare facilities need to have policies and plans in place for early identification of patients with a highly communicable diseases which are highly virulent, ability to immediately isolate such patients, and provide proper management (e.g., training and availability of personal protective equipment) to prevent transmission to healthcare personnel, other patients and visitors to the healthcare facility.","Abstract Objectives were to determine effects of lactation and pregnancy on endometrial gene expression on d 17 of the estrous cycle and pregnancy. Heifers (n=33) were assigned randomly after parturition to lactating (L, n=17) or nonlactating (NL, n=16) groups. Cows were subjected to an ovulation synchronization program for a timed artificial insemination (TAI); 10 cows in L and 12 in NL were inseminated. Slaughter occurred 17 d after the day equivalent to TAI, and intercaruncular endometrial tissues were collected. Gene expression was determined by DNA microarray analysis for pregnant (L, n=8; NL, n=6) and noninseminated cyclic (L, n=7; NL, n=4) cows. Differentially expressed genes were selected with a P-value &lt;0.01 and absolute expression &gt;40. In addition, a fold effect &gt;1.5 was used as a criterion for genes affected by pregnancy. In total, 210 genes were differentially regulated by lactation (136 downregulated and 74 upregulated), and 702 genes were differentially regulated by pregn...","Abstract Analyses of turkey coronavirus (TCoV), an enteric disease virus that is highly similar to infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) an upper-respiratory tract disease virus in chickens, were conducted to determine the adaptive potential, and genetic changes associated with emergence of this group 3 coronavirus. Strains of TCoV that were pathogenic in poults and nonpathogenic in chickens did not adapt to cause disease in chickens. Comparative genomics revealed two recombination sites that replaced the spike gene in IBV with an unidentified sequence likely from another coronavirus, resulting in cross-species transmission and a pathogenicity shift. Following emergence in turkeys, TCoV diverged to different serotypes through the accumulation of mutations within spike. This is the first evidence that recombination can directly lead to the emergence of new coronaviruses and new coronaviral diseases, emphasizing the importance of limiting exposure to reservoirs of coronaviruses that can serv...","Abstract Although Intensive Care Medicine is a young specialty compared with other medical disciplines, it currently plays a key role in the process of care for many patients. Experience has shown that professionals with specific training in Intensive Care Medicine are needed to provide high quality care to critically ill patients. In Europe, important steps have been taken towards the standardization of training programs of the different member states. However, it is now necessary to take one more step forward, that is, the creation of a primary specialty in Intensive Care Medicine. Care of the critically ill needs to be led by specialists who have received specific and complete training and who have the necessary professional competences to provide maximum quality care to their patients. The future of the specialty presents challenges that must be faced with determination, with the main objective of meeting the needs of the population.","Abstract The viral epidemic caused by the new Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 is responsible for the new Coronavirus disease -2019 (Covid-19). This epidemic imposes upheavals in our organizations in healthcare centres which should not obscure the importance of nutritional care. The nutritional diagnosis and the early nutritional care management of Covid-19 infected patients must be integrated into the overall therapeutic strategy, as with any acute situation of acute illness. This document was prepared by the French speaking Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism (SFNCM) in the emergency of the health crisis by a group of experts, based on the national and international recommendations available in the field of malnutrition, critical illness, metabolic stress and intensive care medicine on March 23, 2020. We hope that this article will bring to healthcare professionals, especially those not specialized in nutrition, useful landmarks to help them to manage hospitalized patients, infected ...","In the past twenty years, numerous novel zoonotic viral agents with pandemic potential have emerged in China, such as the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus and, more recently, the avian-origin influenza A/H7N9 virus, which have caused outbreaks among humans with high morbidity and mortality. In addition, several emerging and re-emerging viral pathogens have also been imported into China from travelers, e.g. the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus and Zika virus (ZIKV). Herein, we review these emerging viral pathogens in China and focus on how surveillance by pathogen genomics has been employed to discover and annotate novel pathogenic agents, identify natural reservoirs, monitor the transmission events and delineate their evolution and adaption to the human host. We also highlight the application of genomic sequencing in the recent Ebola epidemics in Western Africa. In summary, genomic sequencing has become a standard research tool in the field of eme...","Abstract: We propose that the palliative care team response will occur in two waves: first communication and second symptom management. Our experience with discussing goals of care with the family of a COVID positive patient highlighted some expected and unexpected challenges. We describe these challenges along with recommendations for approaching these conversations. We also propose a framework for proactively mobilizing the palliative care workforce to aggressively address goals of care in all patients, with the aim of reducing the need for rationing of resources.","A cross-sectional anonymous survey was administered to all directory-listed physicians within a network of three large teaching hospitals that provided care to SARS patients in Toronto. One hundred ninety-three physicians participated, 23% of whom provided direct care to SARS patients. A significantly higher rate of psychological distress was seen among physicians providing direct care to SARS patients (45.7%) than among those not providing direct care (17.7%), and physicians providing direct care reported feeling more stigmatized. Several physicians (10.9%) reported entering the hospital despite experiencing identified SARS symptoms. The most frequent SARS concerns were about the care of non-SARS patients following suspension of nonessential services and loss of physician income.","Since COVID-19 emerged in early December, 2019 in Wuhan and swept across China Mainland, a series of large-scale public health interventions, especially Wuhan lock-down combined with nationwide traffic restrictions and Stay At Home Movement, have been taken by the government to control the epidemic. Based on Baidu Migration data and the confirmed cases data, we identified two key factors affecting the later (e.g February 27, 2020) cumulative confirmed cases in non-Wuhan region (y). One is the sum travelers from Wuhan during January 20 to January 26 (x1), which had higher infected probability but lower transmission ability because the human-to-human transmission risk of COVID-19 was confirmed and announced on January 20. The other is the seed cases from Wuhan before January 19, which had higher transmission ability and could be represented with the confirmed cases before January 29 (x2) due to a mean 10-day delay between infection and detection. A simple yet effective regression model t...","Abstract There are many diseases for which a microbial aetiology is suspected. The hypothesis that a disease has an infectious cause is supported by: clinical features (similar to those of known infectious diseases, e.g. fever, leucocytosis), epidemiology (case clustering in time or location), histology (inflammation of affected tissues, e.g. granulomata) or characteristic microbial structures, treatment (clinical response to antimicrobial treatment), and prevention of disease by vaccines targeting microbial antigens. Proof that a microbe causes a disease requires more rigorous evidence. Future attempts to identify novel microbes associated with human disease may use sequence-based approaches. High-throughput sequencing may allow identification of unique microbial nucleic acid sequences in a background of host DNA. The complete sequencing of the human genome and multiple microbial genomes make this approach more feasible. DNA microarrays are also likely to be used in the search for nov...","Abstract Since the middle of December 2019, human-to-human transmission of novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP) has occurred among close contacts. At the same time, greater attention should be paid to psychological crisis intervention (PCI) among affected populations, for the timely prevention of inestimable damage from a secondary psychological crisis. PCI has been initiated via remote (telephone and internet) and onsite medical services to help medical workers, patients, and others affected to overcome any psychological difficulties. This paper outlines experiences based on the work of the Shanghai Medical Team.","Profiling the genetic evolution and dynamic spreading of viruses is a crucial task when responding to epidemic outbreaks. We aim to devise novel ways to model, visualise and analyse the temporal dynamics of epidemic outbreaks in order to help researchers and other people involved in crisis response to make well-informed and targeted decisions about from which geographical locations and time periods more genetic samples may be required to fully understand the outbreak. Our approach relies on the application of Transcendental Information Cascades to a set of temporally ordered nucleotide sequences and we apply it to real-world data that was collected during the currently ongoing outbreak of the novel 2019-nCoV coronavirus. We assess information-theoretic and network-theoretic measures that characterise the resulting complex network and suggest touching points and temporal pathways that are of interest for deeper investigation by geneticists and epidemiologists.","Objective: To review and critically appraise published and preprint reports of models that aim to predict either (i) presence of existing COVID-19 infection, or (ii) future complications in individuals already diagnosed with COVID-19. Any models to identify subjects at risk for COVID-19 in the general population were also included. Design: Rapid systematic review and critical appraisal of prediction models for diagnosis or prognosis of COVID-19 infection. Data sources: PubMed, EMBASE via Ovid, Arxiv, medRxiv and bioRxiv until 13th March 2020. Study selection: Studies that developed or validated a multivariable COVID-19 related prediction model. Two authors independently screened titles and abstracts. Data extraction: Data from included studies were extracted independently by at least two authors based on the CHARMS checklist, and risk of bias was assessed using PROBAST. Data were extracted on various domains including the participants, predictors, outcomes, data analysis, and predictio...","Abstract The worldwide outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) raises concerns of widespread panic and anxiety in individuals subjected to the real or perceived threat of the virus. Compared to general populations, patients who are institutionalized in a closed unit are also very vulnerable to COVID-19 infection and complications. This crisis touched on difficult issues of not only psychiatric care and ethics, but also psychological impacts to psychiatric care givers. In this Viewpoint, we address both physical and biopsychosocial aspects of this infection, as well as the psychoneuroimmunity of preventive strategies of healthy lifestyle, regular exercise, balanced nutrition, quality sleep and a strong connection with people. Social distancing and wearing masks might help us from pathogen exposure, yet such these measures also prevent us from expressing compassion and friendliness. Therefore, all forms of psychological support should be routinely implemented not only to consider...","Background: The overall objective of this rapid review was to identify infection protection and control recommendations from published clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) for adults aged 60 years and older in long-term care settings Methods: Comprehensive searches in MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, and relevant CPG publishers/repositories were carried out in early March 2020. Title/abstract and full-text screening, data abstraction, and quality appraisal (AGREE-II) were carried out by single reviewers. Results: A total of 17 relevant CPGs were identified, published in the USA (n=8), Canada (n=6), Australia (n=2), and the United Kingdom (n=1). All of the CPGs dealt with infection control in long-term care facilities (LTCF) and addressed various types of viral respiratory infections (e.g., influenza, COVID-19, severe acute respiratory syndrome). Ten or more CPGs recommended the following infection control measures in LTCF: hand hygiene (n=13), wearing personal protective equipment...","AbstractThe emergence and outbreak of SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19, has rapidly become a global concern and has highlighted the need for fast, sensitive, and specific tools to surveil circulating viruses. Here we provide assay designs and experimental resources, for use with CRISPR-based nucleic acid detection, that could be valuable for ongoing surveillance. We provide assay designs for detection of 67 viral species and subspecies, including: SARS-CoV-2, phylogenetically-related viruses, and viruses with similar clinical presentation. The designs are outputs of algorithms that we are developing for rapidly designing nucleic acid detection assays that are comprehensive across genomic diversity and predicted to be highly sensitive and specific. Of our design set, we experimentally screened 4 SARS-CoV-2 designs with a CRISPR-Cas13 detection system and then extensively tested the highest-performing SARS-CoV-2 assay. We demonstrate the sensitivity and speed of this assay usi...","The novel corona virus disease -2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has caused a massive global public health havoc. Recent clinical trials carried out in China has found a promising therapeutic application of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine for COVID-19. This study meticulously evaluated the various dosages of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine utilized in clinical trials registered in Chinese and US clinical trial registries for the treatment of pneumonia caused by SARS-CoV-2.","","Abstract Adoptive immunotherapy\u2014in particular, T-cell therapy\u2014has recently emerged as a useful strategy with the potential to overcome many of the limitations of antiviral drugs for the treatment of viral complications after hematopietic stem cell transplantation. In this review, we briefly summarize the current methods for virus-specific T-cell isolation or selection and we report results from clinical trials that have used these techniques, focusing specifically on the strategies aimed to broaden the application of this technology.",""],"title":["Hospital accreditation and the surgeon: The Canadian experience","Roles and contributions of
