Starting in March 2014, a dramatic increase of cases has occurred in the Arabian Peninsula, many of which were acquired in health care settings. As of May 9, 2014, 536 laboratory-confirmed cases and 145 deaths have been reported globally. Methods Review of publicly available data about MERS-CoV health care\u2013associated transmission. Results We identified 11 events of possible or confirmed health care\u2013associated transmission with high morbidity and mortality, mainly among patients with comorbidities. Health care workers are also frequently affected; however, they tend to have milder symptoms and better prognosis. Gaps in infection control were noted in all events. Currently, health care\u2013associated outbreaks are playing a pivotal role in the evolution of the MERS-CoV epidemic in countries in the Arabian Peninsula. Conclusion There ...","Background: The overall objective of this rapid overview of reviews (overview hereafter) was to identify evidence from systematic reviews (SRs) for infection control and prevention practices for adults aged 60 years and older in long-term care settings. Methods: Comprehensive searches in MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, biorxiv.org/medrxiv.org, clinicaltrials.gov and the Global Infectious Disease Epidemiology Network (GIDEON) were carried out in early March 2020. Title/abstract and full-text screening, data abstraction, and quality appraisal (AMSTAR 2) were carried out by single reviewers. Results: A total of 6 SRs published between 1999 and 2018 were identified and included in the overview. The SRs included between 1 and 37 primary studies representing between 140 to 908 patients. All of the primary studies included in the SRs were carried out in long-term care facilities (LTCF) and examined pharmacological, non-pharmacological, or combined interventions. One high quality SR fou...","ABSTRACT THE CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL and Prevention has published updated guidelines for isolation precautions that outline how health care workers can prevent the transmission of infectious agents to their patients and to themselves. THE GUIDELINES RE-EMPHASIZE standard precautions, which guide clinicians in the use of appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE), depending on the expected type of exposure. Respiratory hygiene/cough etiquette is incorporated into infection control practices as a new component of standard precautions. THE ARTICLE PROVIDES information on the new guidelines as well as information on newly emerging patho gens and methods to prevent disease transmission in health care settings.","Background The novel coronavirus COVID19 has been classified by the World Health Organisation as a pandemic due to its worldwide spread. The ability of countries to contain and control transmission is critical in the absence of a vaccine. We evaluated a range of social distancing measures to determine which strategies are most effective in reducing the peak daily infection rate, and consequential pressure on the health care system. Methods Using COVID19 transmission data from the outbreak source in Hubei Province, China, collected prior to activation of containment measures, we adapted an established individual based simulation model of the city of Newcastle, Australia, population 272,409. Simulation of virus transmission in this community model without interventions provided a baseline from which to compare alternative social distancing strategies. The infection history of each individual was determined, as was the time infected. From this model generated data, the rate of growth in c...","Background Transmission of Middle East respiratory syndrome-coronavirus (MERS-CoV) among health care workers (HCWs) and patients has been documented with mortality rate approximating 36%. We propose advanced infection control measures (A-IC) used in conjunction with basic infection control measures (B-IC) help reduce pathogen transmission. B-IC include standard and transmission-based precautions. A-IC are initiatives implemented within our center to enhance effectiveness of B-IC. Objective Study effectiveness of combining B-IC and A-IC to prevent transmission of MERS-CoV to HCWs. Methods A retrospective observational study was undertaken. A-IC measures include administrative support with daily rounds; infection control risk assessment; timely screening, isolation, and specimen analysis; collaboration; epidemic planning; stockpiling; implementation of contingency plans; full personal protective equipment use for advanced airway management; use of a real-time electronic isolation flaggin...","Fifteen years ago, United Nations world leaders defined millenium development goal 4 (MDG 4): to reduce under-5-year mortality rates by two-thirds by the year 2015. Unfortunately, only 27 of 138 developing countries are expected to achieve MDG 4. The majority of childhood deaths in these settings result from reversible causes, and developing effective pediatric emergency and critical care services could substantially reduce this mortality. The Ebola outbreak highlighted the fragility of health care systems in resource-limited settings and emphasized the urgent need for a paradigm shift in the global approach to healthcare delivery related to critical illness. This review provides an overview of pediatric critical care in resource-limited settings and outlines strategies to address challenges specific to these areas. Implementation of these tools has the potential to move us toward delivery of an adequate standard of critical care for all children globally, and ultimately decrease globa...","Background: The COVID-19 outbreak containment strategies in China based on non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) appear to be effective. Quantitative research is still needed however to assess the efficacy of different candidate NPIs and their timings to guide ongoing and future responses to epidemics of this emerging disease across the World. Methods: We built a travel network-based susceptible-exposed-infectious-removed (SEIR) model to simulate the outbreak across cities in mainland China. We used epidemiological parameters estimated for the early stage of outbreak in Wuhan to parameterise the transmission before NPIs were implemented. To quantify the relative effect of various NPIs, daily changes of delay from illness onset to the first reported case in each county were used as a proxy for the improvement of case identification and isolation across the outbreak. Historical and near-real time human movement data, obtained from Baidu location-based service, were used to derive the i...","The outbreak of pneumonia caused by a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) in Wuhan City of China obtained global concern, the population outflow from Wuhan has contributed to spatial expansion in other parts of China. We examined the effects of population outflow from Wuhan on the 2019-nCoV transmission in other provinces and cities of China, as well as the impacts of the city closure in Wuhan. We observed a significantly positive association between population movement and the number of cases. Further analysis revealed that if the city closure policy was implemented two days earlier, 1420 (95% CI: 1059, 1833) cases could be prevented, and if two days later, 1462 (95% CI: 1090, 1886) more cases would be possible. Our findings suggest that population movement might be one important trigger of the 2019-nCoV infection transmission in China, and the policy of city closure is effective to prevent the epidemic.","With the human society transfers from scattered pieces to a society as a whole and the advent of the aviation era, the occurrence of infectious diseases and their diffusion have led to international health security issues. As the world\u2019s largest and irrevocable annual transnational religious movement, the Hajj and its connection with health security concerns have caught attention since the ancient times, because a huge population from all over the world gathers in the holy city of Mecca, which has tropical arid climate. Currently, the international community and international organizations are implementing multilevel governance with respect to the health security issues of the Hajj. Relevant agencies include the World Health Organization and its regional branches, International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement (ICRC), the Ministry of Hajj as well as the Ministry of Health of Saudi Arabia, and the public health sectors/agencies in various countries that are involved with Hajj activit...","Abstract Certification programs have been developed to provide plant material that meets a predetermined level of plant health. The primary objectives of these programs are to limit pathogen incidence in plant material in order to minimize losses by growers and prevent movement of harmful pests and pathogens that may harm the environment. For many fruit and nut crops, orchards are expected to remain productive for years or decades; thus, starting with plants of high health status is essential. The components of certification programs in terms of plant health will be outlined, along with the benefits of harmonizing these programs where possible to facilitate plant movement without increasing trade in plant pathogens.","The 2009 influenza A (H1N1) pandemic highlighted the importance of quality hospital care of the severely ill, yet there is evidence that the impact of the 2009 pandemic was highest in low\u2010 and middle\u2010income countries with fewer resources. Recent data indicate that death and suffering from seasonal influenza and severe illness in general are increased in resource\u2010limited settings. However, there are limited clinical data and guidelines for the management of influenza and other severe illness in these settings. Life\u2010saving supportive care through syndromic case management is used successfully in high\u2010resource intensive care units and in global programs such as the Integrated Management of Childhood Illness (IMCI). While there are a variety of challenges to the management of the severely ill in resource\u2010limited settings, several new international initiatives have begun to develop syndromic management strategies for these environments, including the World Health Organization's Integrated M...","The number of confirmed COVID-19 cases admitted in hospitals is continuously increasing in the Philippines. Frontline health care workers are faced with imminent risks of getting infected. In this study, we formulate a theoretical model to calculate the risk of being infected in health care facilities considering the following factors: the average number of encounters with a suspected COVID-19 patient per hour; interaction time for each encounter; work shift duration or exposure time; crowd density, which may depend on the amount of space available in a given location; and availability and effectiveness of protective gears and facilities provided for the frontline health care workers. Based on the simulation results, we recommend the following: (i) decrease the rate of patient encounter per frontline health care worker, e.g., maximum of three encounters per hour in a 12-hour work shift duration; (ii) decrease the interaction time between the frontline health care worker and the patient...","Abstract We argue that enhanced Traffic Control Bundling (eTCB) can interrupt the community-hospital-community transmission cycle, thereby limiting COVID-19\u2019s impact. Enhanced TCB is an expansion of the traditional TCB that proved highly effective during Taiwan\u2019s 2003 SARS outbreak. TCB\u2019s success derived from ensuring that Health Care Workers (HCWs) and patients were protected from fomite, contact and droplet transmission within hospitals. Although TCB proved successful during SARS, achieving a similar level of success with the COVID-19 outbreak requires adapting TCB to the unique manifestations of this new disease. These manifestations include asymptomatic infection, a hyper-affinity to ACE2 receptors resulting in high transmissibility, false negatives, and an incubation period of up to 22 days. Enhanced TCB incorporates the necessary adaptations. In particular, eTCB includes expanding the TCB transition zone to incorporate a new sector \u2013 the quarantine ward. This ward houses patients...","BACKGROUND: The continuing circulation of MERS in the Middle East makes the international dissemination of the disease a permanent threat. To inform risk assessment, we investigated the spatiotemporal pattern of MERS global dissemination and looked for factors explaining the heterogeneity observed in transmission events following importation. METHODS: We reviewed imported MERS cases worldwide up to July 2015. We modelled importations in time based on air travel combined with incidence in Middle East. We used the detailed history of MERS case management after importation (time to hospitalization and isolation, number of hospitals visited,\u2026) in logistic regression to identify risk factors for secondary transmission. We assessed changes in time to hospitalization and isolation in relation to collective and public health attention to the epidemic, measured by three indicators (Google Trends, ProMED-mail, Disease Outbreak News). RESULTS: Modelled importation events were found to reproduce b...","ABSTRACT BACKGROUND The COVID-19 epidemic, first emerged in Wuhan during December 2019, has spread globally. While the mass population movement for Chinese New Year has significantly influenced spreading the disease, little direct evidence exists about the relevance to epidemic and its control of population movement from Wuhan, local emergency response, and medical resources in China. METHODS Spearman's correlation analysis was performed between official data of confirmed COVID-19 cases from Jan 20th to Feb 19th, 2020 and real-time travel data and health resources data. RESULTS There were 74,675 confirmed COVID-19 cases in China by Feb 19th, 2020. The overall fatality rate was 2.84%, much higher in Hubei than in other regions (3.27% vs 0.73%). The index of population inflow from Hubei was positively correlated with total (Provincial r=0.9159, p&lt;0.001; City r=0.6311, p&lt;0.001) and primary cases (Provincial r=0.8702, p&lt;0.001; City r=0.6358, p&lt;0.001). The local health emergency measures (e...","Background: An outbreak of a novel coronavirus, named CoVID-19, was first reported in China on 31 December 2019. As of 9 February 2020, cases have been reported in 25 countries, including probable cases of human-to-human transmission in England. Methods: We adapted an existing national-scale metapopulation model to capture the spread of CoVID-19 in England and Wales. We used 2011 census data to capture population sizes and population movement, together with parameter estimates from the current outbreak in China. Results: We predict that a CoVID-19 outbreak will peak 126 to 147 days (~4 months) after the start of person-to-person transmission in England and Wales in the absence of controls, assuming biological parameters remain unchanged. Therefore, if person-to-person transmission persists from February, we predict the epidemic peak would occur in June. The starting location has minimal impact on peak timing, and model stochasticity varies peak timing by 10 days. Incorporating realisti...","Abstract Background The novel coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19), which was first detected in Wuhan City, has now became a pandemic that affecting patients around the world. Particularly, the community patient population are at high risk of infection and are facing potential failure of proper medication use during the pandemic. Objective To discuss community pharmacists\u2019 role and the content of pharmaceutical care (PC) during the novel coronavirus pandemic to promote effective prevention and control and safe drug use of the community patient population. Method Collect and summarize the experience Chinese community pharmacies gained from providing pharmacy services during the COVID-19 outbreak, and taking the PC needs into consideration, analyze and discuss the methods and strategies that community pharmacies and pharmacists shall use to provide PC during the pandemic. Results Community pharmacy management teams shall support PC services by providing adequate supply of COVID-19 related me...","Background: The COVID-19 pandemic caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is straining health systems around the world. Although the Chinese government implemented a number of severe restrictions on people's movement in an attempt to contain its local and international spread, the virus had already reached many areas of the world in part due to its potent transmissibility and the fact that a substantial fraction of infected individuals develop little or no symptoms at all. Following its emergence, the virus started to generate sustained transmission in neighboring countries in Asia, Western Europe, Australia, Canada and the United States, and finally in South America and Africa. As the virus continues its global spread, a clear and evidence-based understanding of properties and dynamics of the global transmission network of SARS-CoV-2 is essential to design and put in place efficient and globally coordinated interventions. Methods: We employ molecular...","The rapid expansion of coronavirus (COVID-19) has been observed in many parts of the world. Many newly reported cases of this new coronavirus during early outbreak phases have been associated with travel history from an epidemic region (identified as imported cases). For those cases without travel history, the risk of wider spreads through community contact is even higher. However, most population models assume a homogeneous infected population without considering that the imported and secondary cases contracted by the imported cases can pose a different risk to community spread. We have developed an \u201ceasy-to-use\u201d mathematical framework extending from a meta-population model embedding city-to-city connections to stratify the dynamics of transmission waves caused by imported, secondary, and others from an outbreak source region when control measures are considered. Using the dynamics of the secondary cases, we are able to determine the probability of community spread. Using the top 10 v...","Background The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was first reported in China, which caused a respiratory disease known as Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). Since its discovery, the virus has spread to over 100 countries and claimed more than 4000 deaths. This study aimed to assess the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of various response public health measures. Method The stochastic agent-based model was used to simulate the process of COVID-19 outbreak in scenario I (imported one case) and II (imported four cases) with a series of public health measures, involving the personal protection, isolation-and-quarantine, gathering restriction, and community containment. The virtual community was constructed following the susceptible-latent-infectious-recovered framework. The epidemiological and economic parameters derived from the previous literature and field investigation. The main outcomes included avoided infectors, cost-effectiveness ratios (CERs), and i...","Objectives: To study the effectiveness of noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) in the treatment of acute respiratory failure (ARF) in severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), and the associated infection risk. Methods: All patients with the diagnosis of probable SARS admitted to a regional hospital in Hong Kong from March 9 to April 28, 2003, and who had SARS-related respiratory distress complications were recruited for NIPPV usage. The health status of all health-care workers working in the NIPPV wards was closely monitored, and consent was obtained to check serum for coronavirus serology. Patient outcomes and the risk of SARS transmission to health-care workers were assessed. Results: NIPPV was applied to 20 patients (11 male patients) with ARF secondary to SARS. Mean age was 51.4 years, and mean acute physiology and chronic health evaluation II score was 5.35. Coronavirus serology was positive in 95% (19 of 20 patients). NIPPV was started 9.6 days (mean) from symptom o...","We present here several variants of a mathematical model to explore three main issues related to SARS-CoV-2 spread in scenarios similar to those present in Mexico and elsewhere in Latin America. We explore the consequences for travel inside a given region, in this case Mexico, particularly focusing on airplane transportation but attempting to give a gross approximation to terrestrial movement since this is the main form of population movement across geographical areas in the country; then we proceed to study the effect of behavioral changes required to lower transmission by lowering the contact rate and infection probability and lastly, we explore the consequences of disease spread in a population subject to social isolation.These models are not suitable for predictive purposes although some rough predictions can be extracted from them. They are presented as a tool that can serve to explore plausible scenarios of spread and impact, effectiveness and consequences of contention and mitig...","Being aware and implementing the latest and best scientific evidence in infection control and health care epidemiology is critical to enhancing patient outcomes. In this review, the latest published scientific data in health care epidemiology and patient safety were reviewed for the period May 2003-May 2004. Medline reviews and reviews of infection control and infectious diseases journals were used for this period. The latest guidelines and publications on antimicrobial resistance, nursing or infection control professional staffing, West Nile virus, and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) are included. Awareness of these and other important infection control publications is essential if the latest measures are to be implemented to prevent and control health care-associated infections.","Background Traditional infection control policies have focused on engineering controls, specific protocols, and personal protective equipment (PPE). In light of the variable success in protecting health care workers (HCWs) from Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2003, organizational and individual factors related to self-protective behavior in health care settings may also play an important role. Methods A critical review of the literature was conducted, directed at understanding what organizational and individual factors are important in protecting HCWs from infectious diseases at work. Results Organizational factors, such as a positive safety climate, have been associated with increased HCW adherence to universal precautions. There is some evidence that appropriate training of HCWs could be effective in changing HCW behavior if appropriate follow-up is applied. Very little research into these factors has been conducted with regard to preventing exposures to respiratory tract...","Abstract Background The objective of the study was to investigate the effectiveness of non-pharmacological interventions in preventing cases of influenza requiring hospitalization. Methods We performed a multicenter case-control study in 36 hospitals, in 2010 in Spain. Hospitalized influenza cases confirmed by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction and three matched controls (two hospital and one community control) per case were selected. The use of non-pharmacological measures seven days before the onset of symptoms (frequency of hand washing, use of alcohol-based hand sanitizers and handwashing after touching contaminated surfaces) was collected. Results We studied 813 cases hospitalized for influenza and 2274 controls. The frequency of hand washing 5-10 times (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]=0.65) and &gt;10 times (aOR=0.59) and handwashing after contact with contaminated surfaces (aOR=0.65) were protective factors and were dose-responsive (p&lt;0.001). Alcohol-based hand sanitizers we...","Since COVID-19 emerged in early December, 2019 in Wuhan and swept across China Mainland, a series of large-scale public health interventions, especially Wuhan lock-down combined with nationwide traffic restrictions and Stay At Home Movement, have been taken by the government to control the epidemic. Based on Baidu Migration data and the confirmed cases data, we identified two key factors affecting the later (e.g February 27, 2020) cumulative confirmed cases in non-Wuhan region (y). One is the sum travelers from Wuhan during January 20 to January 26 (x1), which had higher infected probability but lower transmission ability because the human-to-human transmission risk of COVID-19 was confirmed and announced on January 20. The other is the seed cases from Wuhan before January 19, which had higher transmission ability and could be represented with the confirmed cases before January 29 (x2) due to a mean 10-day delay between infection and detection. A simple yet effective regression model t...","Background The dynamics of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) transmissibility after symptom onset remains unknown. Methods We conducted a prospective case-ascertained study on laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases and their contacts. Secondary clinical attack rate (considering symptomatic cases only) was analyzed for different exposure windows after symptom onset of index cases and for different exposure settings. Results Thirty-two confirmed patients were enrolled and 12 paired data (index-secondary cases) were identified among the 1,043 contacts. The secondary clinical attack rate was 0.9% (95% CI 0.5-1.7%). The attack rate was higher among those whose exposure to index cases started within five days of symptom onset (2.4%, 95% CI 1.1-4.5%) than those who were exposed later (zero case from 605 close contacts, 95% CI 0-0.61%). The attack rate was also higher among household contacts (13.6%, 95% CI 4.7-29.5%) and non-household family contacts (8.5%, 95% CI 2.4-20.3%) than that in healt...","OBJECTIVE: To assess the public health risk to Singapore posed by the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) outbreak in the Republic of Korea in 2015. METHODS: The likelihood of importation of MERS cases and the magnitude of the public health impact in Singapore were assessed to determine overall risk. Literature on the epidemiology and contextual factors associated with MERS coronavirus infection was collected and reviewed. Connectivity between the Republic of Korea and Singapore was analysed. Public health measures implemented by the two countries were reviewed. RESULTS: The epidemiology of the 2015 MERS outbreak in the Republic of Korea remained similar to the MERS outbreaks in Saudi Arabia. In addition, strong infection control and response measures were effective in controlling the outbreak. In view of the air traffic between Singapore and MERS-affected areas, importation of MERS cases into Singapore is possible. Nonetheless, the risk of a serious public health impact to Singapo...","A standard SEIR-type compartment model, parameterised for New Zealand, was used to simulate the spread of Covid19 in New Zealand and to test the effectiveness of various control strategies. Control aims can be broadly categorised as either suppression or mitigation. Suppression aims to keep cases to an absolute minimum for as long as possible. Mitigation aims to allow a controlled outbreak to occur, with the aim of preventing significant overloads on healthcare systems and gradually allowing the population to develop herd immunity. Both types of strategy are fraught with uncertainty. Suppression strategies can succeed in delaying an outbreak, but only for as long as such control measures can be sustained. Once controls are eased or restricted, an epidemic is likely to follow as no herd immunity has been acquired. The success or failure of mitigation strategies can depend sensitively on the timing and efficacy of control measures, and require the ability to bring rapidly growing outbrea...","AbstractThe recent emergence of Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causing COVID-19 is a major burden for health care systems worldwide. It is important to address if the current infection control instructions based on active ingredients are sufficient. We therefore determined the virucidal activity of two alcohol-based hand rub solutions for hand disinfection recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO), as well as commercially available alcohols. Efficient SARS-CoV-2 inactivation was demonstrated for all tested alcohol-based disinfectants. These findings show the successful inactivation of SARS-CoV-2 for the first time and provide confidence in its use for the control of COVID-19.ImportanceThe current COVID-19 outbreak puts a huge burden on the world\u2019s health care systems. Without effective therapeutics or vaccines being available, effective hygiene measure are of utmost importance to prevent viral spreading. It is therefore crucial to evaluate current...","Hospital-acquired infections (HAIs) are serious problems for healthcare systems, especially in developing countries where public health infrastructure and technology for infection preventions remain undeveloped. Here, we characterized how strategy and technology could be mobilized to improve the effectiveness of infection prevention and control in hospitals during the outbreaks of Ebola, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in Asia and West Africa. Published literature on the hospital-borne outbreaks of SARS, Ebola, and MERS in Asia and West Africa was comprehensively reviewed. The results showed that healthcare systems and hospital management in affected healthcare facilities had poor strategies and inadequate technologies and human resources for the prevention and control of HAIs, which led to increased morbidity, mortality, and unnecessary costs. We recommend that governments worldwide enforce disaster risk management, even when no ou...","SummaryBackgroundThe 2019 new coronavirus, \u201c2019-nCoV\u201d, was discovered from Wuhan Viral Pneumonia cases in December 2019, and was named by the World Health Organization on January 12, 2020. In the early stage, people knows little about the 2019-nCoV virus was not clear, and the spread period was encountering China\u2019s annual spring migration, which made the epidemic spread rapidly from Wuhan to almost all provinces in China.MethodsThis study builds a SEIRD model that considers the movement of people across regions, revealing the effects of three measures on controlling the spread of the epidemic.Based on MATLAB R2017a, computational experiments were performed to simulate the epidemic prevention and control measures.FindingsThe research results show that current prevention and control measures in China are very necessary. This study further validates the concerns of international and domestic experts regarding asymptomatic transmission (E-status).InterpretationThe results of this study ar...","Severe acute respiratory syndrome is a newly emerged infectious disease with moderately high transmissibility. Nosocomial outbreaks were responsible for the propagation of the epidemic worldwide. Health care workers (HCW) are at particular high risk because of their close contact with patients, involvement in medical procedures, and handling of excreta/fomites. Good hospital organization and appropriate infection control strategies are essential to prevent/interrupt disease transmission from patients to HCWs (and vice versa) and among inpatients and HCWs themselves. Education and training should target broadly to all HCWs.","Abstract Objective MERS-CoV infection is uncommonly identified among patients visiting healthcare facilities &amp; we were vigilant in screening all patients entering our hospital to prevent cross infection among patients, visitors &amp; healthcare providers and aiming to prevent potential outbreaks with MERS-CoV infection. In spite of our efforts on practicing Failure Mode Effect Analysis for MERS-CoV infection management we ended up having an outbreak with MERS-CoV. Based on our experience, we actively implemented policies, procedures &amp; practices on early identification &amp; appropriate isolation practices along with supplemental infection prevention &amp; control measures for preventing future outbreaks at our healthcare facility. Methods Retrospectively we analyzed our failure in preventing the outbreak of MERS-CoV infection among our hospitalized patients by identifying the outbreak &amp; actively intervening as a team to control the outbreak with the support of Hospital Higher management, Administr...","We integrate the human movement and healthcare resource data to identify cities with high vulnerability towards the 2019-nCoV epidemic with respect to available health resources. The results inform public health responses in multiple ways.","Traveller screening is being used to limit further spread of COVID-19 following its recent emergence, and symptom screening has become a ubiquitous tool in the global response. Previously, we developed a mathematical model to understand factors governing the effectiveness of traveller screening to prevent spread of emerging pathogens (Gostic et al., 2015). Here, we estimate the impact of different screening programs given current knowledge of key COVID-19 life history and epidemiological parameters. Even under best-case assumptions, we estimate that screening will miss more than half of infected people. Breaking down the factors leading to screening successes and failures, we find that most cases missed by screening are fundamentally undetectable, because they have not yet developed symptoms and are unaware they were exposed. Our work underscores the need for measures to limit transmission by individuals who become ill after being missed by a screening program. These findings can suppo...","A novel coronavirus (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, SARS-CoV-2) causing a cluster of respiratory infections (coronavirus disease 2019, COVID-19) in Wuhan, China, was identified on 7 January 2020. The epidemic quickly disseminated from Wuhan and as at 12 February 2020, 45,179 cases have been confirmed in 25 countries, including 1,116 deaths. Strengthened surveillance was implemented in France on 10 January 2020 in order to identify imported cases early and prevent secondary transmission. Three categories of risk exposure and follow-up procedure were defined for contacts. Three cases of COVID-19 were confirmed on 24 January, the first cases in Europe. Contact tracing was immediately initiated. Five contacts were evaluated as at low risk of exposure and 18 at moderate/high risk. As at 12 February 2020, two cases have been discharged and the third one remains symptomatic with a persistent cough, and no secondary transmission has been identified. Effective collaboration be...","This year marks the 15th anniversary of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in Canada and the 100th anniversary of the 1918 Spanish influenza pandemic. These, and other recent public health events, provide an opportunity for us to review and reflect on the evolution of Canada\u2019s public health emergency response over the past 15 years\u2014from SARS, to the 2009 H1N1 pandemic influenza, to Ebola virus and Zika virus disease. Key lessons have been learned and milestones achieved that have shaped and sharpened our response approach and structures. While SARS was a wake-up-call to strengthen infection prevention and control capacity in health care settings and led to the formation of the Public Health Agency of Canada, it also strengthened our Federal/Provincial/Territorial (FPT) senior-level governance and led to agreements for pan-Canadian mutual aid and infectious disease information sharing. As well, our collective public health laboratory capacity has been strengthened through ongoing ...","Data concerning the transmission of the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) in paucisymptomatic patients are lacking. We report an Italian paucisymptomatic case of coronavirus disease 2019 with multiple biological samples positive for SARS-CoV-2. This case was detected using the World Health Organization protocol on cases and contact investigation. Current discharge criteria and the impact of extra-pulmonary SARS-CoV-2 samples are discussed.","Motivated by the rapid upsurge of COVID-19 cases in the United States beginning March 2020, we forecast the disease spread and assess the effectiveness of containment strategies by using an estalished network-driven epidemic dynamic model. Our model is initialized using the daily counts of active and confirmed COVID-19 cases across the US. Based on our model predictions for the March 14-16 timeframe, the national epidemic peak could be expected to arrive by early June, corresponding to a daily active count of \u2248 7% of the US population, if no containment plans are implemented. Epidemic peaks are expected to arrive in the states of Washington and New York by May 21 and 25, respectively. With a modest 25% reduction in COVID-19 transmissibility via community-level interventions, the epidemic progression could be delayed by up to 34 days. Wholesale interstate traffic restriction is ineffective in delaying the epidemic outbreak, but it does desynchronize the arrival of state-wise epidemic pe...","The emergence of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection in 2012 resulted in an increased concern of the spread of the infection globally. MERS-CoV infection had previously caused multiple health-care-associated outbreaks and resulted in transmission of the virus within families. Community onset MERS-CoV cases continue to occur. Dromedary camels are currently the most likely animal to be linked to human MERS-CoV cases. Serologic tests showed significant infection in adult camels compared to juvenile camels. The control of MERS-CoV infection relies on prompt identification of cases within health care facilities, with institutions applying appropriate infection control measures. In addition, determining the exact route of transmission from camels to humans would further add to the control measures of MERS-CoV infection.","Abstract Medicine shortages have been spreading in European countries. In many cases, the unavailability of medicinal products has a substantial impact on the capability of National Healthcare Systems in ensuring the continuity of care. Shortages originate from multifactorial causes. In particular, they can be due to supply-related factors (e.g., manufacturing issues, regulatory issues, logistics, distribution) and demand-related ones (e.g., fluctuating drug demand, parallel market, tendering, price and reimbursement policies). However, some extraordinary geopolitical events (e.g., Brexit) may also affect medicines\u2019 availability. The capability of European Regulatory Authorities and other stakeholders, which are involved in the pharmaceutical distribution chain and the healthcare assistance services, to define suitable problem-solving strategies has been limited for years by the fragmentation of the European regulatory framework, starting from the lack of a univocal definition of a med...","Individual quarantine and active monitoring of contacts are core disease control strategies, particularly for emerging infectious diseases such as Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). To estimate the comparative efficacy of these interventions to control COVID-19, we fit a stochastic branching model, comparing two sets of reported parameters for the dynamics of the disease. Our results suggest that individual quarantine may contain an outbreak of COVID-19 with a short serial interval (4.8 days) only in settings with high intervention performance where at least three-quarters of infected contacts are individually quarantined. However, in settings where this performance is unrealistically high and the outbreak of COVID-19 continues to grow, so too will the burden of the number of contacts traced for active monitoring or quarantine. In such circumstances where resources are prioritized for scalable interventions such as social distancing, we show active monitoring or individual quarantine...","Background: Controlling the transmission of respiratory infections such as influenza and COVID-19 is a critical public health priority. Non-pharmaceutical intervention policies such as community quarantines, closures and travel bans are often implemented in emergencies but many of them are disruptive and difficult to maintain for extended periods of time. A promising alternative recommended by the CDC for influenza is requiring individuals showing fever symptoms to remain isolated at home until they are fever-free for at least one day, but there is limited evidence to support the effectiveness of such symptom-based isolation policies. Methods: Here we introduce a computational model of symptom-based isolation that accounts for the timing of symptoms, viral shedding and the population structure. It was validated on outbreaks of influenza in schools and modified to account for COVID-19. It was then used to estimate the outbreak curves and the attack rates (the proportion of the populatio...","Early recognition and rapid initiation of infection control precautions are currently the most important strategies for controlling severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). No rapid diagnostic tests currently exist that can rule out SARS among patients with febrile respiratory illnesses. Clinical features alone cannot with certainty distinguish SARS from other respiratory illnesses rapidly enough to inform early management decisions. A balanced approach to screening that allows early recognition of SARS without unnecessary isolation of patients with other respiratory illnesses will require clinicians not only to look for suggestive clinical features but also to routinely seek epidemiologic clues suggestive of SARS coronavirus exposure. Key epidemiologic risk factors include 1) exposure to settings where SARS activity is suspected or documented, or 2) in the absence of such exposure, epidemiologic linkage to other persons with pneumonia (i.e., pneumonia clusters), or 3) exposure to hea...","Relevant pandemic-spread scenario simulations provide guiding principles for containment and mitigation policy developments. Here we devise a simple model to predict the effectiveness of different mitigation strategies. The model consists of a set of simple differential equations considering the population size, reported and unreported infections, reported and unreported recoveries and the number of Covid-19-inflicted deaths. For simplification, we assume that Covid-19 survivors are immune (e.g. mutations are not considered) and that the virus can only be passed on by persons with undetected infections. While the latter assumption is a simplification (it is neglected that e.g. hospital staff may be infected by detected patients with symptoms), it was introduced here to keep the model as simple as possible. Moreover, the current version of the model does not account for age-dependent differences in the death rates, but considers higher mortality rates due to temporary shortage of intens...","Importance: As with other traumatic events, pandemics such as coronavirus-19 (COVID-19) may precipitate or exacerbate psychiatric symptoms such as anxiety and depression, while potentially interfering with health systems' capacity to treat such symptoms. Objective: To quantify the impact of increasing COVID-19 infection on extent of psychiatric assessment across 5 Eastern Massachusetts hospitals. Design: In silico cohort using narrative clinical notes generated between 1/2/2020 and 3/25/2020 Setting: Emergency department and outpatient settings from 2 academic medical centers and 3 community hospitals Participants: All individuals age 13 and older presenting to emergency department or outpatient clinics Main Outcome or Measure: Documentation of psychiatric symptoms reflecting depression, anxiety, psychosis, or suicide, and documentation of violence, was drawn from previously-validated term lists. Results: A total of 2,483,159 outpatient and 205,957 emergency department visit notes were...","The COVID-19 pandemic is spreading worldwide. Italy emerged early on as the country with the largest outbreak outside Asia. The outbreak in Northern Italy demonstrates that it is fundamental to contain the virus' spread at a very early stage of diffusion. At later stages, no containment measure, even if strict, can prevent the saturation of the hospitals and of the intensive care units in any country. Here we show that it is possible to predict when the intensive care units will saturate, within a few days from the first cases of COVID-19 intensive care patients. Using early counts of intensive care patients, we predict the saturation for Lombardy, Italy. Governments should use the Italian precursor to control the outbreak of COVID-19 and prevent the saturation of their intensive care units to protect their population.","Background: The novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic is driving many countries to adopt global isolation measures in an attempt to slow-down its spread. These extreme measures are associated with extraordinary economic costs. Objective: To compare the cost-effectiveness of global isolation of the whole population to focused isolation of individuals at high risk of being exposed, augmented by thorough PCR testing. Design: We applied a modified Susceptible, Exposed, Infectious, Removed (SEIR) model to compare two different strategies in controlling the SARS-CoV-2 spread. Data sources and target population: We modeled the dynamics in Israel, a small country with ~ 9 million people. Time horizon: 200 days. Interventions: 1. Global isolation of the whole population (strategy 1) 2. Focused isolation of people at high risk of exposure with extensive PCR testing (strategy 2). Outcome measures: Number of deaths and the cost per one avoided death in strategy 1 vs 2. Results of Base-Case analy...","Abstract Objective This document summarizes the limited experience of SARS in pregnancy and suggests guidelines for management. Outcomes Cases reported from Asia suggest that maternal and fetal outcomes are worsened by SARS during pregnancy. Evidence Medline was searched for relevant articles published in English from 2000 to 2007. Case reports were reviewed and expert opinion sought. Values Recommendations were made according to the guidelines developed by the Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care. Sponsors The Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Canada. Recommendations 1. All hospitals should have infection control systems in place to ensure that alerts regarding changes in exposure risk factors for SARS or other potentially serious communicable diseases are conveyed promptly to clinical units, including the labour and delivery unit. (III-C) 2. At times of SARS outbreaks, all pregnant patients being assessed or admitted to the hospital should be screened for sympto..."],"title":["Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus: Implications for

Halting movement between cities and between countries, as has already occurred with the COVID-19 pandemic, is an additional measure to adopt in any pandemic situation; others have examined these control measures for COVID-19 and pandemic influenza settings. 5, 6 Methods A community-based simulation model capturing the demographics and movement patterns of individuals in an Australian city, with the virus transmission characteristics of COVID-19, was used to evaluate the potential effectiveness of a range of social distancing strategies. The model is individual-based (c.f. agent-based) and represent each individual in a specific community, matching recent census and other government data.7, 8 We previously developed individual-based simulation models for population centres in Australia, South Africa, Thailand, Vietnam and Papua New Guinea, all using the same underlying automata-theoretic modelling methodology, to capture the dynamics of both pathogen transmission and population mobility.9-13 This modelling methodology is presented in detail in previous publications.11","is the (which was not peer-reviewed) The copyright holder for this preprint . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.20.20040055 doi: medRxiv preprint The model explicitly represents each household, workplace and school in community and the movement of individuals between, as they move from households to schools and workplaces in a daytime cycle, then return to their household in an evening cycle, with each day split into a day and night period. This mobility mechanism allowed us to model changing contact patterns, with possible virus transmission occurring in these contact locations, and also in the wider community, including at weekends. The model represents the individual-to-individual contact patterns in as much detail as data sources provide, to accurately describe how the movement of individuals allows virus transmission to spread over a geographic region. This level of detail is critical for modelling social distancing interventions, whose aim is to minimize person-to-person contact patterns and consequential virus transmission. Such models have been used previously to evaluate the effectiveness (and cost-effectiveness) of alternative infectious disease control and containment strategies, including social distancing, vaccination and antiviral drug treatment in an Australian setting.19","Individual-, Institutional-, Community-, and Global-Based Strategies Disease prevention and control activities for infectious agents occur at four levels. The first level is targeted to the individual and is predominantly the domain of the clinician. A variety of prevention activities can be targeted to individuals through their primary care provider. Use of chemoprophylaxis to prevent surgical wound infections is an example of a control measure targeted to the individual. The second level is that of the institution, which is predominantly the domain of the infection-control practitioner or the school health official. This level includes health care facilities, nursing homes, other residential facilities, and schools. Programs to prevent the spread of bloodborne pathogens or tuberculosis to health care workers in hospitals are examples of control strategies targeted at the institutional level. The third level is targeted to the community in general and is predominantly the domain of public health agencies (at the local, state, and national levels). Removal of a contaminated food product from the market is an example of a control measure targeted to the community. The fourth level is related to global strategies. For a number of important pathogens, it has become clear that global control strategies are critical to have an impact on disease occurrence within the United States. The growing proportion of tuberculosis cases among refugees and immigrants to the United States and ongoing episodes of importation of measles from abroad are two examples pertinent to U.S. disease control in the early 21st century.","The emergence of SARS in 2003 and the subsequent control of the virus shed light on important measures for the control of emerging viral respiratory infections. These measures include: quick case detection, isolation of suspected cases, effective contact tracing, and the practice of basic infection control measures [75] (http://www.who.int/ csr/sars/en/WHOconsensus.pdf). In a mathematical model, a combination of household-based quarantine, isolation of cases outside the household, and targeted prophylactic use was shown to be effective in the prevention of viral transmission [76] . Delays of more than 3 days in contact tracing, case identification, and quarantine adversely affected the effectiveness of isolation [77] . One study estimated the effectiveness of the isolation of symptomatic patients and the tracing and quarantine of contacts [78] . The authors concluded that SARS could be controlled by effective isolation of symptomatic patients [78] . This finding is in contrast to the case of pandemic influenza because of the high level of presymptomatic transmission that does not occur with SARS [78] . In a review of the effectiveness of community quarantine, it was found that this is an effective preventive measure, but quantification of the effect was lacking [79, 80] . The delay in the isolation of patients in the healthcare setting also contributed to the spread of SARS [79] . The Al-Hasa MERS-CoV outbreak and the recent increase of MERS-CoV cases in April-May 2014 also point to inadequate infection control measures [4] (http://www.who.int/csr/disease/coronavirus_infections/ MERS_CoV_RA_20140424.pdf?ua=1). Prompt identification of patients with SARS and the implementation of infection control measures resulted in the prevention of secondary transmission of SARS [81] . Different strategies may be used for the control of an outbreak in a healthcare setting. A hospital closure is needed to control nosocomial transmission if the outbreak is detected late, or closure early in an outbreak is sufficient to remove exposed persons to a designated location or keeping them in one place [82] . In a study of family members and other visiting patients with SARS, it was shown that the rate of SARS among visitors was lower when they used masks [83] . Thus, prompt identification of cases with subsequent proper isolation in the healthcare setting or community quarantine is a key measure to prevent the spread of emerging respiratory pathogens.","Finally, control strategies need to be evaluated for their effectiveness. For example, the effectiveness of the control strategy is a critical issue in evaluating ways to curb the HIV epidemic in the absence of vaccination. Evaluation of educational programs on preventing HIV infection or of HIV counseling and testing programs is essential in assessing the effectiveness of currently available strategies. Costeffectiveness models are often used in making recommendations for population-based vaccination programs. 122, 123 Primary, Secondary, and Tertiary Prevention Prevention strategies for infectious diseases can be characterized by the traditional concepts of primary, secondary, or tertiary prevention. 1 Primary prevention can be defined as the prevention of infection by personal and community-wide efforts. Secondary prevention includes measures available to individuals and the population for detection of early infection and effective intervention. Tertiary prevention consists of measures available to reduce or eliminate the long-term impairment and disabilities caused by infectious diseases.","In the absence of vaccines and specific treatment, the only available public health tools to control persontoperson transmittable diseases are isolation and quarantine, social distancing, and community containment measures. 10 Isolation is the separation of ill people from non infected people, and usually occurs in hospital settings, but could also be done at home for mild infections. 11 For isolation to be successful in preventing transmission, case detection should be early-ie, before the onset of viral shedding or at least before the onset of peak viral shedding. For SARS, viral loads peaked at 6-11 days after onset of illness for nasopharyngeal aspirates, enabling early isolation before transmission. 12 The number of secondary cases from an infected patient was clearly reduced if the infected patient was isolated within 4 days after onset of symptoms. 13 For SARS, a highly sensitive case definition was used with a focus on fever or respiratory symptoms, and an epidemiological link (contact or travel history). All suspected patients were isolated until SARS was ruled out. Implementing optimal isolation by itself was modelled to be more costeffective than implementing suboptimal isolation and quarantine together. 14 Secondary household transmission was low in Singapore (6\u00b72%), indicative of rapid detection and isolation of patients. Similarly, in Toronto, secondary attack rate in households was 10%, with a linear association between secondary attack rate and the time that the index patient spent at home after symptom onset. 15 In Singapore, healthcare associated transmission accounted for more than 90% of all cases. 16 Once full measures were in place, almost all patients were promptly isolated before secondary transmission had occurred. The outbreak in Singapore was propagated by five superspreading events, 16 including three super spreading events as a result of atypical clinical manifestations of SARS. 17 Quarantine involves movement restriction, ideally combined with medical observation during the quarantine period, of close contacts of infected patients during the incubation period. 18 The premise for successful quarantine is prompt and comprehensive contact tracing of each and every confirmed patient. Quarantine can take place at home or in designated places such as hotels, and both of these options were used during the SARS epidemic. Quarantined contacts had to record their temperatures, and were visited or telephoned daily by a member of the public healthcare team. If the contact developed symptoms, they were investigated at a designated healthcare facility. The principle is that if the person under quarantine developed illness, that person would not have any close contacts to spread the disease, effectively reducing the R\u2080 of the outbreak to less than 1. As an example of the magnitude of efforts taken, Toronto Public Health investigated 2132 potential cases of SARS and identified 23 103 contacts as requiring quarantine. 19 Legally enforceable quarantine orders were issued to contacts. Police made spot checks in Hong Kong whereas video cameras were installed at the home of each contact in Singapore. 16, 20 Once it is no longer feasible to identify all infectious individuals and their contacts in the attempt to slow the spread of disease, a possible next step is to apply communitywide containment measures. Community wide containment is an intervention that is applied to an entire community, city, or region, designed to reduce personal interactions. 10 These interventions range from measures to encourage personal responsibility to identify disease, increase social distancing among community members including cancellation of public gatherings, and finally implement community quarantine. 11 Enforcement of communitywide contain ment measures is far more complex than isolation or quarantine because of the larger number of people involved. China best exemplified this largescale quarantine by declaring epidemic zones and placing people under collective quarantine in villages, cities, or institutions. 21 In April 2003, the Chinese authorities gained full control of all activities to combat SARS, with guidelines and control measures that were national, unambiguous, rational, and widely followed, under central guidance. The stringent control measures included school closures and closures of all universities and public places, as well as the cancellation of the public holiday in May. Immediately, the R\u2080 decreased greatly and consistently. 22 In May, 2003, China locked down Beijing and closed more than 3500 public places in an effort to curb community spread.","MERS may be transmitted from person-to-person via direct contact likely due to droplet transmission ( Table 2 ). This occurs most commonly when there is close contact such as providing unprotected care to an infected patient. Thus far, no sustained community transmission has been documented. Studies of family clusters and HCP contacts of patients have reported low frequencies of transmission (ie, 1%-3%). However, increased transmission has occurred in health care settings with limited infection control procedures. Importantly, MERS may be transmitted from an asymptomatic source. 73 However, super spreaders have also been reported. 74 The epidemiology and prevention of MERS in health care settings has been reviewed. 10,75-77 Infection prevention strategies have been informed by the multiple reports of outbreaks of MERS involving health care facilities, [78] [79] [80] [81] and by the large outbreak in South Korea. 82 Importantly, during these outbreaks &gt;20% of cases may have occurred in health care providers. Factors contributing to intrahospital transmission include: (1) the initial symptoms of MERS are nonspecific ","A 16-member research team in Vancouver, Canada, composed of experts in occupational medicine, occupational hygiene, infection control, public health, and epidemiology and clinicians and frontline care providers reviewed the current scientific knowledge on the efficacy of PPE in preventing the transmission of respiratory infections and the effectiveness of these protective measures when used in clinical practice under working conditions. Literature searches were conducted in 5 databases (Medline, EMBASE, CINAHL, Web of Science, and OSHROM) for articles published in English in the last 15 years that related to infection control practices, occupational health and safety issues, and environmental factors and other issues of importance in protecting workers against infections in health care settings. This produced an initial list of 841 publications. From the initial literature search results, a series of research topics were developed under 3 broad categories: (1) basic science and efficacy of facial protective equipment, (2) the effectiveness of specific infection control procedures, and (3) organizational and individual factors that influence infection control and occupational health in health care settings.","\u2022 Fill gaps in understanding of the natural history of infection to better define the period of infectiousness and transmissibility; more accurately estimate the reproductive number in various outbreak settings and improve understanding the role of asymptomatic infection. \u2022 Comparative analysis of different quarantine strategies and contexts for their effectiveness and social acceptability \u2022 Enhance and develop an ethical framework for outbreak response that includes better equity for access to interventions for all countries \u2022 Promote the development of point-of-care diagnostic tests \u2022 Determine the best ways to apply knowledge about infection prevention and control in health-care settings in resource-constrained countries (including identification of optimal personal protective equipment) and in the broader community, specifically to understand behaviour among different vulnerable groups \u2022 Support standardised, best evidence-based approach for clinical management and better outcomes and implement randomised, controlled trials for therapeutics and vaccines as promising agents emerge \u2022 Validation of existing serological tests, including those that have been developed by commercial entities, and establishment of biobanks and serum panels of well characterised COVID-19 sera to support such efforts \u2022 Complete work on animal models for vaccine and therapeutic research and development include some identified by the global community and by the Research and Development Blueprint Scientific Advisory Group. The STAG-IH emphasises the importance of the continued rapid sharing of data of public health importance in medical journals that provide rapid peer review and online publication without a paywall. It is sharing of information in this way, as well as technical collaboration among clinicians, epidemiologists, and virologists, that has provided the world with its current understanding of COVID-19.","Many of the studies in this special issue identified strategies to improve the health of marginalized groups. Wallimann and colleagues [19] explored the primary care network of Eritrean immigrants in Switzerland. They found language difficulties and intercultural understanding are barriers to properly accessing care and identified six key lessons for practices to facilitate health care access for Eritrean immigrants. Pudpong et al. [20] assessed a voluntary health insurance scheme for migrants in Thailand. They found that it improved access for previously uninsured migrants and reduced the financial burden for public hospitals in the project area. They suggested further efforts to raise community understanding of the benefits of being insured in order to improve the sustainability and effectiveness of the program. Gaboardi et al. [21] assessed the goals and principles of providers working with people experiencing homelessness in eight European countries, indicating a contrast between providers who were more focused on their client\u2019s autonomy and those whose primary focus was on the client\u2019s basic needs such as food, health and temporary accommodation. Braun-Lewensohn et al. [22] explored the coping strategies for stressors among women in Bedouin society and described the stability of sense of coherence (SOC) in this minority society as it underwent rapid social and cultural changes. Significant differences were found between age groups, and the oldest women were identified as an at-risk population due to limitations in their coping strategies and SOC. In related research in a very different community, Millan et al. [23] examined the health beliefs and practices of Gypsies and Travelers in the UK, where these communities experience significant marginalization and discrimination. They described this community\u2019s health problems and their experiences in health care systems, including discrimination and negative stereotypes. The authors indicate the need for a more concentrated and intensive approach to improve health among travelers in the UK.","We must be precise in the terms that we use. An article entitled ''Rapid control of an outbreak of Staphylococcus aureus on a neonatal intensive care department using standard infection control practices and nasal mupirocin'' 7 states that active surveillance cultures, in addition to cohorting of patients and staff, contact isolation precautions, hand hygiene, and nasal mupriocin were used as the intervention. The outbreak was terminated in 4 weeks. However, it is clear that standard precautions alone were not used (as implied by the article title) but rather that active surveillance cultures were used in addition to contact precautions. If we are not precise in the terms that we use (as in the use of ''standard infection control practices''in this paper), readers will be misled or confused in interpreting the results. How often do health care worker hands become contaminated after contacting environmental surfaces? A study conducted at a Veteran's Administration hospital evaluated how often health care worker's (HCW) hands became contaminated on 8 wards/units randomly selected over 2 weeks. 8 At the hospital, stool specimen positive for Clostridium difficile were screened for vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (VRE), but no active surveillance cultures were performed for MRSA. Target pathogens were MRSA, VRE, C difficile, and gram-negative bacteria. HCW hands were cultured immediately after use of an alcohol rub and then after contact with a variety of environmental surfaces in patient's rooms (ie, bed rail, bed table, or nearby surface). Imprints of the hands were performed on blood agar. All control cultures (after alcohol rub and before environmental contact) were negative. In occupied rooms, 34 of 64 (53%) of HCW hands were positive for $1 target pathogen. In cleaned rooms, 6 of 25 (24%) of HCW hands were positive for $1 target pathogen. The authors concluded that HCWs ''commonly acquire nosocomial pathogens when they contact environmental surfaces near patients who are not in contact isolation.'' This paper again reemphasizes the importance of hand hygiene during all patient and environmental contacts. Is fecal incontinence a risk factor for environmental VRE contamination? In a prospective study at a university hospital, the frequency of VRE contamination in rooms of 15 continent and 15 incontinent patients culture positive for VRE was evaluated by culturing bed rails, bedside tables, and call buttons at baseline and 2 and 5 days after disinfection. 9 Regardless of continence or incontinence status (with or without diarrhea or occasional or frequent incontinence), the rate of environmental VRE contamination was common. All baseline, day 2, or day 5 cultures were positive $50% of the time, except for day 2 cultures in continent patients without diarrhea, which were positive 44% of the time. The authors concluded ''environmental contamination occurs frequently in rooms of patients who are continent or incontinent and VRE-colonized. Similar infection control measures should be implemented for continent and incontinent patients.'' This study shows that incontinence is not a risk factor for environmental VRE contamination. Given the data that VRE colony counts in the stool of colonized or infected patients are similar, 10 these data show that the infection control precautions implemented for VRE-colonized or infected patients should be the same whether or not they are continent or incontinent. Current factors that argue for a more aggressive approach to control of health care-associated MRSA and VRE. During the past few years, we have seen the emergence of community-acquired MRSA. Some have argued that, with the emergence of MRSA in the community, efforts to control MRSA in health care settings should not be a priority. However, although the prevalence of community-acquired MRSA varies from region to region, several studies show that the prevalence of community-acquired MRSA is much, much lower than that of health care-associated MRSA. Three recent studies, 2 in pediatric populations and a third in the homeless population, found the prevalence of community-acquired MRSA to be approximately 0.2%. [11] [12] [13] In addition, a national prevalence study of the US population found the prevalence of MRSA to be ,1%. Thus, the prevalence of community-acquired MRSA pales in comparison with the .50% prevalence of MRSA in health care settings. Furthermore, over the past 2 years, we have witnessed the emergence of true vancomycin resistance in S aureus (VRSA). 14 In 2004, the third VRSA-infected patient was identified in a long-term care facility. 15 Data from the CDC's National Nosocomial Infections Surveillance (NNIS) system show that the incidence of MRSA and VRE continues to increase in our health care facilities, even at facilities with ICPs committed to infection control, suggesting that the current CDC isolation guideline recommendations have not worked (and will not in the future) in preventing transmission of MRSA or VRE in health care settings. The current incidence of MRSA exceeds 50%, and current incidence of VRE exceeds 25% in intensive care unit (ICU) settings (Fig 1; NNIS, MRSA, and VRE). In addition, recent data monitoring the emergence of VRE in San Francisco Bay area hospitals illustrate that, if aggressive control measures are not taken, VRE will become endemic in your institution. 16 In 33 hospitals in the San Francisco Bay area, from 1993 through 1998, VRE increased from 1 isolate at 1 hospital to 864 isolates in all 33 hospitals (and 100 bloodstream infections). These data again illustrate the importance of identifying and isolating patients who are colonized and those who are infected with VRE. The SHEA Guideline. The SHEA Guideline for preventing nosocomial transmission of multidrug-resistant strains of S aureus and enterococcus presents a proven approach for controlling MRSA, VISA, VRSA, and VRE. 4 The major recommendations include the following: (1) active surveillance cultures to identify the reservoir (ie, colonized patients) for spread, (2) hand hygiene, (3) barrier precautions (contact isolation or cohorting), (4) antibiotic stewardship, and (5) decolonization of MRSAor VRE-colonized patients or HCWs (in selected settings). The purpose of the active surveillance cultures is to identify all colonized patients. The guideline does not recommend that all patients admitted to the hospital be cultured. Rather, it recommends that high-risk patients be identified. Examples of such high-risk patients might include those on prolonged antibiotics, those admitted to specific areas of the hospital (eg, dialysis, ICUs, oncology wards), those with underlying diseases (eg, dialysis patients), or those with prolonged hospital stays. What data are there to show that the SHEA Guideline approach works? In Table 1 , the impact of implementing the SHEA recommended approach in a variety of settings (entire acute care hospitals at university or community hospitals; medical, surgical or neonatal ICUs, surgical or oncology wards) is shown. In each of these interventions presented at the 2004 SHEA annual meeting, the SHEA recommendations significantly reduced MRSA compared with the experience in the previous year. In the one instance in which the intervention did not reduce MRSA, subsequent investigation revealed that compliance with surveillance cultures was only 61%, and, after enhancing compliance in obtaining the active surveillance cultures, the rates of MRSA have been significantly reduced (personnel communication, L. Mermel, MD). It seems extremely unlikely that all of these studies (and those that have been already been published) would all have findings in 1 direction-reduction of MRSA or VRE-if the results were due to chance alone. Arguments that all these studies are flawed rings hollow. Where are similar data showing that hand hygiene alone, standard precautions alone, or the implementation of the current or draft CDC HICPAC Isolation Guideline recommendations have had a similar impact? In fact, CDC NNIS data show that the prevalence of MRSA and VRE have continued to increase despite implementation of CDC-HICPAC recommendations at US hospitals. What do mathematical models tell us is the best approach to control VRE? Recently, Perencevich et al 17 published a study using mathematical modeling of their ICU data evaluating a variety of VRE control strategies in ICU settings. In this model, they compared standard precautions with no active surveillance cultures and no isolation of previously known VREpositive patients on readmission, passive surveillance and isolation of those known to be VRE-culture positive on admission or when clinical cultures detect the VREinfected patient (ie, the CDC HICPAC approach), or active surveillance cultures with either isolation of the VRE-colonized patient and removal from isolation when the culture is negative or only placing the patient in isolation when VRE culture positivity is detected. When these approaches were compared, passive surveillance only reduced VRE by 4.2% compared with standard precautions alone. In contrast, active surveillance cultures with isolation of the patient after the culture is positive reduced VRE by 39% and active surveillance cultures with immediate isolation and removal if culture negative reduced VRE by 65% compared with no surveillance. The authors concluded that ''active surveillance are projected to be effective in reducing VRE transmission in ICU settings.''","As the international community responds to SARS-CoV-2, public health authorities in humanitarian crises begin at a disadvantage to enact appropriate infection control to prevent transmission in healthcare settings, identify infectious cases, administer supportive care and novel treatments for the seriously ill, and trace contacts. These standard public health measures are particularly difficult to perform in humanitarian settings. For example, limited public health, laboratory, and primary care services represent a barrier to testing. Providing the limited healthcare worker cadre with appropriate training and personal protective equipment, and ensuring a continuous supply chain for such, is a challenge in all settings, exacerbated in complex humanitarian crises. Frequent displacement and limited contact information may prevent effective contact tracing. Finally, intractable structural challenges such as overcrowding limit the implementation of both quarantine of those exposed and isolation of those who are ill. Given these increased vulnerabilities, humanitarian crises should be viewed as a priority for national and international bodies that seek to combat this unfolding pandemic. Resources must be identified to protect healthcare workers, develop and deploy rapid testing, improve surveillance, and enact quarantine and isolation of contacts and cases.","As seen in the first reported outbreaks, health care workers are at higher risk for infection with SARS. 5, 17 Worldwide, the proportion of probable SARS cases that were health care workers was 21%, with a range of 0% in the United States and other countries to 57% in Vietnam. 12 Although recent reports suggest that infection control practices can be effective in some settings, 18, 19 outbreaks have been documented among protected health care workers. 20 Prior to our findings presented here, few reports have addressed differences in policies and practices among affected hospitals, which might explain differences in infection control effectiveness among institutions and countries. More research also is needed on the effectiveness of hospital policies for triage and visitor restrictions; staff training and education; patient placement in negative air pressure rooms; 2-stage removal of PPE using anterooms or secondary staging areas; and the use of specific articles of PPE, such as eye protection, head covers, and foot covers. Such knowledge will help hospitals prioritize resources most effectively, especially when resources are limited.","To our knowledge, this is the most comprehensive study to date on quantifying the relative effect of different NPIs and their timings for COVID-19 outbreak containment, based on human movement and disease data. Our findings show that NPIs, inter-city travel restrictions, social distancing and contact reductions, as well as early case detection and isolations, have substantially reduced COVID-19 transmission across China, with the effectiveness of different interventions varying. The early detection and isolation of cases was estimated to prevent more infections than travel restrictions and contact reductions, but integrated NPIs would achieve the strongest and most rapid effect. Our findings contribute to improved understanding of integrated NPI measures on COVID-19 containment and can help in tailoring control strategies across contexts.","Since the onset of COVID-19, the demand for facemasks have exceeded supplies leading to a global shortage created by extensive use by the community. Facemask is among the tools for travelers and health professionals highlighted by Chiodinie et al. on February 7, 2020 in the Travel Medicine and Infectious Disease journal [1] . However, the effectiveness of facemask use in community settings for the prevention of COVID-19 has been controversial [1] [2] [3] [4] . Because of lack of evidence, the World Health Organization recommend against wearing masks in community settings for the prevention of COVID-19. Although disposable surgical masks were designed for the protection of health-care workers during occupational exposures, face masks became popular among non-health professionals during the SARS epidemic of 2003 and the 2009 pdm H1N1.","We argue for a focus on basic pediatric critical care principals with locally appropriate adaptations in collaboration with ministries of health and community members. A concentration on international partnerships, educational initiatives, and research strategies will only help to enhance the specialty of pediatric critical care. Building capacity and evaluating efficacy of critical care interventions in resource-limited settings has the potential to greatly improve the overall outcome of critically ill children by supporting interventions at every level of patient care. The strategies outlined move us toward delivery of an adequate standard of critical care for all children globally and provide an opportunity to dramatically decrease the mortality of children in resource-limited settings.","The agenda for critical care research in resource-limited settings should include more evidence on epidemiology and outcomes. A more accurate estimate of the potential lives saved through pediatric critical care interventions would justify its role in healthcare systems globally (19). Data on critical care capacity, and access to both critical care resources and health care professionals, are essential for health system planning, but generally lacking. Efforts should be made to adjust critical care guidelines from high-income countries to resource-limited settings. Cost-effectiveness analyses of current and proposed critical care practices need to be emphasized (73). Efficacy must be measured and validated for critical care interventions, with limited resources targeted to those practices that save lives, time, and resources. Currently, available critical care mortality prediction tools and triage scoring systems require revalidation in region-specific contexts (131, 132) and low-cost critical care technology is much needed to support critical care in resource-limited settings.","There is no doubt that MERS-CoV remains a serious threat and has exhibited a significant public health impact in the affected countries. Currently, health careeassociated transmission plays a pivotal role in the evolution of the MERS-CoV epidemic in countries in the Arabian Peninsula. A significant cost has been encountered in terms of personnel and time required for contact tracing and means of implementing infection control and prevention measures in health care settings. So far, there is no evidence of sustained humanto-human transmission. However, significant concerns exist in terms of the increased number of health careeassociated cases, gaps in knowledge regarding transmission routes, and limited infection control capacity in affected countries. As the MERS-CoV epidemic continues to evolve, vaccine and specific antiviral agents against MERS-CoV are urgently needed. Studies about the effectiveness of infection control measures will provide answers and eventually promote safety in health care facilities both for patients and HCWs.","Why should adults care about paediatric vaccination? S57 one by two weeks. A longer duration of viral shedding and higher viral titres in the naso-pharynx compared with adults, associated with promiscuity (day care centres, school) explain the children' major vector role in this respiratory transmission. Any intervention in childhood limiting Influenza virus circulation in the community should provide indirect protection (\"herd immunity\") to adults. Large immunisation programmes in children have been investigated in different settings measuring the protection of contacts (households) or the community at large. So far, routine immunisation of school-age children appear to be effective in preventing the disease burden in the community and adults contacts in several studies. Nevertheless, methodological discrepancies between them render imprecise the estimation of this strategy on effectiveness: which preventable fraction is achievable in adults? The impact in the community depends on the coverage rate achieved, the vaccine efficacy and the contact patterns. Some simulation models taking in account different efficacy figures of Influenza vaccines (most assume a protective efficacy of 70% and a 80% efficacy for infectiousness) and different coverage levels suggest that a coverage rate of 20% of schoolchildren would result in as much mortality reduction in elderly as vaccinating 90% of persons aged 64 and over. Nevertheless, if the universal influenza immunisation strategy in schoolchildren has demonstrated some benefits in term of reduction of the disease burden -either in observational studies or in mathematical models -in adults or elderly, some points must be raised: -Routine vaccination of school aged children has not been shown to decrease by indirect effect the burden of disease in infants and younger children who are highly infectious (thus transmitting the virus) or more at risk of hospitalisation for severe Influenza disease. So far the American recommendation of immunisation first before 23 months of age, then, since 2006 up to 59 months of age is mainly based on a reduction of morbidity, hospitalisation, mortality in the targeted group. -An other source of concern is the low coverage rates achieved postrecommendation in the US, especially for the full primo-vaccination demanding two doses below 9 years of age. -It has not been demonstrated yet that routine vaccination of children below 2 years of age has an indirect impact in the population. -In Europe, the injectable trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine TIV, sole available raises the issues of acceptability by the families, and on a national public health point of view the feasibility of such a programme, the huge increase of resources and the adequate information strategies. -TIV efficacy may vary depending of the child's age, the matching of the strains -wild/vaccine -although mathematical models assume its upper range (70%) and never more conservative hypothesis (the real life). -Clearly the availability of an intra-nasal live attenuated influenza vaccine in Europe could be an opportunity to enlarge the strategies due to its higher protective efficacy and easiness of administration.","Although most secondary prevention strategies involve chemoprophylaxis (and, rarely, immunoprophylaxis), the concept can be broadened to other prevention efforts aimed at intervention and correction of a recognized specific health hazard. Most such efforts occur at the community level. Examples of community-based secondary prevention efforts include the early identification of contaminated products through outbreak investigations and subsequent removal of such products from the market to prevent additional illnesses and restore \"the community's health. \" A boil-water order for a waterborne disease outbreak of cryptosporidiosis is another example of a secondary prevention strategy aimed at correcting an existing community-wide problem.","Several studies demonstrated the infection control policy of medical centers in Taiwan. 4, 9, 10 For different infectious diseases, the roles and infection control strategies in various levels of healthcare system would be different. The strategies of preventing COVID-19 in community hospitals have not been described. Therein, we present our strategies of how to prevent COVID-19 infection in a community hospital without negative pressure isolation room in Taiwan. Kaohsiung Municipal Ta-Tung hospital (KMTTH) is a 428-bed community hospital in Kaohsiung, Taiwan. Our policy is that we have to do our best to prevent any possible COVID-19 infection in the hospital. We described our strategies as beneath.","The prevention of transmission of MERS-CoV in the community and in health-care settings is crucial to preventing outbreaks and further spread. Several substantive reviews and WHO guidelines are available on the subject. 21, 61, 76, 96 It is important to maintain good personal and environmental hygiene, and to implement stringent contact and droplet precautions among health-care workers. To prevent community transmission, contact tracing, quarantine or isolation of close contacts, and public education are important measures. 20, 60 In hospitals, early case detection followed by isolation is essential, ideally in negative pressure isolation rooms. The main infection prevention and control measures for managing patients with MERS are well documented from the SARS epidemic and from experiences from managing MERS outbreaks (appendix pp 7-8).","We did not analyze second-order benefits from screening, such as potential to raise awareness. Official recommendations emphasize that screening is an opportunity for \u2018risk communication\u2019 in which travellers can be instructed how to proceed responsibly if symptoms develop at the destination (World Health Organization, 2020d). Alongside increased general surveillance/alertness in healthcare settings, such measures could help reduce the risk of local transmission and superspreading, but their quantitative effectiveness is unknown. Once limited local transmission has begun, arrival screening could still have merit as a means to restrict the number of parallel chains of transmission present in a country. Once there is generalized spread which has outpaced contact tracing, departure screening to prevent export of cases to new areas will be more valuable than arrival screening to identify additional incoming cases. Altogether, screening should not be viewed as a definitive barrier to case importation, but used alongside on-the-ground response strategies that help reduce the probability that any single imported case spreads to cause a self-sustaining local epidemic. The cost-benefit tradeoff for any screening policy should be assessed in light of past experiences, where few or no infected travellers have been detected by such programs (Gostic et al., 2015).","Successful control of a communicable disease requires one thing: that the average number of secondary cases generated by a typical primary case is less than one. When transmission is reduced below this threshold, sustained spread of the pathogen becomes impossible. Evidence form national surveillance data, clinical intervention studies, and mathematical models is reviewed and used to assess the possibilities for reducing transmission below this level leading to the long-term control of MRSA transmission in hospitals. Community MRSA reservoirs, community transmission, misleading surveillance data, limited infection control resources, and over-reliance on control measures of limited effectiveness all represent potential obstacles to the successful control of MRSA in hospitals. The importance of these obstacles will be considered, and means of overcoming them discussed.","is the (which was not peer-reviewed) The copyright holder for this preprint . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03. 15.20036418 doi: medRxiv preprint hours. The case fatality rate in china was 3.8% (for Hubei was 4.4%). The highest and the lowest case fatality rate are belongs to Italy (7.9%)(and South Korea (0.76%), respectively. Which represent the effectiveness of their policies in control of the COVID-19. Social distancing was one of the most effective policies to control past epidemic disease by limitation human to human transmission and reducing mortality and morbidity ( 29 , 30 , 30 ) . However studies suggest that combination of multiple policies can boost the effectiveness. For instance, New York City Department of Health implement different policies during the influenza pandemic in 1918-19 at the same time and they have the lowest rate of mortality on the eastern seaboard of the USA 31 . During COVID-19 outbreak, researchers predicted that the mass movement of people at the end of the Lunar New Year holiday, would increase the spreading of disease. Facing this concern, government of china implemented policies which was helpful in control the disease such as, extended the holiday so the holiday would long enough to shelter the incubation period of COVID-19, isolation of confirmed cases in hospitals, quarantining mild or asymptomatic persons in different hospitals, home-based quarantine of people from Hubei province (epicenter of the epidemic), and the most important one was to prevent individuals with asymptomatic infections from spreading the virus. ( 19 , 22 ) Iran is facing this concern as an important upcoming event in Iran is Nowruz which is the Iranian New Year, which recommended prompted policies from government.","However, the presence of asymptomatic cases in the community represent an ongoing threat (64, 65) although it is not currently known if subclinical cases are less infectious. This highlights the need for rapid testing suspected cases to quickly isolate those that test positive for the novel coronavirus. To achieve this goal, public health authorities in Singapore are reactivating 900 general practitioner clinics (66) . Field investigations have identified cases linked to the \"Grace Assembly of God\" and the \"Life Church and Missions\" in Singapore, a large cluster seeded by the Wuhan visitors. Our overall estimate for R does not differ considerably if these two churches are analyzed as a single large cluster or as two smaller clusters. While new clusters emerge, some . CC-BY-NC 4.0 International license It is made available under a author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity. Moreover, Singapore has also produced secondary chains of disease transmission beyond its borders (24). Although Singapore has been detecting and isolating cases with diligence, our findings underscore the need for continued and sustained containment efforts to prevent largescale community transmission including nosocomial outbreaks. Overall, the current situation in Singapore highlights the need to investigate the unlinked and asymptomatic cases that could be a potential source of secondary cases and amplified transmission in confined settings. Although","The effectiveness of quarantine (i.e., lockdown) measures to prevent the spread of an epidemic due to a novel infectious pathogen where no vaccine is available has often been a subject of debate [7,8,9]. Under ordinary circumstances, border control efforts do not go beyond entry screening. However, during the epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2002\u20132003, although entry screening at airports and other key locations was adopted, in most countries its effectiveness was estimated to be very limited due to the relatively long incubation period and low prevalence of SARS, which resulted in extremely low positive predictive values at screening locations [10,11,12,13]. In the ongoing COVID-19 epidemic, many countries have accompanied regular entry screening with drastic changes in travel restrictions. Although the effectiveness of entry screening is likely very limited as already shown elsewhere [14], the epidemiological impact of the change in movement restrictions has yet to be explicitly evaluated.","The effectiveness of quarantine (i.e. lockdown) measures to prevent the spread of an epidemic due to a novel infectious pathogen where no vaccine is available has often been a subject of debate [7] [8] [9] .

Rothstein &amp; Talbott (2007) found that to make quarantine to be the most effective measure for limiting the spread of infection, compliance with quarantine regulations should be encouraged, that is, providing job security and income replacement. Wang et al. (2012) found that In the case of short reaction time, intra-population, such as patient isolation, are more effective than inter-population such as travel restrictions. Jefferson (2008) pandemic influenza (H1N1) and found those were effective to some extent. Rashid (2015) researched the public health policy of the 2009 pandemic influenza and concluded that the school closure, whether positive or passive, seemed to be moderately effective and acceptable in reducing the spread of influenza and delaying the peak of the epidemic, but it is related to high expenses of secondary school. Voluntary isolation and quarantine at home are also effective and acceptable measures, but it takes the risk of intra-household transmission from index cases to contacts. Workplace-related interventions, such as work closure and work at home, are also moderately effective and acceptable, but it may have negatively impact on economy. Internal mobility restriction is only effective when extremely high restrictions (50% of travel) are imposed and mass gatherings which happened within 10 days before the epidemic peak is likely to increase the risk of transmission of influenzas. Rothstein (2015) compared the effectiveness of public health policies to intervene with infectious diseases, among which quarantine is one of the most aggressive and controversial measures that public health officials can take when trying to control an outbreak. Serious legal and ethical concerns have been raised because of restrictions on the movement of potentially large numbers of people (Fidler et al., 2007) . During the SARS epidemic in 2003, quarantine was widely used in several Asian countries and Canada, and it played a role in ending the epidemic. Similarly, during the 2014 Ebola outbreak in West Africa, social distancing measures, including quarantine, had become a major containment strategy. The paradox of quarantine and other social distancing measures is that they may effectively resist the outbreak of disease, but the scope of application is too wide, leading to various social hazards, including economic disruption, physical isolation and even violence. Quarantine is the first public health tool to control infectious diseases and remains a legitimate and valuable public health strategy because it has a significant impact on civil liberties, economic activity and social cohesion, so officials must be extra careful about the possibility of abusing quarantine authority (Rothstein, 2015) .","A second type of primary prevention is antimicrobial prophylaxis, often referred to as chemoprophylaxis. Use of effective chemoprophylaxis requires that the infectious agent be susceptible to the antimicrobial drug used. As a primary prevention strategy, it may be used before or after exposure to prevent infection. Examples of chemoprophylaxis in the postexposure setting include erythromycin after exposure to pertussis; rifampin after N. meningitidis; amantadine, rimantadine, zanamir, or oseltamivir after influenza A virus; and zidovudine after HIV exposure. Use of antiretroviral drugs by HIV-infected pregnant women has been shown to substantially reduce the risk of perinatal HIV infection. 128 Prophylaxis against surgical wound infections with broad-spectrum coverage before surgery and prophylaxis of neonates against ophthalmia neonatorum are examples of chemoprophylaxis used in the hospital setting. In such situations, chemoprophylaxis is origin, socioeconomic status, and geographic location. For example, persons born outside the United States are at increased risk for infectious diseases such as tuberculosis and for being chronic carriers of infections such as hepatitis B. Screening programs targeted to these populations, with subsequent interventions such as isoniazid prophylaxis for persons with M. tuberculosis infection or immunization of susceptible household contacts of HBV carriers, can serve as important community-based strategies to prevent infectious disease occurrence. [115] [116] [117] Another example of defining risk at the community level is assessing behavior that increases the risk for specific diseases, such as injection drug use as a risk behavior for acquiring HIV or HCV infection. Education and drug treatment programs targeted to this population can serve as an important disease prevention and control strategy. Finally, assessing the population of species-specific mosquitoes and viability of local breeding sites can provide a risk assessment of the likelihood of vector-borne disease transmission (e.g., West Nile virus infection). 118, 119 In developing control programs, the feasibility of a strategy also needs to be assessed. Feasibility is dependent on the sociodemographic factors of the population involved. For example, high immunization rates can clearly prevent the occurrence of infectious diseases. In the United States, immunizations should be readily available; however, in the late 1980s, numerous large outbreaks of measles occurred in U.S. inner-city populations because of low immunization rates. 120 A variety of sociodemographic factors contributed to these low rates, such as inadequate access to medical care and other barriers to immunization. Until such barriers are removed and control strategies are developed to specifically target at-risk populations, adequate control of vaccinepreventable diseases in the United States cannot be accomplished. 121 Cost and availability of resources also need to be considered when developing control strategies. Adequate water treatment facilities and distribution systems in developing countries would do much to eliminate the spread of cholera. However, in many countries, resources to build and develop such facilities are not available. Consequently, control strategies need to be focused on simpler, less expensive methods, such as boiling water or improving water storage in the home.","Our knowledge about the epidemiologic characteristics of MERS-CoV that impact health care transmission is very limited. To interrupt in-hospital transmission, routes of efficient exposure and virus shedding should be well studied. The contribution of primary cases to the so-called hospital-acquired cases in the recent upsurge of detected cases in the Arabian Peninsula is still unclear, and further epidemiologic data and analyses are necessary. In 1 analysis, 60 of 95 (63.2%) cases with evidence of secondary transmission acquired the infection in the hospital environment; nevertheless, 49 of them had additionally reported exposure to animals, therefore not eliminating an alternative source of infection. 21 The stability of the proportion of asymptomatic versus symptomatic cases is an argument against increasing testing as a possible explanation for either primary or secondary cases. 10 On the other hand, a reverse scenario could be that additional cases are missed because cases at the early incubation period or with low viral loads may be missed with molecular testing. A transmission event under similar circumstances has been described in the community for the first imported MERS-CoV case in the United States that tested negative by molecular assays but subsequently tested positive by serology. 25, 40 Research for the future Active surveillance and testing are of outmost importance to provide answers about the epidemiology of MERS-CoV and evolution of the current epidemic. Case-control, serologic studies in exposed HCWs are needed to better define the effectiveness of infection control measures. Transmission of the virus via asymptomatic shedding in feces or other routes (eg, fomites, environment) is another topic for investigation. Studies of viral kinetics in affected patients with molecular analyses of samples from various body sites will provide answers for infection control as well.","These secondary cities may have a high risk of community-level transmission through the introduction of infected travellers from Wuhan, and then spread the virus to other tertiary cities by returning population movements after the LNY holiday, causing an even wider spread of the virus. As most of the cities in Hubei province have implemented the same travel controls as Wuhan before LNY, we defined the high-risk secondary cities outside of Hubei province as the cities within top 30 ranked cities (Supplementary Table S1 ) with the highest risk of importation from Wuhan defined above. Based on the 2015 Baidu dataset on population movement, the risk of spreading the virus from high-risk secondary cities to tertiary cities was preliminarily calculated as the averaged percentage of travellers received by each tertiary city out of the total volume of travellers leaving each high-risk secondary city during the four weeks following LNY's Day. We chose a period of four weeks because the returning flow of LNY's population movement, Chunyun, generally lasts four weeks.","Human-to-human transmission of MERS-CoV has been well documented in family clusters, community settings and more often in healthcare settings. 13e15,17,20,34 Common denominators in the largest hospital outbreaks have been overcrowding, especially in emergency departments, and poor adherence to infection control standards. 15,17,35,36 However, MERS-CoV continues to have relatively limited infectiousness. For example, screening identified secondary MERS-CoV infections in only 4% of 280 close family contacts and 2% of 5065 healthcare contacts. 37,38 Moreover, no secondary cases were identified following extensive epidemiological investigations of imported cases in the UK, Germany, France, Greece, The Netherlands, and the USA. 39e46 It has been phylogenetically demonstrated that MERS-CoV transmission chains have not extended beyond two to three months and that the virus has remained genetically stable over the past three years. 47, 48 Given an effective reproduction number (R 0 ) of less than one, human-to-human MERS-CoV could be readily interrupted with effective preventive interventions. 49, 50 Indeed, even the most explosive hospital outbreaks of MERS-CoV infection, such those that occurred in Jeddah and Riyadh in April to May 2014, were brought under control through a strategy based on early case detection and implementation of appropriate infection prevention and control measures; namely contact and droplet precautions for general care in addition to airborne precautions for aerosolgenerating procedures such as intubation and respiratory tract suctioning. 51e53 The poor prognosis associated with MERS-CoV, especially in patients with multiple comorbidities, and the lack of effective anti-viral therapy make appropriate infection prevention and control all-important. Just as is true for most infectious diseases, MERS-CoV reminds us again that prevention is better than cure.","Every year, around one in fi ve patients acquires an HAI in US hospitals. 30 These infections result in about $26-33 billion in excess medical costs and around 99 000 deaths yearly. 30, 31 However, these estimates do not include the substantial burden and consequences of HAIs in non-hospital settings such as long-term care facilities, dialysis settings, and outpatient clinics, where an increasing number of invasive practices are done. HAI reduction strategies largely focus on endemic problems such as catheter-associated urinary tract infections, central-line-associated bloodstream infections, and surgical-site infections, all of which can fuel antimicrobial resistance. Investigations of HAI-related outbreaks can provide important information for improvements in infection control. 32 For example, infections due to unsafe injection practices, 33 including reuse of syringes and inappropriate use of single-use vials, have led to targeted educational campaigns for both patients and health-care providers. 34 Outbreaks have also occurred from contaminated products including those prepared in compounding pharmacies. In 2012-13, a large HAI outbreak in the USA-involving more than 14 000 patients who were potentially exposed and resulting in 751 reported cases of fungal infections, including 384 cases of meningitis and 64 deaths across 20 states 35 -was caused by injections of contaminated steroids produced by a single compounding facility. 36 In the early to mid-2000s, several large-scale US regional and state-wide projects showed substantial decreases for central-line-associated bloodstream infections in intensive care units through focused eff orts to increase adherence to a set of recommended practices for insertion and maintenance of intravascular catheters. 37, 38 Momentum from these and other successes [39] [40] [41] led to new federal, state, and local eff orts to prevent HAIs. In 2009, a national action plan was released, setting goals and metrics for the prevention of HAIs. 42 Additional eff orts included state mandates for HAI reporting to improve accountability and fi nancial incentives off ered by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services for adherence to CDC's infection control guidelines. All 50 states now have HAI prevention plans and state HAI coordinators, resulting in stronger links between health-care facilities, state health departments, state hospital associations, and qualityimprovement organisations.","Efforts to reduce antimicrobial resistance have largely focused on surveillance and infection control in health care settings, along with educational campaigns targeted to health care providers and consumers on judicious antimicrobial use, such as the CDC's \"Get Smart: Know When Antibiotics Work\" campaign. 483 In recent years, impressive gains have been made by U.S. health care settings in reducing several types of HAIs, many of which are drug resistant. 484 As an example, invasive hospital-acquired MRSA infections declined 28% from 2005 through 2008 485 and MRSA bloodstream infections in hospitals decreased nearly 50% between 1997 and 2007. 486 These and other declines in hospital-acquired infections followed targeted, multifaceted efforts undertaken to increase adherence to recommended infection control practices, educate patients and providers, issue facility-specific guidelines for prescription and use of antimicrobial agents, and implement appropriate isolation and cohorting of patients infected or colonized with drug-resistant organisms. In addition, hospital-acquired infections are reported and tracked by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) and through reporting mandates in many states using the CDC's National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN). This secure, Internet-based surveillance system collects data from more than 12,000 facilities in all 50 states on hospital-acquired infections and related issues, including the incidence or prevalence of multidrug-resistant organisms, health care personnel safety and vaccination, and the occurrence of transfusion-related adverse events. Reviews of antibiotic stewardship programs in both large and small hospitals have documented their effectiveness, with facility-specific reductions in antibiotic use of 22% to 36% and related annual cost savings of $200,000 to $900,000. 487, 488 With 50% of antibiotic prescriptions estimated to be unnecessary, 489 education of patients and providers on the importance of and health benefits from responsible use of antibiotics remains paramount.","At the time, when John Snow made the final decision to shut down the broad street water pump in Soho district in 1854, the people of London suspected the results would be effective, although later it was declared as the most effective measure and became the beginning of modern epidemiology. Likewise, it might be too early to evaluate the effectiveness of Wuhan\u2019s lockdown now. Yet, there is no doubt that lockdown will greatly reduce 2019-nCoV cases due to the reduction in the secondary cases from the community. However, long-term limitations on movement of traffic and information poses a great challenge on the stability of a social system [8].","Patients with COVID-19 were interviewed using a standardised questionnaire to identify symptom history, locations visited while symptomatic, and individuals with whom they had contact while symptomatic. The Illinois COVID-19 Investigation Team, comprised of local and state public health staff and the CDC field team, worked with locations visited (eg, workplaces, retail establishments, or health-care facilities) by patients with COVID-19 to identify additional individuals who might have had exposures to SARS-CoV-2. To identify possible exposures in health-care personnel, patient logs and staffing records were obtained and reviewed for all health-care settings visited by patients with COVID-19. Security footage was reviewed to identify additional health-care personnel and patients who had contact with patients with COVID-19 during transport through the admitting hospital. Health-care personnel were defined as all people working in health-care settings who had the potential for exposure to infectious materials, 12 including members of the Illinois COVID-19 Investigation Team. All other contacts were classified as community members, including patients in the same indoor environment in a health-care setting (eg, a hospital waiting room).","The nature and severity of specific symptomatology observed in the context of COVID-19 also needs to be chronicled to facilitate future work. In addition, there is an urgent need for documentation of measures taken by institutions and individuals to manage the mental health impact of COVID-19 on older adults in the absence of clear best practices, as well as strategies for prevention. We believe that a range of measures may have been implemented across various care settings worldwide, including inpatient and outpatient care and large tertiary care centers, community-based hospitals, primary care settings, nursing homes as well as residential environments such as assisted living facilities. It will be important for the field to assess the range and efficacy of these measures -these may include implementing telepsychiatry for direct care and psychotherapy (9), using a range of technologies for social engagement and measures to facilitate physical activity and nutrition. It is equally important that we recognize how the impact on older adults will vary around the world and the factors impacting older adults in low-and middle-income countries may differ from developed countries (4).","Second, nosocomial transmission of MERS appeared more efficient than transmission in the community. This points to the need for focusing interventions on rapid case identification and effective isolation and for improving infection control protocols in hospitals to prevent transmission. The large outbreak observed in South Korea was indeed attributed to sub-optimal infection prevention and control measures in hospitals [45]. These findings are in line with previous analyses on MERS transmission in healthcare settings and with modelling studies evaluating the impact of mechanisms to control SARS spread in 2003 [15, 46\u201348].","Secondary cases have resulted from human-to-human transmission among close contacts. To date, secondary transmission has occasionally occurred between close contacts of individuals with laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV in household settings. 33, 34 However, secondary transmission in health-care facilities has repeatedly occurred in several countries and has, on occasion, resulted in large outbreaks (appendix p 5)-such as 39 Transmission via contact with contaminated hospital environments is possible during outbreaks, although genomic studies providing an evidence base are lacking. Since environmental contamination is a potential source of infection, it is prudent to take precautionary infection control measures.","Outbreaks of Ebola have recurred multiple times in central and East Africa over the past decade, in the Republic of the Congo in 2003, 427, 428 in the Sudan in 2004, 429 345, 431 Although viral hemorrhagic fever outbreaks have lasted from a few months to more than a year, the Ebola and Marburg outbreaks that occurred in Uganda in 2012 were contained within 3 weeks. Hemorrhagic fever outbreaks typically result from a single or small number of spillover events from the virus reservoir with subsequent chains of human-to-human transmission in community (sometimes associated with funerals) and hospital settings. 435 Transmission in health care settings can be prevented by adherence to basic infection control practices and proper disposal of potentially infectious items. 436 The four distinct filovirus outbreaks that occurred in Uganda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo in 2012 were quickly identified and brought under control. That these outbreaks were kept relatively small is attributable in part to the availability of in-country filovirus diagnostics at the viral hemorrhagic fever reference laboratory located at the Uganda Viral Research Institute (UVRI) in Entebbe. This laboratory is a component of a viral hemorrhagic fever surveillance program established in 2010 by the UVRI and the Uganda Ministry of Health, in collaboration with the CDC. 345, 431 Current challenges include improving regional disease surveillance, developing additional diagnostic tools to assist in early diagnosis, and conducting ecologic investigations of Ebola and Marburg viruses. A better understanding of the natural reservoirs of these viruses and how they are spread may help prevent future outbreaks.","The WHO also issued detailed guidelines on the use of face masks in the community, during care at home, and in the health care settings of COVID-19 [56]. In this document, health care workers are recommended to use particulate respirators such as those certified N95 or FFP2 when performing aerosol-generating procedures and to use medical masks while providing any care to suspected or confirmed cases. According to this guideline, individuals with respiratory symptoms are advised to use medical masks both in health care and home care settings properly following the infection prevention guidelines. According to this guideline, an individual without respiratory symptoms is not required to wear a medical mask when in public. Proper use and disposal of masks is important to avoid any increase in risk of transmission [56].","All the imported cases of 2019-CoV infection in Macau were residents from Wuhan who fell ill during their stay in Macau. Considering the possibility of human-to-human transmission and the continuous growth of outbreak, the high volume of travel from Wuhan was considered a major threat to the effectiveness of infection prevention and control. Reinforcement of health inspection and isolation efforts at various cross-boundary checkpoints, mandatory requirements for all travelers from Wuhan to declare their health status, and tighter bordercontrol took place immediately. While these measures aimed to step up the respiratory-disease-surveillance system, the potential risks of carrying and transmitting the virus by the Wuhan travelers who were still staying in Macau could not be dismissed. Early detection and referral of suspected cases were crucial to prevent large-scale community transmission. As mentioned above, the early symptoms could be mild and non-specific, 15, 16 and community pharmacy could well be the first point of contact when the affected people sought basic medical aid for symptomatic relief. Community pharmacists, therefore, must be on full alert and be able to screen patients for any necessary referral. The guide for the evaluation of patients under investigation for 2019-nCoV recommended provided by the US CDC was included in the FIP Guideline and community pharmacists should become familiar with the criteria recommended. 8","Interventions: Any form of infection control and prevention, such as hand hygiene, respiratory hygiene/etiquette, personal protective equipment (for patients and health care providers), triage (on arrival), source control, isolation, daily monitoring/surveillance for signs and symptoms of respiratory illness (e.g., in residence, environmental cleaning, cleaning of linen and medical equipment used by patients, restrictions on resident movement and transportation, restrictions on visitors, restrictions on travel for health care providers and other long-term care facility staff, waste management, dead body management. Only those measures used to prevent and control respiratory illnesses, including influenza and coronavirus (e.g., COVID-19, MERS, SARS) will be included. Interventions focused on preventing bacterial respiratory outbreaks (e.g., strep, pneumonia, klebsiella) will be excluded.","Interventions: Any form of infection control and prevention, such as hand hygiene, respiratory hygiene/etiquette, personal protective equipment (for patients and health care providers), triage (on arrival), source control, isolation, daily monitoring/surveillance for signs and symptoms of respiratory illness (e.g., in residence, environmental cleaning, cleaning of linen and medical equipment used by patients, restrictions on resident movement and transportation, restrictions on visitors, restrictions on travel for health care providers and other long-term care facility staff, waste management, dead body management. Only those measures used to prevent and control respiratory illnesses, including influenza and coronavirus (e.g., COVID-19, MERS, SARS) will be included. Interventions focused on preventing bacterial respiratory outbreaks (e.g., strep, pneumonia, klebsiella) will be excluded.","Prevention and control strategies and methods are reported at three levels: national level, case-related population level, and general population level. At the national level, the National Health Commission of the People\u2019s Republic of China issued the \u201cNo.1 announcement\u201d on 20 January 2020, which officially included the COVID-19 into the management of class B legal infectious diseases, and allowed for class A infectious disease preventive and control measures to be implemented [45]. Under this policy, medical institutes can adopt isolation treatment and observation protocols to prevent and control the spread of the COVID-19. On 22 January 2020, the National Health Commission published national guidelines for the prevention and control of COVID-19 for medical institutes to prevent nosocomial infection [46]. On 28 January 2020, the National Health Commission issued protocols for rapid prevention and control measures in order to effectively contain the spread of the epidemic through a \u201cbig isolation and big disinfection\u201d policy during the Chinese Spring Festival [47]. National-level strategies have also been issued with targeted measures for rural areas (issued on 28 January 2020) and the elderly population (issued on 31 January 2020) [48, 49]. Several public health measures that may prevent or slow down the transmission of the COVID-19 were introduced; these include case isolation, identification and follow-up of contacts, environmental disinfection, and use of personal protective equipment [50].","Strategies aimed at transmission need to be tailored to the type of transmission involved. For example, the use of condoms in prevention of sexually transmitted diseases is a control strategy targeted at preventing contact transmission. Transmission through common vehicles frequently involves food and water and may involve other vehicles, such as blood in the case of transfusions. Irradiation of food and screening of blood for infectious agents are control activities targeted to a common vehicle. An example of a control activity targeted to airborne transmission is the use of respirators to prevent transmission of tuberculosis in the health care setting. Control of vector-borne transmission can be targeted toward destroying the vector or its breeding sites or toward the use of protective clothing and repellents.","Where, \uf07a is the human intervention factor of public health policy, \uf068 is the minimum intensity of intervention, 0 t is the time point of human intervention, m t is the point at which and public health policy intervention. Any public health policy intervention requires costs, and the cost of different interventions varies. In this paper, the various measures to prevent and control the spread of COVID -19 in China are divided into two categories: One is traffic control, which not only affects the movement of people across regions and even across the country, but also affects the transportation of goods. The price of this is to force companies and other institutions to stop operations, which is at huge cost. Another is social distancing, including closure of public places in the city, community containment, isolation of the infected, and quarantine of the suspected, which affects the operation of some urban institutions, and the cost is less than the traffic control. Based on the mechanism analyzed above and the classification of prevention and control measures against COVID-19, we then propose the hypothesis: traffic control and social distancing can quickly contain the spreads of COVID-19 epidemic, but they perform different effect in various regions.","Effectiveness of insertion and maintenance bundles to prevent central-line-associated bloodstream infections in critically ill patients: experiences and challenges in a medical intensive care unit Ya-Wen Chang 1 *, Miao-Fang Tai Background: To determine the effectiveness of a care bundle, with a novel line maintenance procedure, in reducing the rate of central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI) in the intensive care unit (ICU). We aimed to quantify the effectiveness of centralline bundles (insertion or maintenance or both) to prevent these infections.","Intervention: Any form of infection control and prevention, such as hand hygiene, respiratory hygiene/etiquette, personal protective equipment (for patients and health care providers), triage (on arrival), source control, isolation, daily monitoring/surveillance for signs and symptoms of respiratory illness (e.g., in residence, environmental cleaning, cleaning of linen and medical equipment used by patients, restrictions on resident movement and transportation, restrictions on visitors, restrictions on travel for health care providers and other long-term care facility staff, waste management, dead body management. Only those measures used to prevent and control respiratory illnesses, including influenza and coronavirus (e.g., COVID-19, MERS, SARS) were included. Interventions focused on preventing bacterial respiratory outbreaks (e.g., strep, pneumonia, klebsiella) or aspiration pneumonia were excluded. Interventions specifically focused on vaccination were excluded, as a vaccine for the coronavirus currently does not exist."],"title":["The Effectiveness of Social Distancing in Mitigating COVID-19 Spread: a modelling analysis","The Effectiveness of Social Distancing in Mitigating COVID-19 Spread: a modelling analysis","13 Epidemiologic Principles","Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus: transmission and phylogenetic evolution","13 Epidemiologic Principles","Can we contain the COVID-19 outbreak with the same measures as for SARS?","New and emerging infectious diseases (Ebola, Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome coronavirus, carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae, Candida auris): Focus on environmental survival and germicide susceptibility","Protecting health care workers from SARS and other respiratory pathogens: Organizational and individual factors that affect adherence to infection control guidelines","COVID-19: towards controlling of a pandemic","Progress towards Health for All: Time to End Discrimination and Marginalization","The State of the Science of health care epidemiology, infection control, and patient safety, 2004","Responding to the COVID-19 pandemic in complex humanitarian crises","Infection control practices for SARS in Lao People's Democratic Republic, Taiwan, and Thailand: Experience from mobile SARS containment teams, 2003","Effect of non-pharmaceutical interventions for containing the COVID-19 outbreak in China","COVID-19: Facemask use prevalence in international airports in Asia, Europe and the Americas, March 2020","A Review of Pediatric Critical Care in Resource-Limited Settings: A Look at Past, Present, and Future Directions","A Review of Pediatric Critical Care in Resource-Limited Settings: A Look at Past, Present, and Future Directions","Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus: Implications for health care facilities","Oral presentations","13 Epidemiologic Principles","The Preventive Strategies of Community Hospital in the Battle of Fighting Pandemic COVID-19 in Taiwan","Middle East respiratory syndrome","Estimated effectiveness of symptom and risk screening to prevent the spread of COVID-19","S8 \u2013 S47 and O50 \u2013 O440","Understanding Epidemic Data and Statistics: A case study of COVID-19","Real-time monitoring the transmission potential of COVID-19 in Singapore, February 2020","Assessing the Impact of Reduced Travel on Exportation Dynamics of Novel Coronavirus Infection (COVID-19)","Assessing the impact of reduced travel on exportation dynamics of novel coronavirus infection (COVID-19)","Which Measures are Effective in Containing COVID-19?
