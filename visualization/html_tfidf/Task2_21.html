By using a previously-estimated synthetic contact matrix and age-stratified data, we were able to estimate age-dependent susceptibility profiles based on the first 425 and the first 4,021 cases in China. We then combined these estimated profiles with estimates of age-stratified contacts in 151 other countries to give us transmission matrices for these countries from which we could estimate the scale of basic reproductive ratios in each country relative to China. We demonstrated that taking age-specific susceptibility into account results in substantially different predictions of transmission intensity by country relative to a model without age-specific susceptibility; countries with older populations are at substantially higher risk than countries with younger populations.","Meta-analysis on pooled data from all the four Chinese populations provided unequivocal evidence for a relationship between CCL2 G-2518A and susceptibility to SARS-CoV infection (Fig. 1 ). OR associated with GG genotype was 1.58 (95% CI, 1.28 to 1.96, P Z 2.3 \u00c2 10 \u00c05 , P heterogeneity Z .43, I 2 Z 0%; Fig. 1a ). Given there was no significant heterogeneity for the four Chinese populations, we further analyzed the pooled data by logistic regression, and a strong support for an association between the G-2518A and susceptibility to SARS-CoV infection was observed (P Z 1.6 \u00c2 10 \u00c04 ), with the OR being 1.48 (95% CI, 1.21e1.82) for the at-risk GG genotype, compared with the AG plus AA genotype. On the basis of the ORs combined with the frequencies of GG genotype, PAFs were estimated to account for 12.8e53.1% of SARS cases in the 4 individual populations, and 14.6% in the overall population (Table 1) .","In Figure 3 (a) we plot the scaling factors obtained through our consideration of age-dependent susceptibility (figure 2) against the factors obtained by assuming homogeneous susceptibility across age groups (figure 1). Allowing for age-dependent susceptibility substantially increases the amount of variation in scaling (and thus in basic reproductive ratio) by country, and in particular can lead us to predict much larger scaling factors. When the transmission structure is modelled as a simple scaling of a population's contact patterns, the variation in scaling is driven by the variation in average intensity of contacts (captured by the eigenvalue of the contact pattern matrix K) by country. When we incorporate age-dependent susceptibility, contact patterns involving members of highly susceptible age classes becomes particularly important -generating a 3 .

Phenotypic NAI assays are wellcharacterized but require a cultivated isolate, which make them inadequate as a point-of-care diagnostic, and they are generally less sensitive for detecting resistant variants in mixed populations (Wetherall et al., 2003) ; however, newer technologies have attempted to reduce turn-around time and increase the sensitivity of the standard NAI assay (Gubareva et al., 2017) . Lack of standardization and a clear relationship between the level of reduced susceptibility and clinical outcomes make phenotypic assays difficult to interpret, but this also is a continuing area of study. Genotypic assays are generally rapid and sensitive, but require prior knowledge of the effect of certain mutations on virus susceptibility. Genotypic assays can vary in scope, from realtime PCR SNP detection to Sanger or 'next-generation' sequencing of whole genes or genomes. The advent of influenza antivirals with distinct mechanisms of action will require new assays and approaches. Phenotypic assays for baloxavir are currently neither rapid nor highthroughput, although advances are currently being made, and the genetic determinants of reduced susceptibility to baloxavir are still being defined. As with all classes of drugs, surveillance will involve the use of genotypic and phenotypic assays to account for the emergence and spread of resistance.","(3) Susceptibility surveillance: According to the dynamics of infectious diseases, outbreaks of specific diseases are closely related to susceptibility in the human population. Therefore, periodic surveillance of antibody levels in high risk populations can reflect level of susceptibility. Generally, low immunization may suggest the increased of risk of outbreaks.","The cause of MS is unknown. Theories revolve around the idea that the disease is either autoimmune or virus-mediated. It is still reasonable to question which pathologic feature is the inciting event. Much research is focused on the T cell and potential mechanisms by which these cells could initiate MS. HLA associations are found in many populations; however, HLA markers are neither necessary nor sufficient to confer disease susceptibility, and other factors that confer disease susceptibility are being sought.","In the past two decades, pathogenic coronaviruses (CoVs) have caused epidemic infections, including the server acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV outbreak in 2003, the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) outbreak in 2012 and the current Wuhan 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCov) outbreak. They typically affect the respiratory tract and cause severe respiratory illnesses. We have learned from SARS-Cov and MERS-Cov that human populations showed disparities in susceptibility to these viruses. For example, epidemiology studies found that males had higher incidence and mortality rates than females. 1, 2 We believe that the susceptibility to the novel 2019-nCov is also different among population groups. In current severe global emergency situation of 2019-nCov outbreak, it is imperative to identify vulnerable and susceptible groups for effective protection and care.","Salmonella grouping, analysis of 284 strains of Salmonella, type B has 85 strains (30%), type C has 66 strains (23%), type D has 83 strains (29%), E type has 47 strains (17%), unidentified (non-PolyA-I &amp; Vi) type has 3 strains (1%). 284 strains of Salmonella is isolated from bile, blood, pus, feces and urine, which account for 88% of feces, 8% blood, and 2% urine. We analyzed a routine antibiotic susceptibility testing of ampicillin/sulbactam, ceftriaxone, ertapenem,imipenem, levofloxacin and trimethoprim/sulfame. Ampicillin/sulbactam had 55% susceptibility, ceftriaxone had 69% susceptibility, ertapenem had 100% susceptibility, Imipenem had 100% susceptibility, levofloxacin had 70% susceptibility, and trimethoprim/sulfame had 69% susceptibility. Conclusion: O antigen group of Salmonella, found to have various types, not more often type have been separated, they mainly isolated from the feces, and in the antibiotic susceptibility test part of the carbapenem class (Imipenem, Imipenem) has 100% susceptibile, fluoquinolone drugs (levofloxacin) has 70% susceptibile, other drug also has more than 50% susceptibile testing. Salmonella is one of the most common causes of food poisoning. Symptoms of salmonellosis are mild and patients recover without specific treatment in most cases. However, in children and elderly patients, the associated dehydration become severe and lifethreatening. Antimicrobial resistance of salmonella have emerged,the right antibiotic choice is very important.","This study has several potential limitations. First, the small sample size of subjects homozygous for the minor allele B of MBL codon 54 variant (A/B) did not allow calculation of separate ORs for the BB genotype (the genotype with the greatest risk). Second, the small sample sizes likely meant that there was low power to detect genetic interaction between polymorphisms. Third, the small sample sizes of the two new caseecontrol populations (Beijing HCW and Tianjin) meant that the effect estimates for these groups were larger in magnitude and had wider CIs (that is, they were less stable as shown in Table 1 and Fig. 1 ) than the effect estimates generated from the other two larger caseecontrol populations. Last, there was no adjustment for co-morbid conditions (such as chronic diseases) that could affect susceptibility to SARS.","When an antibiotic susceptibility test is performed, minor changes in resistance level must be identified because they might point to the existence of a first step mutation. Then, the use of FQ should be avoided in order to prevent the selection of strains that developed a second step mutation, which implies cross-resistance. For the same reason, it is prudent to avoid long duration FQ treatments in patients with CB, as well as to avoid the use of FQ in patients with CB who have been treated recently with FQ. The H. influenzae and S. pneumoniae bacterial populations present in bronchial secretions of a CB patient are often heterogeneous. Clones with different antibiotic susceptibility can easily coexist [82] . The FQ resistant clone, perhaps arising from a prior FQ treatment, could remain hidden by the vast sensitive population, but it can be rapidly selected and will prevail after a few days when a new FQ antibiotic treatment course has started.","To date, few isolated cases of complete glycopeptide resistance in S. aureus (VRSA) have been reported. However, low-level resistance, or \"vancomycin-intermediate S. aureus\" (VISA), has been documented worldwide. These isolates display a thickened cell wall affecting the activity of glycopeptides. Recent data have also demonstrated the isolation of MRSA isolates with heterogenous subpopulations with decreased susceptibility to glycopeptides (\"heterogeneous VISA\"), and the possibility that a slight rise in modal vancomycin MIC values within the susceptible category (MIC range 1.5 to 2 mg/mL) may affect clinical success of glycopeptide treatment. This possibility has been observed in different infections, including bacteraemia. The true incidence of MRSA populations with decreased susceptibility to glycopeptides is unclear and might depend on population structure distribution. Maintaining vigilant surveillance of these resistance trends is critical to ensure appropriate coverage. Treatment options for invasive MRSA infections currently include vancomycin, linezolid, daptomycin, tigecycline, and quinupristin/dalfopristin. Additionally, a number of compounds to combat the growing resistance problems are in development, including novel glycopeptides (dalbavancin, telavancin, and oritavancin), and next-generation cephalosporins (ceftobiprole and ceftaroline) which demonstrate excellent in vitro activity against MRSA, VISA and VRSA. The addition of these new agents to the armamentarium will be critical in managing patients with infections due to MRSA encountered both in the hospital and community settings.","Objectives: This analysis of data from 39 countries over the first 4 years (1999) (2000) (2001) (2002) (2003) of the PROTEKT global surveillance study was undertaken to investigate longitudinal and regional trends in the distribution of macrolide resistance mechanisms among Streptococcus pneumoniae, and the susceptibility of these isolates to antibacterials, including the ketolide telithromycin. Objectives: The 7-valent formulation of the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7) was introduced in the USA in February 2000. There is a general recommendation for its use in all children &lt;2 years of age, and the vaccine is licensed for children up to 5 years of age. In Europe, the vaccine is licensed for children up to 5 years of age, but most countries do not have a general recommendation for use. PROTEKT -a global, longitudinal study of the antimicrobial susceptibility of bacterial respiratory tract pathogens -has now completed its fourth year. A comparison was made between serotype distribution and PCV7 coverage between Y1 and Y4. Methods: Analysis was performed only on Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates obtained from paediatric patients at the 31 centres common to both years (Y1, n = 553; Y4, n = 682). Serotyping was performed by Neufeld's Quellung reaction using Statens Serum Institute antisera (SSI, Denmark). Results: PCV7 coverage decreased from 67.7% and 62.5% in Y1 to 51.0% and 41.0% in Y4 in the USA and Latin America, respectively (Chi-squared; p = &lt;0.001 and 0.007, respectively). Serotypes that showed the greatest increase (Y1, Y4) in the USA were 19A (7.0%, 22.2%), 6A (1.8%, 9.9%), 3 (1.8%, 6.2%), 15 (1.8%, 6.2%), and 11 (0%, 6.2%). In Brazil, a similar pattern was seen although there was no change in the proportion of isolates with the 19A serotype. In contrast, no change in serotype distribution was observed in Canada, Western Europe, and the Far East, where the PCV7 vaccine is not routinely used for paediatric vaccination. Conclusions: Results from this analysis of PROTEKT data indicate that the proportion of S. pneumoniae isolates from paediatric patients covered by the PCV7 vaccine has decreased significantly over 4 years in regions where the vaccine is routinely used. Other serotypes, such as 19A, which is known to be highly resistant to antimicrobials and is not covered by PCV7, have increased in these regions. This study demonstrates the importance of serotyping antimicrobial surveillance study isolates in order to monitor such changes and any potential future implications for therapy and vaccine formulations. Background: Sequential alterations in PBP sequences constitute the classical mechanism to acquire penicillin resistance in S. pneumoniae, that is reflected in changes in the cell wall peptidoglycan structure. murM gene controls the addition of the first amino acid of the dipeptide bridge of the pneumococcal muropeptide. Mutations in this gene are apparently required for high penicillin and cefotaxime resistance. The aim of this study was to compare the murM gene sequence within the earlier and the latest highly penicillin resistant pneumococcal populations recovered in Spain. Material and methods: A total of 56 S. pneumoniae isolates (10 of them from 1987-88 and 46 from 2002-04) with resistance to penicillin (MIC 2-8 lg/ml) were included. Susceptibility to different b-lactams, macrolides, tetracycline, levofloxacin, chloramphenicol, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (SxT) were determined by the agar dilution method. All isolates were grouped according to serotype and pulsotype (PFGE-SmaI pattern) and the murM gene was sequenced.","Global temperatures are rising, and will increase by 1.8-5.8 8C by the end of the 21st century. 69 The annual average temperature in China has increased significantly, reaching 0.5 to 0.8 8C, and will increase by 1.3-2.1 8C in 2020, and by 2.3-3.3 8C in 2050. 70 The increased temperature can enhance pathogen development, disease transmission, and host susceptibility. 71 Animal and vector-borne diseases are strongly affected by climate change. Increased temperatures will accelerate the development of mosquitoes. Since mosquitoes lay their eggs in water-filled containers, rainfall often affects larval habitats and vector populations. In some cases, rainfall may change larval habitats and vector populations. Excessive rain can remove habitats through flooding, while limited rainfall may create new habitats, when water in the rivers is drawn into pools to create novel breeding sites for a number of mosquito species during the dry season. 69 A typical example is Schistosomiasis japonicum, whose intermediate host Oncomelania hupensis is usually limited to areas with a mean January temperature of above 0 8C. Due to the increasing temperature, schistosomiasis japonica will be transmitted to nonendemic areas in the north, and the additional risk area is expected to be increased by 783 883 km 2 by 2050, equivalent to 8.1% of the surface area of China. 72 Waterborne infectious diseases are also strongly affected by climate change. During times of drought, water scarcity results in poor sanitation, therefore, many people can be exposed to potentially contaminated water. In contrast, excess rainfall and flooding can also cause epidemics of waterborne infectious diseases, including bacterial and protozoan diarrheal illnesses. 73,74","since the 1970s. It is also recognised that there is a shift to Gram-negative pathogens with increasing age. This study describes the trends in BSI pathogens and antimicrobial susceptibility over 9 years at an Australian adult tertiary referral hospital. Methods: Positive blood cultures from 1st January 2001 till 31st December 2009 were reviewed. Duplicate isolates (within 14 days of the primary culture) and patients &lt;20 years of age were excluded. Patients in haematology (including bone marrow transplantation), respiratory (including lung transplant and cystic fibrosis), oncology and burns units were also excluded as they represented heterogeneous populations. Coagulase negative Staphylococci (CNS) were excluded as it was not possible to retrospectively differentiate between true infections and contamination. Results: We found an overall decline in blood culture positivity rate from 9.48 to 4.80 per 1000 admissions. Similarly, the proportion of positive cultures also decreased from 2.6% to 1.5%. Overall, Grampositive pathogens were isolated in 48.9% of patients (S. aureus 24.0%, Enterococcus spp. 7.1%, S. viridans 3.6%) compared to Gram-negative pathogens in 45.5% of patients (E. coli 20.3%, Klebsiella spp. 6.9%, Pseudomonas spp. 3.8%). There was a trend to an increasing proportion of Gram-negative pathogens during these 9 years. However, age specific proportions of Gram-positives and Gram-negatives remained similar, suggesting this relates to overall aging of the hospital population. The proportion of S. aureus isolates that were methicillin-resistant (MRSA) declined from 54.0% to 27.5%. In Gram-negatives, susceptibility to gentamicin and third generation cephalosporins by Enterobacteriaceae remained stable. Ceftazidime resistance also remained stable, suggesting no increase in extended spectrum b-lactamase (ESBL) producing organisms. Conclusions: Our study demonstrated important trends in epidemiology of BSI pathogens over time and their impact on choices of appropriate antimicrobial therapy, particularly for the elderly hospital inpatient population. b-lactams, gentamicin and quinolones all remain effective antibiotics for our patient population.","Functional polymorphisms of the CCL2 and MBL genes cumulatively increase susceptibility to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus infection Introduction Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a newly emerged infectious disease of humans caused by a novel coronavirus (CoV), the SARS-CoV. 1 Pathogenesis of SARS is complex and host genetic background is considered to be one of the factors in determining susceptibility to, and outcome of SARS. 2 Previous reports have shown that polymorphisms of several putatively important genes affect an individual's susceptibility to SARS-CoV infection or disease severity of SARS. 3\u00c010 In particular, our previous two independent association studies have implicated that a functional polymorphism at codon 54 in exon 1 (rs1800450, G230A, denoted as A/B variant) of mannose binding lectin (MBL), which encodes a protein belonging to the family of collectin and plays a critical role in the innate immune response, conferred a significantly increased susceptibility to SARS-CoV infection. 3, 9 However, on the basis of the fact that the susceptibility to infectious disease is determined at different functional levels of innate and adaptive immunity, 11 we hypothesize that an unknown number of other unidentified genes are likely to mediate the susceptibility to SARS, including SARS-CoV infection and disease severity.","Methods: A total of 28 LTCF were randomly selected from the public sanitation list of Attica province. Urine, nasopharyngeal and wound samples were collected from 668 elderly residents. We chose randomly 35% of the existing population from each LTCF (minimum sum 25 residents, age above 65 years). Gram negative bacteria were identified by API strips and underwent antimicrobial disk susceptibility testing, following the NCCLS guidelines. Data were also collected on resident factors and institutional variables. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed. Odds ratios (OR) and P values were calculated. Results: 412 Gram negative (GN) strains were isolated from 1448 samples (prevalence rate 28.5%). The majority of them were recovered from urine samples (86.8%). 53% of the residents had been taking systemic antibiotics during the preceding month. Q were the leading class (38%). \u00c1 R of GN to ciprofloxacin (CIP) were estimated (Table) . Multi-drug QRGN accounted for 11.5% of the isolated strains. The most prevalent phenotype was resistance to ampicilline, CIP and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. In the multivariate analysis, only prior exposure to antimicrobial agents (P &lt; 0.001; OR = 2), specifically to Q (P &lt; 0.001; OR = 14), and the presence of a urinary catheter (P &lt; 0.001; OR = 2) were significantly associated with colonization with QRGN. Objectives: Colonization and resistance dynamics of gramnegative bacteria in the intestinal and oropharyngeal microflora of patients admitted to intensive care units (ICU) and general wards (GW) were investigated during and after hospitalization. Methods: Specimens were obtained on admission, once weekly during hospitalization, at discharge from the ICU, at discharge from the hospital and one and three months after discharge from the hospital. Five colonies per specimen were selected for identification and susceptibility testing by the VITEK 2 system. Results: A total of 3316 specimens from 411 patients were collected. In both patient populations, the gram-negative colonization rates in oropharyngeal specimens increased during hospitalization and did not decrease in the three months after discharge. In rectal specimens, colonization rates decreased during hospitalization and increased after discharge. There was a change in species distribution among the dominant microflora during hospitalization. Klebsiella spp., Enterobacter spp., Serratia marcescens and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were more often isolated, whereas the frequency of E. coli declined. The percentage of ICU patients colonized with ampicillin and/or cephalothin resistant faecal E. coli was significantly increased at discharge from the hospital and did not change in the three months after discharge. Emergence of multi-drug resistance was observed in many gram-negative species during stay on the ICU. Resistance frequencies in E. coli significantly increased with length of stay on the ICU. For the GW population, no significant changes in resistance frequencies were found during hospitalization.","This high-throughput focus-forming assay was compared against the plaque assay for its ability to detect reduced susceptibility to baloxavir acid (the active form of baloxavir marboxil) among reference strains. The reference strains included viruses with and without the I38T substitution, which conferred a 40-to 50-fold reduction in susceptibility to baloxavir in both assays, consistent with the fold change observed for this substitution in other studies (Jones et al., 2018; Omoto et al., 2018) . A panel of NAI-resistant viruses and their sensitive counterparts were also evaluated for their susceptibility in both assays, which showed similar results and validated the focus-forming assay as an adequate surveillance tool. Viruses isolated from the community during the 2017-2018 influenza season in Japan (114 A(H1N1), 76 A(H3N2), 34 B/Victoria-lineage, and 65 B/Yamagata-lineage) were then evaluated for their susceptibility in the focus-forming assay. In the focusforming assay, median baloxavir EC 50 values for influenza type A and type B community isolates were 0.2-0.3 nM and 2.4-3.4, respectively, and ranged up to approximately 3-fold the median. There were no clear outliers indicative of significantly reduced susceptibility, and all viruses expressed wild-type PA I38; however, the limited variation in EC 50 values observed could be driven by other viral genetic determinants. Baloxavir exhibited wild-type EC 50 values against reference strains with known NAI resistance substitutions, consistent with the distinct mechanism of action of baloxavir. Nationwide surveillance for viruses with reduced susceptibility to baloxavir in Japan will be implemented using this high-throughput focus forming assay.","Beyond infectious diseases, microbial agents have been identified as the cause or contributing factor in a number of chronic diseases (Table 14-3 ). In 2008, approximately 2 million new cancer cases were linked to infections. 7 Among the leading causes of cancer-related deaths, three are caused by infectious agents: hepatocellular carcinoma by hepatitis B and C viruses, cervical cancer by human papillomavirus, and gastric cancer by Helicobacter pylori bacteria. Many other potential infectious/chronic disease linkages are also being explored, including Chlamydia pneumoniae and multiple sclerosis, 8, 9 Alzheimer's disease, 9 and atherosclerosis 10 ; enteroviruses and type 1 diabetes 11, 12 ; and rhinoviruses and childhood asthma. 13 In addition, several genetic factors have been shown to influence infectious disease susceptibility and disease progression (Table and hundreds of others are under investigation. 14 The past few decades have provided numerous examples of the ongoing threat of infectious diseases and the ability of microbes to evolve, adapt, and survive. In particular, acute respiratory viruses are often among the most recognized emerging and reemerging infectious diseases because of the high disease burden they produce. Examples in the past decade include a novel coronavirus that resulted in the 2003 global outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), 15 17 ; and avian influenza A H7N9 in China in 2013. 18 Emerging and reemerging vector-borne infections also remain priorities, as mosquito-borne viruses such as dengue and chikungunya continue to appear in new areas and tick-borne diseases continue their steady rise. In addition, increased attention is being given to environmental fungi as a cause of human and animal infections. Recent examples include the emergence of Cryptococcus gattii infections in the U.S. Pacific Northwest, 19, 20 increasing numbers of Coccidioides infections, which are a major cause of community-acquired pneumonia in California and the southwest United States, 21 and novel fungal infections as a cause of health care-associated infections (HAIs). 22 International trade and travel along with globally mobile populations present particular challenges for controlling infectious diseases, highlighting concerns for spread of known infections such as tuberculosis 23 and vaccine-preventable diseases 24 along with introduction of new threats. 25 In 2011, international tourist arrivals approached 1 billion worldwide, and they are expected to nearly double over the coming decades ( Fig. 14-2 ). 26 Moreover, today's globalized food supply has resulted in an increasing number of foodborne illnesses, many of which have severe consequences-especially for more vulnerable populations such as children, immunocompromised individuals, and the elderly. Also on a global level is the growing problem of resistance to antimicrobial agents, which continues to impede treatment and control efforts for an increasing number of pathogens.","Objectives: MRSA is becoming the most commonly isolated Gram-positive pathogen and can cause both community acquired (CA) and hospital acquired (HA) infections, each with different antimicrobial susceptibility patterns. The aim of this study was to compare antimicrobial susceptibility patterns with Staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec (SCCmec) types. Methods: Both invasive and non-invasive MRSA isolates recovered at Vanderbilt University Medical Center (VUMC) were collected from October 1, 2004 to September 30, 2005 . A real-time PCR assay (TaqMan) was developed to detect and differentiate four SCCmec types, which are associated with HA-MRSA (SCCmec-I, II, and III) and CA-MRSA (SCCmec-IV). Antibiotic susceptibility for amoxicillin-clavulanate, cefazolin, clindamycin, erythromycin, gentamicin, levofloxacin, minocycline, penicillin, rifampin, trimethoprim/ sulfamethoxazole (SXT) and vancomycin was determined by a disc diffusion method and inducible clindamycin resistance was determined by a D zone test. Results: Among the total 1,315 MRSA isolates collected, 448 (34.1%) were SCCmec-II, 847 (64.4%) were SCCmec-IV, 2 (0.2%) were mixed SCCmec-II/IV, and 18 (1.4%) were untypeable. More SCCmec-II was detected in invasive isolates than SCCmec-IV (72.5% vs. 19.3%, p = 0.00) and vice versa in non-invasive ones (24.7% vs. 79.6%, p = 0.00). CA-MRSA strains, which carry SCCmec-IV, showed greater susceptibility than SCCmec-IIcarried HA-MRSA strains to clindamycin (89.6% vs. 4.2%, p = 0.00), erythromycin (9.3% vs. 1.8%, p = 0.00), levofloxacin (89.6% vs. 5.1%, p = 0.00), gentamicin (99.4% vs. 93.5%, p &lt; 0.01), rifampin (99.9% vs. 96.2%, p &lt; 0.01), minocycline (100.0% vs. 99.3%, p &gt; 0.05), and SXT (98.9% vs. 98.0%, p &gt; 0.05). Within clindamycin-resistant isolates, 152 (35.4%) of the HA-MRSA strains were erythromycin induced in comparison to 36 (40.9%) of the CA-MRSA strains (p &gt; 0.05). Non-invasive strains showed significant greater susceptibility than the invasive ones to clindamycin (73.9% vs. 23.1%, p = 0.00) and levofloxacin (75.0% vs. 23.9%, p = 0.00). All isolates were resistant to methicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanate, cefazolin and penicillin. No isolates was resistant to vancomycin. Conclusion: These data indicate that MRSA isolates predominantly recovered at VUMC carried either SCCmec-IV (CA-MRSA, 64.4%) or SCCmec-II (HA-MRSA, 34.1%). The SCCmec typing correlates with major antimicrobial susceptibility patterns. CA-MRSA strains possessed significantly greater susceptibility to several commonly used antibiotics.","We find robust statistical evidence that higher temperatures lower the number new cases of COVID-19 in a given population. In our main statistical specification, we find that a 1 \u2022 C increase in local temperature reduces new COVID-19 cases per 1 million people by 13%, with a 95% confidence interval of [-21%, -4%] ( Fig. 1B and col. 1 of Table S1 ). This result is robust to controlling for precipitation and specific humidity, neither of which exhibit statistically significant effects (although point estimates on humidity are negative, consistent with prior evidence for influenza 5 ) ( Fig. 1B and col. 2 of Table S1 ). Our findings are also robust to inclusion of a range of semi-parametric controls, including controlling for seasonal patterns of temperature that are common across countries within particular latitude bands of varying width ( Fig. 1B and cols. 4-7 of Table S1 ). In our benchmark model (col. 5 of Table  S1 ), we control for separate nonlinear trends for countries that fall within each 25 \u2022 latitude band across the globe. This model accounts for spatially-varying trends in seasonal factors that may correlate both with COVID-19 cases and with temperature. Decreasing the width of these latitudinal bands, and thus imposing more restrictive controls on spatial patterns of seasonality, yields a coefficient statistically indistinguishable from that in our benchmark model (col. 7 of Table S1 ). These estimates are proportional, implying that the level change in the COVID-19 case rate per unit change in temperature will be higher in populations where the epidemic has already taken a strong hold. In contrast, lower temperatures will lead to far fewer individuals infected in a population with a low overall case rate. However, we detect no evidence of nonlinearity in this proportional response ( Fig. 1B and col. 3 of Table S1 ); a 1 \u2022 C increase in local temperature increases the case rate by 13% on average whether a country is presently relatively cold (e.g. South Korea), or relatively warm (e.g. Australia). These estimates relate new COVID-19 cases to plausibly random daily variation in local temperatures. Thus, they reflect multiple possible channels through which changes in temperature can influence new cases. First, temperature is likely to have a biological effect on the virus 2019-nCoV itself, as has been documented in lab experiments for influenza. 3 Second, temperature may change people's behavior, and thus change the number of new cases caused by a single infected individual. For example, warming temperatures encourage outdoor activities, 17 possibly changing the intensity of social interaction. Finally, temperature has a direct effect on other causes of morbidity and mortality, with particularly large impacts on elderly populations. [18] [19] [20] [21] Thus, temperature may increase susceptibility to COVID-19 by lowering overall health.","Interestingly, a significant cumulative effect on the susceptibility to SARS-CoV infection was observed for the combination of two functional SNPs in CCL2 and MBL across the four independent caseecontrol series (P trend Z 1.3 \u00c2 10 \u00c010 in the pooled samples). We estimated that individuals who have both of the at-risk genotypes have an odds ratio of 2.88 for SARS-CoV infection (Table 2) . Therefore, PAFs can be calculated to be 14.6% for CCL2, 21.9% for MBL, and 28.5% for both in the pooled samples, indicating that, for example, 28.5% of the increase in the risk of SARS-CoV infection can be attributed to carrying 1 or 2 at-risk genotypes of the two polymorphisms. If the associations are real, then at-risk genotypes of the two polymorphisms are associated with a low to moderate fraction of SARS-CoV infection among Chinese, suggesting that there exist unrevealed genes conferring susceptibility to such an infection. In fact, previous reports have shown that polymorphisms of several genes affect an individual's susceptibility to SARS-CoV infection or disease severity of SARS, 3\u00c010 although most of these susceptibility genes need to be confirmed in independent sample sets. In addition, it is notable that at this stage, CCL2 G-2518A and MBL codon 54 variant (A/B) are unlikely to be appropriate for risk prediction testing individually or in combination, because of low AUCs (53.7% for CCL2, 55.5% for MBL, and 57.0% for both) in pooled population. However, as further susceptibility polymorphisms are identified and confirmed, and interaction effects among such polymorphisms together with other risk factors are taken into account, prediction of the susceptibility of SARS-CoV infection may become more accurate and clinically usable.","To estimate the equivalent of the matrix R for some new population with age-structured contact matrix k = (k i,j ), we assume that z i is constant across populations (i.e. in every population we see the same dependence of susceptibility on age). Then our desired matrix has (i, j)th entr\u1ef9","A. Atrasheuskaya*, I.A. Karpov, G.M. Ignatyev (Minsk, BY) Mumps virus-neutralizing antibodies are believed to be the most predictable surrogate marker of protective immunity. The remote history of vaccination also suggests that waning immunity could have contributed to the vaccinees' susceptibility. Mumps outbreaks in vaccinated populations are usually caused by the phylogenetically distinct from the vaccine strains mumps viruses (MuV).","O101 Efflux pump inhibitors may overcome antibiotic resistance in multi-resistant bacteria by increasing intracellular drug concentration I. Leitner, J. Nemeth, A. Abrahim, H. Lagler, T. Erker, M. Zeitlinger (Vienna, AT) Introduction: Multi drug resistance (MDR) of bacteria is an increasing problem in clinical practice of antimicrobial therapy. Inhibition of bacterial efflux mechanisms appears to be a promising target in order to restore antimicrobial susceptibility in MDR bacteria. Previous in-vitro studies have shown that inhibitors of bacterial efflux pumps may improve the antimicrobial effect of fluoroquinolons. However, for most substances concentrations necessary to restore antimicrobial susceptibility were too high for clinical use, which might be ascribed to insufficient increase of intracellular concentrations of antimicrobials. The present study set out to investigate the potency of various efflux pump inhibitors (EPI) to overcome MDR and to explore changes of intracellular concentrations of ciprofloxacin for the most potent substances. Methods: Two previously described EPIs, 1-(1-naphthylmethyl)piperazine (NMP) and phenyl-arginine-beta-naphthylamide (PAbN) and with two novel, specific p-glycoprotein (PGP) inhibitors, tariquidar and elacridar, were investigated in terms of effects on in vitro antibacterial activity. Antimicrobial susceptibility to ciprofloxacin in the absence and presence of EPIs were tested in the following strains: Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 29213 (SA), ciprofloxacin resistant S. aureus SA-1199B (rSA), Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853 (PS) and MDR Stenotrophomonas maltophilia ATCC BAA-85 (SM). Changes in intracellular concentrations of ciprofloxacin were determined by use of [14C]Ciprofloxacin. Results: Inhibition of PGP mediated drug efflux by tariquidar and elacridar reduced MICs of ciprofloxacin for rSA from 16 mg/l to 2 mg/l in a dose depended manner, whereas only minor effects were observed for SA and Gram-negative strains. Addition of MNP and PAbN at high concentrations increased susceptibility towards ciprofloxacin in all resistant strains tested. By addition of tariquidar and elacridar a dose dependent increase of intracellular [14C]Ciprofloxacin was detected. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that tariquidar and elacridar are potent inhibitors of PGP mediated bacterial efflux. Both substances may restore susceptibility for PGP over expressing pathogens by dose dependent increase of intracellular ciprofloxacin. MDR in Stenotrophomonas maltophilia could not be overcome by specific PGP inhibitors but susceptibility could be increased by addition of high doses of MNP and PAbN.","Background: Candida is the most common cause of invasive fungal infections in immunocompromised cancer patients. The knowledge of antibiotics susceptibility of different Candida species may help clinicians in treatment planning. Methods: We retrieved the data of the Candida species in patients with candidemia during the period from 2014 to 2016. The yeast identification methods included window test, CHROMagar Candida, Urease, Pellicle, API-20 C AUX, and VITEK 2 YST. We also performed yeast drug susceptibility test by ATB FUNGUS 3. The Interpretive guidelines for in vitro susceptibility testing of Candida species were applied according to the CLSI M27-S3. Results: There were 50 colonies of Candida species in candidemia. C. albicans [n = 21 (42%)] was the most commen species, followed by C. parapsilosis [n = 10 (20%)], C. glabrata [n = 7 (14%)], C. tropicalis [n = 6 (12%)], C. guiliermondii complex [n = 2 (4%)], C. krusei [n = 1 (2%)], C. inconspicua [n = 1 (2%)], C. haemilonii [n = 1 (2%)], C. lusitaniae [n = 1 (2%)]. We also performed anti-fungal drug susceptibility tests including Flucytosine, Amphotericin B, Voriconazole, Fluconazole, and Intraconazole for 82 Candida colonies isolated from aseptic specimens. C. albicans (n = 42) and C. tropicalis (n = 9) was susceptible to Intraconazole with sensitivity of 98% and 67%, respectively. Both species were susceptible to other antifungal agents. However, C. glabrata (n = 12) was indiscernibly susceptible to Fluconazole and Intraconazole but had susceptible rates to Amphotericin B, Flucytosine, Voriconazole with 100%, 92% and 83%, respectively. All of C. parapsilosis (n = 12) and C. lusitaniae (n = 1) were susceptible to all antifungal agents. C. krusei (n = 3) was a species with intrinsic resistance to Fluconazole. The susceptibility of C. krusei to Flucytosine was intermediate, and had the susceptible rates of 100% and 67% to Voriconazole and Amphotericin B, respectively. C. guiliermondii complex (n = 2) were susceptible to all anti-fungal agents except intermediately susceptible to Intraconazole. C. Inconspicua (n = 1) was intermediately susceptible to Fluconazole and Intraconazole and susceptible to other antifugal agents. Conclusion: C. albicans remains the most common species found in patients with Candidemia, which is similar to reports in other countries. Nevertheless, the incidence is decreasing to be less than 50%. C. tropicalis is not the second common species, but C. parapsilosis or C. glabrata. The knowledge of the distribution of anti-fungal drug susceptibility of different Candida species in the hospital may help clinicians in prescription planning.","The model cannot be immediately utilized to make predictions on the spread of COVID-19 but it provides us insights on the transmission of a disease between two populations with different characteristics in terms of factors affecting the spread of a disease, such as the basic reproduction number and susceptibility rate.

To this end, we genotyped the CCL2 G-2518A polymorphism in 4 independent caseecontrol populations of Chinese descent, totally including 932 patients with SARS and 982 control subjects. We also reassessed the MBL codon 54 variant (A/B) in susceptibility to SARS-CoV infection in the present study. Furthermore, we investigated whether a combination of these two functional polymorphisms of CCL2 and MBL would have a cumulative effect on risk of SARS-CoV infection.","Many viruses use the bloodstream to spread in the host from sites of primary replication to distant target tissues (see Fig. 134-6) . In some cases, viruses may enter the bloodstream directly, such as during a blood transfusion or via an arthropod bite. More commonly, viruses enter the bloodstream after replication at some primary site. Important Severe rash: Ulceration then spread to the CNS by hematogenous and neural routes. 187 After oral inoculation, VEE is incapable of primary replication and spread to the CNS, illustrating that tropism can be determined by the site of entry into the host. Influenza virus buds exclusively from the apical surface of respiratory epithelial cells, 188 which may limit its capacity to spread within the host and infect cells at distant sites. A wide variety of host factors can influence viral tropism. These include age, nutritional status, and immune responsiveness, as well as certain genetic polymorphisms that affect susceptibility to viral infection. Age-related susceptibility to infection is observed for many viruses, including reovirus, 189, 190 RSV, [191] [192] [193] 195 The increased susceptibility in young children to these viruses may in part be due to immaturity of the immune response but also may be related to intrinsic age-specific factors that enhance host susceptibility to infection. Nutritional status is a critical determinant of the tropism and virulence of many viruses. For example, persons with vitamin A deficiency have enhanced susceptibility to measles virus infection. 196, 197 Similarly, the outcome of most viral infections is strongly linked to the immune competence of the host.","This finding promoted us to investigate the role of geneegene interaction in the genotype-to-phenotype relationship of SARS-CoV infection. However, no consistent significant genetic interaction between these two SNPs on risk of SARS-CoV infection was observed across all caseecontrol populations and in the pooled samples. Furthermore, no functional studies reported for the interactive effect of MBL and CCL2 on the susceptibility to SARS-CoV infection. Several previous studies have implicated that MBL could increase the secretion of CCL2 from human monocytic U937 cell lines, peripheral blood mononuclear cells and umbilical vein endothelial cells mediated by a variety of bacterial microbes. 36, 37 Whether or not there exit biological interactions between MBL and CCL2 under the condition of SARS-CoV infection remains to be investigated in future studies.","We contrasted three possible hypotheses. In hypothesis 1, there were no age-related differences in susceptibility ( ) or symptomatic fraction ( ). In hypothesis 2, u i = u y i = y susceptibility varied by age ( ), but the proportion of exposed individuals who became (i) u i = u clinical cases did not vary by age ( ). In hypothesis 3, the clinical case probability varied y i = y by age ( ), but susceptibility did not ( ). Susceptibility and clinical fraction curves (i) y i = y u i = u were fitted using three control points for young, middle, and old age, interpolating between them with a half-cosine curve (see Methods for details).","Selective forces to particular HLA-DRB1 alleles (e.g., conferring resistance to bacterial pathogens) other than a balancing selection have been discussed in Pacific/Asian populations including Viet-namese [13, 19] . Resultant limited variation of their HLA repertoires may be disadvantageous to protection against emerging infections. On the other hand, it is also conceivable that such a common Asian allele or haplotype may evoke an unfavorable immune reaction to new pathogens in the disease progression. Strong association of HLA-DRB1*1202 in a dominant model might support the latter possibility. Although HLA alleles probably account for only a part of disease susceptibility, this hypothesis should be carefully tested in the recent critical circumstances of the prevailing human infection caused by avian influenza H5N1 in almost the same area of southeast Asia [20] .","To understand the interplay between social distancing interventions, changes in human mixing patterns, and outbreak dynamics, we also need to consider potential age differences in susceptibility to infection. This is currently a topic of debate, as little information on the age profile of asymptomatic cases is available (7, 8) . To this aim, we analyzed contact tracing information from detailed epidemiological field investigations conducted by the Hunan CDC (Supplement). We calculated the age-specific relative risk of infection for close contacts of confirmed COVID-19 index cases. Briefly, all close contacts of COVID-19 cases reported in Hunan province were placed under medical observation for 14 days and were tested using real-time RT-PCR. Those who developed symptoms and tested positive were considered as symptomatic confirmed cases, while contacts who tested positive without exhibiting symptoms were considered as asymptomatic infections. The total of symptomatic and asymptomatic infections was used to estimate the relative susceptibility to infection by age. The ratio of symptomatic cases to total infections was used to estimate the relative probability of developing symptoms (see Supplementary Material). We found age differences in susceptibility to SARS-CoV2 infection, where young individuals (aged 0-14 years) had a lower risk of infection than individual ages 65 years and over (OR=0.41 (95%CI: 0.18-0.93), p-value=0.026). There was a weak non-significant trend towards lower susceptibility in middle-aged adults, relative to seniors (OR=0.76, 95%CI: 0.46-1.24, Tab. 2). These findings are in contrast with a previous study in Shenzhen, where susceptibility to infection did not change with age (7). Moreover, we found that the relative probability of developing symptoms also increased with age, however the difference was not statistically significant (Tab. 2).","RSV fusion and polymerase inhibitors rapidly select viral populations with &gt; 1,000 to 40,000-fold reduction in susceptibility. This study evaluated the barriers to developing resistance to EDP-938. RSV-A Long and RSV-B Washington strains were serially passaged in the presence of increasing concentrations of EDP-938. RSV resistance could be forced with a stepwise increase in concentration of EDP-938 but the development of resistance was associated with decreased fitness. The most potent mutation, N protein M109K, caused a 67-fold decrease in sensitivity to EDP-938 but also resulted in a 100-fold lower viral titer. A phase 1 study was recently completed (reported at the 11th International Respiratory Syncytial Virus Symposium) and overall demonstrated no safety concerns. Phase 2 studies in an RSV human controlled infection model were ongoing at the time of the meeting.","COPD is a complex condition resulting from the interaction of environmental and genetic factors. Familial clustering was reported in the studies of COPD in China. 6, 7, [9] [10] [11] 15, 51 Several gene polymorphisms have been investigated in the Chinese population, but there is a need for further clarifi cation and confi rmation. Individuals with a 1-antiprotease deficiency had a markedly increased risk of developing COPD in Europe, 55 whereas few patients with a 1 -antiprotease defi ciency developed COPD in China. 56 Another case-control study among the Han population in southwest China failed to obtain evidence of the contribution of SERPINE2 polymorphism to COPD susceptibility, 57 although it has been accepted as a candidate gene in other populations. 58 It was suggested that there might be other genetic factors involved in the development of COPD in the Chinese population.","increase in disease transmission [2] . In addition, there is a susceptibility factor with the aging population and movements of high-risk populations via immigration. Human behavior has contributed to exposure opportunities, examples of which include extreme adventure sports resulting in Listeria outbreaks and spelunking associated with histoplasmosis [2] . Air conditioning, a major technologic advancement, has led to outbreaks of legionnaires' disease. Environmental changes involving exposure to the tropical rain forest have resulted in new hemorrhagic fever viruses. Climate changes, including changes in temperature, rainfall, and vegetation, contribute to the emergence of infectious diseases [2] . International travel has facilitated the global transmission of diseases; an example is the introduction of an infected bird or person causing West Nile virus and SARS [3] . A simple, straightforward URI may represent a more complicated, lethal process. The nonspecific symptoms of a URI may represent a kaleidoscope of lethal disease entities.","It is clear that phage can have complex effects on host populations, but these phage themselves often exist in complex and mixed states that can be diffi cult to unravel ( Harcombe and Bull, 2005 ) . It has been known for some time that the presence of otherwise silent phage can greatly affect the growth of other virus and susceptibility of host. One such silent and common phage that has long been studied is P1. P1 was initially discovered due to its effect on T4 and lambda. However, P1 has been a very interesting model, not because it causes disease or offers potential therapy against bacterial pathogens, but simply because it persists effi ciently as an episome and competes effectively with many other phage ( Yarmolinsky, 2004 ) . Since it does so without integrating, P1 provides us with one of the only well-studied models that can inform us regarding the molecular strategies and details of how stability in non-genomic persistence is attained.","Susceptibility to pandemic influenza will depend on whether the virus is a re-emergent virus similar to one that has infected people in the past, for example influenza A (H2N2), or an entirely new virus like the avian influenza A (H5N1) virus that appeared in Hong Kong in 1997. If it is an influenza A (H2N2)-like virus, people over the age of 35 years (approximately 40% of the world's population) are likely to have been immunologically primed by past infection and will require only one 'booster' dose of vaccine. If the virus is entirely new, no one will have been primed and everyone will probably require two doses. Moreover, because the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of vaccinating not only older adults but also younger adults and children is widely appreciated, health officials in many countries may choose to vaccinate most, if not all of their populations. Thus the number of doses of vaccine that will be needed for a pandemic will be much larger than the number currently used each year.","Infectious disease also may be viewed from its impact on human populations. Infectious diseases have had a profound effect on migrating human populations and vice versa. Conflicts have been affected by infectious diseases from ancient times continuing to the present. Civilizations and subsequent history have been altered profoundly by infectious diseases. The plague of Athens changed the balance of power between Athens and Sparta, ending the golden age of Pericles and Athenian predominance in the ancient world. With the downfall of Greece and subsequently of ancient Rome, once again in large part caused by the plague of Justinian, history again was changed forever. Immune populations exposed to virulent infections from invaders, decimated native populations and changed history as a result. During the age of exploration, the invasion of Europeans in Latin America, Asia, India, and Africa had important consequences. Explorers, conquerors, and invading armies brought with them insect and rodent vectors that can introduce or sustain infectious diseases in nonendemic areas. Geographically defined disease pools are interrelated precariously and interact with human populations.","Cytotoxicity assays from crude lymphocyte preparations of murine lung indicated the presence of NK cells (Puccetti et al., 1980) . It was then further shown that the use of anti-NK cell depleting antibodies decreased lung cell cytotoxicity, whereas influenza infection increased cytotoxicity, providing evidence for resident NK cells in the mouse lung (Stein-Streilein et al., 1983) . Further experiments with mice showed that lung NK cells can present with higher cytotoxic activity than blood and spleen populations (Wiltrout et al., 1985) , while depletion of NK cells from the lung led to the increased susceptibility and mortality of mice infected with the influenza virus (Stein-Streilein and Guffee, 1986). In addition, human lung lymphocytes displayed cytotoxic activity (Bordignon et al., 1982) , although resting lung NK cells were only capable of killing the target following stimulation (Robinson et al., 1984) . It was also shown that alveolar macrophages could potently inhibit lung NK cell activity but had little effect on peripheral blood NK cells (Roth and Golub, 1989) , suggesting that in the lung, NK cells might represent a different subtype that responds to different regulatory mechanisms.","Although advances in medical science have made us less vulnerable to some infectious diseases, epidemics and pandemics continue to occur as they have throughout human history. During the 1960s and 1970s, there was a growing sense that infectious diseases were being \"successfully\" conquered on a global basis. 89 However, in 2013, infectious diseases still remain the leading cause of death worldwide. The world's human and animal populations continue to struggle against an increasingly recognized number of viral, bacterial, protozoal, helminthic, and fungal agents. 90 A 2003 National Academy of Sciences Institute of Medicine report detailed the combination of emerging social, political, and economic factors favoring infectious agents in humans and animals: \"a transcendent moment nears upon the world for a microbial perfect storm. \" 91 Thirteen factors were identified in the report that favor the emergence of infectious agents: microbial adaptation and change, human susceptibility to infection, climate and weather, changing ecosystems, human demographics and behavior, economic development and land use, international travel and commerce, technology and industry, breakdown of public health measures, poverty and social inequality, war and famine, lack of political will, and intent to harm.","In response to the outbreak, the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (China CDC) dispatched a rapid response team to accompany health authorities of Hubei province and Wuhan city to conduct epidemiological and etiological investigations. The WHO confirmed that the outbreak of the coronavirus epidemic was associated with the Huanan South China Seafood Marketplace, but no specific animal association was identified [6]. Scientists immediately started to research the source of the new coronavirus, and the first genome of COVID-19 was published by the research team led by Prof. Yong-Zhen Zhang, on 10 January 2020 [7]. Within 1 month, this virus spread quickly throughout China during the Chinese New Year \u2013 a period when there is a high level of human mobility among Chinese people. Although it is still too early to predict susceptible populations, early patterns have shown a trend similar to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronaviruses. Susceptibility seems to be associated with age, biological sex, and other health conditions [8]. COVID-19 has now been declared as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern by the WHO [9].","The National Health Commission of China has published several guideline documents since January of 2020, varying from the notification of principles for emergency psychological crisis intervention for the COVID-19 epidemic on January 26 to the notice of psychological assistance hotlines for the epidemic on February 2, and most recently, guidelines for psychological assistance hotlines during the COVID-19 epidemic on February 7 (National Health Commission of China, 2020). Williams (2020) points out that in two correspondences published in Lancet Psychiatry, experts drew attention to patient populations that may need tailored interventions: older adults and international migrant workers Liem et al., 2020) . Hence, considering the large aging Chinese population and their susceptibility to COVID-19, older adults with psychiatric conditions may be experiencing further distress (Williams, 2020) . Moreover, they may not have access to care as a result of mass quarantine restrictions and public transport closure . Liu et al. (2020) highlighted that the COVID-19 epidemic has underscored potential gaps in mental health services during emergencies, while also testing the resilience of healthcare workers and medical systems. Duan and Zhu (2020) noted an increase of psychological problems during this epidemic, including anxiety, depression, and stress.","Selection studies in cell culture and analysis of viruses from drugtreated patients in clinical trials have revealed the principal pathways to reduced susceptibility to baloxavir Jones et al., 2018; Omoto et al., 2018) and pimodivir (Byrn et al., 2015; Trevejo et al., 2018) . In baloxavir studies, treatment-emergent amino acid substitutions most frequently occurred at conserved position I38 (I38 F/ M/T) in the PA endonuclease active site and conferred reduced susceptibility by 10-57-fold in influenza A and 2-6-fold in influenza B. Substitutions at position S324 (S324C/I/N/R) in the cap-binding site of PB2 were recognized as the leading pathway for a 60-160-fold reduced susceptibility to pimodivir. Next generation sequence (NGS) analysis of 9,233 influenza type A and B viruses collected in the U.S. between 2016 and 2018, showed that only three viruses had the abovementioned substitutions. However, drug-resistant influenza viruses can become transmissible and spread widely; it is essential to monitor drug susceptibility among seasonal and non-seasonal influenza viruses.","A. Babak*, S.M. Zahraei, Z. Pezeshky, Z. Nokhodian, B. Ataei, M. Ataie (Isfahan, IR) Objectives: Nosocomial infections are those which are created during hospitalization or as its result. The health care workers' hands are the main route of microorganism transmission. Hand washing is the most important measure to prevent spread of this infection. Compliance of hand hygiene (HH) among healthcare workers is generally low (less than 50%). This study aimed to determine the acceptance level of hand hygiene in Isfahan hospitals, 2010 to design interventions to increase awareness, motivation and performance among Healthcare workers. Methods: This cross sectional study was conducted in three large hospitals in Isfahan (a public training medical center, a public medical center, and a private medical center) and a total of seven trained observers for different working shifts at three hospitals were selected. 7 working days during two different weeks and every day, eight 20-minute sessions was considered. During these sessions, observers monitored healthcare workers during their routine activities through a check list. Five indications (before touching a patient, before a procedure, after a procedure or body fluid exposure risk, after touching a patient, after touching a patient surroundings) were observed based on the World Health Organization guideline. Four different professional groups (physician, nursing, student, others) were considered for this study. HH compliance was calculated as \"(number of positive hand hygiene actions/number of total hand hygiene indications) \u00d7 100\" based on each indication and professional group. Results: From the total 3097 observed indications, in general, the HH compliance rate was 5.6% and statistically significant between three different hospitals (7.4%, 4.1%, and 1.4% respectively). The most rates were observed among the nursing group (7.3%), and then the student group (6.5%), (p-value less than 0.001). Among the various indications, the highest rate of compliance was observed after a procedure or body fluid exposure risk (9.4%), (p-value less than 0.001). Conclusion: In this study, the hand hygiene compliance rate in hospitals studied was low and needs to plan for improve. Phadebact monoclonal antibody typing (Boule Diagnostic AB, Hudding, Sweden) was performed on these isolates. Penicillinase production was performed using nitrocephin method. Results: All 36 isolates were WII/WIII (IB serovars), yielded 100% invitro susceptibility to ceftriaxone (MIC 0.5mg/l) and spectinomycin (MIC 128mg/l). Three isolates (8.3%) were resistance to penicillin (MIC 2mg/l) and were penicillinase producing strains. Twenty eight isolates (77.8%) yielded reduced susceptibility to penicillin (MIC 0.12\u22121mg/l). Thirty one isolates (86%) were resistance to penicillin or yielded reduced susceptibility to penicillin. Five isolates (13.9%) were resistant to ciprofloxacin (QRNG) (MIC 1mg/l) of these five isolates three yielded penicillin reduced susceptibility pattern while two were resistant to penicillin. Six (16.7%) were resistant to tetracycline (MIC 2mg/l) (TRNG). All the ciprofloxacin resistant isolates were from male subjects. Seven distinct antimicrobial susceptibility patterns were observed. A 0.74% isolation rate was obtained in this study population. Conclusion: Ciprofloxacin and penicillin resistance is increasing. Cephalosporin resistance was not observed but, local continuous antimicrobial surveillance is paramount and should be ongoing. There was no distinct link between the phadebact monoclonal typing of these isolates and their antimicrobial susceptibility pattern.","A major weakness of our own study is the limited number of cases similar to those in other studies. Although our conclusion here derives from the most rational deduction based on accumulated results of each small study, different associations in other studies could also be interpreted in other ways, for instance, by the interaction with other environmental or pathogenic factors such as possible difference of mutation in SARS-CoV. Alternatively, it is also possible that the HLA-genes are merely markers of the disease susceptibility and that other immune-related genes in the HLA regions may be more deeply involved in the risk of disease. Genetic contribution of non-HLA immune molecules has also been studied extensively even now [6 -8] . We should collect all information and prepare for the threat of a future outbreak of emerging diseases such as H5N1 infection that causes lethal acute lung injury presumably through a similar immune mechanism. In conclusion, our study demonstrated that an HLA class II allele, HLA-DRB1*1202 is a new candidate allele involved in the progress of SARS, which enabled us to evaluate previous HLA studies on the basis of alleles and haplotypes common to the Asian populations. Accumulation of these studies would also help when planning a future effective vaccination strategy.","In clinical trials of baloxavir, treatment-emergent resistance was detected in 9.7% of adults and \u223c23% of children, and typically occurred at day 5 or later. The amino acid substitutions at conserved residue I38 in the Polymerase Acidic (PA) protein (PA-I38 T/ M/F) were the most commonly reported changes. In influenza A viruses, substitution PA-I38T was associated with a 27-57 fold decrease in baloxavir susceptibility, while I38M and I38F caused 10-20 fold decrease in susceptibility. The same changes conferred 3-8 fold decrease in baloxavir susceptibility of influenza B viruses. These substitutions were reported to impair in vitro replicative capacity of influenza A viruses . Analysis of PA sequences of 6,891 influenza A and B viruses collected in the U.S. during 2016/17 and 2017/18 seasons revealed amino acid substitutions: I38L (two A(H1N1) pdm09 viruses), E23G (two A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses) and I38M (one A(H3N2) virus) conferring 4-10-fold reduced susceptibility to baloxavir (Gubareva et al., 2019) . This study reports the replicative fitness of the viruses containing I38L and I38M substitutions in the PA protein.","Evaluation of an AmpC disk test and genetic detection of imported ampC-genes in Norwegian clinical strains of E. coli Background: Convenient phenotypic tests to detect clinical significant AmpC-production in E. coli are important for diagnostic purposes, infection control and to ensure effective therapy. Objectives: The aims were to evaluate an EDTA-based disk test for detection of AmpC-production and examine for imported ampC-genes in Norwegian clinical strains of E. coli with an AmpC-susceptibility profile. Methods: We included 23 clinical strains of E. coli collected during 2003-2005 from 11 Norwegian laboratories with an AmpC-susceptibility profile: resistance to aminopenicillins (ampicillin MIC &gt; 128 mg/L), and oxyimino cephalosporins without clavulanic acid synergy (cefpodoxime and cefotaxime and ceftazidime MIC &gt; 4 mg/L), and cephamycins (cefoxitin &gt; 16 mg/L), and susceptibility to cefepime and carbapenems. b-lactam susceptibility testing was performed by E-test. Extended susceptibility testing was done by VITEK II. The strains were negative for blaSHV and blaCTX-M by consensus PCRs. The strains were examined for b-lactamase production by IEF. Phenotypic detection of AmpCexpressional was performed by a recently described disk test based on the use of Tris-EDTA to permeabilize a bacterial cell causing extracellular release of b-lactamases (Black et al., J Clin Microbiol 2005; 40:3110) . The strains were examined by a multiplex PCR covering six families of ampC-specific genes (ACC, CIT, DHA, EBC, FOX, and MOX) as well as a specific CMY-PCR. Control strains included: ampC-positive strains (N = 6), susceptible E. coli ATCC reference strains (N = 3), clinical strains of E. coli (N = 10) susceptible for oxyimino-cephalosporins (MIC &lt; 1 mg/L) and cefoxitin (MIC &lt; 4 mg/L). Results: All 23 clinical strains with an AmpC-profile produced a b-lactamase with a pI between 8.5 and 9.0 corresponding to pIs of AmpC-b-lactamases. CMY-genes were detected in 10/23 strains as the only imported ampC gene. Sequence typing revealed both CMY-2 and CMY-7. A total of 21 out of 23 clinical strains were positive in the AmpC-disk test including all ten CMY-positive strains. The AmpC-profile negative control strains were negative in the AmpC disk test. There was a trend towards a multiresistance phenotype in the AmpC-positive E. coli strains.","Lyssaviruses circulating in modern European bats may now have many new ways to spread and evolve, driven by the changes to the dynamics and interactions of their bat hosts. Cave specialists, and the viruses they have independently maintained in their perpetually large and aggregated Mediterranean populations, will have presumably been carried northward across substantially extended ranges, to mix with a diverse community of tree roosting species. As well as reacquainting populations of northern European tree roosting species with viruses they may not have seen for over 5000 years, this process also permits any viral pathogen that has co-evolved in a tree roosting species to move the other way into the more densely aggregated populations of cave specialists, although evidence of bat host switching is scant. Buildings, and the diversity of roost options offered, are the primary conduit for this potential interchange, bringing otherwise ecologically separate populations into close contact. Certainly, if the fragmentation of host bat populations promoted a sufficient evolutionary drift to produce antigenically distinct viruses, it can be imagined that this might lead to a substantial proliferation of disease, and perpetuate its spread to many new bat species. Antigenically similar viruses, even if they have co-evolved in separate cave hibernating species, may compete more directly for the new pool of hosts.","Evaluation of MicroScan WalkAway 96 for susceptibility testing of Gram-negative bacilli to quinolones P445 Evaluation of identification and antimicrobial susceptibility testing of bacterial pathogens by VITEK 2 Compact System E. Stefaniuk, A. Mrowka, W. Hryniewicz (Warsaw, PL) Objectives: The aim of this study was the evaluation of VITEK 2 Compact System for identification and antimicrobials susceptibility determination of the most important bacterial clinical pathogens. The results of the analyses were compared with those obtained by other microbiological methods. Methods: A total of 279 clinically significant gram-negative (n = 158) and gram-positive (n = 121) bacterial pathogens were included in the study. The isolates were collected from patients hospitalised in different medical centres in Poland and were not epidemiologically related. They were identified to the species level according to standard methods. These results were compared with identification data using VITEK 2 Compact GNI and DPI cards. MICs of various antimicrobials were evaluated by agar or broth dilution methods in accordance with the CLSI guidelines. A wide variety of clinically important antimicrobial resistance mechanisms were represented by the isolates. These included extended-spectrum beta-lactamases in Enterobacteriaceae, methicillin resistance in Staphylococci, decreased pneumococcal susceptibility to penicillin and resistance to vancomycin and to high concentrations of aminoglycosides in Enterococci. The same antimicrobial agents were tested as those that are present in the VITEK 2 Compact cards used in the study. Characteristic features of the automatic method of identification and drug susceptibility determination were defined: total accordance of resistance categories, accuracy, sensitivity, specificity and errors. Results: A high rate of ID agreement (96,5%) between VITEK 2 Compact and the conventional methods was observed. It ranged from 95% for gram-positive cocci to 98,1% for gram-negative rods. The study has shown a high correlation of results (n = 1118) obtained by aid of VITEK 2 Compact drug sensitivity tests and the results obtained by the aid of reference methods. The total accordance of resistance categories has been estimated at the level of 99,1%. A high concordance (99%) between the two methods was also achieved in the respect to the detection of bacterial resistance mechanisms Conclusions: VITEK 2 Compact System is an esthetical, functional and easy to use device. The VITEK 2 Compact System appears a reliable tool for the detection and interpretive reading of clinically important mechanisms of resistance and can be recommended for routine work.","The origins of this virus have been traced back to the seafood wholesale market in Wuhan, China. [4] In our epidemiologic investigation, 16 recipients experienced contact with animals or poultry, but there was no reported animal death. No recipients have ever been to the seafood wholesale market in Wuhan or were in contact with any potential supply chains of wild or game meat. immunocompromised hosts with mortality rates of 10% and 35%, respectively. [10, 11] Early patient reports from SARS-CoV-2 find similar trends. Severe manifestations even death with SARS-CoV-2 has been associated in elderly patients with comorbidities, including 8 hypertension, diabetes, heart and/or kidney disease. [3] This finding is similar to increased severity and death in elderly patients following both SARS and MERS-CoV infection. [12, 13] For the MERS-CoV outbreak, smoking, hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and/or other chronic illnesses were present in the majority of deaths and correspond to findings in animal models. [14] The accompanying comorbidities in this group of HTx recipients include: transplantation. [15] Data from Ju Chunrong suggest that the number of SOT recipients in China suffering from SARS-CoV-2 infection are few, including only 9 confirmed cases altogether. [16] With limited data, it is difficult to determine the populations that may be most susceptible to SARS-CoV-2. More data are needed to determine the susceptibility of the immunocompromised population."],"title":["Estimation of country-level basic reproductive ratios for novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) using synthetic contact matrices","Functional polymorphisms of the CCL2 and MBL genes cumulatively increase susceptibility to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus infection","Estimation of country-level basic reproductive ratios for novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) using synthetic contact matrices","Advances in respiratory virus therapeutics \u2013 A meeting report from the 6th isirv Antiviral Group conference","Chapter 1 Introduction","Multiple sclerosis","Bulk and single-cell transcriptomics identify tobacco-use disparity in lung gene expression of ACE2, the receptor of 2019-nCov","Poster Sessions","Functional polymorphisms of the CCL2 and MBL genes cumulatively increase susceptibility to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus infection","Should patients with acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis be treated with antibiotics?

Methods We genotyped the CCL2 G-2518A and MBL codon 54 variant (A/B) in 4 case\u2013control populations of Chinese descent, totally consisting of 932 patients with SARS and 982 control subjects. Results Both the high-CCL2-producing GG genotype and the low-MBL-producing B allele were consistently associated with increased risks of SARS-CoV infection in all 4 case\u2013control populations (joint P = 1.6 \u00d7 10\u22124 and 4.9 \u00d7 10\u22128, for CCL2 and MBL respectively), with no interaction between polymorphisms could be detected. Furthermore, all the 4 case\u2013control studies demonstrated a cumulative effect on risk of SARS-CoV infection for the combination of polymorphisms (joint P = 1.3 \u00d7 10\u221210). However, tests using the area under the curve (AUC) indicated that at this stage, the polymorphisms...","The 2019-nCoV is reported to share the same entry (ACE2) as SARS-CoV according to the updated findings. Analyzing the distribution and expression level of the route of coronavirus may help reveal underlying mechanisms of viral susceptibility and post-infection modulation. In this study, we found that the expression of ACE2 in healthy populations and patients with underlying diseases was not significantly different, suggesting relatively similar susceptibility, which was consistent with current clinical observations. Moreover, based on the expression of ACE2 in smoking individuals, we inferred that long-term smoking might be a risk factor for 2019-nCoV. Analyzing the ACE2 in SARS-CoV infected cells suggested that ACE2 was more than just a receptor but also participated in post-infection regulation, including immune response, cytokine secretion, and viral genome replication. We also constructed Protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks and identified hub genes in viral activity and cyto...","The COVID-19 pandemic has shown a markedly low proportion of cases among children. Age disparities in observed cases could be explained by assortative mixing patterns and reactive school closures which decrease mixing between children, or by children exhibiting lower susceptibility to infection, or by children having a lower propensity to show clinical symptoms. We formally test these hypotheses by fitting an age-structured mathematical model to epidemic data from six countries, finding strong age dependence in the probability of developing clinical symptoms, rising from around 20% in under 10s to over 70% in older adults. We find that interventions aimed at halting transmission in children may have minimal effects on preventing cases depending on the relative transmissibility of subclinical infections. Our estimated age-specific clinical fraction has implications for the expected global burden of clinical cases because of demographic differences across settings. In younger populations...","Abstract The current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia pandemic, caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus, is spreading globally at an accelerated rate, with a basic reproduction number (R0) of 2 \u2013 2.5, indicating that 2 \u2013 3 persons will be infected from an index patient. A serious public health emergency, it is particularly deadly in vulnerable populations and communities in which healthcare providers are insufficiently prepared to manage the infection. As of March 16, 2020, there are more than 180,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19 worldwide, with over 7,000 related deaths. The SARS-CoV-2 virus has been isolated from asymptomatic individuals, and affected patients continue to be infectious two weeks after cessation of symptoms. The substantial morbidity and socioeconomic impact have necessitated drastic measures across all continents, including nationwide lockdowns and border closures. Pregnant women and their fetuses represent a high-risk populat...","Assuming that no human had any previously acquired immunoprotection against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) during the 2003 SARS outbreak, the biological bases for possible difference in individual susceptibility are intriguing. However, this issue has never been fully elucidated. Based on the premise that SARS patients belonging to a given genotype group having a significantly higher SARS infection rate than others would imply that genotype group being more susceptible, we make use of a compartmental model describing disease transmission dynamics and clinical and gene data of 100 laboratory confirmed SARS patients from Chinese Han population in Taiwan to estimate the infection rates of distinct candidate genotype groups among these SARS-infected individuals. The results show that CXCL10(\u2212938AA) is always protective whenever it appears, but appears rarely and only jointly with either Fgl2(+158T/*) or HO-1(\u2212497A/*), while (Fgl2)(+158T/*) is associated with highe...","Abstract Excessive immune response is believed to play a role in the development of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). Inhomogeneous spread of SARS led one to think of an Asian genetic predisposition and contribution of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) to the disease susceptibility. However, past case-control studies showed inconsistent results. In Viet Nam, of 62 patients with SARS, 44 participated in the present study together with 103 individuals who had contact with SARS patients and 50 without contact history. HLA-DRB1*12 was more frequently shown in SARS patients than in controls (corrected p = 0.042). HLA-DRB1*1202, the predominant allele in the Vietnamese population showed the strongest association with SARS in a dominant model (corrected p = 0.0065 and 0.0052, depending on the controls to be compared). Our results and accumulated data on HLA in the Asian populations would help in the understanding of associations with emerging infectious diseases.","Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is a recently isolated betacoronavirus identified as the etiologic agent of a frequently fatal disease in Western Asia, Middle East respiratory syndrome. Attempts to identify the natural reservoirs of MERS-CoV have focused in part on dromedaries. Bats are also suspected to be reservoirs based on frequent detection of other betacoronaviruses in these mammals. For this study, ten distinct cell lines derived from bats of divergent species were exposed to MERS-CoV. Plaque assays, immunofluorescence assays, and transmission electron microscopy confirmed that six bat cell lines can be productively infected. We found that the susceptibility or resistance of these bat cell lines directly correlates with the presence or absence of cell surface-expressed CD26/DPP4, the functional human receptor for MERS-CoV. Human anti-CD26/DPP4 antibodies inhibited infection of susceptible bat cells in a dose-dependent manner. Overexpression of human CD26/...","Bats and rodents are being increasingly recognized as reservoirs of emerging zoonotic viruses. Various studies have investigated bat viruses in tropical regions, but to date there are no data regarding viruses with zoonotic potential that circulate in bat and rat populations in Viet Nam. To address this paucity of data, we sampled three bat farms and three wet markets trading in rat meat in the Mekong Delta region of southern Viet Nam. Faecal and urine samples were screened for the presence of RNA from paramyxoviruses, coronaviruses and filoviruses. Paramyxovirus RNA was detected in 4 of 248 (1%) and 11 of 222 (4.9%) bat faecal and urine samples, respectively. Coronavirus RNA was detected in 55 of 248 (22%) of bat faecal samples; filovirus RNA was not detected in any of the bat samples. Further, coronavirus RNA was detected in 12 of 270 (4.4%) of rat faecal samples; all samples tested negative for paramyxovirus. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the bat paramyxoviruses and bat and ra...","Abstract The angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) has been identified as a receptor for the severe acute respiratory syndrome associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV). Here we show that ACE2 expression on cell lines correlates with susceptibility to SARS-CoV S-driven infection, suggesting that ACE2 is a major receptor for SARS-CoV. The soluble ectodomain of ACE2 specifically abrogated S-mediated infection and might therefore be exploited for the generation of inhibitors. Deletion of a major portion of the cytoplasmic domain of ACE2 had no effect on S-driven infection, indicating that this domain is not important for receptor function. Our results point to a central role of ACE2 in SARS-CoV infection and suggest a minor contribution of the cytoplasmic domain to receptor function.","Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causes the infectious disease COVID-19, which was first reported in Wuhan, China in December, 2019. Despite the tremendous efforts to control the disease, COVID-19 has now spread to over 100 countries and caused a global pandemic. SARS-CoV-2 is thought to have originated in bats; however, the intermediate animal sources of the virus are completely unknown. Here, we investigated the susceptibility of ferrets and animals in close contact with humans to SARS-CoV-2. We found that SARS-CoV-2 replicates poorly in dogs, pigs, chickens, and ducks, but efficiently in ferrets and cats. We found that the virus transmits in cats via respiratory droplets. Our study provides important insights into the animal reservoirs of SARS-CoV-2 and animal management for COVID-19 control.","Importance: Risk factors associated with COVID-19, the viral pneumonia originating in Wuhan, China, in Dec 2019, require clarification so that medical resources can be prioritized for those at highest risk of severe COVID-19 complications. Infection with M. tuberculosis (MTB), the pathogen that causes TB and latently infects ~25% of the global population, may be a risk factor for SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe COVID-19 pneumonia. Objective: To determine if latent or active TB increase susceptibility to SARS-COV-19 infection and disease severity, and lead to more rapid development of COVID-19 pneumonia. Design: An observational case-control study of 36 confirmed COVID-19 cases from Shenyang, China, conducted in Feb 2020. Final date of follow-up: Feb 29, 2020. Cases were grouped according to COVID-19 pneumonia severity (mild/moderate, severe/critical), and MTB infection status compared. Comparisons were made with MTB infection data from another case-control study on bacterial/viral pneu...","Strict interventions were successful to control the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak in China. As transmission intensifies in other countries, the interplay between age, contact patterns, social distancing, susceptibility to infection and disease, and COVID-19 dynamics remains unclear. To answer these questions, we analyze contact surveys data for Wuhan and Shanghai before and during the outbreak and contact tracing information from Hunan Province. Daily contacts were reduced 7-9 fold during the COVID-19 social distancing period, with most interactions restricted to the household. Children 0-14 years were 59% (95% CI 7-82%) less susceptible than individuals 65 years and over. A transmission model calibrated against these data indicates that social distancing alone, as implemented in China during the outbreak, is sufficient to control COVID-19. While proactive school closures cannot interrupt transmission on their own, they reduce peak incidence by half and delay the epidemic. Thes...","Abstract Mannheimia (Pasteurella) haemolytica A1 produces an extracellular leukotoxin (LKT) that is reported to bind the \u03b22-integrin CD11a/CD18 (LEA-1) on ruminant leukocytes. LKT binding induces activation, and subsequent cytolysis, of these cells. It is well known that active viral infection greatly increases the susceptibility of cattle to pasteurellosis. To better understand the mechanism by which this occurs, we investigated the effects of experimental in vivo infection of cattle with bovine herpes virus-1 (BHV-1) on the ex vivo interaction of bovine leukocytes with the M. haemolytica LKT. In this study, we demonstrated that active BHV-1 infection increased the expression of the \u03b22-integrin CD11a/CD18 (as defined by the mAb BAT75) on bovine peripheral blood neutrophils, enhanced the binding of LKT to bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) leukocytes and peripheral blood neutrophils, and increased the killing of BAL leukocytes and peripheral blood leukocytes by LKT. In addition, BHV-1 greatl...","We probe how genetic variability across the three major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I genes (human leukocyte antigen [HLA] A, B, and C) may affect susceptibility to and severity of severe acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus responsible for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). We execute a comprehensive in silico analysis of viral peptide-MHC class I binding affinity across all known HLA -A, -B, and -C genotypes for all SARS-CoV-2 peptides. We further explore the potential for cross-protective immunity conferred by prior exposure to four common human coronaviruses. The SARS-CoV-2 proteome is successfully sampled and presented by a diversity of HLA alleles. However, we found that HLA-B*46:01 had the fewest predicted binding peptides for SARS-CoV-2, suggesting individuals with this allele may be particularly vulnerable to COVID-19, as they were previously shown to be for SARS (1). Conversely, we found that HLA-B*15:03 showed the greatest capacity to present hig...","In an era of global health threats caused by epidemics of infectious diseases and rising multidrug resistance, microbiology laboratories provide essential scientific evidence for risk assessment, prevention, and control. Microbiology has been at the core of European infectious disease surveillance networks for decades. Since 2010, these networks have been coordinated by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC). Activities delivered in these networks include harmonization of laboratory diagnostic, antimicrobial susceptibility and molecular typing methods, multicentre method validation, technical capacity mapping, training of laboratory staff, and continuing quality assessment of laboratory testing. Cooperation among the European laboratory networks in the past 7 years has proved successful in strengthening epidemic preparedness by enabling adaptive capabilities for rapid detection of emerging pathogens across Europe. In partnership with food safety authorities, inte...","Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is characterized by substantial acute pulmonary inflammation with a high mortality rate. Despite the identification of SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) as the etiologic agent of SARS, a thorough understanding of the underlying disease pathogenesis has been hampered by the lack of a suitable animal model that recapitulates the human disease. Intranasal (i.n.) infection of A/J mice with the CoV mouse hepatitis virus strain 1 (MHV-1) induces an acute respiratory disease with a high lethality rate that shares several pathological similarities with SARS-CoV infection in humans. In this study, we examined virus replication and the character of pulmonary inflammation induced by MHV-1 infection in susceptible (A/J, C3H/HeJ, and BALB/c) and resistant (C57BL/6) strains of mice. Virus replication and distribution did not correlate with the relative susceptibilities of A/J, BALB/c, C3H/HeJ, and C57BL/6 mice. In order to further define the role of the host geneti...","BACKGROUND: Public health risks associated to infection by human coronaviruses remain considerable and vaccination is a key option for preventing the resurgence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV). We have previously reported that antibodies elicited by a SARS-CoV vaccine candidate based on recombinant, full-length SARS-CoV Spike-protein trimers, trigger infection of immune cell lines. These observations prompted us to investigate the molecular mechanisms and responses to antibody-mediated infection in human macrophages. METHODS: We have used primary human immune cells to evaluate their susceptibility to infection by SARS-CoV in the presence of anti-Spike antibodies. Fluorescence microscopy and real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) were utilized to assess occurrence and consequences of infection. To gain insight into the underlying molecular mechanism, we performed mutational analysis with a series of truncated and chime...","Importance: The recent outbreak of Novel Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) Disease (COVID-19) has put the world on alert, that is reminiscent of the SARS outbreak seventeen years ago. Objective: We aim to compare the severity and mortality between male and female patients with both COVID-19 and SARS, to explore the most useful prognostic factors for individualized assessment. Design, Setting, and Participants: We extracted the data from a case series of 43 hospitalized patients we treated, a public data set of the first 37 cases died of COVID-19 in Wuhan city and 1019 survived patients from six cities in China. We also analyzed the data of 524 patients with SARS, including 139 deaths, from Beijing city in early 2003. Main Outcomes and Measures: Severity and mortality. Results: Older age and high number of comorbidities were associated with higher severity and mortality in patients with both COVID-19 and SARS. The percentages of older age (\u226565 years) were much higher in the deceased group than i...","The novel coronavirus 2019-nCoV has caused major outbreaks in many parts of the world. A better understanding of the pathophysiology of COVID-19 is urgently needed. Clinically, it is important to identify who may be susceptible to infection and identify treatments for the disease. There is good evidence that ACE2 is a receptor for 2019-nCoV, and studies also suggested that high expression of ACE2 may increase susceptibility to infection. Here we conducted a phenome-wide Mendelian randomization (MR) study to prioritize diseases/traits and blood proteins that may be causally linked to ACE2 expression in the lung. Expression data was based on GTEx. We also explored drug candidates whose targets overlapped with the top-ranked proteins in MR analysis, as these drugs could potentially alter ACE2 expression and may be clinically relevant. Notably, MR is much less vulnerable to confounding and reverse causality compared to observational studies. The most consistent finding was a tentative caus...","OBJECTIVE To investigate the relationship between the ABO blood group and the COVID-19 susceptibility. DESIGN The study was conducted by comparing the blood group distribution in 2,173 patients with COVID-19 confirmed by SARS-CoV-2 test from three hospitals in Wuhan and Shenzhen, China with that in normal people from the corresponding regions. Data were analyzed using one-way ANOVA and 2-tailed \u03c72 and a meta-analysis was performed by random effects models. SETTING Three tertiary hospitals in Wuhan and Shenzhen, China. PARTICIPANTS A total of 1,775 patients with COVID-19, including 206 dead cases, from Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital, Wuhan, China were recruited. Another 113 and 285 patients with COVID-19 were respectively recruited from Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan and Shenzhen Third People's Hospital, Shenzhen, China. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Detection of ABO blood groups, infection occurrence of SARS-CoV-2, and patient death RESULTS The ABO group in 3694 normal people in Wuhan sh...","We are proposing to use machine learning algorithms to be able to improve possible case identifications of COVID-19 more quicker when we use a mobile phone-based web survey. This will also reduce the spread in the susceptible populations.","Zoonotic transmission of novel viruses represents a significant threat to global public health and is fueled by globalization, the loss of natural habitats, and exposure to new hosts. For coronaviruses (CoVs), broad diversity exists within bat populations and uniquely positions them to seed future emergence events. In this review, we explore the host and viral dynamics that shape these CoV populations for survival, amplification, and possible emergence in novel hosts.","This paper focuses on the formulation of a deterministic 2019-nCov transmission model by considering the exposed and recovered populations with immunity. The scenario of the simulation is depicted based on the patient zero in Malaysia. The transmission model is found to be able to predict the next confirmed case given a single case introduced in a fully susceptible population. The mathematical model is developed based on the SEIR model which has susceptible, exposed, infectious and recovered populations. The system of equations which were obtained were solved numerically and the simulation results were analyzed. The analysis includes the impact of the disease if no control is taken.","Middle East Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is a novel coronavirus discovered in 2012 and is responsible for acute respiratory syndrome in humans. Though not confirmed yet, multiple surveillance and phylogenetic studies suggest a bat origin. The disease is heavily endemic in dromedary camel populations of East Africa and the Middle East. It is unclear as to when the virus was introduced to dromedary camels, but data from studies that investigated stored dromedary camel sera and geographical distribution of involved dromedary camel populations suggested that the virus was present in dromedary camels several decades ago. Though bats and alpacas can serve as potential reservoirs for MERS-CoV, dromedary camels seem to be the only animal host responsible for the spill over human infections.","","","","As an atypical pneumonia began to appear in December 2019, Zhou et al . worked with remarkable speed to identify the associated virus, determine its relationship to animal viruses, and evaluate factors conferring infection susceptibility and resistance. These foundational results are being advanced to control the current worldwide human coronavirus epidemic.","Governments around the world must rapidly mobilize and make difficult policy decisions to mitigate the COVID-19 pandemic. Because deaths have been concentrated at older ages, we highlight the important role of demography, particularly how the age structure of a population may help explain differences in fatality rates across countries and how transmission unfolds. We examine the role of age structure in deaths thus far in Italy and South Korea and illustrate how the pandemic could unfold in populations with similar population sizes but different age structures, showing a dramatically higher burden of mortality in countries with older versus younger populations. This powerful interaction of demography and current age-specific mortality for COVID-19 suggests that social distancing and other policies to slow transmission should consider both the age composition of local and national contexts as well as the social connectedness of older and younger generations. We also call for countries t...","The ongoing pandemic of 2019-nCov (COVID-19) coronavirus has made reliable epidemiological modeling an urgent necessity. Unfortunately, most of the existing models are either too fine-grained to be efficient or too coarse-grained to be reliable. Here we propose a computationally efficient hybrid approach that uses SIR model for individual cities which are in turn coupled via empirical transportation networks that facilitate migration among them. The treatment presented here differs from existing models in two crucial ways: first, self-consistent determination of coupling parameters so as to maintain the populations of individual cities, and second, the incorporation of distance dependent temporal delays in migration. We apply our model to Indian aviation as well as railway networks taking into account populations of more than 300 cities. Our results project that through the domestic transportation, the significant population is poised to be exposed within 90 days of the onset of epidem...","Unknown","The study of virus evolution has historically been concerned with disease and its emergence and has not been integrated into the general study of evolution. Yet viruses dominate our planet and their evolution is a broad and applied field that can be studied in the real time (such HIV in human disease) and can also be applied to biotechnological problems. Virus evolution is very similar, but not identical, to host evolution. Darwinian principles apply, such as with Fisher population genetics, but other features, such as reticulated and quasispecies-based evolution, distinguish virus evolution. In RNA viruses, high error rates have led to the quasispecies concept in which collective populations are the basis of evolution. These populations provide viruses with high capacities for adaptation. Yet some RNA viruses show remarkable evolutionary stability. With DNA viruses, especially of bacteria, extensive recombination defines vast dynamic and ancient genetic pools. Temperate viruses can di...","Summary Viruses, particularly syncitial respiratory virus, are the main aetiology of community-acquired lower respiratory tract infections in infants, while bacterial agents are more frequently responsible in children older than 3 years. Antimicrobial therapy must take into account the development of reduced susceptibility of penicillin to strains of Straptoccocus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae with \u03b2-lactamase, and high frequency of Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Chlamydia pneumoniae infections. Although the mortality rate has remained low in France, the morbidity appeared to increase in recent years.","Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is infecting people throughout the world. It is probable that coronavirus disease (COVID-19) will be transmitted to people experiencing homelessness, which will become a major problem in particular in North America where there are sizable populations of people experiencing homelessness in nearly every metropolitan city in the USA and Canada. In the USA, more than 500 000 people were reported to be experiencing homelessness on any given night over the past decade (2007\u201319).1 The State of Homelessness in Canada 2016 report2 estimated 35 000 people are experiencing homelessness on any given night in Canada. People experiencing homelessness live in environments that are conducive to a disease epidemic. Many people experiencing homelessness live in congregate living settings\u2014be it formal (ie, shelters or halfway houses) or informal (ie, encampments or abandoned buildings)\u2014and might not have regular access to basic hygiene supplies...","Outbreaks of infection can be devastating for individuals and societies. In this review, we examine the applications of new high-throughput sequencing approaches to the identification and characterization of outbreaks, focusing on the application of whole-genome sequencing (WGS) to outbreaks of bacterial infection. We describe traditional epidemiological analysis and show how WGS can be informative at multiple steps in outbreak investigation, as evidenced by many recent studies. We conclude that high-throughput sequencing approaches can make a significant contribution to the investigation of outbreaks of bacterial infection and that the integration of WGS with epidemiological investigation, diagnostic assays and antimicrobial susceptibility testing will precipitate radical changes in clinical microbiology and infectious disease epidemiology in the near future. However, several challenges remain before WGS can be routinely used in outbreak investigation and clinical practice.","Given the potential for laboratory-associated severe acute respiratory syndrome\u2013associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) infections, we must know which cell lines are susceptible to the virus. We investigated 21 cell lines routinely used for virus isolation or research. After infection with SARS-CoV, cells were observed for cytopathic effects, and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to measure ongoing viral replication. An indirect immunofluorescence assay was also used as a confirmatory test. The study identified 10 new cell lines capable of supporting the replication of SARS-CoV and confirmed the susceptibility of 4 cell lines previously reported. This study shows that SARS-CoV can be isolated in several cell lines commonly used for diagnostic or research purposes. It also shows that SARS-CoV can achieve high titers in several cell lines, sometimes in the absence of specific cytopathic effects.","Abstract Foodborne parasites have long been a neglected group of pathogens, as they often have insidious, chronic effects, rather than being acute diseases, and they are often associated with impoverished or marginalized populations. In addition, due to the long incubation period for most foodborne parasites, source attribution is often difficult, if not impossible. However, global trends have enabled foodborne parasites to emerge in different populations in new locations, transmitted through different food types, and sometimes with unexpected symptoms. This emergence of foodborne parasites has brought them into focus. In this chapter, six foodborne parasites are used as examples on emergence: Echinococcus multilocularis is spreading to new locations; Cryptosporidium spp. are beginning to be associated not only with water, but also with salads; Trypanosoma cruzi is being manifest with acute disease due to foodborne transmission, particularly transmitted with juices; Trichinella spp. ha...","Abstract Advances in molecular biology, bioinformatics, and robotics have allowed microarray technology to be used for in-depth, basic science studies in all fields of microbiology. Recently, translation of these basic science applications to clinical microbiology and infectious diseases has also progressed. From a clinical infectious disease perspective, genome-based organism identification, pathogen discovery, and antimicrobial susceptibility testing of problematic organisms offer the potential to yield diagnostic information that may not otherwise become available. Moreover, microarray-based studies have the ability to provide \u201csignatures\u201d of host cell transcriptional responses for individual pathogens and/or groups of pathogens. This type of information has the potential to confirm difficult diagnoses, to monitor responses to therapeutic intervention, or even to predict prognosis and sequelae following an infectious disease. Examples are presented to illustrate ways in which microa...","The coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has infected more than 600,000 people and has overwhelmed hospital systems around the world. However, the factors mediating fatal SARS-CoV-2 infections are poorly understood. Here, we show that cigarette smoke causes a dose-dependent upregulation of Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2), the SARS-CoV-2 receptor, in rodent and human lungs. Using single-cell sequencing data, we demonstrate that ACE2 is expressed in a subset of epithelial cells that line the respiratory tract, including goblet cells, club cells, and alveolar type 2 cells. Chronic smoke exposure triggers a protective expansion of mucus-secreting goblet cells and a concomitant increase in ACE2 expression. In contrast, quitting smoking causes a decrease in lung ACE2 levels. Taken together, these results may partially explain why smokers are particularly likely to develop severe SARS-CoV-2 infections, and they suggest that quitting smoking could lessen coronavirus susceptibility.","Abstract The notion that an infectious respiratory pathogen can damage the central nervous system (CNS) and lead to neurological disease was tested using a human respiratory coronavirus, the OC43 strain of human coronavirus (HCoV-OC43). First, primary cell cultures were used to determine the susceptibility of each type of neural cells to virus infection. Neurons were the target cells, undergoing degeneration during infection, in part due to apoptosis. Second, neuropathogenicity was investigated in susceptible mice. Intracerebral inoculation of HCoV-OC43 into BALB/c mice led to an acute encephalitis with neuronal cell death by necrosis and apoptosis. Infectious virus was apparently cleared from surviving animals, whereas viral RNA persisted for several months. Some of the animals surviving to acute encephalitis presented an abnormal limb clasping reflex and a decrease in motor activity starting several months post-infection. These results suggest that viral persistence could be associat...","Governments around the world are responding to the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic with unprecedented policies designed to slow the growth rate of infections. Many actions, such as closing schools and restricting populations to their homes, impose large and visible costs on society. In contrast, the benefits of these policies, in the form of infections that did not occur, cannot be directly observed and are currently understood through process-based simulations. Here, we compile new data on 936 local, regional, and national anti-contagion policies recently deployed in the ongoing pandemic across localities in China, South Korea, Iran, Italy, France, and the United States (US). We then apply reduced-form econometric methods, commonly used to measure the effect of policies on economic growth, to empirically evaluate the effect that these anti-contagion policies have had on the growth rate of infections. In the absence of any policy actions, we estimate that early infections of COVI...","Abstract We have expressed a series of truncated spike (S) glycoproteins of SARS-CoV and found that the N-terminus 14\u2013502 residuals were sufficient to bind to SARS-CoV susceptible Vero E6 cells. With this soluble S protein fragment as an affinity ligand, we screened HeLa cells transduced with retroviral cDNA library from Vero E6 cells and obtained a HeLa cell clone which could bind with the S protein. This cell clone was susceptible to HIV/SARS pseudovirus infection and the presence of a functional receptor for S protein in this cell clone was confirmed by the cell\u2013cell fusion assay. Further studies showed the susceptibility of this cell was due to the expression of endogenous angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) which was activated by inserted LTR from retroviral vector used for expression cloning. When human ACE2 cDNA was transduced into NIH3T3 cells, the ACE2 expressing NIH3T3 cells could be infected with HIV/SARS pseudovirus. These data clearly demonstrated that ACE2 was the func...","Objective: Establishing a social contact data sharing initiative and an interactive tool to assess mitigation strategies for COVID-19. Results: We organized data sharing of published social contact surveys via online repositories and formatting guidelines. We analyzed this social contact data in terms of weighted social contact matrices, next generation matrices, relative incidence and R0. We incorporated location-specific isolation measures (e.g. school closure or telework) and capture their effect on transmission dynamics. All methods have been implemented in an online application based on R Shiny and applied to COVID-19 with age-specific susceptibility and infectiousness. Using our online tool with the available social contact data, we illustrate that social distancing could have a considerable impact on reducing transmission for COVID-19. The effect itself depends on assumptions made about disease-specific characteristics and the choice of intervention(s). Keywords: social contact ...","Respiratory disease caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) pneumonia first emerged in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, in December 2019 and spread rapidly to other provinces and other countries. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the receptor for SARS-CoV and has been suggested to be also the receptor for 2019-nCoV. Paradoxically, ACE2 expression in the lung protects mice from SARS-CoV spike protein induced lung injury by attenuating the renin-angiotensin system. In the intestine, ACE2 also suppresses intestinal inflammation by maintaining amino acid homeostasis, antimicrobial peptide expression and ecology of the gut microbiome. Upon analysis of single cell-RNA sequencing data from control subjects and those with colitis or inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), we found that ACE2 expression in the colonocytes was positively associated with genes regulating viral infection, innate and cellular immunity, but was negatively associated with viral transcription, protein translati...","The outbreak of novel coronavirus (COVID-19) has the potential for global spread, infecting large numbers in all countries. In this case, estimating the country-specific basic reproductive ratio is a vital first step in public-health planning. The basic reproductive ratio (R0) is determined by both the nature of pathogen and the network of contacts through which the disease can spread - with this network determined by socio-demographics including age-structure and household composition. Here we focus on the age-structured transmission within the population, using data from China to inform age-dependent susceptibility and synthetic age-mixing matrices to inform the contact network. This allows us to determine the country-specific basic reproductive ratio as a multiplicative scaling of the value from China. We predict that R0 will be highest across Eastern Europe and Japan, and lowest across Africa, Central America and South-Western Asia. This pattern is largely driven by the ratio of ch...","BACKGROUND: Prior to emergence in human populations, zoonoses such as SARS cause occasional infections in human populations exposed to reservoir species. The risk of widespread epidemics in humans can be assessed by monitoring the reproduction number R (average number of persons infected by a human case). However, until now, estimating R required detailed outbreak investigations of human clusters, for which resources and expertise are not always available. Additionally, existing methods do not correct for important selection and under-ascertainment biases. Here, we present simple estimation methods that overcome many of these limitations. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Our approach is based on a parsimonious mathematical model of disease transmission and only requires data collected through routine surveillance and standard case investigations. We apply it to assess the transmissibility of swine-origin influenza A H3N2v-M virus in the US, Nipah virus in Malaysia and Bangladesh, and also present...","R\u00e9sum\u00e9 Les zoonoses, distingu\u00e9es ici des maladies humaines d\u2019origine animale, repr\u00e9sentent un ensemble d\u2019entit\u00e9s pathologiques dont les agents responsables circulent r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement entre l\u2019esp\u00e8ce humaine et de nombreuses esp\u00e8ces de vert\u00e9br\u00e9s.

However, the mode of virus transmission and tissue tropism is not well established yet. Recent findings of substantial liver damage in patients and ACE2+ cholangiocytes in healthy liver tissues prompted us to hypothesize that human liver ductal organoids could serve as a model to determine the susceptibility and mechanisms underlining the liver damage upon SARS-CoV-2 infection. By single-cell RNA sequencing, we found that long-term liver ductal organoid culture preserved the human specific ACE2+ population of cholangiocytes. Moreover, human liver ductal organoids were permissive to SARS-CoV-2 infection and support robust replication. Notably, virus infection impaired the barrier and bile acid transporting functions of cholangiocytes through dysregulation of genes involved in tight junction formation and bile acid transportation, which could explain the bile acid accumulation and ...","ABSTRACT In the last 30 years, the study of virus evolution has undergone a transformation. Originally concerned with disease and its emergence, virus evolution had not been well integrated into the general study of evolution. This chapter reviews the developments that have brought us to this new appreciation for the general significance of virus evolution to all life. We now know that viruses numerically dominate all habitats of life, especially the oceans. Theoretical developments in the 1970s regarding quasispecies, error rates, and error thresholds have yielded many practical insights into virus\u2013host dynamics. The human diseases of HIV-1 and hepatitis C virus cannot be understood without this evolutionary framework. Yet recent developments with poliovirus demonstrate that viral fitness can be the result of a consortia, not one fittest type, a basic Darwinian concept in evolutionary biology. Darwinian principles do apply to viruses, such as with Fisher population genetics, but other...","Abstract Since the outbreak of the new coronavirus epidemic, novel coronavirus has infected nearly 100,000 people in more than 110 countries. How to face this new coronavirus epidemic outbreak is an important issue. Basic reproduction number (R0) is an important parameter in epidemiology; The basic reproduction number of an infection can be thought of as the expected number of cases directly generated by one case in a population where all individuals are susceptible to infection. Epidemiology dynamics is a mathematical model based on a susceptibility-infection-recovery epidemic model. Researchers analyzed the epidemiological benefits of different transmission rates for the establishment of effective strategy in prevention and control strategies for epidemic infectious diseases. In this review, the early use of TCM for light and ordinary patients, can rapidly improve symptoms, shorten hospitalization days and reduce severe cases transformed from light and normal.
