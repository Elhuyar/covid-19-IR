Fast, affordable sequencing of pathogen genomes \u2014 now a staple of the public health microbiology laboratory in well-resourced settings \u2014 can affect each of these areas. Coupling genomic diagnostics and epidemiology to innovative digital disease detection platforms raises the possibility of an open, global, digital pathogen surveillance system. When informed by a One Health approach, in which human, animal and environmental health are considered together, such a genomics-based system has profound potential to improve public health in settings lacking robust laboratory capacity.

We performed health economic analyses projecting whether the additional costs from screening would be offset by the avoided costs with hospitalizations. We analysed Portuguese COVID-19 data up until the 22nd March 2020, and estimated the additional number of cases that would be detected if different testing rates and frequencies of positive results would have been observed. We projected that, in most scenarios, the costs with scaling up COVID-19 tests would be lower than savings with hospitalization costs, rendering large scale testing cost-saving.","Global gene expression analysis is beginning to move from the laboratories of basic investigators to large-scale clinical trials. The potential of this technology to improve diagnosis and tailored treatment of human disease may soon be realised, now that several comprehensive studies have demonstrated the utility of gene expression profiles for the classification of tumours into distinct, clinically relevant subtypes and the prediction of clinical outcomes. In addition, new data from the emerging proteomics platforms add another layer of molecular information to the study of human disease, as scientists attempt to catalogue a complete inventory of the proteins encoded by the genome and to establish a 'biosignature' profile of human health and disease. As a result, it is anticipated that, together, these technologies will facilitate the comprehensive study of genes, gene products and signalling pathways so that the objective of personalised molecular medicine can be achieved. This paper...","Outbreaks of infection can be devastating for individuals and societies. In this review, we examine the applications of new high-throughput sequencing approaches to the identification and characterization of outbreaks, focusing on the application of whole-genome sequencing (WGS) to outbreaks of bacterial infection. We describe traditional epidemiological analysis and show how WGS can be informative at multiple steps in outbreak investigation, as evidenced by many recent studies. We conclude that high-throughput sequencing approaches can make a significant contribution to the investigation of outbreaks of bacterial infection and that the integration of WGS with epidemiological investigation, diagnostic assays and antimicrobial susceptibility testing will precipitate radical changes in clinical microbiology and infectious disease epidemiology in the near future. However, several challenges remain before WGS can be routinely used in outbreak investigation and clinical practice.","Mass spectrometry (MS) has found numerous applications in life sciences. It has high accuracy, sensitivity and wide dynamic range in addition to medium- to high-throughput capabilities. These features make MS a superior platform for analysis of various biomolecules including proteins, lipids, nucleic acids and carbohydrates. Until recently, MS was applied for protein detection and characterization. During the last decade, however, MS has successfully been used for molecular diagnostics of microbial and viral infections with the most notable applications being identification of pathogens, genomic sequencing, mutation detection, DNA methylation analysis, tracking of transmissions, and characterization of genetic heterogeneity. These new developments vastly expand the MS application from experimental research to public health and clinical fields. Matching of molecular techniques with specific requirements of the major MS platforms has produced powerful technologies for molecular diagnosti...","The ongoing pandemic of 2019-nCov (COVID-19) coronavirus has made reliable epidemiological modeling an urgent necessity. Unfortunately, most of the existing models are either too fine-grained to be efficient or too coarse-grained to be reliable. Here we propose a computationally efficient hybrid approach that uses SIR model for individual cities which are in turn coupled via empirical transportation networks that facilitate migration among them. The treatment presented here differs from existing models in two crucial ways: first, self-consistent determination of coupling parameters so as to maintain the populations of individual cities, and second, the incorporation of distance dependent temporal delays in migration. We apply our model to Indian aviation as well as railway networks taking into account populations of more than 300 cities. Our results project that through the domestic transportation, the significant population is poised to be exposed within 90 days of the onset of epidem...","Since its emergence and detection in Wuhan, China in late 2019, the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has spread to nearly every country around the world, resulting in hundreds of thousands of infections to date. The virus was first detected in the Pacific Northwest region of the United States in January, 2020, with subsequent COVID-19 outbreaks detected in all 50 states by early March. To uncover the sources of SARS-CoV-2 introductions and patterns of spread within the U.S., we sequenced nine viral genomes from early reported COVID-19 patients in Connecticut. Our phylogenetic analysis places the majority of these genomes with viruses sequenced from Washington state. By coupling our genomic data with domestic and international travel patterns, we show that early SARS-CoV-2 transmission in Connecticut was likely driven by domestic introductions. Moreover, the risk of domestic importation to Connecticut exceeded that of international importation by mid-March regardless of our estimated impact...","The first cases of COVID-19 in France were detected on January 24, 2020. The number of screening tests carried out and the methodology used to target the patients tested do not allow for a direct computation of the actual number of cases and the mortality rate. In this note, we develop a 'mechanistic-statistical' approach coupling a SIR ODE model describing the unobserved epidemiological dynamics, a probabilistic model describing the data acquisition process and a statistical inference method. The objective of this model is not to make forecasts but to estimate the actual number of people infected with COVID-19 during the observation window in France and to deduce the mortality rate associated with the epidemic. Main results. The actual number of infected cases in France is probably much higher than the observations: we find here a factor x15 (95%-CI: 4-33), which leads to a 5.2/1000 mortality rate (95%-CI: 1.5/1000-11.7/1000) at the end of the observation period. We find a R0 of 4.8, ...","Abstract Due to serotype variations among different avian infectious bronchitis viruses isolated in Tunisia since 2000, protection of chicks, especially broiler flocks, with Mass H120 vaccine often fails. Therefore, association of CR88 (793B type) with H120 vaccines was used for better response. Challenge experiments were then conducted to evaluate tracheal and renal cross-protection in chickens immunized via nasal and eye drops. Conferred protection was measured by clinical signs and macroscopic lesions observed, based on scores attributed according to their severities. The results showed a low protection conferred by H120 alone, as vaccination did not reduce tracheal and kidney lesions (70% scored as 3) after TN20/00 virus challenge, which also led to 10% mortality. Conversely, the challenge results indicated that the combination of the 2 strains (H120/CR88) allow high protection. Based on the results of the challenge experiments, a vaccination protocol coupling CR88 to H120 was appl...","The sudden outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2002 prompted the establishment of a global scientific network subsuming most of the traditional rivalries in the competitive field of virology. Within months of the SARS outbreak, collaborative work revealed the identity of the disastrous pathogen as SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV). However, although the rapid identification of the agent represented an important breakthrough, our understanding of the deadly virus remains limited. Detailed biological knowledge is crucial for the development of effective countermeasures, diagnostic tests, vaccines and antiviral drugs against the SARS-CoV. This article reviews the present state of molecular knowledge about SARS-CoV, from the aspects of comparative genomics, molecular biology of viral genes, evolution, and epidemiology, and describes the diagnostic tests and the anti-viral drugs derived so far based on the available molecular information.","BACKGROUND: Coronavirus can cross the species barrier and infect humans with a severe respiratory syndrome. SARS-CoV-2 with potential origin of bat is still circulating in China. In this study, a prediction model is proposed to evaluate the infection risk of non-human-origin coronavirus for early warning. METHODS: The spike protein sequences of 2666 coronaviruses were collected from 2019 Novel Coronavirus Resource (2019nCoVR) Database of China National Genomics Data Center on Jan 29, 2020. A total of 507 human-origin viruses were regarded as positive samples, whereas 2159 non-human-origin viruses were regarded as negative. To capture the key information of the spike protein, three feature encoding algorithms (amino acid composition, AAC; parallel correlation-based pseudo-amino-acid composition, PC-PseAAC and G-gap dipeptide composition, GGAP) were used to train 41 random forest models. The optimal feature with the best performance was identified by the multidimensional scaling method, ...","Abstract Porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus (PEDV), belongs to the genus Alphacoronavirus in the family Coronaviridae and causes severe diarrhoea, vomiting, dehydration and high mortality in seronegative newborn piglets. Thus, a precise and rapid diagnosis of PEDV infection is important for the application of control measures to limit viral dissemination. In this investigation, a monoclonal antibodies (MAbs)-based competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for detecting antibodies against PEDV was developed and validated. The diagnostic performance of the test was evaluated by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis using a panel of 829 known sera collected from different commercial pig farms, with or without a history of PED presence and from experimentally infected pigs. The competitive ELISA showed excellent diagnostic performance and discriminatory power with high sensitivity (Se) and specificity (Sp) values (Se = 96.5%, 95% IC 94.1\u201398.1; Sp = 98.2%, 95% IC 96.3\u20139...","Countries across the world observed dramatic rises in COVID-19 cases and deaths in March 2020. In the United States, delays in the availability of diagnostic testing have prompted questions about the extent of unobserved community transmission. Using a simulation model informed by reported cases and deaths, we estimated that tens of thousands of people (median: \u200b22,876, 95% posterior predictive interval: 7,451 - 53,044) were infected by the time a national emergency was declared. Our results also indicate that fewer than 10% of locally acquired, symptomatic infections in the US were detected throughout much of late February. These results point to the need for immediate, large-scale efforts to mitigate the impacts of SARS-CoV-2 on the US.","During the current COVID-19 pandemic, testing kit and RNA extraction kit availability has become a major limiting factor in the ability to determine patient disease status and accurately quantify prevalence. Current testing strategies rely on individual tests of cases matching restrictive diagnostic criteria to detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA, limiting testing of asymptomatic and mild cases. Testing these individuals is one effective way to understand and reduce the spread of COVID-19. Here, we develop a pooled testing strategy to identify these low-risk individuals. Drawing on the well-studied group testing literature, modeling suggests practical changes to testing protocols which can reduce test costs and stretch a limited test kit supply. When most tests are negative, pooling reduces the total number of tests up to four-fold at 2% prevalence and eight-fold at 0.5% prevalence. At current SARS-CoV-2 prevalence, randomized group testing optimized per country could double the number of tested ind...","BACKGROUND: Infectious diseases emerge frequently in China, partly because of its large and highly mobile population. Therefore, a rapid and cost-effective pathogen screening method with broad coverage is required for prevention and control of infectious diseases. The availability of a large number of microbial genome sequences generated by conventional Sanger sequencing and next generation sequencing has enabled the development of a high-throughput high-density microarray platform for rapid large-scale screening of vertebrate pathogens. METHODS: An easy operating pathogen microarray (EOPM) was designed to detect almost all known pathogens and related species based on their genomic sequences. For effective identification of pathogens from EOPM data, a statistical enrichment algorithm has been proposed, and further implemented in a user-friendly web-based interface. RESULTS: Using multiple probes designed to specifically detect a microbial genus or species, EOPM can correctly identify k...","AbstractDuring its first month, the recently emerged 2019 Wuhan novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) has already infected many thousands of people in mainland China and worldwide and took hundreds of lives. However, the swiftly spreading virus also caused an unprecedentedly rapid response from the research community facing the unknown health challenge of potentially enormous proportions. Unfortunately, the experimental research to understand the molecular mechanisms behind the viral infection and to design a vaccine or antivirals is costly and takes months to develop. To expedite the advancement of our knowledge we leverage the data about the related coronaviruses that is readily available in public databases, and integrate these data into a single computational pipeline. As a result, we provide a comprehensive structural genomics and interactomics road-maps of 2019-nCoV and use these information to infer the possible functional differences and similarities with the related SARS coronavirus. ...","","As of March 5, 2020, there has been sustained local transmission of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Hong Kong, Singapore, and Japan.1 Containment strategies seem to have prevented smaller transmission chains from amplifying into widespread community transmission. The health systems in these locations have generally been able to adapt,2 , 3 but their resilience could be affected if the COVID-19 epidemic continues for many more months and increasing numbers of people require services. We outline some of the core dimensions of these resilient health systems4 and their responses to the COVID-19 epidemic. First, after variable periods of adaptation, the three locations took actions to manage the outbreak of a new pathogen. Surveillance systems were readjusted to identify potential cases while public health staff identified their contacts. National laboratory networks developed diagnostic tests once the COVID-19 genetic sequences were published5 and laboratory testing capacity was inc...","BACKGROUND Limited data exist on how SARS-CoV-2 enters and spreads in the general population. METHODS We used two strategies for SARS-CoV-2 testing: targeted testing of high-risk individuals (n=4,551) and a population screening (n=5,502). We sequenced SARS-CoV-2 from 340 individuals. RESULTS On March 22 2020, 528 had tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in the targeted testing (11.6%) and 50 in the population screening (0.9%); approximately 0.2% of the Icelandic population. Large fractions of positives had travelled outside Iceland (38.4% and 34.0%). Fewer under 10 years old were positive than those older: 2.8% vs. 12.3% for targeted testing (P=1.6e-9) and 0.0% vs. 1.0% for population screening (P=0.031). Fewer females were positive in the targeted testing than males (9.5% vs. 14.6%, P=6.8e-9). SARS-CoV-2 came from eight clades, seven A clades and one B clade. The clade composition differed between the testing groups and changed with time. In the early targeted testing, 65.0% of clades were ...","Background: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a virus that causes severe respiratory illness in humans, which eventually results in the current outbreak of novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) around the world. The research community is interested to know what are the hotspots in coronavirus (CoV) research and how much is known about COVID-19. This study aimed to evaluate the characteristics of publications involving coronaviruses as well as COVID-19 by using a topic modeling analysis. Methods: We extracted all abstracts and retained the most informative words from the COVID-19 Open Research Dataset, which contains all the 35,092 pieces of coronavirus related literature published up to March 20, 2020. Using Latent Dirichlet Allocation modeling, we trained an eight-topic model from the corpus. We then analyzed the semantic relationships between topics and compared the topic distribution between COVID-19 and other CoV infections. Results: Eight topics emerge...","Public health preparedness requires effective surveillance of and rapid response to infectious disease outbreaks. Inclusion of research activities within the outbreak setting provides important opportunities to maximize limited resources, to enhance gains in scientific knowledge, and ultimately to increase levels of preparedness. With rapid advances in laboratory technologies, banking and analysis of human genomic specimens can be conducted as part of public health investigations, enabling valuable research well into the future.","BACKGROUND: Coronaviruses (CoVs) are large ribonucleic acid (RNA) viruses causing primarily respiratory disease in humans. A novel human coronavirus, subsequently named middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), was first reported in Saudi Arabia in September of 2012. With increasing numbers of infections and deaths from MERS-CoV, development of a rapid and reliable kit was crucial to prevent further spread of MERS-CoV. OBJECTIVES: In this study, we present two real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) assays for in-house rapid and sensitive diagnostic testing of MERS-CoV, detecting the regions upstream of the envelope gene (upE) and open reading frame (ORF) 1b, respectively, for initial screening and final confirmation of MERS-CoV infection, as recommended by the world health organization (WHO). MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this experimental study, acquiring patient samples was difficult; thus, according to WHO recommendations and standard protocol...","To control the spread of Corona Virus Disease (COVID-19), screening large numbers of suspected cases for appropriate quarantine and treatment is a priority. Pathogenic laboratory testing is the diagnostic gold standard but it is time consuming with significant false negative results. Fast and accurate diagnostic methods are urgently needed to combat the disease. Based on COVID-19 radiographical changes in CT images, we aimed to develop a deep learning method that could extract COVID-19's graphical features in order to provide a clinical diagnosis ahead of the pathogenic test, thus saving critical time for disease control. Methods:We collected 1,119 CT images of pathogen-confirmed COVID-19 cases along with those previously diagnosed with typical viral pneumonia. We modified the Inception transfer-learning model to establish the algorithm, followed by internal and external validation. Results: The internal validation achieved a total accuracy of 89.5% with specificity of 0.88 and sensiti...","Since the first report of COVID-19 from Wuhan China, the virus has rapidly spread across the globe now presently reported in 177 countries with positive cases crossing 400 thousand and rising. In the current study, prediction is made for highly infected countries by a simple and novel method using only cumulative positive cases reported. The rate of infection per week (R_w) coefficient delineated three phases for the current COVID-19 pandemic. All the countries under study have passed Phase 1 and are currently in Phase 2 except for South Korea which is in Phase 3. Early detection with rapid and large-scale testing helps in controlling the COVID-19 pandemic. Staying in Phase 2 for longer period would lead to increase in COVID-19 positive cases.","The complete genome of a novel coronavirus was sequenced directly from the cloacal swab of a Canada goose that perished in a die-off of Canada and Snow geese in Cambridge Bay, Nunavut, Canada. Comparative genomics and phylogenetic analysis indicate it is a new species of Gammacoronavirus, as it falls below the threshold of 90% amino acid similarity in the protein domains used to demarcate Coronaviridae. Additional features that distinguish the genome of Canada goose coronavirus include 6 novel ORFs, a partial duplication of the 4 gene and a presumptive change in the proteolytic processing of polyproteins 1a and 1ab.","Our understanding of human disease and potential therapeutics is improving rapidly. In order to take advantage of these developments it is important to be able to identify disease markers. Many new high-throughput genomics and proteomics technologies are being implemented to identify candidate disease markers. These technologies include protein microarrays, next-generation DNA sequencing and mass spectrometry platforms. Such methods are particularly important for elucidating the repertoire of molecular markers in the genome, transcriptome, proteome and metabolome of patients with diseases such as cancer, autoimmune diseases, and viral infections, resulting from the disruption of many biological pathways. These new technologies have identified many potential disease markers. These markers are expected to be valuable to achieve the promise of truly personalized medicine.","ABSTRACTSevere Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 is rapidly spreading around the world. There is no existing vaccine or proven drug to prevent infections and stop virus proliferation. Although this virus is similar to human and animal SARS- and MERS-CoVs the detailed information about SARS-CoV-2 proteins structures and functions is urgently needed to rapidly develop effective vaccines, antibodies and antivirals. We applied high-throughput protein production and structure determination pipeline at the Center for Structural Genomics of Infectious Diseases to produce SARS-CoV-2 proteins and structures. Here we report the high-resolution crystal structure of endoribonuclease Nsp15/NendoU from SARS-CoV-2 \u2013 a virus causing current world-wide epidemics. We compare this structure with previously reported models of Nsp15 from SARS and MERS coronaviruses.","A newly identified novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) is causing pneumonia-associated respiratory syndrome across the world. Epidemiology, genomics, and pathogenesis of the SARS-CoV-2 show high homology with that of SARS-CoV. Current efforts are focusing on development of specific antiviral drugs. Therapeutic neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) against SARS-CoV-2 will be greatly important therapeutic agents for the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Herein, the host immune responses against SARS-CoV discussed in this review provide implications for developing NAbs and understanding clinical interventions against SARS-CoV-2. Further, we describe the benefits, challenges and considerations of NAbs against SARS-CoV-2. Although many challenges exist, NAbs still offer a therapeutic option to control the current pandemic and the possible re-emergence of the virus in the future, and their development therefore remains a high priority.","Abstract Analyses of turkey coronavirus (TCoV), an enteric disease virus that is highly similar to infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) an upper-respiratory tract disease virus in chickens, were conducted to determine the adaptive potential, and genetic changes associated with emergence of this group 3 coronavirus. Strains of TCoV that were pathogenic in poults and nonpathogenic in chickens did not adapt to cause disease in chickens. Comparative genomics revealed two recombination sites that replaced the spike gene in IBV with an unidentified sequence likely from another coronavirus, resulting in cross-species transmission and a pathogenicity shift. Following emergence in turkeys, TCoV diverged to different serotypes through the accumulation of mutations within spike. This is the first evidence that recombination can directly lead to the emergence of new coronaviruses and new coronaviral diseases, emphasizing the importance of limiting exposure to reservoirs of coronaviruses that can serv...","Summary The Zika epidemic in the Americas has challenged surveillance and control. As the epidemic appears to be waning, it is unclear whether transmission is still ongoing, which is exacerbated by discrepancies in reporting. To uncover locations with lingering outbreaks, we investigated travel-associated Zika cases to identify transmission not captured by reporting. We uncovered an unreported outbreak in Cuba during 2017, a year after peak transmission in neighboring islands. By sequencing Zika virus, we show that the establishment of the virus was delayed by a year and that the ensuing outbreak was sparked by long-lived lineages of Zika virus from other Caribbean islands. Our data suggest that, although mosquito control in Cuba may initially have been effective at mitigating Zika virus transmission, such measures need to be maintained to be effective. Our study highlights how Zika virus may still be \u201csilently\u201d spreading and provides a framework for understanding outbreak dynamics. Vi...","The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic emerged in Wuhan, China, spread nationwide and then onto half a dozen other countries between December 2019 and early 2020. The implementation of unprecedented strict quarantine measures in China has kept a large number of people in isolation and affected many aspects of people\u2019s lives. It has also triggered a wide variety of psychological problems, such as panic disorder, anxiety and depression. This study is the first nationwide large-scale survey of psychological distress in the general population of China during the COVID-19 epidemic.","The world was shocked in early 2003 when a pandemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) was imminent. The outbreak of this novel disease, caused by a novel coronavirus (the SARS-coronavirus), hit hardest in the Asian Pacific region, though eventually it spread to five continents. The speed of the spread of the SARS epidemic was unprecedented due to the highly efficient intercontinental transportation. An international collaborative effort through the World Health Organization (WHO) has helped to identify the aetiological agent about 1 month after the onset of the epidemic. The power of molecular biology and bioinformatics has enabled the complete decoding of the viral genome within weeks. Over 1000 publications on the phylogeny, epidemiology, genomics, laboratory diagnostics, antiviral, immunization, pathogenesis, clinical disease, and management accumulated within just 1 year. Although the exact animal reservoir of virus and how it evolved into a human pathogen are still obscu...","Abstract Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a newly emerging infectious disease caused by a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV), which has overwhelmed more than 30 countries claiming nearly 8400 cases with over 800 fatalities. Thanks to the unprecedented international collaboration, the whole-genomes of SARS-CoVs were successfully deciphered shortly after the identification of the causative pathogen for outbreak of SARS in southern China, in 2003. Hitherto, the SARS-CoV, as a viral paradigm of emerging infectious entities, has been extensively studied that has ranged from epidemiology, molecular virology/immunology to structural genomics. Also, several lines of breakthroughs have been record-brokenly obtained, that included the finding of ACE2, a functional receptor for the SARS-CoV, solution of the 3CLpro structure, a first crystal structure of SARS-related macromolecules, revealing of bats as natural reservoirs for SARS-like viruses and the possible involvement of civet cats in the...","The apparent early success in China's large-scale intervention to control the COVID-19 epidemic has led to interest in whether other countries can replicate it as well as concerns about a resurgence of the epidemic if or when China relaxes the interventions. In this paper we look at the impact of a single short-term intervention on an epidemic. We see that if an intervention cannot be sustained long-term, it has the greatest impact if it is imposed once infection levels have become large enough that there is an appreciable number of infections present. For minimising the total number infected it should start close to the peak so that there is no rebound once the intervention is stopped, while to minimise the peak prevalence, it should start earlier, allowing two peaks of comparable size rather than one very large peak. In populations with distinct subgroups, synchronized interventions are less effective than targeting the interventions in each sub-population separately. We do not attem...","Due to the limitation of rapid development of specific antiviral drug or vaccine for novel emerging viruses, an accurate and rapid diagnosis is a key to manage the virus spread. We developed an efficient and rapid method with high specificity for the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), based on one-pot reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (one-pot RT-LAMP). A set of six LAMP primers [F3, B3, FIP, BIP, LF (Loop-F), and LB (Loop-B)] were designed using the sequence of nucleocapsid (N) gene with optimized RT-LAMP enzyme conditions: 100 U M-MLV RTase and 4 U Bst polymerase, implying that the reaction was able to detect four infectious viral genome copies of MERS-CoV within a 60 min reaction time period. Significantly, EvaGreen dye has better signal read-out properties in one-pot RT-LAMP reaction and is more compatible with DNA polymerase than SYBR green I. Isothermally amplified specific N genes were further evaluated using field-deployable micr...","Novel Corona virus (COVID-19 or 2019-nCoV) is an emerging global health concern that requires a rapid diagnostic test. Quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) is currently the standard for COVID-19 detection; however, Reverse Transcription Loop-Mediated Isothermal Amplification (RT-LAMP) may allow for faster and cheaper field based testing at point-of-risk. The objective of this study was to develop a rapid screening diagnostic test that could be completed in under 30 minutes. Simulated patient samples were generated by spiking serum, urine, saliva, oropharyngeal swabs, and nasopharyngeal swabs with a portion of the COVID-19 nucleic sequence. The samples were tested using RT-LAMP as well as by conventional qRT-PCR. Specificity of the RT-LAMP was evaluated by also testing against other related coronaviruses. RT-LAMP specifically detected COVID-19 in simulated patient samples. This test was performed in under 30 minutes. This approach could be used for monitoring of exposed indi...","In the past twenty years, numerous novel zoonotic viral agents with pandemic potential have emerged in China, such as the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus and, more recently, the avian-origin influenza A/H7N9 virus, which have caused outbreaks among humans with high morbidity and mortality. In addition, several emerging and re-emerging viral pathogens have also been imported into China from travelers, e.g. the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus and Zika virus (ZIKV). Herein, we review these emerging viral pathogens in China and focus on how surveillance by pathogen genomics has been employed to discover and annotate novel pathogenic agents, identify natural reservoirs, monitor the transmission events and delineate their evolution and adaption to the human host. We also highlight the application of genomic sequencing in the recent Ebola epidemics in Western Africa. In summary, genomic sequencing has become a standard research tool in the field of eme...","Currently, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2, formerly known as 2019-nCoV, the causative pathogen of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)) has rapidly spread across China and around the world, causing an outbreak of acute infectious pneumonia. No specific anti-virus drugs or vaccines are available for the treatment of this sudden and lethal disease. The supportive care and non-specific treatment to ameliorate the symptoms of the patient are the only options currently. At the top of these conventional therapies, greater than 85% of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients in China are receiving Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) treatment. In this article, relevant published literatures are thoroughly reviewed and current applications of TCM in the treatment of COVID-19 patients are analyzed. Due to the homology in epidemiology, genomics, and pathogenesis of the SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, and the widely use of TCM in the treatment of SARS-CoV, the clinical evidence showing th...","A symptom-based mass screening and testing intervention (MSTI) can identify a large fraction of infected individuals during an infectious disease outbreak. China is currently using this strategy for the COVID-19 outbreak. However, MSTI might lead to increased transmission if not properly implemented. We investigate under which conditions MSTI is beneficial.","Social mixing patterns are crucial in driving transmission of infectious diseases and informing public health interventions to contain their spread. Age-specific social mixing is often inferred from surveys of self-recorded contacts which by design often have a very limited number of participants. In addition, such surveys are rare, so public health interventions are often evaluated by considering only one such study. Here we report detailed population contact patterns for United Kingdom based self-reported contact data from over 36,000 volunteers that participated in the massive citizen science project BBC Pandemic. The amount of data collected allows us generate fine-scale age-specific population contact matrices by context (home, work, school, other) and type (conversational or physical) of contact that took place. These matrices are highly relevant for informing prevention and control of new outbreaks, and evaluating strategies that reduce the amount of mixing in the population (su...","Before the lock-down of Wuhan/Hubei/China, on January 23rd 2020, a large number of individuals infected by COVID-19 moved from the epicenter Wuhan and the Hubei province due to the Spring Festival, resulting in an epidemic in the other provinces including the Shaanxi province. The epidemic scale in Shaanxi was comparatively small and with half of cases being imported from the epicenter. Based on the complete epidemic data including the symptom onset time and transmission chains, we calculate the control reproduction number (1.48-1.69) in Xian. We could also compute the time transition, for each imported or local case, from the latent, to infected, to hospitalized compartment, as well as the effective reproduction number. This calculation enables us to revise our early deterministic transmission model to a stochastic discrete epidemic model with case importation and parameterize it. Our model-based analyses reveal that the newly generated infections decay to zero quickly; the cumulative...","The emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in 2002 and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in 2012 has generated enormous interest in the biodiversity, genomics and cross-species transmission potential of coronaviruses, especially those from bats, the second most speciose order of mammals. Herein, we identified a novel coronavirus, provisionally designated Rousettus bat coronavirus GCCDC1 (Ro-BatCoV GCCDC1), in the rectal swab samples of Rousettus leschenaulti bats by using pan-coronavirus RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing. Although the virus is similar to Rousettus bat coronavirus HKU9 (Ro-BatCoV HKU9) in genome characteristics, it is sufficiently distinct to be classified as a new species according to the criteria defined by the International Committee of Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV). More striking was that Ro-BatCoV GCCDC1 contained a unique gene integrated into the 3\u2019-end of the genome that has no homologs in any known coronaviru...","Abstract Human coronavirus, hCoV-19, is highly pathogenic with severe pneumonia associated with rapid virus replication. Arising in Wuhan China December 2019, the current COVID-19 epidemic has rapidly grown with person-to-person infection expanding to become a global health emergency now on pandemic scale. In mitigation of this current COVID-19 pandemic, according to Anderson et al. 2020 [1], governments will not be able to minimise both deaths from COVID-19 and the economic impact of viral spread. Keeping mortality as low as possible will be the highest priority for individuals; hence governments must put in place measures to ameliorate the inevitable economic downturn. The current global picture shows small chains of transmission in many countries and large chains resulting in extensive spread in a few countries, such as Italy, Iran, South Korea, and Japan. Most countries are likely to have spread of COVID-19, at least in the early stages, before any mitigation measures have an impac...","We present here the design of the Mechanical Ventilator Milano (MVM), a novel mechan- ical ventilator designed for mass scale production in response to the COVID-19 pandemics, to compensate for the dramatic shortage of such ventilators in many countries. This venti- lator is an electro-mechanical equivalent of the old, reliable Manley Ventilator. Our design is optimized to permit large sale production in short time and at a limited cost, relying on off-the-shelf components, readily available worldwide from hardware suppliers. Operation of the MVM requires only a source of compressed oxygen (or compressed medical air) and electrical power. The MVM control and monitoring unit can be connected and networked via WiFi so that no additional electrical connections are necessary other than the connection to the electrical power. At this stage the MVM is not a certified medical device. Construction of the first proto- types is starting with a team of engineers, scientists and computing experts....","Abstract Background An ongoing epidemic of respiratory diseases caused by a novel coronavirus (COVID 2019, SARS-CoV2) started in Wuhan, Hubei, in China at the end of December 2019. The French government decided to repatriate the 337 French nationals living in Wuhan and place them in quarantine in their home country. We decided to test them all for SARS-Cov2 twice in order to reduce anxiety among the population and decision-makers. Methods We investigated the presence of SARS-CoV-19 in asymptomatic carriers by testing all repatriated patients within the first 24 h of their arrival in France and at day 5. Viral RNA was extracted from pooled nasal and oropharyngeal swab fluids or sputum in the absence of nasal/oropharyngeal swabs. Detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA was then carried out using several real-time reverse transcription (RT)-PCR assays. Results We tested 337 passengers at day 0 and day 5. All the tests for SARS-CoV2 were negative. By optimising the sampling process, sending samples se...","Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) was the first natural disaster that challenged the Chinese people at the beginning of the twenty-first century. It was caused by a novel animal coronavirus, never recognized or characterized before. This SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) exploited opportunities provided by \u2018wet markets\u2019 in southern China to adapt to the palm civet and human. Under the positive selection pressure of human host, certain mutated lineages of the virus became readily transmissible between humans and thus caused the epidemic of 2002\u20132003. This review will provide first-hand information, particularly from Guangdong, China, about the initial epidemiology, the identification of the aetiological agent of the disease, the molecular evolution study of the virus, the finding of SARS-like CoV in horseshoe bats and the mechanistic analysis for the cross-host tropism transition. The substantial scientific contributions made by the Chinese scientists towards understanding the virus an...","Background: False negative results of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid detection pose threats to COVID-19 patients and medical workers alike. Objective: To develop multivariate models to determine clinical characteristics that contribute to false negative results of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid detection, and use them to predict false negative results as well as time windows for testing positive. Design: Retrospective Cohort Study (Ethics number of Tongji Hospital: No. IRBID: TJ-20200320) Setting: A database of outpatients in Tongji Hospital (University Hospital) from 15 January 2020 to 19 February 2020. Patients: 1,324 outpatients with COVID-19 Measurements: Clinical information on CT imaging reports, blood routine tests, and clinic symptoms were collected. A multivariate logistic regression was used to explain and predict false negative testing results of SARS-CoV-2 detection. A multivariate accelerated failure model was used to analyze and predict delayed time windows for testing positive. Result...","Abstract The development of rapid, accurate, and sensitive diagnostic methods for detecting pathogens is the basis for treating, controlling, and eradicating infectious diseases of veterinary importance. Scientific and technological advancements have revolutionized the field of veterinary diagnostics. Genome sequencing has allowed efficient, sensitive, and specific diagnostic assays to be developed based on the detection of nucleic acids. The integration of advances in biochemistry, proteomics, engineering, and medicine offers enormous potential for the rapid and accurate diagnosis of viral, microbial, genetic, and metabolic disease. In the future, polymerase chain reaction assays, microarray testing, genomic analysis, and metabolic profiling will be accomplished in a rapid, portable, sensitive, and cost-efficient manner.","Background The outbreak of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) started in the city of Wuhan, China, with a period of rapid initial spread. Transmission on a regional and then national scale was promoted by intense travel during the holiday period of the Chinese New Year. We studied the variation in transmission of COVID-19, locally in Wuhan, as well as on a larger spatial scale, among different cities and even among provinces in mainland China. Methods In addition to reported numbers of new cases, we have been able to assemble detailed contact data for some of the initial clusters of COVID-19. This enabled estimation of the serial interval for clinical cases, as well as reproduction numbers for small and large regions. Findings We estimated the average serial interval was 4.8 days. For early transmission in Wuhan, any infectious case produced as many as four new cases, transmission outside Wuhan was less intense, with reproduction numbers below two. During the rapid growth phase ...","Governments around the world are responding to the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic with unprecedented policies designed to slow the growth rate of infections. Many actions, such as closing schools and restricting populations to their homes, impose large and visible costs on society. In contrast, the benefits of these policies, in the form of infections that did not occur, cannot be directly observed and are currently understood through process-based simulations. Here, we compile new data on 936 local, regional, and national anti-contagion policies recently deployed in the ongoing pandemic across localities in China, South Korea, Iran, Italy, France, and the United States (US). We then apply reduced-form econometric methods, commonly used to measure the effect of policies on economic growth, to empirically evaluate the effect that these anti-contagion policies have had on the growth rate of infections. In the absence of any policy actions, we estimate that early infections of COVI..."],"title":["Towards a genomics-informed, real-time, global pathogen surveillance system","Is scaling-up COVID-19

This function is also known as the generalized logistic function. Moreover, the function \u03b1 E has many interesting features and it can be reduced to several useful function in physics such as Fermi-Dirac distributions [15] or running coupling constant of the four-fermion contact interaction [16] for n = 1 and the generalized Woods-Saxson nuclear potential [17] for n = 2 as well as the Starobinsky inflation potential [18] for n = \u22122. Turning to the crucial part of this section, we will derive the beta function of epidemic strength coupling with the RG technique in the following and demonstrate how COVID-19 spread underlying the RG flow description. It is well known that the evolution of the \u03b1 E (t) function is governed by the beta function. In the present work, we use t as a time of the evolution of the system instead of energy in high energy physics. The time scale in our work is related to the typical energy scale as t = ln \u00b5 0 /\u00b5 in the standard RG approach where \u00b5 0 and \u00b5 are the energy scale limit of our interested and the running energy scale, respectively. The standard beta function of \u03b1 E is defined by","In this work, we reviewed the emerging applications of protein disorder predictions in a number of biomedical fields, such as protein evolution, protein function, membrane proteins, drug discovery, drug design, analysis of disease risks and some healthcare domains. The existing work demonstrates that disorder prediction has become an indispensable tool for many research and medical problems in these fields. In order to facilitate the large-scale application of disorder prediction to big data produced in this field, we also developed a new deep learning method to predict protein disorder from one single primary sequence only, which is several magnitudes faster than existing methods and has comparable performance. The method can be a valuable tool for large-scale scanning of big genomics data for identifying disorder proteins that are relevant to many biomedical problems.","This work provides an initial large-scale structural genomics and interactomics effort towards The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.10.942136 doi: bioRxiv preprint pinpoints to the interesting targets for structural biology and hybrid methods. For instance, the whole structures of the multi-domain proteins wN and wNsp3 could be resolved by integrating individual models with the lower-resolution but whole-protein covering techniques such as cryogenic electron microscopy (CryoEM). The structure of wNsp3 is especially interesting because of the presence of the novel peptide introduced between the two structural domains of the protein.","The tailed phage of bacteria have been called the dark matter of genetics, due to their numerical dominance ($10 31 en toto). This corresponds to about 10 24 productive infections per second on a global scale. Most hostrestricted phage lineages clearly conserve sets of core proteins (especially capsid genes), but others (the broader T-even phages) do not conserve any hallmark genes. Hallmark genes, when present, are usually recognized by conserved domains within proteins, such as replication and structural proteins. Replicator strategy and gene order are also frequently conserved. Phage also tends to conserve genes that are active against other phage (i.e., DNA modification, lambda RexA, T4 rII). With the sequencing of numerous phage genomes, however, a large number of novel genes have been identified. Currently, 350 full genomes of tailed phage and 400 prophage from bacterial genomes have been sequenced. In general, large DNA viruses are tenfold overrepresented in small single-domain genes ($100 aa). Comparative genomics, especially of lactobacterial phages, suggest that most phage genomes evolve as mosaics, with sharp boundaries between genes as well as at protein domains within genes (see Figure 5 ). Recombination between lytic, temperate, and cryptic prophages appears to account for this gene and subgene domain variation. Some specific phages have mechanisms to generate specific gene diversity (such as bordetella phage using RT for surface receptor diversity), but most diversity is the product of recombination. Two broad patterns of phage variation have been observed corresponding to host-unassociated lytic and host-associated (congruent) temperate phage. In most bacterial genomes (ECOR Escherichia coli collection, cyanobacteria, B. subtilis), patterns of prophage colonization account for significant genetic distinctions between closely related host strains. The general picture for tailed phage of bacteria is that they are not the products of reduction of host genomes.","In the past decade, we have moved from a time when entire research papers were based on the sequencing of a single gene or a single bacterial operon to single manuscripts that describe entire genomes. The availability of this level of genetic information has spawned the terms functional genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and even metabonomics. These fields of study describe the large-scale applications of global gene expression profiling, protein analysis, and metabolite analysis. In each case, powerful bioinformatics tools with links to the comprehensive databases are essential to drive the process. This review focuses on the role that gene expression profiling has begun to play in clinical microbiology and discusses potentials for pathogen identification, pathogen discovery, and novel therapeutics discovery. The availability of complete microbial genomes continues to grow rapidly. Some of the more than 200 different complete pathogen genomes and the dates they became available are listed in Table 1 . Links to these and other complete microbial genomes, partial sequences, and ongoing pathogen-related genomic projects are available on the web site for The Institute for Genomic Research at http://www.tigr.org.","Matthew W. Gilmour (Diagnostic Services Manitoba, Winnipeg, Canada) discussed \"Real-time genomics for bacterial pathogen surveillance\". He considered the benefits and challenges represented by pathogen genomics to clinical and public health sectors. The speaker also underlined the potential of proteomics to facilitate the investigation of outbreaks. An integrated network coordinating the monitoring, assessment, investigation, outbreak response and recovery with standardized genomic analyses and unified laboratory workflows was envisioned.","Although sizeable efforts were made for assembling large-scale, experimentally reported drug-target networks from publicly available databases, the network data may be incomplete and some drug-protein interactions may be functional associations, instead of physical bindings. We may use computational approaches to systematically predict the drug-target interactions further [24, 69] . In addition, the collected virus-host interactions are far from complete and the quality can be influenced by multiple factors, including different experimental assays and human cell line models. We may computationally predict a new virus-host interactome for HCoVs using sequence-based and structure-based approaches [70] . The current systems pharmacology model cannot separate therapeutic antiviral effects from those predictions due to lack of detailed pharmacological effects of drug targets and unknown functional consequences of virushost interactions. Drug targets representing nodes within cellular networks are often intrinsically coupled with both therapeutic and adverse profiles [71] , as drugs can inhibit or activate protein functions (including antagonists versus agonists). Comprehensive identification of the virus-host interactome for 2019-nCoV, with specific biological effects using functional genomics assays [72, 73] , will significantly improve the accuracy of current network-based methodologies.","On the other hand, another study compared the effectiveness of conservative nonsurgical treatment with core decompression with or without DC electrical stimulation. 184 The clinical symptom scores and the rate of progression to arthroplasty were best in the group with core decompression and DC electrical stimulation and worst in the nonoperative group. Capacitive coupling can be performed with or without core decompression and grafting. Forty patients with stage 1 to 3 osteonecrosis underwent core decompression and grafting; half of the patients wore active capacitive coupling units with electrodes over the femoral head for 6 months. The control group was 55 patients with osteonecrosis who were treated conservatively. Follow-ups at 2 and 4 years showed that core decompression with or without capacitive coupling provided a better clinical and radiologic outcome than did conservative treatment. Capacitive coupling did not improve the results further when used with core decompression and grafting.","structural genomics initiatives focusing on determining the 3D structures of proteins on a genome scale [34] and specific efforts on rapid structural characterization of proteins in emerging viruses [35] [36] [37] [38] , multiple works have used comparative modeling to predict the structures of protein-protein interaction complexes [39] [40] [41] , facilitating structure-based drug discovery [33, 42, 43] , inferring protein functions [44] , determining the macromolecular interaction network [45] [46] [47] , and providing molecular insights into viral evolution [48] [49] [50] .","is the (which was not peer-reviewed) The copyright holder for this preprint . https: //doi.org/10.1101 //doi.org/10. /2020 using the same pure recombinant antigen and coupling condition (supplementary figure S1), the 206 detection specificity difference is more likely linked to intrinsic antibody traits and concentration 207 differences in the patients' blood. 208 We noted that four patients with clinical symptoms less than four days were simultaneously detected 209 by both IgM and IgG testing. A close examination of their medical record reveals that all of them had 210 previous contact with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 individuals in at least 16 days ago, pointing to the 211 possibility that they were probably asymptomatically infected by SARS-CoV-2 for certain time already. 212 Fourteen cases (17.7%) from 79 SARS-CoV-2 confirmed patients were not identified by our serological 213 testing method (both the IgM and IgG manner). Interestingly, of them, seven people were younger 214 than 8-year-old or over 70-year-old. These people generally have low immunity in which a clinical 215 symptom may occur rapidly upon exposure to the SARS-CoV-2, and we speculate that the antibodies 216 in these people may not develop well yet when testing. More investigations are warranted to 217 uncover the real situations. When comparing the detection rates in different age groups by our 218 method, we noted that a significantly lower detection rate in both lgM and lgG testing manner for the 219 individual group younger than 18 years old was observed compared to that of people aging from 18 to 220 65. An in-depth look at the days after onset for these 12 individuals younger than 18-years-old, the 221 symptom onset time for all the 12 people are less than 14 days with six people even less seven days 222 (Supplementary Table S2 ). The lower detection rate for these 12 people younger than 18-years-old 223 was likely associated with no or less production of antibodies in them yet when we collected the 224 serums.","In December 2019, an outbreak of a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) was reported in Wuhan, China (1) . SARS-CoV-2 rapidly spread to other regions of China along with more than 150 other countries, at a speed that is much higher than the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) (2) . Despite the lower mortality rate of SARS-CoV-2 compared with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the scale of the SARS-CoV-2 contagion has already caused more casualties than either of the previous outbreaks. Early research into SARS-CoV-2 has mostly described its epidemiological features (1, 3) , case reports (4), structural characterizations (5), basic genomics features (6, 7) , etc.","In many ways, virology and viral forensics are still in their infancy. We know very little about the vast spectrum of viruses in nature. Although we should continue to pursue studies on known human pathogens, we need to broaden our efforts in virus isolation, viral genomics, and bioinformatics. A comprehensive database of viral sequences is critical for rapid identification of emerging viral pathogens and new diagnostic platforms, such as oligonucleotide 55 arrays. In addition to viral genomics, global proteomic analysis of viral disease processes may uncover molecular signatures that can be used to implicate a particular etiologic agent or class of agents, even in the absence of viral nucleic acid or serology. The global eradication of smallpox ranks as one of humankind' s greatest accomplishments. In the wake of this triumph, many viral challenges remain. HIV, hepatitis B and C, influenza, dengue, rotavirus, and many other viral diseases continue to affect tens of millions. It is distressing that in the face of these undeniable challenges we are back to discussing the deliberate use of existing or modified viruses for harm, not good.","The overall impact of these interventions is qualitatively similar to that of the singlepopulation model. We find that if the epidemics in the sub-populations are not synchronous (as occurs if the coupling is small [2, 4] ) then interventions acting at different times for each sub-population are substantially more effective than interventions responding to a global threshold. If the coupling is larger so that epidemics are synchronized, then there is no distinction between these strategies.","Critics and skeptics of microarray technology argue that genome scale research is largely non-hypothesisdriven science. However, advocates view the technology as positive, because it has already revealed the functions of genes that may have been missed by other conventional approaches and will likely continue to do so. The need for genome-wide approaches to gene expression experiments becomes apparent when one considers that the genome sequence of E. coli has been in hand for more than 6 years, but the microbe still contains over 1,000 genes of unknown function. The role of such genes will not be discovered without application of functional genomic technologies combined with creative experiments. Functional genomics allows researchers to make new and unexpected links between the functions of unrelated and hitherto uncharacterized genes and to put forth hypotheses that can be sub-sequently tested by more traditional methods.","Unlike other biomarkers, such as antibodies or non-genetic molecules originating from pathogens, NA can be chemically amplified, enabling direct detection of low numbers of pathogens (down to single organisms). Hence tests targeting NA tend to be exceptionally sensitive. NA-based reagents (e.g., primers) for NA testing can also be produced synthetically rapidly and on a large scale; DNA-based molecules, in particular, are highly stable, therefore, do not require a cold-chain for storage, making it especially suitable for PoN testing. 1 Ability to produce NA quickly also increases the speed of development and deployment of new test kits to health systems, providing much needed diagnostic capabilities for the detection of novel pathogens (such as SARS-CoV-2). Despite the massive advantages, on-site testing of NA has been limited.","The ongoing pandemic of SARS-CoV-2 is the first global public health emergency for which next-generation sequencing technologies have been employed at such scale. This has led to a high density sampling that is unprecedented for both the geographic extent of virus spread and the evolutionary space explored by the virus since its emergence in China. Since the pandemic is currently only a few months old, no epidemiologically relevant lineages from the beginning of the epidemics are expected to die out anytime soon. Indeed, although the virus genetic diversity is gradually increasing, particular genomic variants continue to be repeatedly sequenced at different time points and geographical locations. It provides the means of tracking virus spread and evolution across time and space from the beginning of the epidemics using the methods of computational genomics and molecular epidemiology, and make conclusions about the potential routes of transmission.","The peptides were synthesized by a standard Fmoc/t-Bu protection strategy. After removal of Fmoc of Fmoc-rink MBHA resin by 20% Piperidine/DMF (v:v) treatment for 10 min twice, the resin was thoroughly washed by DMF, Methanol, DCM and DMF, three times each. Fmoc protective amino acid was then coupled onto the resin for 45 min at room temperature using 3-fold excess molar ratio of amino acid and 3-fold excess DIC and HOBt as coupling and additive reagents, respectively. Until Kaiser's test [25] showing to be negative, the Fmoc-deprotection and washing steps were performed again as described above. The next amino acid assembly was repeated. In case of Kaiser's test to be positive or weakly positive, a double coupling step was carried out until Kaiser's test to be negative. Otherwise, the remaining amino group after two-coupling steps was captured by 15% Ac 2 O/DCM (v:v) for 30 min at room temperature. After all amino acids were successfully assembled onto resin, the last Fmoc group was removed and the resin was rinsed thoroughly with DMF, methanol and DCM. The resin must be completely dried under airflow at room temperature before the peptide was cleaved off resin.","We acknowledge several limitations in the current study. Although 2019-nCoV/SARS-CoV-2 shared high nucleotide sequence identity with other HCoVs (Fig. 2), our predictions are not 2019-nCoV/SARS-CoV-2 specific by lack of the known host proteins on 2019-nCoV/SARS-CoV-2. We used a low binding affinity value of 10 \u03bcM as a threshold to define a physical drug\u2013target interaction. However, a stronger binding affinity threshold (e.g., 1 \u03bcM) may be a more suitable cut-off in drug discovery, although it will generate a smaller drug\u2013target network. Although sizeable efforts were made for assembling large scale, experimentally reported drug\u2013target networks from publicly available databases, the network data may be incomplete and some drug\u2013target interactions may be functional associations, instead of physical bindings. For example, Silvestrol, a natural product from the flavagline, was found to have antiviral activity against Ebola75 and Coronaviruses76. After adding its target, an RNA helicase enzyme EIF4A76, silvestrol was predicted to be significantly associated with HCoVs (Z = \u20131.24, P = 0.041) by network proximity analysis. To increase coverage of drug\u2013target networks, we may use computational approaches to systematically predict the drug-target interactions further25,26. In addition, the collected virus\u2013host interactions are far from completeness and the quality can be influenced by multiple factors, including different experimental assays and human cell line models. We may computationally predict a new virus\u2013host interactome for 2019-nCoV/SARS-CoV-2 using sequence-based and structure-based approaches77. Drug targets representing nodes within cellular networks are often intrinsically coupled with both therapeutic and adverse profiles78, as drugs can inhibit or activate protein functions (including antagonists vs. agonists). The current systems pharmacology model cannot separate therapeutic (antiviral) effects from those predictions due to lack of detailed pharmacological effects of drug targets and unknown functional consequences of virus\u2013host interactions. Comprehensive identification of the virus\u2013host interactome for 2019-nCoV/SARS-CoV-2, with specific biological effects using functional genomics assays79,80, will significantly improve the accuracy of the proposed network-based methodologies further.","In his presentation \"From genomics to new interventions for tuberculosis and leprosy\", Stewart Cole (Global Health Institute, Lausanne, Switzerland) reminded the audience about the high disease burden of tuberculosis and leprosy, which are characterized by a very low amount of genetic diversity encountered in the two corresponding pathogens, M. tuberculosis and Mycobacterium leprae. S. Cole illustrated how pioneering studies in tuberculosis genomics shed light on the biology, pathogenesis and epidemiology of TB. He also discussed how the promise of genomics for discovery of novel drug targets met unanticipated challenges. On the other hand, genome sequencing brought novel ways to rapidly discover cellular targets of old or redesigned drugs. Finally, S. Cole demonstrated the power of combining genomics and more conventional typing approaches such as MLVA to decipher the phylogeography of an old scourge, leprosy, and to demonstrate that populations of armadillos from America represent a reservoir of the disease bacillus.","We implement a weak coupling by joining the population in a linear fashion: population i is only connected to population (i \u2212 1) and (i + 1). The first and the last populations only connect to the second and the pen-ultimate population, respectively. The entries for the coupling/mixing matrix are generated as follows. On the main diagonal, the \u03b2 ii values are set to 2 + (U nif (0, 1) \u2212 0.5). Off-diagonal entries are set to U nif (0, 1)(\u03b2 * ii /10) (\u03b2 * = max i=1,2,...,N \u03b2 ii ) and represent a scaled and randomised version of the largest entry on the main diagonal. This yields an R 0 above 2, comparable to current estimates for COVID-19.","Extending the concept of subclassifying patient cohorts to the single patient level refers to as personalised medicine. During the last few years, acceptance level of the personalised medicine is sharply increased as it has been apparent that standard treatment approaches are rarely efficient across the entire patient population. Advances in high-throughput molecular assay technologies in the fields of genomics, proteomics and other \"omics\" is increasing the diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for personalised treatment. As a result, declining per-sample cost has given rise to numerous public repositories of biomolecular data. In particular, the availability of these data sets for many different diseases presents a ripe opportunity to use data-driven approaches to advance our current knowledge of disease relationships in a systematic way. The identified disease patterns can then be further investigated with regards to their diagnostic utility or help in predicting novel therapeutic targets. Medicine will focus on each individual patient. It will become intrinsically proactive and will increasingly focus on wellness rather than disease. Proactive and personalised medicine will bring fundamental changes to healthcare, taking carefully targeted preventative or therapeutic action at the earliest indications of risk or disease comorbidities.","We implement a weak coupling by joining the population in a linear fashion: population i is only connected to population (i \u2212 1) and (i + 1).

This yields an R 0 above 2, comparable to current estimates for COVID-19 [6, 7] .","Covalent coupling of HRN trimer or HRC trimer to the BIACORE CM5 chip (a dextran-coated sensor chip) surface was performed following the standard amine coupling procedure according to the manufacturer's speciWcation. BrieXy, the dextran surface of the CM5 chip was Wrst activated with 20 l N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS)/N-ethyl-N\u0408-(dimethyl-aminopropyl)-carbodiimide (EDC). HRN trimer or HRC trimer in 10 mM sodium acetate buVer (pH4.3) was injected and allowed to react to give a surface density of 420 resonance units (RU) for the HRC trimer chip and 2000 RU for the HRN chip. Remaining activated groups were then blocked by injection of 35 l ethanolamine HCl. A reference surface with the same treatment except no injection of ligand was generated at the same time and was used as background to correct instrument and buVer artifacts.","After the alchemical pathway is determined, for each window, 5000 cycles of steepest descent energy minimization were first carried out, and then 100 ps simulations in the NVT ensemble along with Langevin dynamics 29, 30 for temperature coupling was performed to heat the system to 298 K with weak position restraints of 1000 kJ/mol/nm 2 applied to the receptor and the ligand heavy atoms. The simulation system was subsequently equilibrated in an NPT ensemble for 500 ps with the position restraints still applied followed by a 4 ns unconstrained production simulation. Pressure was coupled using Parrinello-Rahman pressure coupling scheme 31 . The LINCS constraint algorithm 32 was used only on H-bonds. In all simulations, the particle mesh Ewald (PME) algorithm 33 was used for calculation of long-range electrostatic interactions. \uf044U values were sampled along the unconstrained simulation, and the free energy differences between each window were calculated by using the Bennet acceptance ratio (BAR) method 34, 35 .","What we are faced with is a newly discovered viral disease, testing drugs are selected mainly based on the past experience of such drugs treating other related diseases. Some of them only had in vitro tests. Some hasn\u2019t finished Phase II clinical trials. Large-scale clinical trials will take a long time. Therefore, the small-scale clinical trials, including Phase II clinical trials, are currently given priority to, in which case, its effect, proper dosage, the medication and adverse reaction are initially verified. Those possibly effective and relatively safe medications can be coordinated to the large-scale and multi-centre clinical trials. In this way, a bulk of repetitive trials are avoided.","The first rapid real-time assay was developed based on the most conserved region of the ORF1b gene sequence 86., 87.. A person will be confirmed to be infected by the SARS-CoV if viral RNA is detected by either the two PCR assays, two aliquots of specimen, or two sets of primers (http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/sars/specimen_collection_sars2.htm). The second generation of this test protocol can detect the existence of the virus within 10 days after the onset of fever 87., 88., 89. and provides 80% sensitivity and 100% specificity in the testing of 50 NPA samples collected from SARS patients within three days after the onset of the disease (87). To further increase the sensitivity, one-step real-time RT-PCR has been recently developed (89). Specificity of the PCR can be enhanced by coupling it with the use of an additional amplification target using the virus N gene fragment (89), which is theoretically the most abundant subgenomic mRNA produced during transcription (13). The technique provides information on viral load during anti-viral treatments in real time, so that the efficacy of the therapy can be evaluated (10). However, although the PCR assays are powerful, their performance is also technically demanding and labor intensive (10).","Cells isolated from each compartment (\"immune and endothelial enriched\", \"epithelial enriched\", \"stromal\") and subject blood were captured in droplet emulsions using a Chromium Single-Cell instrument (10x Genomics) and libraries were prepared using the 10x Genomics 3'","Reads from single cells isolated using 10x chromium were demultiplexed and then aligned to the GRCh38.p12 human reference (from 10x Genomics) using Cell Ranger (version 2.0, 10x Genomics). Cells with fewer than 500 genes detected or 1000 unique molecular identifiers (UMIs) were excluded from further analyses.","Also, the viral replicase in trans is involved in the replication of RNAs that do not encode replicase component proteins in viruses with a multipartite genome. Likewise, defective-RNAs occurring naturally or created artificially as constructed-deletion variants can be efficiently amplified by a helper virus that supplies replicase component proteins in trans. In contrast, cis-preferential function of the viral encoded proteins or a coupling between translation and replication has been reported for several viruses, including Alfalfa mosaic virus (AMV) (Neeleman and Bol, 1999; van Rossum et al., 1996) , Clover yellow mosaic virus (CYMV) (White et al., 1992) , Bovine coronavirus (Chang et al., 1994) , Cowpea mosaic virus (van Bokhoven et al., 1993) , Poliovirus (Hagino-Yamagishi and Nomoto, 1989; Johnson and Sarnow, 1991; Novak and Kirkegaard, 1994) , Turnip crinkle virus (TCV) (White et al., 1995) , Tobacco etch virus (Mahajan et al., 1996; Schaad et al., 1996) , Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) (Lewandowski and Dawson, 2000) , Tomato bushy stunt virus (TBSV) (Oster et al., 1998) , Turnip yellow mosaic virus (TYMV) (Weiland and Dreher, 1993) , and Rubella virus (Liang and Gillam, 2001) . The coupling between translation and RNA replication appears to play important roles in virus infection. However, the roles are poorly understood.","Although these are short-term models, the ever-changing nature of COVID-19 pandemic and the dynamic nature of the variables of this study -for example the development of cheaper and faster diagnostic kits -may prompt large-scale testing to become even more appealing.","Binding of mAbs to various RBDs were anaylyzed on a Biacore T100 (Biacore) at 25\u00b0C. Anti-human IgG Fc antibody (Biacore) was covalently coated to CM4 sensor chip by amine-coupling using the coupling kit (Biacore). Abs were captured onto anti-human IgG Fc surfaces at the flow rate of 10 \u00b5l/min in HBS buffer (Biacore). RBDs were injected over each flow cell at the flow rate of 30 \u00b5l /min in HBS buffer at concentrations ranging from 0.15 to 100 nM for interactions of Abs with Tor2-RBD or GD03-RBD, and 15.6 to 2000 nM for the interaction of Abs with D480A-RBD, respectively. A buffer injection served as a negative control. Upon completion of each association and dissociation cycle, surfaces were regenerated with 3 M MgCl2 solution. The association rates (ka), dissociation rate constants (kd), and affinity constants (KD) were calculated using Biacore T100 evaluation software. The goodness of each fit was based on the agreement between experimental data and the calculated fits, where the Chi2 values were below 1.0. Surface densities of Abs were optimized to minimize mass transfer. All ka, kd, KD reported here represent the means and standard errors of at least two experiments.","My background comprises microbes, immunology, genomics and bioinformatics. I took part in the work of SARS genome sequencing in the Beijing Genomics Institute et the Chinese Academy of Sciences in 2003 [9] . Now I am majoring in the study on the PAMP and TLRs. Given this, I am in general interested in the topic.","The alanine scan of the spike protein RBD of SARS-CoV1, on the other hand shows less significant penalty to the binding score upon mutation to alanine. Only six residues (Tyr436, Tyr440, Asn473, Tyr484, Thr486, and Thr487) seen to be involved in strong electrostatic coupling with ACE2 residues (indicated in Table 1 ). In addition, Gly488Ala and Gly482Ala mutations lead to 41% and 72% loss of ACE2 binding, respectively. In summary, alanine scans indicate that SARS-CoV2 has the highest number of \"effectively\" interacting residues at the ACE2 binding interface whereas the SARS-CoV1 spike forms only a few strong ACE2 connectors with a large number of \"idle\" interface residues (43% -7 out of 16) which do not affect ACE2 binding upon mutation to alanine. OC83 seems to be between the two with a The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.30.015891 doi: bioRxiv preprint maximum number of weak electrostatic interactors (43% -7 out of 16) and only two idle residues at the interface (i.e., residues Asn239 and Tyr241). ","The synthesis of the peptidic fragments 13aer was achieved from the leucine tert-butyl ester (12) in the presence of various carboxylic acids (8) via a 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide (EDC) e1-hydroxybenzotriazole (HOBt)-mediated coupling method in the presence of triethylamine (TEA) in DMF. The N-protected amino acid tert-butyl esters (13) were subsequently deprotected with trifluoroacetic acid/water (10:1) over 1 h to afford the N-protected amino acids (14aer), which were used directly in subsequent steps. 16 [21, 22] by treatment with bromoacetonitrile, followed by reduction with PtO 2 (5%), cyclization, and hydrolysis (Scheme 2). Further coupling of 16 to N,O-dimethylhydroxylamine via the EDCeHOBt method afforded the Weinreb amide 17 [21] . The Weinreb amide 17 was then coupled to benzothiazole in the presence of n-butyl lithium (n-BuLi) at \u00c078 C to furnish 18, which was then deprotected and subsequently coupled to the peptides 14 in the presence of O-benzotriazole-N,N,N 0 ,N 0 -tetramethyluroniumhexafluoro phosphate (HBTU) and DIPEA in DMF to afford the title compounds 5aer. All compounds were purified by reverse phase HPLC for the biological evaluation and characterized by 1 H NMR, 13 C NMR, and mass spectrometry. The purity of each compound exceeded 95%.","antibody-directed drug therapy The targeting of a drug to particular cells by coupling it to an antibody directed against an appropriate cell surface marker.","Better estimates could be derived from large-scale investigations, in particular, in the region of the epidemic's origin. Still, population-based testing of respiratory secretions by nucleic acid amplification testing (NAT) for 2019-nCoV would most likely underestimate the scale of the outbreak, as asymptomatic patients or patients after recovery from infection may no longer be NAT-positive. A sensitive 2019-nCoV-specific serological assay is needed to firmly assess the rate of past exposure and may help to assess herd immunity.","The single-cell suspensions of scRNA-seq samples were converted to barcoded scRNA-seq libraries using the Chromium Single Cell 5\u2032 Library, Gel Bead and Multiplex Kit, and Chip Kit (10X Genomics). The Chromium Single Cell 5\u2032 v2 Reagent (10X Genomics, 120237) kit was used to prepare single-cell RNA libraries according to the manufacturer's instructions. The FastQC software was used for quality check. The CellRanger software (version 3.1.0) was used for initial processing of the sequencing data.","Hadamard product of the two matrices gives us the matrix of the local coupling energies %&amp; = / %&amp; \u2022 %&amp; We will select as possible interacting zones sets of close by residues that show weak or frustrated interactions.","The synthesis of the title inhibitors was achieved through a coupling reaction involving two key fragments, as shown in Scheme 1. One of the key fragment intermediates (19) (20) , which were used directly in the subsequent step.","Saponification of the resulting methyl esters provided the corresponding acids. Coupling of amine 265 with acids 263 and 264, as described previously, and subsequent oxidation of the sulfides with m-chloroperbenzoic acid furnished inhibitors 258 and 259.259","We assume the existence of several metapopulation units inside a given geographical region such that for each of these the dynamics of disease is well approximated by the standard SIR model. The disease transmission among the units is due to migrating population described using a coupling term.","In an era of personalized medicine, one should not lose sight of how molecular medicine can be used to improve global health. Cheaper drugs and vaccines for all communities is an important benefit that should come from molecular-based technologies. Another would be better NATs. In this respect it is intriguing to recall how direct-to-consumer DNA testing (Chapter 5) makes effective use of the Internet. Could the Internet be one way to improve accessibility for disadvantaged communities or those in rural and remote regions? Consideration of how genomics can play a part in the bioeconomy, with its potential to generate income, improve food production and sustain a better environment, are some of the challenges now being taken up by bodies such as the OECD.","Sedation is not generally required but may be necessary in certain fractious foals. Optimal image quality is obtained by clipping the hair over the area of interest or the entire ventral abdomen if required. The abdomen should then be washed and ultrasound coupling gel applied to the skin.","Later, these authors reported a one-pot synthesis of N-alkyl carbamates starting from primary amines (Scheme 4).96 Carbamates were generated via a three-component coupling of primary amines, CO2, and an alkyl halide in the presence of cesium carbonate and TBAI in anhydrous DMF (Scheme 4 and Table 8).","were subjected to single-cell suspension preparation, 5 ' gene expression libraries construction, and 10x Genomics single-cell RNA sequencing [13] . Cellranger v2.1 pipeline (10x genomics) was utilized to demultiplex the cellular barcodes and align reads to the human transcriptome (build GRCh38). The unique molecular identifier (UMI) count matrix was converted to Seurat object using the R package Seurat v2. 3.4 [22] . After quality control and data normalization, dimension reduction and cell clustering were performed [13] . Different cell types were identified by mapping canonical marker genes in the two-dimensional t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor embedding (tSNE) map [13] .","For a weakly-coupled metapopulation model, the subgroups are likely to have somewhat asynchronous epidemics. In this case it is better to implement the one-shot interventions based on a local threshold rather than a global threshold. If the coupling is stronger, the epidemics are closely synchronized and there is little difference between the strategies.","More recent developments in DLS technology allow for coupling of DLS with a high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) column to provide rapid eluent analysis. Of particular interest for screening purposes, at least two companies (Wyatt Technology Corporation and Precision Detectors, Inc.) have developed high-throughput DLS, increasing the number of compounds that can be studied by this method.","In order to discover highly mutated viruses and unknown pathogens, we subsequently developed a userfriendly multiplex-PCR-based metagenomic method. In this method, random hexamer-adapters were used to amplify DNA or cDNA targets in a multiplex PCR reaction. The large amounts of non-specific amplification products were removed by using Paragon Genomics' proprietary background removing reagent, thus resolving a library suitable for sequencing. For RNA samples, our reverse transcription reagents were additionally used to convert RNA into cDNA, resulting in significantly reduced amount of human ribosomal RNA species.","In an infectious disease outbreak, the immediate priority is to limit and contain the threat to human health and wellbeing. Research during and following the outbreak can also be important for developing effective treatments and preventive measures, and for guiding public health policies. Recently, research conducted within ongoing investigations of H1N1 infection has demonstrated that pregnant women may be at elevated risk for complications from infection [38]. These findings have led to recommendations to prioritize pregnant women for vaccination and, if infected, for antiviral therapy. Several published candidate gene studies of susceptibility to viral and bacterial diseases have demonstrated the feasibility and utility of integrating host genomics into epidemiologic studies and surveillance [36,39-42]. The greatest public health impact of such research may be through accelerating the development of preventive vaccines; however, novel diagnostic tests developed for clinical use may also prove useful for epidemic monitoring and triage during outbreaks. For example, scientists recently demonstrated that human gene expression profiles are an effective tool for determining the etiology of respiratory infections, providing a striking example of rapid translation from basic research to potential clinical and public health application [43].","It is well-known that if the sub-populations have strong enough coupling, the epidemics in all sub-populations are effectively synchronised [2, 4] . In this case the time-evolution of the outbreaks in the various sub-populations are similar to that of the fully mixed population, and there is little distinction between interventions based on individual sub-population or at the global-level."],"title":["Estimating the size of COVID-19 epidemic outbreak","An Overview of Practical Applications of Protein Disorder Prediction and Drive for Faster, More Accurate Predictions","Structural genomics and interactomics of 2019 Wuhan novel coronavirus, 2019-nCoV, indicate evolutionary conserved functional regions of viral proteins","Evolution of Viruses","Microarrays and gene expression profiling in microbiology and infectious diseases: a clinician's perspective","Microbial molecular markers and epidemiological surveillance in the era of high throughput sequencing: an update from the IMMEM-10 conference","Network-based Drug Repurposing for Human Coronavirus","Chapter 103 Osteonecrosis","Structural genomics and interactomics of 2019 Wuhan novel coronavirus, 2019-nCoV, indicate evolutionary conserved functional regions of viral proteins","Evaluations of serological test in the diagnosis of 2019 novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) infections during the COVID-19 outbreak","The immune vulnerability landscape of the 2019 Novel Coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2","CHAPTER 4 Keeping Track of Viruses","The timing of one-shot interventions for epidemic control","Microarrays and gene expression profiling in microbiology and infectious diseases: a clinician's perspective","Ultra-Low-Cost Integrated Silicon-based Transducer for On-Site, Genetic Detection of Pathogens","Global transmission network of SARS-CoV-2: from outbreak to pandemic","Why are HIV-1 fusion inhibitors not effective against SARS-CoV?
