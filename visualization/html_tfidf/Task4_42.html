Several animal models have been evaluated for SARS- and MERS CoVs including mouse, guinea pigs, hamsters, ferrets, rabbits, rhesus macaques, marmosets, and cats.42,44-50","Due to the new technologies available for surveillance, assay development, vaccine design, animal modeling, and manufacturing, the scientific aspects of vaccine development are not limiting our ability to prepare for emerging viral diseases. The major factors that need to be addressed include (1) the political will to provide the resources necessary to conduct the epidemiology and laboratory work needed to support vaccine development, (2) new business models to create an infrastructure for advanced vaccine development that does not require profit motive, and (3) creative regulatory processes and clinical trial designs to evaluate products for efficacy during outbreaks that are by nature sporadic and causing social chaos. Importantly, achieving solid efficacy data that can support licensure is critical so products can be more readily available during future epidemics. Novel approaches to vaccine design may significantly shorten vaccine development timelines and increase the frequency of success. New technologies that have rapidly evolved over the last 5-10 years make atomic level antigen design feasible and provide mechanisms for rapid, iterative improvements in antigenicity and immunogenicity of candidate vaccines. In particular, high throughput sequencing provides a starting point for vaccine antigens and helps to define the extent of genetic variability. Relatively inexpensive gene synthesis, the ease of isolating and characterizing human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against target antigens, the ability to define structures of vaccine antigens in complex with mAbs with desirable functional properties, and the development of assays that evaluate immunogenicity of vaccines in animal models, provide the foundation for rapid development of highly characterized candidate vaccines and their advancement into clinical evaluation. The figure illustrates the steps taken in the case of MERS CoV to rapidly develop the tools needed to generate candidate vaccines. Advanced knowledge of effective vaccine approaches for a particular virus family together with these modern development and design approaches may significantly shorten the time needed to prepare vaccines for field testing in the setting of a new pandemic threat.","Because of the economic importance of CoV infection to livestock and domestic animals, a variety of live-attenuated and killed CoV vaccines have been tested in animals. Vaccines have been developed against IBV, TGEV, CCoV, and FIPV. However, these vaccines do not seem to provide complete protection from wild-type virus infection. In some cases, the wild-type CoV rapidly evolves to escape neutralization by vaccine-induced antibodies. In studies of vaccinated chickens, a live-attenuated IBV vaccine has been shown to undergo RNA recombination with wild-type virus to generate vaccine escape mutants. Killed virus vaccines may also be problematic for some CoV infections. Vaccination of cats with a killed FIPV vaccine has been shown to exacerbate disease when cats are challenged with wild-type virus. Therefore, extensive studies will be required to carefully evaluate candidate vaccines for SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV. A variety of approaches are currently under investigation for developing CoV vaccines, including analysis of killed virus vaccines, live-attenuated virus vaccines, and viral vector vaccines (such as modified vaccine virus Ankara, canarypox, alphavirus, and adenovirus vectors). Studies have shown that removing the envelope (E) protein from either SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV is an effective approach for generating a live attenuated virus vaccine. In the absence of this structural protein, the virus replicates to lower titers in the lungs of mice, but still induces an immune response that is protective from challenge with wild type virus. The development of improved animal models for human coronaviruses will be essential for evaluating any candidate vaccines. Transgenic mice expressing human ACE-2 (for SARS-CoV) can be used as a model system for SARS, however the pathogenesis in ACE-2 expressing transgenic mice does not fully mimic the pathogenesis seen during SARS-CoV infection in humans. CoVs can be adapted for replication in small animal models. Passaging SARS-CoV in mice led to the generation of a mouse-adapted strain, SARS CoV-MA15, which induces a lethal respiratory tract infection of mice. CoV vaccine studies will benefit from an improved understanding of conserved viral epitopes that can be targeted for vaccine development.","Depending on features of the virus structure, transmission dynamics, entry requirements, tropism, and replication strategy, a vaccine approach should be proposed, designed, and evaluated in small animals for immunogenicity and protection against challenge. Manufacturing a candidate vaccine for which there is no immediate market poses a significant dilemma because most stages of advanced vaccine development are carried out by large pharmaceutical companies that need to make profit to stay in business. While emerging infectious diseases pose a public health threat, they rarely present a compelling commercial opportunity. Vaccines require a large investment and historically have a relatively low probability of being successful without an extensive iterative process of evaluation and redesign. Therefore, in addition to new biological tools, there needs to be political will to prioritize public funding of advanced vaccine development and new business models for managing this process. 3 In this review, we describe the vaccine development efforts for three distinct viruses that collectively capture many of the challenges faced when developing vaccines for emerging viral threats. Ebola, a member of the Filoviridae family, is spread by body fluids and secretions with a relatively low attack rate but causes a systemic disease with high mortality. Chikungunya, an alphavirus in FIGURE 28.1 Time from identification of a viral pathogen to vaccine availability. Vaccine development is a lengthy process often measured in decades. Many steps are required even for a traditional empirical approach including identification of target antigen; assay development; defining seroprevalence and incidence in relevant populations; understanding transmission dynamics and whether there is an intermediate animal host; developing animal models; exploring pathogenesis and defining immune mechanisms of protection; designing vaccine antigens; determining formulation, delivery route and method; preclinical evaluation for safety and immunogenicity; manufacturing; and several years of clinical evaluation and clearing regulatory hurdles. Vaccines can fail at any of these steps, and it is rare for the first attempted concept to become the final product.","The CoV S-proteins are the major target of the humoral and cellular immune response and constitute prime candidates for vaccine development. Vaccination of mice with SARS-CoV S-encoding DNA triggered a humoral and cellular immune response and induced protection against infection [55] . Depletion of T cells and Ig transfer experiments revealed that protection was due to neutralizing antibodies [29, 55] ; protection can be achieved by the sole administration of S-specific neutralizing monoclonal antibodies [56] . Production of neutralizing antibodies was also observed upon immunization of macaques with adenovirus [57] and mice with vaccinia virus [48] , both encoding the S-protein, and in the latter case protection of the vaccinated animals against SARS-CoV was demonstrated. These data, in conjunction with neutralization of S-driven infection using sera obtained from convalescent SARS patients [40, 41] and also using a monoclonal antibody directed against the S1 subunit [58] , indicate that S-based vaccines are promising for future human trials. However, triggering inflammation in S-vaccinated but not in control animals has also been reported [59] and an enhancing effect of S-specific antibodies on feline infectious peritonitis virus replication is well established [60] . Therefore, S-based vaccines need to be carefully characterized in several animal models before being administered to humans.","There is no available vaccine against COVID-19, while previous vaccines or strategies used to develop a vaccine against SARS-CoV can be effective. Recombinant protein from the Urbani (AY278741) strain of SARS-CoV was administered to mice and hamsters, resulted in the production of neutralizing antibodies and protection against SARS-CoV [56, 57] . The DNA fragment, inactivated whole virus or live-vectored strain of SARS-CoV (AY278741), significantly reduced the viral infection in various animal models [58] [59] [60] [61] [62] [63] . Different other strains of SARS-CoV were also used to produce inactivated or live-vectored vaccines which efficiently reduced the viral load in animal models. These strains include, Tor2 (AY274119) [64, 65] , Utah (AY714217) [66] , FRA (AY310120) [59] , HKU-39849 (AY278491) [57, 67] , BJ01 (AY278488) [68, 69] , NS1 (AY508724) [70] , ZJ01 (AY297028) [70] , GD01 (AY278489) [69] and GZ50 (AY304495) [71] . However, there are few vaccines in the pipeline against SARS-CoV-2. The mRNA based vaccine prepared by the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases against SARS-CoV-2 is under phase 1 trial [72] . INO-4800-DNA based vaccine will be soon available for human testing [73] . Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) working on the development of an inactivated virus vaccine [74, 75] . Soon mRNA based vaccine's sample (prepared by Stermirna Therapeutics) will be available [76] . GeoVax-BravoVax is working to develop a Modified Vaccina Ankara (MVA) based vaccine [77] . While Clover Biopharmaceuticals is developing a recombinant 2019-nCoV S protein subunit-trimer based vaccine [78] .","Researchers are searching for effective and suitable vaccine candidates and therapeutics for controlling the deadly COVID-19. There are no effective vaccines or specific antiviral drugs for COVID-19. Hence, we have to rely exclusively on enforcing strict preventive and control measures that minimize the risk of possible disease transmission. Results obtained from the recently conducted in vitro study against COVID-19 are promising since the drugs remdesivir and chloroquine were found to be highly effective in controlling the infection. Direct clinical trials can be conducted among the patients infected with COVID-19 since these drugs are being used for treating other diseases and have well-established safety profiles, making the further evaluation of these drugs much easier. S protein is considered a key viral antigen for developing CoV vaccines, as shown in several preclinical studies. Although research is in progress to improve prevention, treatment, and control of COVID-19, the documented clinical data on different therapeutic approaches for CoVs are scarce. Further research should be directed toward the study of SARS-CoV-2 in suitable animal models for analyzing replication, transmission, and pathogenesis.","A more economical and achievable strategy than traditional approaches to vaccine development and deployment would be to focus on manufacturing small stockpiles of vaccine using a common platform technology. ChAd vectored vaccines provide a good example of a suitable vaccine platform, which has been identified as one of significant interest by the WHO R&amp;D Blueprint process. The overall strategy would be to generate suitable stockpiles for emergency response use having previously demonstrated safety and immunogenicity of each vaccine up to Phase II trials in the target geographical regions. These products could be stored in relevant locations for each disease and, in the event of an outbreak emerging, could be deployed in a ring vaccination program similar to that employed in a Phase III trial in Guinea of the rVSV ZEBOV vaccine during the West African Ebola outbreak.18 Such a deployment would need to be made under the provisions of policies for use of unapproved medicinal products, such as the FDA Expanded Access program, also known as \u201ccompassionate use\u201d, or other emergency use legislation. This would require fulfilment of certain conditions including that no comparable or satisfactory therapy is available, that the risk of harm from the vaccine is not greater than the risk of disease and that there is sufficient evidence of the safety and effectiveness of the product to support its use in the given circumstances.46 In this context, a vaccine for an outbreak pathogen, based on a well-developed platform, such as ChAd vectors, with evidence of efficacy from a relevant animal model would be likely to gain approval for use in a limited setting. Based on research, manufacturing and clinical trial costs for the ChAd3 vectored vaccine developed for Ebola, vaccines might be stockpiled for just $50 million per disease, representing a fraction of the cost of bringing a vaccine through to licensure. Deployment would provide the efficacy data in humans required for approval by a national regulator, increasing the likelihood of the vaccine progressing through the later stages of development.","Mucosal vaccine with protein antigens is a very promising product format for future vaccine development, especially considering the desired immunity protection at the mucosal surface and the safety of protein antigens. However, the low immunogenicity and weak stability of free protein antigens in the relatively harsh mucosal fluid (such as nasal mucus and gastric conditions), require an optimized vaccine formulation to enhance immune protection. A wide range of particulate delivery systems have been proven to be efficient in vaccine delivery in animals and human. Co-administration of suitable immunostimulants with protein antigens could facilitate and enhance the generation of potent antigen-specific immune protection. Therefore, a successfully designed vaccine therapeutics is always an optimal combination of antigens, immuno-potentiators, vaccine carriers, and an effective formulation of the above, which is delivered through an appropriate administration route.","It is very difficult and often impossible to test the efficacy of new treatments for highly lethal infections in human clinical trials. Animal models for human EIDs can play a key role in the development and testing of candidate vaccines and therapeutics and can be used to facilitate their regulatory approval. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has developed The Animal Rule to assist in the regulatory approval process [4] . The rule states that when it would not be ethical to perform human challenge studies to measure the efficacy of vaccines and drugs developed to prevent or treat highly pathogens, the FDA may grant approval based on appropriate animal efficacy studies when the results of those studies establish that the drug is reasonably likely to produce a clinical benefit in humans. The Animal Rule states that the FDA will only rely on evidence from animal studies to provide substantial evidence of effectiveness when strict criteria are met.","The receptor-binding domain (RBD) in spike protein located on the outer membrane of coronavirus mediates receptor binding and plays a major role in virus entry into the host cell [57] . This protein could be used as a potential vaccine candidate as it is the major target for neutralizing antibodies [58] . Hence, it could be considered to develop potential effective vaccines or therapeutics against coronavirus infection. As the virus uses angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the host cell receptor for its cell entry similar like SARS-CoV [59] [60] [61] , the monoclonal antibodies that are identified and tested to be effective against SARS virus protein or specific to ACE2 can be produced in plants and shall be tested for its efficacy against nCoV. Earlier reports showed several vaccines and monoclonal antibody candidates in response to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which could be tested and used for passive immunotherapy for an immediate immune response [62] [63] [64] . The possibility of producing a VLP based vaccine is also feasible by expressing all the structural viral proteins that can assemble into VLPs in plants. The structural and functional studies of viral proteins in nCoV might help in designing better vaccines and specific therapeutics. Producing viral proteins in plants may further be helpful to evaluate their potential in developing diagnostic kits or the protection/therapeutic tools that can be manufactured fast in order to manage the highly infectious nCoV. This will open an avenue to characterize recombinant immunogenic viral proteins and provide a proof of concept for using plants as a robust, rapid, and flexible platform for producing protein/research reagents, which are highly essential to face potential nCoV outbreaks.","Fortunately, scientists around the world are working at breakneck speed to figure out how to detect, treat, and control the new coronavirus. On Feb 10-12, 2020, WHO brought almost 400 scientists together for a research and innovation forum on the new coronavirus. 4 The meeting covered the topics of diagnostics, vaccines, and therapeutics for COVID19, alongside questions of how to best integrate social science into the response and protection of healthcare workers from infection. The forum generated a research roadmap, due to be published at the end of February, 2020, to develop tools to help control the outbreak, reduce deaths, and minimise damage to economies and the social fabric of communities.","There are currently no approved antiviral treatments or vaccines for human coronavirus infections, including HCoV-NL63, HCoV-HKU1, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. Studies have described small-molecule inhibitors that have the potential to control SARS-CoV infection, and in vitro studies have reported that the virus has partial ribavirin and interferon sensitivity at high doses, but clinical management of severe infections (which mostly occur in people infected with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV) is limited to supportive and palliative care14,87,88. Thus, the development of safe, stable vaccines is necessary, and, because these viruses rise rapidly out of heterogeneous, zoonotic pools, vaccines would ideally be broad-spectrum and rapidly adaptable to new coronaviruses. Of particular importance is the protection of the elderly, as they might be disproportionately susceptible to severe disease from both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infections. In support of this hypothesis, the median age of MERS-affected patients who experience disease that is severe enough to require medical attention is currently 50 years (with an age range from 14 months to 94 years) (WHO MERS-CoV incidence updates). Additionally, in the case of SARS-CoV, the elderly respond poorly to most vaccine formulations14,42,89. Multiple strategies have been used to generate coronavirus vaccines, which include inactivated virus vaccines, live-attenuated virus vaccines, viral vector vaccines, subunit vaccines and DNA or protein vaccines. Most studies have focused only on SARS-CoV vaccine development and have used animal models that do not recapitulate the severe clinical disease that occurs in humans (Table 2). To critically evaluate a vaccine, lethal-challenge models using viral strains that are homologous and heterologous to the vaccine strain in both young and aged animals are essential.","Animal models play a vital role to uncover the mechanisms of viral pathogenicity from the entrance to the transmission and designing therapeutic strategies. Previously, to examine the replication of SARS-CoV, various animal models were used which showed the symptoms of severe infection [43] . In contrast to SARS-CoV, no MERS-CoV pathogenesis was observed in small animals. Mice are not vulnerable to infection by MERS-coronavirus due to the non-compatibility of the DPP4 receptor [44] . As the entire genome of the 2019-novel coronavirus is more than 80% similar to the previous human SARS-like bat CoV, previously used animal models for SARS-CoV can be utilized to study the infectious pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2. The human ACE2 cell receptor is recognized by both SARS and Novel coronaviruses. Conclusively, TALEN or CRISPR-mediated genetically modified hamsters or other small animals can be utilized for the study of the pathogenicity of novel coronaviruses. SARS-CoV has been reported to replicate and cause severe disease in Rats (F344), where the sequence analysis revealed a mutation at spike glycoprotein [45] . Thus, it could be another suitable option to develop spike glycoprotein targeting therapeutics against novel coronaviruses. Recently, mice models and clinical isolates were used to develop any therapeutic strategy against SARS-CoV-2 induced COVID-19 [46, 47] . In a similar study, artificial intelligence prediction was used to investigate the inhibitory role of the drug against SARS-CoV-2 [48] . SARS-CoV-2 infected patients were also used to conduct randomized clinical trials [46, 49, 50] . It is now important that the scientists worldwide collaborate the design a suitable model and investigate the in vivo mechanisms associated with pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2.","The regulatory considerations for the nonclinical and clinical development of preventive vaccines, as well as pathways to licensure described elsewhere in this chapter, are largely also applicable to vaccines formulated with adjuvants. However, adjuvants can exhibit a range of properties that invoke complex immune responses, the mode of action is not always known or fully understood, and animal models that are relevant for evaluating both the safety and the efficacy of an adjuvantantigen combination are frequently not available. Thus, there are some unique issues to be addressed during preclinical and clinical development of the adjuvanted vaccine formulation. A WHO guideline published in 2013 describes the nonclinical, quality, pharmacological, toxicological, and other information needed to support initiation of clinical trials with a vaccine combined with a novel adjuvant. 36 In 2007, CBER published two guidance documents (\"Guidance for Industry: Clinical Data Needed to Support Licensure of Pandemic Influenza Vaccines\" 37 and \"Guidance for Industry: Clinical Data Needed to Support the Licensure of Seasonal Inactivated Influenza Vaccines\" 38 ). Each of these documents discusses the development of adjuvanted inactivated influenza vaccines and notes that \"[d]ata to support the safety of the adjuvanted formulation and added benefit over the unadjuvanted formulation must be submitted in the BLA\u2026\" 37, 38 Sponsors were advised that \"at an early stage of development, clinical data supporting the value of adding the adjuvant should be provided\u2026\" 37, 38 The seasonal influenza vaccine guidance notes further that \"[i]f an adjuvant is added to a licensed seasonal vaccine without antigen sparing effects\u2026the immune response elicited by the adjuvanted formulation should be substantially better than that elicited by the unadjuvanted vaccine\u2026\" 38 As the FDA's experience with novel adjuvants has grown, the agency continues to reexamine guidance and engages with sponsors and applicants regarding the clinical development of adjuvanted vaccines.","More important, the HIV vaccine development effort initially focused on replicating the approach that had been used to develop Hepatitis B vaccine development, which was to clone and express the surface protein of the virus. This simplistic approach to a complex virus was recently proven to be a failure [3] . Will scientists once again pursue \"quick and easy solutions\" in the hopes of stimulating a protective antibody response despite existing evidence that coronavirus vaccines (for animals) based on the S or spike surface protein have largely been ineffective? In order to best define an effective SARS vaccine approach, it is important to consider the correlates of protection from coronaviruses in animal models and any evidence for immunity that may be emerging from clinical experience. Little is known, as yet, about the human immune response to SARS-CoV but much can be learned from examining the immunology of other coronaviruses and the history of coronavirus vaccines. We must also examine the host-pathogen interaction and ask whether specific antigens (proteins derived from the pathogen) or host responses, such as antibodies and T cell response, provide any insight into the type of vaccine that should be developed. SARS, like HIV, has the potential to set off a global pandemic. In this article, we argue that there is much to be learned from the past-both in terms of building a cooperative approach in order to expedite the development of an effective vaccine and in terms of the scientific knowledge that has emerged as a result of this collaborative process [4] . There is no better time to begin working on a new SARS vaccine than now. It is imperative to capture this moment, when the virus is relatively new, before clades and strains of this highly virulent airborne virus emerge.","Besides improving existing detection assays-for instance, PCR methods based on the amplification of the nucleoprotein gene may be intrinsically more sensitive, due to the coronaviral transcription strategy , and thus be valuable for early diagnosis-further laboratory research needs to include detailed physico-chemical analysis of SARS-CoV proteins to allow the development of novel compounds based on targeted drug design (Anand et al., 2003) . Although an effective vaccine cannot be expected to be available soon, the relative ease with which SARS-CoV can be propagated in vitro is clearly helpful. A suitable animal model for SARS may be available in the form of cynomolgus macaques (Macaca fascicularis) . While the availability of vaccines against animal coronaviruses, such as avian infectious bronchitis virus, transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus of pigs, and feline infectious peritonitis virus, is encouraging, the obvious lack of protective immunity in humans after infection with HCoV OC43 and 229E is not. There is also currently no commercial veterinary vaccine to prevent respiratory coronavirus infections, except for infectious bronchitis virus infections in chickens. Further research is also urgently needed to determine whether immune pathogenesis plays a r\u00f4le in SARS or whether immune enhancement may occur, the chances of developing an effective and safe vaccine therefore remain uncertain. It is to be hoped that after such an encouraging start in an atmosphere of open collaboration and mutual trust, progress in SARS-CoV research will not be impeded by patent matters (Gold, 2003) .","To improve responsiveness to epidemics, in 2015 the WHO published a list of nine diseases requiring urgent vaccine R&amp;D to prevent public health emergencies in the future. This list was revised in 2017, and key characteristics of the diseases prioritised by the WHO are summarised in Table 3. The process of prioritising diseases took into account properties of the causative pathogen e.g. transmissibility, host-based factors such as immunopathology, clinical aspects including ease of accurate diagnosis, availability of countermeasures and mortality, public health capacity and epidemiological factors.47 Research and development priorities for these diseases include development of suitable diagnostic tests, assessment of potential treatments, identification of key knowledge gaps, production platforms, behavioural interventions and acceleration of vaccine development. Preparation of sufficient quantities of safe and efficacious vaccines against potential outbreak pathogens is an extremely effective strategy. However, a lack of access to dedicated long-term funding has hampered vaccine development for outbreak pathogens in recent decades.48 As well as limiting the number of new vaccines being developed, the number of facilities with the capacity to biomanufacture vaccines is also limited, which is a significant issue for outbreak preparedness.49 In addition, WHO recognised that generally applicable platform technologies for rapid vaccine development are required and have set out to identify and prioritise the leading platforms.   ","DNA vaccines hold promise for use in humans [27] . However, the immunogenicity of SARS-CoV DNA vaccine in humans has yet to be established. Whether this approach could be applied to other animal models is still unknown, and its immunogenicity in humans remains to be established. What's more, for the SARS-CoV vaccine, there are significant limitations with current technologies that have prevented the full effectiveness of DNA vaccines in larger animals and humans because of the safety concerns about live virus. Therefore, it is very important to evaluate the efficacy of SARS DNA vaccine in any other animal models, which is a highly relevant translational model for demonstrating human immune responsiveness.","There are no clinically approved vaccines against NiV, however, one therapeutic approach (monoclonal antibody therapy) has recently completed a phase I clinical trial with results still to be reported.57 While monoclonal antibody treatment may be efficacious in a short window post-exposure, this treatment option is not suitable for large-scale use, and as such, vaccine development is a key research focus for the prevention of NiV-mediated disease. Advantageously, there are a number of animal models of NiV infection which are used in vaccine development programs and are considered to sufficiently mirror NiV-induced pathogenesis observed in humans, e.g. the hamster, ferret and African Green Monkey (AGM) models.58-60","practical requirement in the development of any EIAV vaccine is compatibility with established regulatory policies and diagnostic assays. The ability of EIAV-infected horses to routinely establish immunologic control over virus replication and disease suggests that an effective vaccine can indeed be developed, if the critical natural immune correlates of protection can be elicited by a candidate vaccine. An attenuated live EIAV vaccine with a reported protection efficacy of about 70% has been used in China since the early 1980s, but the effectiveness of this vaccine remains to be confirmed outside of that country. Evaluation of other candidate EIAV vaccines (live-attenuated, inactivated whole virus, subunit vaccines, synthetic peptides, etc.) under experimental conditions has revealed a spectrum of vaccine efficacy that ranges from 'sterile protection' (prevention of infection upon inoculation with EIAV) to severe elevation of EIAVreplication, and exacerbation of disease. These results indicate that immune responses to EIAVare a double-edged sword that can either mediate protection or yield vaccine enhancement. Vaccine enhancement has previously been reported for other viral infections (dengue virus, respiratory syncitial virus, feline infectious peritonitis virus) and is of special concern with macrophage-tropic viruses. Similar examples of vaccine protection and enhancement have been reported in studies of experimental vaccines for other lentiviruses, including feline immunodeficiency virus, caprine arthritis-encephalitis virus, and visna-maedi virus. These observations in several diverse animal lentivirus systems suggest that the potential for immune enhancement may be a general property of lentiviruses, including HIV-1. Current efforts in the production of a commercial EIAV vaccine are focused on the development of a vaccine that can achieve sufficient maturation of immune responses to provide protection from virus infection, but allow the serological differentiation between vaccinated and infected horses. In this regard, DNA vaccine strategies appear to be well suited to accomplish these criteria for a commercial EIAV vaccine.","For lyssaviruses, the lack of vaccine protection against numerous divergent lyssaviruses has been previously defined. However, the continued emergence of novel lyssaviruses warrants the continued assessment of vaccine protection, as well as where human infection occurs and how the clinical disease develops, as there remains no cure for rabies. Human rabies vaccines have been available for decades, and following vaccination, it has long been established that a neutralising antibody titre over a defined threshold will protect individuals from the development of disease when infection with classical RABV occurs [143]. However, the protective cut-off for a serological neutralising antibody titre is poorly defined for many of the other lyssaviruses within the genus, and consequently, the discovery of novel viruses warrants an investigation on the efficacy of existing pre- and post-exposure preparations [144,145,146,147,148,149,150]. Although response to vaccines differs between individuals, it is widely accepted that a protective titre of 0.5 international units (IU)/ml is sufficient for protection against RABV [151]. Alongside RABV, the current vaccine protects against all phylogroup I lyssaviruses, namely: ARAV, ABLV, BBLV, DUVV, EBLV-1, EBLV-2, IRKV, KHUV, and GBLV, although the level of neutralising antibody required to protect is undefined. Evidence has shown, however, that a titre higher than 0.5IU/ml is required for protection for some phylogroup I lyssaviruses, indicating an increased antigenic distance of the vaccine strains to the circulating lyssaviruses [144] [146,149]. For more divergent lyssaviruses, such as those in phylogroup II and III, in vivo vaccination-challenge experiments have shown that the antibody response generated from the RABV vaccine is not sufficient for protection [17,147,150,152,153,154]. ","The use of DNA vaccines is based on the transfection of plasmid DNA that encodes antigenic proteins into host cells and the subsequent expression of these foreign genes in order to induce a potent immune response against the disease of interest. Undoubtedly, at first glance, nucleic acid immunization appears to be an attractive vaccine platform: fast vaccine development, a clean safety profile, and low production costs [35]. However, in spite of the promising data from pre-clinical animal studies, DNA vaccines have not yet been fully successful in humans. For example, the dengue DNA vaccine D1ME100 showed excellent anti-dengue cellular and humoral immune responses in non-human primates; however, it failed to produce neutralizing antibody in human subjects [36, 37]. Research and development on MERS-CoV DNA vaccines has been focused on the S protein by engineering plasmid DNA that encoded full-length S protein sequences [38\u2022]. A synthetic DNA vaccine against MERS-CoV was studied in mice and large animal models (non-human primates\u2014NHPs and camels), and the results showed that the vaccine is capable of inducing S protein-specific neutralizing antibodies in these animals. Intriguingly, the study revealed that vaccinated NHPs were protected and failed to demonstrate any clinical or radiographic signs of pneumonia post MERS viral challenge [38\u2022]. In early 2016, the first-in-human trial of MERS vaccine has begun [39], where 75 participants will receive the MERS DNA vaccine, GLS-5300, co-developed by Inovio Pharmaceuticals and GeneOne Life Science Inc. [40]. In an alternative approach, Graham and co-workers proposed to combine a DNA vaccine and the S1 subunit protein in a prime-boost scheme. Rhesus macaques immunized with spike DNA vaccine followed by the S1 protein (adjuvanted with aluminum phosphate) yielded more neutralizing antibodies, showed fewer signs of pulmonary disease than animals vaccinated with the S1 protein only [41].","Since then, investigators working with experimental respiratory vaccines have proceeded with great caution and even reluctance based on the prospect of causing another such incident. In laboratory animals antibody-dependent immune Microbes [7, 8] , although to a lesser degree. Such concerns prompted efforts to develop a more restricted receptor binding domain (RBD) of the S protein as a recombinant vaccine [9, 10] , which elicits highly effective cross-neutralizing antibody responses in the vaccinated animals [11] . An equivalent RBD molecule has now been identified from MERS-CoV spike protein (Fig. 2) [12e14], potentially making it feasible to co-develop this molecule as a recombinant MERS vaccine, alongside an RBD-based SARS vaccine. To date, however, the level of interest from scientific funding agencies to develop MERS vaccines has been modest. When considering the time and expense of developing a safe and effective vaccine against uncertain risk factors, global health policymakers have so far hesitated in prioritizing MERS-CoV vaccines for the purpose of creating a stockpile in the event of a public health emergency.","For other viral zoonoses of bat present within the EU there have been varying degrees of success in the development of vaccines. Following the 2014 Ebola outbreak, a vaccine based on vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) expressing the surface glycoprotein of Zaire Ebola (EBOV), termed VSV-EBOV, was developed [155]. Clinical trials demonstrated 95-100% efficacy in generating a protective response against EBOV, making it the first filovirus vaccine in use [156]. However, as with the lyssaviruses, there is antigenic divergence across the filovirus family with six distinct species of ebolavirus being described and little is understood regarding any potential cross-protection afforded by the current vaccine. Further, two other genera are classified alongside the ebolaviruses within the filovirus family, Marburgviruses and Cuevavirus. Whilst a vaccine for Marburgviruses is not currently in use, studies have shown that, similar to EBOV, VSV expressing MARV glycoproteins is effective at generating a sufficient antibody titre for protection in non-human primates [157]. Of note, the VSV-MARV vaccine affords protection against Ravn virus (RAVV), a further novel lyssavirus [158]. ","The rationale is that the section KRSFIEDLLFNKV is exposed as associated with S2 0 at the surface but highly conserved as shown in the second (i.e. \"FIEDLL\") alignment in Section 4.3. To bring it to the length of circa 20 amino acid residues considered in the author's experience (and frequently by other workers) as most suitable as a basis of a B-epitope for vaccine and diagnostic design, it was noted that the preceding serine (S) and following leucine (L) and alanine (A) are found in 2019-nCoV, well conserved in human host (AAR07628.1) and bat host species, and represent fairly conservative substitutions in the next most related coronaviruses, the pig host species. The remaining principles used in this design are summarized at the end of Section 4.6 alongside the similar discussion for a peptidomimetic, because the method of design (as is typical for epitopes in synthetic peptide vaccines) is based on rules-ofthumb as discussed in that Section, and are similar in the two cases. The choice is supported by the fact that it corresponds to an exposed loop in the SARS coronavirus, which will be important for raising antibodies. The ends of the peptides will have amino and carboxyl groups (shown above), which are linked to the rest of the protein sequence by neutral peptide links. The ends of the peptide are thus selected on the rationale that (a) the exposed N-terminal NH 3 \u00fe -glycine (G) mimics (albeit imperfectly) the positively charged lysine (K) in the KPS triplet and (b) cysteine-(COO \u00c0 ) provides a means for a Cys-S-S-Cys disulfide link to a carrier protein and the exposed carboxy terminus mimics (again albeit imperfectly) the aspartate (D) in the LAD triplet. A carrier protein is required to be added for antibody production and T-system memory, because short peptides have limited antigenicity. Keyhole limpet haemocyanin is often used, at least for raising antibodies, and for early stage vaccine studies, using laboratory animals. It is derived from the limpet, a gastropod; it is phylogenetically distant from mammalian proteins, thus reducing false positives in immunologically-based research techniques in mammalian model organisms, and clinically avoiding autoimmune effects. Some further conventional wisdom for selection of amino acid residues to synthesize as peptides and used as the basis of diagnostics and vaccines is as follows. Concerns are for raising antibodies (B immune system), implanting immune system memory in the case of vaccines), and specificity, and avoiding unwanted cross reactions with other proteins with similar epitopes to the target protein of interest. The peptide length should in general best be 10-20 amino acids of which many but not all are significantly polar (hydrophilic, water-liking) (residues in the set [STDENQKRHYP]). The length is thus considered appropriate at 20 amino acid residues. Tackling the issue of avoiding potential immunological crossreactivity with other human proteins, the closest match of the appropriate corresponding non-terminal sequence KGPSKRSFIEDLLFNKVT-LACD with human genome protein products in GenBank is as follows.","To address these issues, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) was launched in January 2017, bringing together funders including the Wellcome Trust, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, and the governments of Norway, Germany, Japan and others.50 The initial fund is $460 million, with the European Commission also pledging co-funding of \u20ac250 million and further funding due to be confirmed from the Government of India by the end of 2017. The fund will initially focus on the Nipah, Lassa and MERS viruses, aiming to bring two candidate vaccines through development against each disease. CEPI also aims to promote technical and institutional platforms to improve responsiveness to future epidemics. The approach undertaken by CEPI will advance vaccine development for diseases where research to date has been limited. This is in large part due to the lack of market potential for such vaccines in conjunction with the huge costs involved over a long period of time to provide a vaccine, from pre-clinical development through to licensure, estimated at upwards of $200 million to $500 million per vaccine.51 Therefore, the funding required to license a vaccine for each of the priority diseases highlighted by the WHO blueprint would run into many billions of dollars, and opportunities to assess the efficacy of these vaccines in humans would be rare.","Altogether our results demonstrate that, in presence of vaccine-elicited antiviral antibodies, SARS-CoV displays an altered tropism toward primary human immune cells, which do not express the conventional virus receptor and are otherwise refractory to the virus. A number of SARS vaccine candidates have been tested in experimental animal models [35,36], many of them based on the viral Spike glycoprotein previously identified as the most immunogenic antigen inducing neutralizing and protective antibodies [14,15,37,38]. Of note, some vaccines against animal coronaviruses have been also generated, but their development has proven difficult due to immune enhancement of disease in vaccinated recipients [39-41]. Despite the fact that this alternative infection pathway appears to have a limited impact, it remains of interest to appreciate the cost of antibody-mediated SARS-CoV infection on the functionality of the target cells, in order to have a broad understanding of the tropism and pathogenesis of the virus and evaluate potential pitfalls associated with immunization against human coronaviruses. This aspect is gaining more relevance as the emergence of the MERS-CoV further indicates that the availability of vaccines targeting this group of viruses, which have demonstrated the ability to jump species, is one of the few options available to prevent the spread of infections causing severe diseases with high mortality in humans [42].","The envelope protein (E) is also an attractive vaccine target that has been proposed for leverage in the development of live-attenuated vaccines [60, 61] . MERS-CoV mutants with the E protein deleted are replication-competent but propagation-defective [61] . Similar results were shown for the SARS-CoV when E was removed [62] . Together this suggests that deletion of E from coronaviruses may provide a safe-single replication live viral vaccine for use in inducing a mucosal immune response. We investigated the similarity of the E protein of 2019-nCoV by phylogenetic analysis against known coronavirus E protein sequences ( Figure 6 ) and found clustering, although somewhat distant, with human SARS-CoV. Given that vaccines have been generated for MERSand SARS-CoVs by mutating the E protein, an E-based vaccine may represent an alternate candidate for 2019-nCoV vaccines. As vaccine candidates are identified, the requirement of animal models for vaccine development and evaluation will be essential.","The availability of therapeutic NAbs against SARS-CoV-2 will offer benefits for the control of the current pandemic and the possible re-emergence of the virus in the future, and their development therefore remains a high priority. The efforts of NAb development will surely be an area of intense research in the coming months and even years. Currently, several strategies are used in the clinic or under development, such as viral-targeting therapeutics and host-targeting agents (such as interferons, glucocorticoids) for the treatment of COVID-19. As compared with these therapeutic strategies, NAbs appear to be more specific for virions. Understanding of action mechanisms of NAbs may provide valuable implications for the rapid development of antibody therapy and vaccine for SARS-CoV-2. However, the development of NAb-based therapeutics is a time-consuming and laborious process. To date, no NAb agents for either SARS-CoV or (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus) MERS-CoV are available in the market. Meanwhile, a note of caution is that the effect of antibody immune response in protecting against pulmonary pathogenesis of SARS-CoV is controversial 31. Some patients who died of SARS showed the strong NAb responses and pulmonary proinflammatory accumulation, suggesting NAbs could be associated with fatal acute lung injury. Therefore, it is important to take insight into humoral and cellular responses of SARS-CoV-2 when antiviral immunotherapy is developed.","The other problems of inactivated influenza vaccine relate to the rather low efficacy (approximately 70% protection), poor longevity of the immune response (1 year), evasion of the induced immune response by antigenic mutants of the virus, and residual toxicity of the vaccine itself. As regards the latter, most adult persons receiving current inactivated vaccines notice only local pain and stinging at the site of inoculation and although this may deter future acceptance of vaccine it is not a serious reaction. However, in children or unprimed adults, whole virus vaccine Population groups in which a more extended use of inactivated influenza A and B vaccine could be recommended may induce more serious side reactions, including fever. To circumvent these adverse effects, more recently developed vaccines are 'subunit' preparations containing only the relevant antigens which induce protective immunitynamely the two surface glycoprotein spikes of the virus, haemagglutinin and neuraminidase (reviewed by Tyrrell and Smith, 1979; Webster and Laver, 1966) . Such subunit vaccines are less reactogenic but unfortunately they are also less immunogenic in unprimed individuals. Studies are continuing in attempts to improve the immune response to HA subunits. For example, addition of synthetic adjuvants such as muramyl dipeptide (MDP or 6-stearoyl MDP) may increase the B cell response to the HA molecule, at least in animal models.","Current research suggested that mucosal delivery of properly designed formulation of protein-based antigens could provide efficient humoral protection in animal models. Nontheless, the detailed mechanism through which different vaccine therapeutics actually generate and enhance the vaccination protection is still awaiting to be investigated, which could be realized by systemic comparation of the effect of various formulations and administation routes on the same antigen. More specificly, how different delivery carriers and immunostimulants, and their properties such as size, geometry, in vivo kinetics and molecular patterns contribute to the mucosal sampling, the vaccine uptake, process, presentation and finally lead to the desired immunity? Meanwhile, more research efforts are required to design mucosal vaccines to induce strong cellular immunity, including the Th1 and CTL responses, especially for diseases like tuberculosis, HIV and malaria where cellular immunity is crucial in mediating protection.","Thus far, MERS-CoV vaccines have been shown to provide efficacious protection in animal models, though none of the vaccines developed has been tested in human clinical trials. Major strategies for vaccine development are focused on the elicitation of serum antibodies against the major antigen (S protein) of MERS-CoV . Further, passive immunotherapy using convalescent phase human plasma is being considered in MERS patients after its success in animal models . However, studies also demonstrate that MERS-CoV S protein-derived vaccines induce specific CD8 \u00fe T-cell and virus-neutralizing antibodies, which could contribute to complete protection against MERS-CoV in animal models (Lan et al., 2014; Volz et al., 2015) . Based on the investigations of immune memory against SARS-CoV in follow-up studies of recovered patients (discussed above), T-cell responses can provide robust long-term memory and possess a considerable potential for cross-reactivity with heterotypic coronaviruses. Thus, vaccines combining both cellular and humoral responses should be considered for coronavirus prevention. The similarities between the immunopathogenesis of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV through interaction with cell receptors and blockage of host innate immune responses also point to potential therapeutic targets in patients infected with other pathogenic coronaviruses.","The emergence of SARS-CoV in 2002 taught us many lessons about zoonotic reservoirs, the importance of identifying animal models that recapitulate the various aspects of human disease and the determinants of vaccine efficacy and safety. This knowledge is being applied to the recent emergence of MERS-CoV in the human population. With its strikingly high morbidity and mortality rates in hospitalized individuals, it is clear that MERS-CoV has the potential have a profound impact on the human population. However, its low penetrance thus far suggests that the virus might ultimately fail to develop a niche in humans or it might still be adapting to human hosts and that the worst of its effects are yet to come. Studies with SARS-CoV suggest that MERS-CoV research should focus on establishing animal models that recapitulate replication, pathogenesis and transmission in humans. A priority is to develop treatments to prevent viral-induced immune pathology, particularly in the elderly. Furthermore, vaccines that target conserved alleles and provide broad protection against strains that are both closely and distantly related to the vaccine strain should be developed. One particular concern is the possibility that MERS-CoV vaccines can elicit TH2 cell immune pathology, as seen with inactivated, vectored and DNA SARS-CoV vaccines. Live-attenuated vaccines and vaccine combinations (for example, inactivated virus combined with DNA vaccines) do not seem to induce this immune phenomenon; thus, these approaches might hold more promise for the development of successful vaccination strategies, particularly in older populations. Adjuvants that promote more robust TH1 cell responses should also be evaluated in more rigorous models. A second concern is that for SARS-CoV escape from neutralization is driven by spike protein variability; thus, spike-dependent vaccine strategies might require multivalent approaches124. For MERS-CoV, the natural variation in the MERS-CoV spike glycoprotein is mostly unknown; thus, it is essential that more natural isolates are recovered and sequenced from humans and reservoir species. Focusing on these priorities will not only help to combat the emergence of MERS-CoV but will also increase our preparedness for any future coronavirus emergence events that originate from the vast, mutable zoonotic reservoir. As such, heterologous SARS-CoV- and MERS-CoV-related isolates that encode even minute variations in the spike protein will be important reagents for evaluating vaccine efficacy against future emerging strains.","Scientists of Rocky Mountain Laboratories are collaborating with Oxford University to develop a chimpanzee adenovirus-vectored COVID-19 vaccine candidate.35 The Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) recently announced the initiation of three programs aimed to develop COVID-19 vaccines by utilizing established vaccine platforms.36 Among the three programs, two are continuations of previously initiated partnerships. CEPI collaborated with Inovio in 2018 to developing DNA vaccine candidates for MERS ($56 M funding). The vaccine in development utilizes DNA Medicines\u2019 platform for delivering synthetic genes into cells for translation into antigenic proteins, which elicit T-cell and antibody responses. CEPI has collaborated with The University of Queensland in 2019 to develop the molecular clamp vaccine platform against multiple viral pathogens including MERS-CoV ($10 M funding). The vaccine platform functions by synthesizing viral surface proteins that get attached to the host cells and clamp them into shape. This facilitates easier recognition of antigens by the immune system.36 Other than these ongoing programs, CEPI has announced funding to Moderna for comparing mRNA therapeutics and vaccines. They will design and manufacture an mRNA vaccine in collaboration with the Vaccine Research Center (VRC) of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), a part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH).37 NIAID-VRC scientists are developing a vaccine candidate expressing SARS-CoV-2 S protein in the mRNA vaccine platform technology. This vaccine is expected to undergo clinical testing in the coming months.35","Compared with other vaccine types such as inactivated virus and viral-vectored vaccines, SARS and MERS subunit vaccines are much safer and do not cause obvious side effects. However, these subunit vaccines may face some important challenges, mostly arising from their relatively low immunogenicity, which must be combined with appropriate adjuvants or optimized for suitable protein sequences, fragment lengths, and immunization schedules. In addition, structure and epitope-based vaccine design has become a promising strategy to improve the efficacy of subunit vaccines. This is evidenced by a structurally designed MERS-CoV RBD-based protein which has significantly improved neutralizing activity and protection against MERS-CoV infection (Du et al., 2016a) . It is prospected that more structureguided novel strategies will be developed to improve the overall immunogenicity and efficacy of subunit vaccines against emerging pathogenic human coronaviruses, including those targeting SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. Although a large number of SARS and MERS subunit vaccines have been developed with potent immunogenicity and/or protection in available animal models, virtually all remain in the preclinical stage. It is thus expected that one or several of these promising subunit vaccines can be further processed into clinical trials to confirm their immunogenicity against viral infections in humans.","To date, there is no anti-viral therapeutics that specifically targets human coronaviruses, so treatment is only supportive. In vitro, interferons (IFNs) are only partially effective against coronaviruses [38] . In vivo, the effectiveness of IFNs combined with ribavirin requires further evaluation [39] . A variety of other agents, including antiviral peptides and corticosteroids have been shown to be effective in vitro and/or in animal models [40, 41] . However, clinical evidence does not support the use of corticosteroid treatment for SARS-CoV-2 lung injury [42] . Vaccines that have been developed are either not effective, or in some cases have been reported to be involved in the selection of novel pathogenic CoVs via recombination of circulating strains [12, 22, 40] . Vaccine development can be a challenge. It is noteworthy that almost 20 years after SARS, there is still no vaccine for coronavirus.","Pandemics such as HIV, Ebola, and Zika have raised the awareness of global threats to human health posed by known as well as newly emerging pathogens and can provide the impetus to prepare against future pandemics by promoting the development of vaccine platforms that can tackle the challenges of outbreak situations. New platforms, such as viral vector and nucleic acid based vaccines meet the prerequisites to provide solutions for some of these challenges by representing highly versatile technologies that allow fast vaccine manufacturing. Each vaccine technology has its own advantages and disadvantages related to its ability to induce certain immune responses, manufacturing capacity and safety for human use (Table 4). Viral vector based vaccines are able to induce potent immune responses against the encoded target antigen. Indeed, a number of clinical trials have demonstrated that viral vector based vaccines such as VSV-ZEBOV show great promise for inducing protective responses in humans. However, antigen delivery in the context of an unrelated virus renders this technology relatively complex in terms of manufacturing. Furthermore, the presence of immune targets other than the target antigen can lead to unfavorable effects such as pre-existing immunity hampering immune responses, as seen for Ad5 vectors, or the inability to use the same technology for repeated vaccinations. In addition, delivery of attenuated viral vectors raises safety concerns due to the risk of adverse events and residual viral replication upon delivery, as detected in a small number of subjects in a clinical trial testing VSV-ZEBOV. DNA based vaccines offer the advantage of allowing a relatively simple, fully synthetic production process. While the presence of non-functional sequences in original DNA vectors raised regulatory safety concerns, newer developments allow minimal constructs that exclusively encode for the target antigen. Several studies have demonstrated the safety of DNA vaccines for human use and clinical trials testing vaccines against influenza and Zika have furthermore highlighted the speed of vaccine development supported by this technology. However, the potential for long term persistence and genomic integration and the dependence on injection devices or electroporation represent some important disadvantages of this technology. Some, especially early, clinical studies testing DNA based vaccines have yielded somewhat discouraging results in terms of immunogenicity, while newer trials, such as studies testing DNA vaccines against Zika virus, have demonstrated that this technology is able to induce promising immune responses. Like DNA vaccines, RNA based vaccine technologies support a comparably simple, fully synthetic manufacturing process that allows production of different vaccines using the same established production process and facility. Their inability for genomic integration and lack of persistence in the cells of the vaccinee offers important advantages in terms of vaccine safety. However, since RNA vaccines represent the most recently developed technology described here, their use in humans is less well characterized than for viral vector or DNA based vaccines. Although further studies will be required to fully characterize this technology in humans, clinical studies conducted so far have yielded overall encouraging results in terms of safety and immunogenicity and provide support for further clinical exploration.","A concerted effort to develop effective drugs and vaccines against existing and potential future coronavirus infections and other highly pathogenic virus outbreaks is necessary to reduce overwhelming impacts on human life and worldwide healthcare systems. Given the costly and arduous process involved with clinical drug development, the outbreak of COVID-19 further highlights the value of developing relatively broad-spectrum antiviral drugs and the importance of applying innovative approaches such as artificial intelligence to facilitate drug discovery. Given the lengthy process of new drug development, the current strategy of drug repurposing has become one of the chosen solutions for immediate treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals. Long-term drug development goals for the pharmaceutical industry include identification of inhibitors aimed at the replication or infection processes associated with SARS-CoV-2 or other related coronaviruses, as well as the symptomatic results of their infections leading to severe disease and/or death. The summarized lists, contained in this report, of small molecule compounds, and additional descriptions of biologics with properties suitable for inhibiting several key coronavirus proteins, could serve as information starting points for drug development. Since vaccines are crucial for prevention of coronavirus-related epidemic diseases in the future, it is reassuring that a number of innovative strategies are already being deployed. Four MERS coronavirus DNA vaccine candidates began phase 1 clinical trials in September of 2019,56 and Moderna Inc. released its first batch of mRNA-1273 in February of 2020, which is an mRNA vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 ready for phase 1 study in the United States.55","There seems little doubt of the amplification role respiratory viral infections play in sensitisation, a virus/allergic synergy 23 . Experimental studies prove that there is a greater increase in bronchial hyperresponsiveness and eosinophilic infiltration with RV inoculation and concomitant or segmental antigen bronchoprovocation and allergenic provocation than with any isolated attack 40 . This is also seen in experimental animal models 41 and in clinical practice when virus infection is in tandem with exposure to allergens 42 . Both models demand the two forms of attack in conjunction as the phenomena will not occur if the two are at an interval greater than a week 43 . This association suggests a simultaneous T Helper (Th) 1 and Th 2 response which is mutually potentiating 44 . The virus can also influence the immune response to foreign agents and heighten specific long-term memory to allergens the patient had contact with in childhood 10 .","There seems little doubt of the amplification role respiratory viral infections play in sensitisation, a virus/allergic synergy 23 .

However, the effects in mice may be more dramatic than those in humans, and there are significant limitations with the current technologies that prevent the full effectiveness of DNA vaccines in larger animals. Whether this approach could be applied to other animal models is still unknown, and its immunogenicity in humans remains to be established. Therefore, it is very important to evaluate the efficacy of this SARS DNA vaccine strategy in some highly relevant translational models to demonstrate human immune responsiveness.","The use of different animal models can be tailored to the goals of each study. Consistency, reproducibility and the relevance of the outcome measures to the scientific question (such as immunogenicity and efficacy of vaccines or pathogenesis of disease) must be considered before one can conclude that a given model is superior to other available models and is the preferred or appropriate model. Clearly, the pathogenesis of disease can only be studied in animal models that replicate key aspects of the disease. But animal models do not need to replicate all aspects of disease to provide useful information in evaluation of vaccines and immunoprophylaxis. For example, an animal model can be useful in vaccine efficacy studies if the following two criteria are met: (i) virus titer correlates with disease severity; and (ii) the virus replicates in the animal model to a sufficiently high titer so that differences in the level of replication between immunized and mock-immunized control groups can be meaningfully distinguished. Under these conditions, demonstration that a vaccine or antibody can prevent or significantly reduce the level of replication of challenge virus would be convincing evidence of efficacy. There is ample precedence for this approach in the development of vaccines against other respiratory viruses.","\u2022 Fill gaps in understanding of the natural history of infection to better define the period of infectiousness and transmissibility; more accurately estimate the reproductive number in various outbreak settings and improve understanding the role of asymptomatic infection. \u2022 Comparative analysis of different quarantine strategies and contexts for their effectiveness and social acceptability \u2022 Enhance and develop an ethical framework for outbreak response that includes better equity for access to interventions for all countries \u2022 Promote the development of point-of-care diagnostic tests \u2022 Determine the best ways to apply knowledge about infection prevention and control in health-care settings in resource-constrained countries (including identification of optimal personal protective equipment) and in the broader community, specifically to understand behaviour among different vulnerable groups \u2022 Support standardised, best evidence-based approach for clinical management and better outcomes and implement randomised, controlled trials for therapeutics and vaccines as promising agents emerge \u2022 Validation of existing serological tests, including those that have been developed by commercial entities, and establishment of biobanks and serum panels of well characterised COVID-19 sera to support such efforts \u2022 Complete work on animal models for vaccine and therapeutic research and development include some identified by the global community and by the Research and Development Blueprint Scientific Advisory Group. The STAG-IH emphasises the importance of the continued rapid sharing of data of public health importance in medical journals that provide rapid peer review and online publication without a paywall. It is sharing of information in this way, as well as technical collaboration among clinicians, epidemiologists, and virologists, that has provided the world with its current understanding of COVID-19.","Failure of host countries to protect the health of refugees and migrants; epidemic of devastating rumours and fake news on social media due to increased digital connectivity; emergence of social influencers exerting influence on politicians and institutions; increased resistance and hesitancy within communities to health interventions because of opposition by local experts Environment Geography affecting biological diversity; planned and unplanned urbanisation; climate change; interaction between humans, animals, and vectors; human development; state of the economy; state of health systems Climate change resulting in increased flooding with failed sanitation and safe water; altered distribution of zoonotic disease reservoirs and vectors; emerging zoonosis with increased agricultural production and human encroachment into animal environments; changing national priorities resulting in sharply reduced investment in health systems Pathogenesis Changing disease biomes; relationship between hosts and pathogens; pathogen evolution and changes; technologies such as synthetic biology, and the risks of manufacturing pathogens and their accidental or deliberate release; characteristics of a population such as underlying disease condition Increased opportunities for mutation or reassortment of infectious agents; increasingly reduced effectiveness of conventional vaccines and therapeutics for prevention and treatment of diseases; failure of conventional control measures to break the chain of transmission of infectious agents To tackle the wide-ranging issues, the Commission has brought together experts from academic, public health, policy making, international, non-governmental, and corporate institutions.

This included creating vaccine strains needed for vaccine manufacturing within weeks of the very first 2009 pandemic H1N1 influenza cases appearing, developing reagents and tests through international collaborations to measure the vaccine's potency, consulting the FDA's expert vaccine advisory committee to review the Agency's approach to approval of the 2009 H1N1 vaccine s as well as extensive in process quality control and product testing. Licensure of vaccines against the 2009 H1N1 influenza virus occurred in September 2009 based on the FDA's determination that standards to ensure the safety and potency of these vaccines had been met. In parallel to these efforts, NIH and vaccine manufacturers initiated clinical trials to determine the optimal vaccine dosage and number of doses needed to induce a protective immune response against pandemic 2009 H1N1 virus.","As regards vaccine development, the long-lived neutralizing antibody response in those who recovered from SARS provides hope that active and passive immunization strategies are feasible, at least in principle. A number of vaccine strategies were developed and tested in laboratory animals, including recombinant vectored vaccines expressing SARS-CoV S protein, DNA vaccines, inactivated whole-virus vaccines and recombinant-protein vaccines (for a review, see Gillim-Ross and Subbarao, 2006) . These studies showed that the S protein is crucial for eliciting effective protective antibody responses, and that there is a good correlation between neutralizing-antibody titers and protection from challenge in animal models. The N protein can induce antigen-specific T-cell-mediated immune responses. An inactivated whole-virus vaccine was tested in phase-1 clinical trials in China. Human monoclonal antibodies that neutralize SARS-CoV were shown to be protective for passive prophylaxis and immunotherapy in laboratory animals (Gillim-Ross and Subbarao, 2006) . However, in the absence of a re-emergence of SARS, there was little incentive to pursue these initiatives, and recent years have not seen progress towards a credible SARS vaccine.","Compared to the large animal models, small animals such as mice and rabbits are preferred due to lower cost, ease of manipulation, and readily available efficacy methods.43 Further studies are needed to recognize suitable models for emerging SARS-CoV-2 by identifying receptor affinity of SARS-CoV-2 and studying disease manifestations, pathologies/viral pathogenesis associated with experimental inoculation of the virus in mice, rats, and other models, as well as examining virus-specific immune responses and protection. This would facilitate preclinical evaluations of candidate COVID-19 vaccines and drugs.","SARS-CoV is an enveloped positive-stranded RNA virus and its \"crown\"-like spike (S) protein has two major biological functions: 1) mediating receptor (angiotensin converting enzyme 2, ACE2) binding and membrane fusion; 2) inducing neutralizing antibody responses [2,3]. The S protein was considered as an important target for developing diagnostics, vaccines and therapeutics [4-12]. The receptor-binding domain (RBD) of S protein was defined as a fragment corresponding to the residues 318 - 510 of the S protein, which mediates viral binding to cell receptor ACE2 [13-15]. Coincidently, we identified the RBD as a major target of neutralizing antibodies [16-19], and proposed it as an ideal vaccine antigen for clinical application [20-22]. The immunogenicity and protective efficacy of RBD-based vaccine candidates have been evaluated in animal models [17,23-25]. However, the antigenicity and immunogenicity of RBD in humans need to be characterized in detail toward developing the RBD-based vaccines and diagnostics. In this short communication, we found that patients recovered from SARS developed potent and persistent RBD-specific antibody responses, highlighting the potentials of clinical applications of RBD-based vaccines and diagnostics."],"title":["COVID-19, an emerging coronavirus infection: advances and prospects in designing and developing vaccines, immunotherapeutics, and therapeutics","Chapter 28 Vaccines for Emerging Viral Diseases","Coronaviruses: Molecular Biology\u2606","Chapter 28 Vaccines for Emerging Viral Diseases","Cellular entry of the SARS coronavirus","COVID-19 infection: Origin, transmission, and characteristics of human coronaviruses","COVID-19, an emerging coronavirus infection: advances and prospects in designing and developing vaccines, immunotherapeutics, and therapeutics","Chimpanzee adenoviral vectors as vaccines for outbreak pathogens","Intranasal and oral vaccination with protein-based antigens: advantages, challenges and formulation strategies","Overview of the CSIRO Australian Animal Health Laboratory","Emergence of Novel Coronavirus 2019-nCoV: Need for Rapid Vaccine and Biologics Development","What are the risks of COVID-19 infection in pregnant women?","A decade after SARS: Strategies to control emerging coronaviruses","COVID-19 infection: Origin, transmission, and characteristics of human coronaviruses","79 Regulation and Testing of Vaccines","How the SARS vaccine effort can learn from HIV\u2014speeding towards the future, learning from the past","Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)\u2014paradigm of an emerging viral infection","Chimpanzee adenoviral vectors as vaccines for outbreak pathogens","Comparative analysis of the immunogenicity of SARS-CoV nucleocapsid DNA vaccine administrated with different routes in mouse model","Chimpanzee adenoviral vectors as vaccines for outbreak pathogens","Evolution of Viruses","Bats and Viruses: Emergence of Novel Lyssaviruses and Association of Bats with Viral Zoonoses in the EU","Vaccine Development Against Middle East Respiratory Syndrome","Calling for rapid development of a safe and effective MERS vaccine","Bats and Viruses: Emergence of Novel Lyssaviruses and Association of Bats with Viral Zoonoses in the EU","Computers and viral diseases.

In the present study, the known SIR model was used for the dynamics of an epidemic to provide a suitable assessment of the COVID-19 virus epidemic in Iran. The epidemic curve and SIR model parameters were obtained with the use of Iran statistical data. The recovered people were considered alongside the official number of confirmed victims as the reliable long-time statistical data of Iran. The results offered many important predictions of the COVID-19 virus epidemic such as realistic number of victims, infection rate, peak time, and other characteristics.","Summary Emerging infectious diseases arising from livestock and wildlife pose serious threats to global human health, as shown by a series of continuous outbreaks involving highly pathogenic influenza, SARS, Ebola and MERS. The risk of pandemics and bioterrorism threats is ever present and growing, but our ability to combat them is limited by the lack of available vaccines, therapeutics and rapid diagnostics. The use of high bio-containment facilities, such as the CSIRO Australian Animal Health Laboratory, plays a key role studying these dangerous pathogens and facilitates the development of countermeasures. To combat diseases like MERS, we must take a holistic approach that involves the development of early biomarkers of infection, a suite of treatment options (vaccines, anti-viral drugs and antibody therapeutics) and appropriate animal models to test the safety and efficacy of candidate treatments.","BACKGROUND: In the absence of effective drugs, controlling SARS relies on the rapid identification of cases and appropriate management of the close contacts, or effective vaccines for SARS. Therefore, developing specific and sensitive laboratory tests for SARS as well as effective vaccines are necessary for national authorities. RESULTS: Genes encoding truncated nucleocapsid (N) and spike (S) proteins of SARSCoV were cloned into the expression vector pQE30 and fusionally expressed in Escherichia coli M15. The fusion protein was analyzed for reactivity with SARS patients' sera and with anti-sera against the two human coronaviruses HCoV 229E and HCoV OC43 by ELISA, IFA and immunoblot assays. Furthermore, to evaluate the antigen-specific humoral antibody and T-cell responses in mice, the fusion protein was injected into 6-week-old BALB/c mice and a neutralization test as well as a T-cell analysis was performed. To evaluate the antiviral efficacy of immunization, BALB/c mice were challenge...","Bats in the EU have been associated with several zoonotic viral pathogens of significance to both human and animal health. Virus discovery continues to expand the existing understating of virus classification, and the increased interest in bats globally as reservoirs or carriers of zoonotic agents has fuelled the continued detection and characterisation of new lyssaviruses and other viral zoonoses. Although the transmission of lyssaviruses from bat species to humans or terrestrial species appears rare, interest in these viruses remains, through their ability to cause the invariably fatal encephalitis\u2014rabies. The association of bats with other viral zoonoses is also of great interest. Much of the EU is free of terrestrial rabies, but several bat species harbor lyssaviruses that remain a risk to human and animal health. Whilst the rabies virus is the main cause of rabies globally, novel related viruses continue to be discovered, predominantly in bat populations, that are of interest pure...","Abstract Background: The protocols of WHO network laboratories facilitated development of rapid diagnosis for SARS coronavirus (CoV) using reverse transcription (RT)-PCR assays. However, several reports have shown that conventional and real-time PCR assays were very specific for SARS CoV but lack sensitivity depending on the assay, specimen, and time course of disease. Objective: To evaluate an automatic nucleic acid extraction system and two standardized real-time PCR assays for rapid diagnosis of SARS CoV during outbreak and post-epidemic periods in Hong Kong. Study design: Specimens from clinically suspected SARS patients collected during outbreak and post-epidemic periods were tested by an automatic nucleic acid extraction system followed by our first generation conventional RT-PCR and two standardized real-time PCR assays (Artus GmbH, Germany and Roche Diagnostics, Germany). Paired serum samples were assayed for increasing titer against SARS CoV. Results: In the SARS epidemic, Art...","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has grown up to be a pandemic within a short span of time. To investigate transmission dynamics and then determine control methodology, we took epidemic in Wuhan as a study case. Unfortunately, to our best knowledge, the existing models are based on the common assumption that the total population follows a homogeneous spatial distribution, which is not the case for the prevalence occurred both in the community and in hospital due to the difference in the contact rate. To solve this problem, we propose a novel epidemic model called SEIR-HC, which is a novel epidemic model with two different social circles. Using the model alongside the exclusive optimization algorithm, the spread process of COVID-19 epidemic in Wuhan city is reproduced and then the propagation characteristics and unknown data are estimated. Furthermore, the control measures implemented in Wuhan are assessed and the control methodology of COVID-19 is discussed to provide guidance f...","The outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003 was controlled by public health measures at a time when specific interventions such as antiviral drugs, vaccines and immunotherapy were not available. Since then, several animal models have been developed for the study of SARS and, although no model replicates the human disease in all aspects, the use of animal models for SARS has led to the establishment of several important principles for vaccine and immunotherapy. Consistency and reproducibility of findings in a given model must be demonstrated to establish the superiority of one model over others. Here, we suggest aspects of an ideal animal model for studies of SARS pathogenesis and vaccine development and present our assessment of the strengths and limitations of the current animal models for SARS.","Abstract The development of strategies to augment the immunogenicity of DNA vaccines is critical for improving their clinical utility. One such strategy involves using the different immune routes with DNA vaccines. In the present study, the immunogenicity of SARS-CoV nucleocapsid DNA vaccine, induced by using the current routine vaccination routes (intramuscularly, by electroporation, or orally using live-attenuated Salmonella typhimurium), was compared in mouse model. The comparison between the three vaccination routes indicated that immunization intramuscularly induced a moderate T cell response and antibody response. Mice administrated by electroporation induced the highest antibody response among the three immunization groups and a mid-level of cellular response. In contrast, the orally DNA vaccine evoked vigorous T cell response and a weak antibody production. These results indicated that the distinct types of immune responses were generated by the different routes of DNA immuniza...","Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the cause of the ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), a public health emergency of international concern declared by the World Health Organization (WHO). An immuno-informatics approach along with comparative genomic was applied to design a multi-epitope-based peptide vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 combining the antigenic epitopes of the S, M and E proteins. The tertiary structure was predicted, refined and validated using advanced bioinformatics tools. The candidate vaccine showed an average of \u2265 90.0% world population coverage for different ethnic groups. Molecular docking of the chimeric vaccine peptide with the immune receptors (TLR3 and TLR4) predicted efficient binding. Immune simulation predicted significant primary immune response with increased IgM and secondary immune response with high levels of both IgG1 and IgG2. It also increased the proliferation of T-helper cells and cytotoxic T-cells along w...","Exotic and emerging viral pathogens associated with high morbidity and mortality in humans are being identified annually with recent examples including Lujo virus in southern Africa, Severe Fever with Thrombocytopenia Syndrome virus in China and a SARS-like coronavirus in the Middle East. The sporadic nature of these infections hampers our understanding of these diseases and limits the opportunities to design appropriate medical countermeasures against them. Because of this, animal models are utilized to gain insight into the pathogenesis of disease with the overall goal of identifying potential targets for intervention and evaluating specific therapeutics and vaccines. For these reasons it is imperative that animal models of disease recapitulate the human condition as closely as possible in order to provide the best predictive data with respect to the potential efficacy in humans. In this article we review the current status of disease models for highly pathogenic and emerging viral p...","Abstract An important effort has been performed after the emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic in 2003 to diagnose and prevent virus spreading. Several types of vaccines have been developed including inactivated viruses, subunit vaccines, virus-like particles (VLPs), DNA vaccines, heterologous expression systems, and vaccines derived from SARS-CoV genome by reverse genetics. This review describes several aspects essential to develop SARS-CoV vaccines, such as the correlates of protection, virus serotypes, vaccination side effects, and bio-safeguards that can be engineered into recombinant vaccine approaches based on the SARS-CoV genome. The production of effective and safe vaccines to prevent SARS has led to the development of promising vaccine candidates, in contrast to the design of vaccines for other coronaviruses, that in general has been less successful. After preclinical trials in animal models, efficacy and safety evaluation of the most promising vaccin...","Summary Respiratory viruses that emerge in the human population may cause high morbidity and mortality, as well as concern about pandemic spread. Examples are severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and novel variants of influenza A virus, such as H5N1 and pandemic H1N1. Different animal models are used to develop therapeutic and preventive measures against such viruses, but it is not clear which are most suitable. Therefore, this review compares animal models of SARS and influenza, with an emphasis on non-human primates, ferrets and cats. Firstly, the pathology and pathogenesis of SARS and influenza are compared. Both diseases are similar in that they affect mainly the respiratory tract and cause inflammation and necrosis centred on the pulmonary alveoli and bronchioles. Important differences are the presence of multinucleated giant cells and intra-alveolar fibrosis in SARS and more fulminant necrotizing and haemorrhagic pneumonia in H5N1 influenza. Secondly, the path...","Abstract Two novel coronaviruses have emerged to cause severe disease in humans. While bats may be the primary reservoir for both viruses, SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) likely crossed into humans from civets in China, and MERS coronavirus (MERS-CoV) has been transmitted from camels in the Middle East. Unlike SARS-CoV that resolved within a year, continued introductions of MERS-CoV present an on-going public health threat. Animal models are needed to evaluate countermeasures against emerging viruses. With SARS-CoV, several animal species were permissive to infection. In contrast, most laboratory animals are refractory or only semi-permissive to infection with MERS-CoV. This host-range restriction is largely determined by sequence heterogeneity in the MERS-CoV receptor. We describe animal models developed to study coronaviruses, with a focus on host-range restriction at the level of the viral receptor and discuss approaches to consider in developing a model to evaluate countermeasures agai...","AbstractThe outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in China caused by SARS-CoV-2 virus continually lead to worldwide human infections and deaths. It is currently no specific viral protein targeted therapeutics yet. Viral nucleocapsid protein is a potential antiviral drug target, serving multiple critical functions during the viral life cycle. However, the structural information of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein is yet to be clear. Herein, we have determined the 2.7 \u00c5 crystal structure of the N-terminal RNA binding domain of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein. Although overall structure is similar with other reported coronavirus nucleocapsid protein N-terminal domain, the surface electrostatic potential characteristics between them are distinct. Further comparison with mild virus type HCoV-OC43 equivalent domain demonstrates a unique potential RNA binding pocket alongside the \u03b2-sheet core. Complemented by in vitro binding studies, our data provide several atomic resolution features of...","Most pathogens initiate their infections at the human mucosal surface. Therefore, mucosal vaccination, especially through oral or intranasal administration routes, is highly desired for infectious diseases. Meanwhile, protein-based antigens provide a safer alternative to the whole pathogen or DNA based ones in vaccine development. However, the unique biopharmaceutical hurdles that intranasally or orally delivered protein vaccines need to overcome before they reach the sites of targeting, the relatively low immunogenicity, as well as the low stability of the protein antigens, require thoughtful and fine-tuned mucosal vaccine formulations, including the selection of immunostimulants, the identification of the suitable vaccine delivery system, and the determination of the exact composition and manufacturing conditions. This review aims to provide an up-to-date survey of the protein antigen-based vaccine formulation development, including the usage of immunostimulants and the optimization ...","The novel coronavirus infection (COVID-19 or Coronavirus disease 2019) that emerged from Wuhan, Hubei province of China has spread to many countries worldwide. Efforts have been made to develop vaccines against human coronavirus (CoV) infections such as MERS and SARS in the past decades. However, to date, no licensed antiviral treatment or vaccine exists for MERS and SARS. Most of the efforts for developing CoV vaccines and drugs target the spike glycoprotein or S protein, the major inducer of neutralizing antibodies. Although a few candidates have shown efficacy in in vitro studies, not many have progressed to randomized animal or human trials, hence may have limited use to counter COVID-19 infection. This article highlights ongoing advances in designing vaccines and therapeutics to counter COVID-19 while also focusing on such experiences and advances as made with earlier SARS- and MERS-CoVs, which together could enable efforts to halt this emerging virus infection.","To identify a major antigenic determinant for use in the development of a rapid serological diagnostic test for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus infection and to study the immune response during SARS coronavirus infection in humans, we cloned the full length and six truncated fragments of the nucleocapsid gene, expressed them, and purified them as glutathione S-transferase-tagged recombinant proteins. The reactivities of the recombinant proteins to a panel of antibodies containing 33 SARS coronavirus-positive sera and 66 negative sera and to antibodies against other animal coronaviruses were screened. A truncated 195-amino-acid fragment from the C terminus of the nucleocapsid protein (N195) was identified that had a strong ability to detect antibodies against SARS coronavirus. No cross-reaction was found between the N195 protein and antibodies against chicken, pig, and canine coronaviruses. The N195 protein was used to develop a Western blot assay to detect antibodi...","Rapid diagnostics, vaccines and therapeutics are important interventions for the management of the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak. It is timely to systematically review the potential of these interventions, including those for Middle East respiratory syndrome-Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV, to guide policymakers globally on their prioritization of resources for research and development. A systematic search was carried out in three major electronic databases (PubMed, Embase and Cochrane Library) to identify published studies in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Supplementary strategies through Google Search and personal communications were used. A total of 27 studies fulfilled the criteria for review. Several laboratory protocols for confirmation of suspected 2019-nCoV cases using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) have been publ...","Coronaviruses (CoVs) have formerly been regarded as relatively harmless respiratory pathogens to humans. However, two outbreaks of severe respiratory tract infection, caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), as a result of zoonotic CoVs crossing the species barrier, caused high pathogenicity and mortality rates in human populations. This brought CoVs global attention and highlighted the importance of controlling infectious pathogens at international borders. In this review, we focus on our current understanding of the epidemiology, pathogenesis, prevention, and treatment of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, as well as provides details on the pivotal structure and function of the spike proteins (S proteins) on the surface of each of these viruses. For building up more suitable animal models, we compare the current animal models recapitulating pathogenesis and summarize the potential role of host receptor...","Summary The causative agent of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), which affected over 8000 individuals worldwide and was responsible for over 700 deaths in the 2002\u20132003 outbreak, is a coronavirus that was unknown before the outbreak. Although many different treatments were used during the outbreak, none were implemented in a controlled fashion. Thus, the optimal treatment for SARS is unknown. Since the outbreak, much work has been done testing new agents against SARS using in-vitro methods and animal models. In addition, global research efforts have focused on the development of vaccines against SARS. Efforts should be made to evaluate the most promising treatments and vaccines in controlled clinical trials, should another SARS outbreak occur.","Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) is a newly emerging infectious disease caused by a novel coronavirus, MERS-coronavirus (MERS-CoV), a new member in the lineage C of \u03b2-coronavirus (\u03b2-CoV). The increased human cases and high mortality rate of MERS-CoV infection make it essential to develop safe and effective vaccines. In this review, the current advancements and potential strategies in the development of MERS vaccines, particularly subunit vaccines based on MERS-CoV spike (S) protein and its receptor-binding domain (RBD), are discussed. How to improve the efficacy of subunit vaccines through novel adjuvant formulations and routes of administration as well as currently available animal models for evaluating the in vivo efficacy of MERS-CoV vaccines are also addressed. Overall, these strategies may have important implications for the development of effective and safe vaccines for MERS-CoV in the future.","Abstract RNA viruses are a significant source of morbidity and mortality in humans every year. Additionally, the potential use of these viruses in acts of bioterrorism poses a threat to national security. Given the paucity of vaccines or postexposure therapeutics for many highly pathogenic RNA viruses, novel treatments are badly needed. Sequence-based drug design, under development for almost 20 years, is proving effective in animal models and has moved into clinical trials. Important advances in the field include the characterization of RNA interference in mammalian cells and chemical modifications that can dramatically increase the in vivo stability of therapeutic oligonucleotides. Antisense strategies utilize single-stranded DNA oligonucleotides that inhibit protein production by mediating the catalytic degradation of target mRNA, or by binding to sites on mRNA essential for translation. Double-stranded RNA oligonucleotides, known as short-interfering RNAs (siRNAs), also mediate the...","Objective To provide an overview of supply and demand issues in the vaccine industry and the policy options that have been implemented to resolve these issues. Data sources Medline, Policy File, and International Pharmaceutical Abstracts were searched to locate academic journal articles. Other sources reviewed included texts on the topics of vaccine history and policy, government agency reports, and reports from independent think tanks. Keywords included vaccines, immunizations, supply, demand, and policy. Study selection Search criteria were limited to English language and human studies. Articles pertaining to vaccine demand, supply, and public policy were selected and reviewed for inclusion. Data extraction By the authors. Data synthesis Vaccines are biologic medications, therefore making their development and production more difficult and costly compared with \u201csmall-molecule\u201d drugs. Research and development costs for vaccines can exceed $800 million, and development may require 10 y...","Cellular entry of enveloped viruses is often dependent on attachment proteins expressed on the host cell surface. Viral envelope proteins bind these receptors, and, in an incompletely understood process, facilitate fusion of the cellular and viral membranes so as to introduce the viral core into the cytoplasm. Only a small fraction of viral receptors have been identified so far. Recently, a novel coronavirus was identified as the etiological agent of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). The fusion protein gene of SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) was cloned and characterized, and shortly thereafter, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) was shown to be its functional receptor. Identification of ACE2 as a receptor for SARS-CoV will likely contribute to the development of antivirals and vaccines. It may also contribute to the development of additional animal models for studying SARS pathogenesis, and could help identify the animal reservoir of SARS-CoV.","Abstract This chapter reviews the main viral pathogens of the respiratory tract, the immune responses they induce, currently available vaccines, and vaccines that are in development to control them. The main viruses responsible for acute respiratory infection in people include respiratory syncytial, influenza, human parainfluenza, human metapneumo-, human rhino-, corona-, and adenoviruses. Licensed vaccines are available only for influenza virus, with vaccines against the other pathogens either in clinical trials or in preclinical stages of development. The majority of studies evaluating respiratory virus vaccines measure serum antibody responses, because, although both cellular and humoral responses contribute to the clearance of a primary infection, neutralizing antibodies are known to protect against secondary infection. Humoral responses can be readily detected after vaccination with inactivated or subunit vaccines; however, fewer individuals seroconvert after vaccination with live...","The immunogenicity of SARS-CoV nucleocapsid DNA vaccine and the immunoregulatory activity of interleukin-2 (IL-2) were investigated. DNA vaccine plasmids, pcDNA-N and pcDNA-IL2, were constructed and inoculated into BALB/c mice with or without pcDNA-IL2 by intramuscular injection. Cellular and humoral immune responses were assessed by indirect ELISA, lymphocyte proliferation assays, ELISPOT and FACS. The nucleocapsid DNA vaccine had good immunogenicity and can induce specific humoral and cellular immunity in BALB/c mice, while IL-2 plays an immunoadjuvant role and enhances specific immune responses. This study provides a frame of reference for the design of DNA vaccines against SARS-CoV.","Abstract Data on the burden of disease and circulation patterns of influenza B lineages for Brazil are limited. This review aims to describe the pattern of influenza B occurrence in Brazil to have a better understanding of its epidemiology and its relevance when considering seasonal influenza vaccine composition. A review of the data including analysis of international and local surveillance data as well as information from online search of databases using Medical Subject Headings terms in conjunction with screening of abstracts from scientific events was performed. Based on international epidemiologic surveillance data, moderate levels of influenza B disease (19%; 2006\u20132014) were observed. Of these nine years, it was possible to compare data from three years (2007, 2008 and 2013) which have information on the circulating influenza B lineage. Co-circulation of influenza B lineages was observed in all these three influenza seasons, of which, during one season, a high degree of mismatch ...","Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is caused by a novel coronavirus (CoV), SARS-CoV. In previous studies, we showed that a SARS-CoV spike (S) glycoprotein-based modified vaccinia Ankara (MVA-S) vaccine could induce strong neutralizing antibody (Nab) response which might have played a critical role in protecting Chinese rhesus monkeys from the pathogenic viral challenge. To date, however, it remains unknown what the minimal level of Nab is required to achieve sterile immunity in humans. It is therefore important to explore techniques to maximize the level of Nab response in vivo. Here, we evaluate various vaccination regimens using combinations of DNA-S, MVA-S, and adenovirus type 5 (Ad5-S) vaccines. We show that in vaccinated mice and rabbits, a heterologous MVA-S prime with Ad5-S boost regimen induces the highest and most persistent level of Nab response when compared with other combinations. Interestingly, the initial level of Nab after prime does not necessarily predict the ma...","SARS-CoV-2 has infected over 140,000 people as of March 14, 2020. We use a mathematical model to investigate the effectiveness of social distancing interventions lasting six weeks in a middle-sized city in the US. We explore four social distancing strategies by reducing the contacts of adults over 60 years old, adults over 60 years old and children, all adults (25, 75 or 95% compliance), and everyone in the population. Our results suggest that social distancing interventions can avert cases by 20% and hospitalizations and deaths by 90% even with modest compliance within adults as long as the intervention is kept in place, but the epidemic is set to rebound once the intervention is lifted. Our models suggest that social distancing interventions will buy crucial time but need to occur in conjunction with testing and contact tracing of all suspected cases to mitigate transmission of SARS-CoV-2.","Abstract The latest advancements in drug development are structure-assisted and computer-aided identification, design, and synthesis of target-specific antiviral. Structural virology of animal viruses has made valuable contribution to our understanding of viruses in general, replication, evolution, and interaction with the host. Structure\u2013function relation studies are definitely the need of the hour for rational design of drugs and vaccines to effectively treat animal viral diseases. These studies are important for economical, veterinary, and human medical perspectives. X-ray crystallography, nuclear magnetic resonance and cryo-electron microscopy techniques elaborate the structure\u2013function relation studies by utilizing various computational approaches for structure-assisted designing of drug molecules and antiviral against viruses. Availability of protein three-dimensional structures, high-performance computing, data management software, and internet are enhancing the modern day drug ...","Abstract Background The severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus is a member of the Coronaviridae (CoV) family that first appeared in the Guangdong Province of China in 2002 and was recognized as an emerging infectious disease in March 2003. Over 8000 cases and 900 deaths occurred during the epidemic. We report the safety and immunogenicity of a SARS DNA vaccine in a Phase I human study. Methods A single-plasmid DNA vaccine encoding the Spike (S) glycoprotein was evaluated in 10 healthy adults. Nine subjects completed the 3 dose vaccination schedule and were evaluated for vaccine safety and immune responses. Immune response was assessed by intracellular cytokine staining (ICS), ELISpot, ELISA, and neutralization assays. Results The vaccine was well tolerated. SARS-CoV-specific antibody was detected by ELISA in 8 of 10 subjects and neutralizing antibody was detected in all subjects who received 3 doses of vaccine. SARS-CoV-specific CD4+ T-cell responses were detected in all vaccin...","The Brighton Collaboration Viral Vector Vaccines Safety Working Group (V3SWG) was formed to evaluate the safety and characteristics of live, recombinant viral vector vaccines. A recent publication by the V3SWG described live, attenuated, recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (rVSV) as a chimeric virus vaccine for HIV-1 (Clarke et al., 2016). The rVSV vector system is being explored as a platform for development of multiple vaccines. This paper reviews the molecular and biological features of the rVSV vector system, followed by a template with details on the safety and characteristics of a rVSV vaccine against Zaire ebolavirus (ZEBOV). The rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine is a live, replication competent vector in which the VSV glycoprotein (G) gene is replaced with the glycoprotein (GP) gene of ZEBOV. Multiple copies of GP are expressed and assembled into the viral envelope responsible for inducing protective immunity. The vaccine (designated V920) was originally constructed by the National Microbi...","An emerging respiratory infectious disease with high mortality, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), is caused by a novel coronavirus (MERS-CoV). It was first reported in 2012 in Saudi Arabia and has now spread to eight countries. Development of effective therapeutics and vaccines is crucial to save lives and halt the spread of MERS-CoV. Here, we show that a recombinant protein containing a 212-amino acid fragment (residues 377-588) in the truncated receptor-binding domain (RBD: residues 367\u2013606) of MERS-CoV spike (S) protein fused with human IgG Fc fragment (S377-588-Fc) is highly expressed in the culture supernatant of transfected 293T cells. The purified S377-588-Fc protein efficiently binds to dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), the receptor of MERS-CoV, and potently inhibited MERS-CoV infection, suggesting its potential to be further developed as a therapeutic modality for treating MERS-CoV infection and saving the patients\u2019 lives. The recombinant S377-588-Fc is able to induce in t...","AIM To investigate the characteristics and clinical value of chest computed tomography (CT) images of novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP). MATERIALS AND METHODS Clinical data and CT images of 80 cases of NCP were collected. The clinical manifestations and laboratory test results of the patients were analysed. The lesions in each lung segment of the patient's chest CT images were characterised. Lesions were scored according to length and diffusivity. RESULTS The main clinical manifestations were fever, dry cough, fatigue, a little white sputum, or diarrhoea. A total of 1,702 scored lesions were found in the first chest CT images of 80 patients. The lesions were located mainly in the subpleural area of the lungs (92.4%). Most of the lesions were ground-glass opacity, and subsequent fusions could increase in range and spread mainly in the subpleural area. Pulmonary consolidation accounted for 44.1% of all of the lesions. Of the 80 cases, 76 patients (95%) had bilateral lung disease, four (5...","The newly emerged Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is becoming another \u201cSARS-like\u201d threat to the world. It has an extremely high death rate (\u223c50%) as there is no vaccine or efficient therapeutics. The identification of the structures of both the MERS-CoV receptor binding domain (RBD) and its complex with dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), raises the hope of alleviating this currently severe situation. In this review, we examined the molecular basis of the RBD-receptor interaction to outline why/how could we use MERS-CoV RBD to develop vaccines and antiviral drugs.","Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a newly emerging infectious disease caused by a novel coronavirus, SARS-coronavirus (SARS-CoV). The SARS-CoV spike (S) protein is composed of two subunits; the S1 subunit contains a receptor-binding domain that engages with the host cell receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 and the S2 subunit mediates fusion between the viral and host cell membranes. The S protein plays key parts in the induction of neutralizing-antibody and T-cell responses, as well as protective immunity, during infection with SARS-CoV. In this Review, we highlight recent advances in the development of vaccines and therapeutics based on the S protein.","Filoviruses are emerging pathogens and causative agents of viral haemorrhagic fever. Case fatality rates of filovirus disease outbreaks are among the highest reported for any human pathogen, exceeding 90% (ref. 1). Licensed therapeutic or vaccine products are not available to treat filovirus diseases. Candidate therapeutics previously shown to be efficacious in non-human primate disease models are based on virus-specific designs and have limited broad-spectrum antiviral potential. Here we show that BCX4430, a novel synthetic adenosine analogue, inhibits infection of distinct filoviruses in human cells. Biochemical, reporter-based and primer-extension assays indicate that BCX4430 inhibits viral RNA polymerase function, acting as a non-obligate RNA chain terminator. Post-exposure intramuscular administration of BCX4430 protects against Ebola virus and Marburg virus disease in rodent models. Most importantly, BCX4430 completely protects cynomolgus macaques from Marburg virus infection whe...","Human coronaviruses (HCoVs) are large RNA viruses that infect the human respiratory tract. The emergence of both Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome and Middle East Respiratory syndrome CoVs as well as the yearly circulation of four common CoVs highlights the importance of elucidating the different mechanisms employed by these viruses to evade the host immune response, determine their tropism and identify antiviral compounds. Various animal models have been established to investigate HCoV infection, including mice and non-human primates. To establish a link between the research conducted in animal models and humans, an organotypic human airway culture system, that recapitulates the human airway epithelium, has been developed. Currently, different cell culture systems are available to recapitulate the human airways, including the Air-Liquid Interface (ALI) human airway epithelium (HAE) model. Tracheobronchial HAE cultures recapitulate the primary entry point of human respiratory viruses w...","We used a combination approach of conventional virus isolation and molecular techniques to detect human metapneumovirus (HMPV) in patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). Of the 48 study patients, 25 (52.1%) were infected with HMPV; 6 of these 25 patients were also infected with coronavirus, and another 5 patients (10.4%) were infected with coronavirus alone. Using this combination approach, we found that human laryngeal carcinoma (HEp-2) cells were superior to rhesus monkey kidney (LLC-MK2) cells commonly used in previous studies for isolation of HMPV. These widely available HEp-2 cells should be included in conjunction with a molecular method for cell culture followup to detect HMPV, particularly in patients with SARS.","SUMMARY Since 1976 Ebola virus regularly has caused small deadly outbreaks in Central Africa, usually controlled in a few months. For the first time, an Ebola epidemic of exceptional magnitude dramatically engulfed several countries in West Africa since December 2013. Major failures of implementing measures to prevent human-to-human transmissions are the main cause of this large-scale Ebola outbreak. After about one-week incubation period, the Ebola virus disease is characterized by a sudden onset of high fever leading to multiple hemorrhages and to widespread organ failure. Several bat species constitute the main reservoirs of Ebola viruses. Human contamination would occur either directly from bats, widely consumed by the local populations, or through animal species susceptible to Ebola infection, such as chimpanzees and gorillas. Alongside this \u201cnatural cycle\u201d, an \u201cepidemic cycle\u201d involving domestic animals living in villages such as dogs or pigs, is seriously suggested. Thus, accord...","Abstract An effective vaccine for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) will probably require the generation and maintenance of both humoral and cellular immune responses. It has been reported that after natural infection in humans and immunization in animals with SARS-CoV vaccine, antibody is produced and persistent for a long period of time. In the present study, mice were immunized i.m. with SARS-CoV S DNA vaccine, and three different methods (ELISA, ELISPOT and FACS) were used to evaluate the immune responses when the cells were stimulated in vitro with a pool of peptides overlapping entire SARS spike protein. The results show that prime-immunization with SARS-CoV S DNA vaccine can induce both CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses. Boosting with the same vaccine enhances CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses in both lymphoid and nonlymphoid organs and were persistent over two months. The SARS-CoV S-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were CD62L\u2212, a marker for memory cells, and \u221230 to 50% of the ce...","Recent outbreaks of infectious pathogens such as Zika, Ebola, and COVID-19 have underscored the need for the dependable availability of vaccines against emerging infectious diseases (EIDs). The cost and risk of R&amp;D programs and uniquely unpredictable demand for EID vaccines have discouraged vaccine developers, and government and nonprofit agencies have been unable to provide timely or sufficient incentives for their development and sustained supply. We analyze the economic returns of a portfolio of EID vaccine assets, and find that under realistic financing assumptions, the expected returns are significantly negative, implying that the private sector is unlikely to address this need without public-sector intervention. We have sized the financing deficit for this portfolio and propose several potential solutions, including price increases, enhanced public-private partnerships, and subscription models through which individuals would pay annual fees to obtain access to a portfolio of vacc...","Welcome to the New Year and a new issue of the Biomedical Journal, where we learn that travelling with company boosts the metastatic potential of circulating tumour cells, as well as that a worm could be an excellent model to study antidiabetic drugs. In addition, we discover another pair of molecular scissors for genetic engineering, how exactly Leptospira wreaks havoc on its run through the host organism, and that hyperparathyroidism brings its own risks, but does not worsen the outcome of papillary thyroid carcinoma. Furthermore, the importance of taking into account differing beauty ideals for aesthetic surgery surveys is discussed, alongside the question how bad isolated local recurrence is in the case of HR + breast cancer. Finally, we find out that virtual colonoscopy deserves more credit, that the first medical experiment in space was all about the H-reflex, and that it is possible to survive advanced necrotising fasciitis of the face and neck.","Background: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a virus that causes severe respiratory illness in humans, which eventually results in the current outbreak of novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) around the world. The research community is interested to know what are the hotspots in coronavirus (CoV) research and how much is known about COVID-19. This study aimed to evaluate the characteristics of publications involving coronaviruses as well as COVID-19 by using a topic modeling analysis. Methods: We extracted all abstracts and retained the most informative words from the COVID-19 Open Research Dataset, which contains all the 35,092 pieces of coronavirus related literature published up to March 20, 2020. Using Latent Dirichlet Allocation modeling, we trained an eight-topic model from the corpus. We then analyzed the semantic relationships between topics and compared the topic distribution between COVID-19 and other CoV infections. Results: Eight topics emerge...","Predicting vaccine efficacy remains a challenge. We used a systems vaccinology approach to identify early innate immune correlates of antibody induction in humans receiving the Ebola vaccine rVSV-ZEBOV. Blood samples from days 0, 1, 3, 7, and 14 were analyzed for changes in cytokine levels, innate immune cell subsets, and gene expression. Integrative statistical analyses with cross-validation identified a signature of 5 early innate markers correlating with antibody titers on day 28 and beyond. Among those, IP-10 on day 3 and MFI of CXCR6 on NK cells on day 1 were independent correlates. Consistently, we found an early gene expression signature linked to IP-10. This comprehensive characterization of early innate immune responses to the rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine in humans revealed immune signatures linked to IP-10. These results suggest correlates of vaccine-induced antibody induction and provide a rationale to explore strategies for augmenting the effectiveness of vaccines through manipulatio...","Abstract A novel approach modifying cells to express viral markers to elicit protective immunity responses (decoy cellular vaccination) in the prevention of COVID-19 disease is currently being explored. Our approach entails utilizing SARS-CoV-2 Spike antigen-expressing, non-replicating cells as carriers and presenters of immunogenic antigens, so called \u201cI-cells\u201d. By using irradiated cells as presenting vehicles of SARS-CoV-2 viral antigens(s) in a cellular context, these presented viral proteins can be recognized by the host immune system, thus, an efficient protective immune response might be elicited. Another advantage of this strategy is that the manufacturing process is scalable and yields uniform cell products allowing for \u201coff-the-shelf\u201d frozen supply availability. To prevent engraftment and proliferation of the cells after administration, the cells will be irradiated post-harvesting abolishing in vivo replication potential. Specifically, immunoreactive Spike-1 proteins from SARS...","Ever since the development of the first vaccine more than 200 years ago, vaccinations have greatly decreased the burden of infectious diseases worldwide, famously leading to the eradication of small pox and allowing the restriction of diseases such as polio, tetanus, diphtheria, and measles. A multitude of research efforts focuses on the improvement of established and the discovery of new vaccines such as the HPV (human papilloma virus) vaccine in 2006. However, radical changes in the density, age distribution and traveling habits of the population worldwide as well as the changing climate favor the emergence of old and new pathogens that bear the risk of becoming pandemic threats. In recent years, the rapid spread of severe infections such as HIV, SARS, Ebola, and Zika have highlighted the dire need for global preparedness for pandemics, which necessitates the extremely rapid development and comprehensive distribution of vaccines against potentially previously unknown pathogens. What ...","Seven coronaviruses (CoVs) have been isolated from humans so far. Among them, three emerging pathogenic CoVs, including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and a newly identified CoV (2019-nCoV), once caused or continue to cause severe infections in humans, posing significant threats to global public health. SARS-CoV infection in humans (with about 10% case fatality rate) was first reported from China in 2002, while MERS-CoV infection in humans (with about 34.4% case fatality rate) was first reported from Saudi Arabia in June 2012. 2019-nCoV was first reported from China in December 2019, and is currently infecting more than 70000 people (with about 2.7% case fatality rate). Both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are zoonotic viruses, using bats as their natural reservoirs, and then transmitting through intermediate hosts, leading to human infections. Nevertheless, the intermediate host for 2019-nCoV is still under inve...","The emergence of new pathogens, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and Ebola virus, poses serious challenges to global public health and highlights the urgent need for novel antiviral approaches. Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) have been successfully used to treat various diseases, particularly cancer and immunological disorders. Antigen-specific mAbs have been isolated using several different approaches, including hybridoma, transgenic mice, phage display, yeast display, and single B-cell isolation. Consequently, an increasing number of mAbs, which exhibit high potency against emerging viruses in vitro and in animal models of infection, have been developed. In this paper, we summarize historical trends and recent developments in mAb discovery, compare the advantages and disadvantages of various approaches to mAb production, and discuss the potential use of such strategies for the development of antivi...","Abstract Coronaviruses may cause respiratory, enteric and central nervous system diseases in many species, including humans. Until recently, the relatively low burden of disease in humans caused by few of these viruses hampered development of coronavirus specific therapeutics. However, the emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) has prompted the discovery of such drugs. Subsequent studies in animal models demonstrated the efficacy of SARS-CoV specific monoclonal antibodies, pegylated-interferon-\u03b1 and siRNAs against SARS-CoV. Furthermore, several antivirals shown to be effective against other viruses were tested in vitro. Because of availability and shown efficacy, the use of interferons may be considered should SARS-CoV or a related coronavirus (re)-emerge. The more recent design of wide-spectrum inhibitors targeting the coronavirus main proteases may lead to the discovery of new antivirals against multiple coronavirus induced diseases."],"title":["Prediction of Peak and Termination of Novel Coronavirus Covid-19 Epidemic in Iran","Overview of the CSIRO Australian Animal Health Laboratory","The expression and antigenicity of
