During the initial isolation of 13 individuals confirmed positive with COVID-19 infection, air and surface samples were collected in eleven isolation rooms to examine viral shedding from isolated individuals. While all individuals were confirmed positive for SARS-CoV-2, symptoms and viral shedding to the environment varied considerably. Many commonly used items, toilet facilities, and air samples had evidence of viral contamination, indicating that SARS-CoV-2 is shed to the environment as expired particles, during toileting, and through contact with fomites. Disease spread through both direct (droplet and person-to-person) as well as indirect contact (contaminated objects and airborne transmission) are indicated, supporting the use of airborne isolation precautions.","A novel \u03b2-coronavirus (2019-nCoV) caused severe and even fetal pneumonia explored in a seafood market of Wuhan city, Hubei province, China, and rapidly spread to other provinces of China and other countries. The 2019-nCoV was different from SARS-CoV, but shared the same host receptor the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). The natural host of 2019-nCoV may be the bat Rhinolophus affinis as 2019-nCoV showed 96.2% of whole-genome identity to BatCoV RaTG13. The person-to-person transmission routes of 2019-nCoV included direct transmission, such as cough, sneeze, droplet inhalation transmission, and contact transmission, such as the contact with oral, nasal, and eye mucous membranes. 2019-nCoV can also be transmitted through the saliva, and the fetal\u2013oral routes may also be a potential person-to-person transmission route. The participants in dental practice expose to tremendous risk of 2019-nCoV infection due to the face-to-face communication and the exposure to saliva, blood, an...","Background: Severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a newly identified virus which mainly spreads from person-to-person. Fecal shedding of SARS-CoV-2 has been constantly reported in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Most published studies focus on adult populations, whereas data concerning pediatric patients is relatively scarce. Methods: From January 17, 2020 to March 6, 2020, three pediatric cases of COVID-19 were reported in Qingdao, Shandong Province, China. Epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment data of these children were collected. Real-time fluorescence reverse-transcriptase-polymerase-chain reaction (RT-PCR) was performed to detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA in throat swabs and fecal specimens. Results: All the three pediatric cases were household contacts of adults whose symptoms developed earlier. There has been no evidence showing the virus was transmitted from the children to others. Severity of disease of ...","Prolonged viral shedding is associated with severe status and poor prognosis of COVID-19 patients. Unexpectedly, here we report a non-severe patient with the longest duration of viral shedding. According to the investigation on the clinical and epidemiological information of this case, we concluded that this type of virus might have a low toxicity and transmissibility, but have a prolonged infective ability and was hardly to be eliminated in the body with regular therapy. However, infusion of plasma from recovered patients showed high efficiency in elimination of this virus. Our findings might shed light on the management of COVID-19.","In December 2019, a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) caused an outbreak in Wuhan, China, and soon spread to other parts of the world. It was believed that 2019-nCoV was transmitted through respiratory tract and then induced pneumonia, thus molecular diagnosis based on oral swabs was used for confirmation of this disease. Likewise, patient will be released upon two times of negative detection from oral swabs. However, many coronaviruses can also be transmitted through oral\u2013fecal route by infecting intestines. Whether 2019-nCoV infected patients also carry virus in other organs like intestine need to be tested. We conducted investigation on patients in a local hospital who were infected with this virus. We found the presence of 2019-nCoV in anal swabs and blood as well, and more anal swab positives than oral swab positives in a later stage of infection, suggesting shedding and thereby transmitted through oral\u2013fecal route. We also showed serology test can improve detection positive rate thus...","The use of viral agents for biological warfare has a long history, which predates their recognition and isolation by culture. Advances in viral culture and virus stabilization made during the second half of the twentieth century raised the level of concern by facilitating the large-scale production of viral agents for aerosol dissemination. Furthermore, the nucleic acid of many viruses, including some that are currently not threats, can be manipulated in the laboratory. Thus, the potential for genetic engineering and misuse of biotechnology is a serious threat. An effective defense against viral agents requires a comprehensive approach including restricting access to viral stocks, detecting deliberately induced disease outbreaks, rapid laboratory identification of viral agents in clinical specimens, preventing person-to-person transmission, using reliable decontamination procedures, and developing effective vaccines and antiviral drugs.","Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) has recently emerged in the Middle East. Since 2012, there have been approximately 2,100 confirmed cases, with a 35% case fatality rate. Disease severity has been linked to patient health status, as people with chronic diseases or an immunocompromised status fare worse, although the mechanisms of disease have yet to be elucidated. We used the rhesus macaque model of mild MERS to investigate whether the immune response plays a role in the pathogenicity in relation to MERS-CoV shedding. Immunosuppressed macaques were inoculated with MERS-CoV and sampled daily for 6 days to assess their immune statues and to measure viral shedding and replication. Immunosuppressed macaques supported significantly higher levels of MERS-CoV replication in respiratory tissues and shed more virus, and virus disseminated to tissues outside of the respiratory tract, whereas viral RNA was confined to respiratory tissues in non-immunosuppressed animals. Desp...","Abstract Due to presence of secondary bioactive metabolites, natural compounds are considered a major source of new active molecules that can be developed as new drugs. Infectious diseases, and mainly the common respiratory infections, are major challenges to the current chemotherapy systems and, therefore, there is a requirement to find new compounds with therapeutic potential. The volatile natural compounds and essential oils are the main treasure agents in the natural compounds with antibiotic potential. The present chapter reviews natural traditional remedies used in the treatment of respiratory infections with the emphasis on antibacterial, antiviral, and antiinflammation activities of the volatile natural compounds (essential oils, etc.), and provides a brief view in some of structural activity relationships between antibacterial potencies and chemical structures of the essential oil\u2019s constituents.","Abstract Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is caused by SARS-COV2 and represents the causative agent of a potentially fatal disease that is of great global public health concern. Based on the large number of infected people that were exposed to the wet animal market in Wuhan City, China, it is suggested that this is likely the zoonotic origin of COVID-19. Person-to-person transmission of COVID-19 infection led to the isolation of patients that were subsequently administered a variety of treatments. Extensive measures to reduce person-to-person transmission of COVID-19 have been implemented to control the current outbreak. Special attention and efforts to protect or reduce transmission should be applied in susceptible populations including children, health care providers, and elderly people. In this review, we highlights the symptoms, epidemiology, transmission, pathogenesis, phylogenetic analysis and future directions to control the spread of this fatal disease.","In 2012, a novel coronavirus associated with severe respiratory disease in humans emerged in the Middle East. Epidemiologic investigations identified dromedary camels as the likely source of zoonotic transmission of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Here we provide experimental support for camels as a reservoir for MERS-CoV. We inoculated 3 adult camels with a human isolate of MERS-CoV and a transient, primarily upper respiratory tract infection developed in each of the 3 animals. Clinical signs of the MERS-CoV infection were benign, but each of the camels shed large quantities of virus from the upper respiratory tract. We detected infectious virus in nasal secretions through 7 days postinoculation, and viral RNA up to 35 days postinoculation. The pattern of shedding and propensity for the upper respiratory tract infection in dromedary camels may help explain the lack of systemic illness among naturally infected camels and the means of efficient camel-to-camel an...","Abstract Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is caused by a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV). Future research on the molecular virology of SARS-CoV will be important in the understanding of the epidemiology and the natural history of SARS. This will also facilitate the development of sensitive and accurate diagnostic tests, as well as vaccination and other therapeutics to combat SARS.","We report temporal patterns of viral shedding in 94 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients and modelled COVID-19 infectiousness profile from a separate sample of 77 infector-infectee transmission pairs. We observed the highest viral load in throat swabs at the time of symptom onset, and inferred that infectiousness peaked on or before symptom onset. We estimated that 44% of transmission could occur before first symptoms of the index. Disease control measures should be adjusted to account for probable substantial pre-symptomatic transmission.","","Abstract The contribution of cell-mediated immunity to protective immunity against virulent transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) infection conferred by primary porcine respiratry coronavirus (PRCV) or TGEV exposure was assessed in pigs that were challenged with TGEV 24 days after a primary oronasal inoculation with PRCV or TGEV when 11 days old. PRCV exposure induced partial protection against TGEV challenge in suckling pigs based upon a decreased number of diarrhea cases (42% vs. 90% in age-matched control pigs), limited virus shedding in feces, and increases in virus-neutralizing serum antibody titers; in contrast, all 11-day-old pigs inoculated with TGEV were completely protected after challenge. Weaned pigs were also studied to eliminate any possibility that lactogenic immunity from contact PRCV-exposed sows contributed to protection against TGEV. Once weaned, none of the PRCV-exposed or age-matched control pigs had diarrhea after TGEV challenge; moreover, both groups exhibit...","Background A pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been spreading over the world. However, the viral dynamics, host serologic responses, and their associations with clinical manifestations, have not been well described in prospective cohort. Methods We conducted a prospective cohort and enrolled 67 COVID-19 patients admitting between Jan 26 and Feb 5, 2020. Clinical specimens including nasopharyngeal swab, sputum, blood, urine and stool were tested periodically according to standardized case report form with final follow-up on February 27. The routes and duration of viral shedding, antibody response, and their associations with disease severity and clinical manifestations were systematically evaluated. Coronaviral particles in clinical specimens were observed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Results The median duration of SARS-CoV-2 RNA shedding were 12 (3-38), 19 (5-37), and 18 (7-26) days i...","Abstract Since the emergence of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in 2012, many questions remain on modes of transmission and sources of virus. In outbreak situations, especially with emerging organisms causing severe human disease, it is important to understand the full spectrum of disease, and shedding kinetics in relation to infectivity and the ability to transmit the microorganism. Laboratory response capacity during the early stages of an outbreak focuses on development of virological and immunological methods for patient diagnosis, for contact tracing, and for epidemiological studies into sources, modes of transmission, identification of risk groups, and animal reservoirs. However, optimal use of this core public health laboratory capacity requires a fundamental understanding of kinetics of viral shedding and antibody response, of assay validation and of interpretation of test outcomes. We reviewed available data from MERS-CoV case reports, and compared this...","IAs of February 11, 2020, all prefecture-level cities in mainland China have reported confirmed cases of 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), but the city-level epidemical dynamics is unknown. The aim of this study is to model the current dynamics of 2019-nCoV at city level and predict the trend in the next 30 days under three possible scenarios in mainland China. We developed a spatially explicit epidemic model to consider the unique characteristics of the virus transmission in individual cities. Our model considered that the rate of virus transmission among local residents is different from those with Wuhan travel history due to the self-isolation policy. We introduced a decay rate to quantify the effort of each city to gradually control the disease spreading. We used mobile phone data to obtain the number of individuals in each city who have travel history to Wuhan. This city-level model was trained using confirmed cases up to February 10, 2020 and validated by new confirmed cases on...","In late December 2019, a previous unidentified coronavirus, currently named as the 2019 novel coronavirus#, emerged from Wuhan, China, and resulted in a formidable outbreak in many cities in China and expanded globally, including Thailand, Republic of Korea, Japan, United States, Philippines, Viet Nam, and our country (as of 2/6/2020 at least 25 countries). The disease is officially named as Coronavirus Disease-2019 (COVID-19, by WHO on February 11, 2020). It is also named as Severe Pneumonia with Novel Pathogens on January 15, 2019 by the Taiwan CDC, the Ministry of Health and is a notifiable communicable disease of the fifth category. COVID-19 is a potential zoonotic disease with low to moderate (estimated 2%-5%) mortality rate. Person-to-person transmission may occur through droplet or contact transmission and if there is a lack of stringent infection control or if no proper personal protective equipment available, it may jeopardize the first-line healthcare workers. Currently, ther...","Summary SARS coronavirus continues to cause sporadic cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in China. No active or passive immunoprophylaxis for disease induced by SARS coronavirus is available. We investigated prophylaxis of SARS coronavirus infection with a neutralising human monoclonal antibody in ferrets, which can be readily infected with the virus. Prophylactic administration of the monoclonal antibody at 10 mg/kg reduced replication of SARS coronavirus in the lungs of infected ferrets by 3\u00b73 logs (95% Cl 2\u00b76\u20134\u00b70 logs; p&lt;0\u00b7001), completely prevented the development of SARS coronavirus-induced macroscopic lung pathology (p=0\u00b7013), and abolished shedding of virus in pharyngeal secretions. The data generated in this animal model show that administration of a human monoclonal antibody might offer a feasible and effective prophylaxis for the control of human SARS coronavirus infection.","Abstract In December 2019, an outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) due to the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus began in China and spread rapidly worldwide. It is unknown whether hemodialysis patients represent a distinct group of patients with certain characteristics that may make them susceptible to infection or severe disease. In this Case Report, we describe the clinical and epidemiological features of COVID-19 in 201 maintenance hemodialysis patients in Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan university, including 5 maintenance hemodialysis patients who contracted COVID-19 disease. Of the 5 patients with COVID-19, one had a definite history of contact with an infected person. The age range of the patients was 47\u201367 years. Diarrhea (80%), fever (60%), and fatigue (60%) were the most common symptoms. Lymphopenia occurred in all patients.Chest computerized tomography (CT) scans showed ground glass opacity in the lungs of all patients. Up to February 13, 2020, none of the patients had developed severe ...","Abstract Isotype-specific antibody responses to bovine herpesvirus 1 (BHV1) were measured in sera, nasal, ocular and genital secretions of calves that were reinfected with BHV1 and 6 weeks later treated with corticosteroids to reactivate putative latent virus. After reinfection and after reactivation, no BHV1-specific IgM antibody response was detected. The serum IgA response was only transiently detectable after reinfection and again appeared rapidly after reactivation in most calves. Most calves showed an increase in nasal and ocular IgA titres after reinfection and reactivation; some calves also had IgA antibodies in genital secretions. A salient finding was that after reinfection and reactivation more calves showed a serum IgA response than virus shedding or an increase in serum IgG1 or IgG2 titres. This suggests that the serum IgA response would be the most sensitive indicator to detect BHV1 reinfection and reactivation. No correlation was found between nasal IgA titre at the time...","AbstractSince December 2019, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) emerged in Wuhan, Central China and rapidly spread throughout China. Up to March 3, 2020, SARS-CoV-2 has infected more than 89,000 people in China and other 66 countries across six continents. In this study, we used 10 new sequenced genomes of SARS-CoV-2 and combined 136 genomes from GISAID database to investigate the genetic variation and population demography through different analysis approaches (e.g. Network, EBSP, Mismatch, and neutrality tests). The results showed that 80 haplotypes had 183 substitution sites, including 27 parsimony-informative and 156 singletons. Sliding window analyses of genetic diversity suggested a certain mutations abundance in the genomes of SARS-CoV-2, which may be explaining the existing widespread and high adaptation of the deadly virus. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the view, pangolin acted as an intermediate host, may be controversial. The network indicated that, in the original hapl...","Diagnosis is the key point for confirmation and treatment of COVID-19. we focused on comparative analysis of virus dynamics between the upper respiratory and feces specimens in the COVID-19 patients. A total of 66 upper respiratory swabs, 51 feces, 56 urine and 56 plasma samples were sequentially collected from 23 patients in a designated hospital. The plasma and urine samples were all negative, except for urine samples from two severe cases at the latest available detection point. Conversely, virus was shed in respiratory swabs and feces samples during the diseased period. Ten of 12 (83.3%) cases were positive for feces samples, while 14 of 21 (66.7%) were positive for respiratory samples. In addition, the median duration of virus shedding was 10.0 days (IQR 8.0 to 17.0) in the upper respiratory swabs, but was 22.0 days (IQR 15.5 to 23.5) for the feces. Notably, at 26 days after discharge, case 3 (a 45-year-old) was detected positive again in the feces samples, but appears to be healt...","This article reviews the current epidemiology and clinical presentation of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection and describes the preparedness plan of several countries. The MERS-CoV was first reported in 2012 and has since infected more than 1600 patients in 26 countries, mostly in Saudi Arabia and the Middle East. The epidemiology of the infection is compatible with multiple introductions of the virus into humans from an animal reservoir, probably dromedary camels. The clinical presentation ranges from no symptoms to severe pneumonitis and respiratory failure. Most confirmed cases so far were part of MERS-CoV clusters in hospital settings, affecting mainly middle-aged men and patients with a chronic disease or immuno-suppressed status. There is no vaccine or anti-viral medication available. Viral epidemics can occur anywhere in today\u2019s \u201cglobal village\u201d. MERS-CoV is a relatively new virus, and this work is intended to add to the still-sparse data on its ep...","Abstract Objective To determine the dynamic changes of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA in respiratory and fecal specimens in children with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Methods From January 17, 2020 to February 23, 2020, three paediatric cases of COVID-19 were reported in Qingdao, Shandong Province, China. Epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment data were collected. Patients were followed up to March 10, 2020, and dynamic profiles of nucleic acid testing results in throat swabs and fecal specimens were closely monitored. Results Clearance of SARS-CoV-2 in respiratory tract occurred within two weeks after abatement of fever, whereas viral RNA remained detectable in stools of pediatric patients for longer than 4 weeks. Two children had fecal SARS-CoV-2 undetectable 20 days after throat swabs showing negative, while that of another child lagged behind for 8 days. Conclusions SARS-CoV-2 may exist in child...","Abstract Ocular transmission of COVID-19 is uncertain. 64 tear samples were collected from 17 COVID-19 patients between Day 3 to Day 20 from initial symptoms. Neither viral culture nor reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) detected the virus, suggesting a low risk of ocular transmission.","In order to quantitatively characterize the epidemic of COVID\u201519, useful relations among parameters describing an epidemic in general are derived based on the Kermack-McKendrick model. The first relation is 1/\u03c4grow=1/\u03c4trans\u22121/\u03c4inf, where \u03c4grow is the time constant of the exponential growth of an epidemic, \u03c4trans is the time for a pathogen to be transmitted from one patient to uninfected person, and the infectious time \u03c4inf is the time during which the pathogen keeps its power of transmission. The second relation p(\u221e) \u22481\u2212exp(\u2212(R0\u22121)/0.60) is the relation between p(\u221e), the final size of the disaster defined by the ratio of the total infected people to the population of the society,and the basic reproduction number, R0, which is the number of persons infected by the transmission of the pathogen from one infected person during the infectious time. The third relation 1/\u03c4end=1/\u03c4inf\u2212(1\u2212p(\u221e))/\u03c4trans gives the decay time constant \u03c4end at the ending stage of the epidemic. Derived relations are a...","Respiratory viruses are the most frequent causative agents of disease in humans, with significant impact on morbidity and mortality worldwide. Common respiratory agents from several virus families are well adapted to efficient person-to-person transmission and circulate in a global scale, and community-based studies conducted over the past five decades or so confirm that these viruses are the predominant etiological agents of acute respiratory infections (ARIs). The respiratory viruses that most commonly circulate in all continents as endemic or epidemic agents are influenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza viruses, metapneumovirus, rhinovirus, coronaviruses, adenoviruses, and bocaviruses. Although vaccines and effective antiviral drugs are not yet available for most of these viruses, much progress has been made in the understanding of their biology and fundamental issues of host\u2013parasite relationship. This article is a summary of the current knowledge about these viru...","BACKGROUND: As reported by the World Health Organization, a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) was identified as the causative virus of Wuhan pneumonia of unknown etiology by Chinese authorities on 7 January, 2020. The virus was named as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) by International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses on 11 February, 2020. This study aimed to develop a mathematical model for calculating the transmissibility of the virus. METHODS: In this study, we developed a Bats-Hosts-Reservoir-People transmission network model for simulating the potential transmission from the infection source (probably be bats) to the human infection. Since the Bats-Hosts-Reservoir network was hard to explore clearly and public concerns were focusing on the transmission from Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market (reservoir) to people, we simplified the model as Reservoir-People (RP) transmission network model. The next generation matrix approach was adopted to calculate the basic ...","As a city famous for tourism, the public healthcare system of Macau SAR has been under great pressure during the outbreak of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). In this study, we report clinical and microbiological features of ten COVID-19 patients enrolled in the Centro Hospitalar Conde de S\u00e3o Janu\u00e1rio (CHCSJ) between January 21 to February 16, 2020. Clinical samples from all patients including nasopharyngeal swab (NPS)/sputum, urine, and feces were collected for serial virus RNA testing by standard qRT-PCR assay. In total, seven were imported cases and three were local cases. The median duration from Macau arrival to admission in imported cases was 3 days. Four patients required oxygen therapy but none of them needed machinal ventilation. No fatal cases were noted. The most common symptoms were fever (80%) and diarrhea (80%). In the \"Severe\" group, there was significantly more elderly patients (p=0.045), higher lactate dehydrogenase levels (p=0.002), and elevated C-Reactive prot...","Background: An outbreak of a novel coronavirus, named CoVID-19, was first reported in China on 31 December 2019. As of 9 February 2020, cases have been reported in 25 countries, including probable cases of human-to-human transmission in England. Methods: We adapted an existing national-scale metapopulation model to capture the spread of CoVID-19 in England and Wales. We used 2011 census data to capture population sizes and population movement, together with parameter estimates from the current outbreak in China. Results: We predict that a CoVID-19 outbreak will peak 126 to 147 days (~4 months) after the start of person-to-person transmission in England and Wales in the absence of controls, assuming biological parameters remain unchanged. Therefore, if person-to-person transmission persists from February, we predict the epidemic peak would occur in June. The starting location has minimal impact on peak timing, and model stochasticity varies peak timing by 10 days. Incorporating realisti...","Abstract SARS-CoV-2 can be shed in the stool of patients in the recovery phase. Children show a longer shedding time than adults. We analyzed the possible causes of this finding and recommend that a negative stool sample be included in a patient\u2019s discharge criteria.","The emergence of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) highlights the zoonotic potential of Betacoronaviruses. Investigations into the origin of MERS-CoV have focused on two potential reservoirs: bats and camels. Here, we investigated the role of bats as a potential reservoir for MERS-CoV. In vitro, the MERS-CoV spike glycoprotein interacted with Jamaican fruit bat (Artibeus jamaicensis) dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) receptor and MERS-CoV replicated efficiently in Jamaican fruit bat cells, suggesting there is no restriction at the receptor or cellular level for MERS-CoV. To shed light on the intrinsic host-virus relationship, we inoculated 10 Jamaican fruit bats with MERS-CoV. Although all bats showed evidence of infection, none of the bats showed clinical signs of disease. Virus shedding was detected in the respiratory and intestinal tract for up to 9 days. MERS-CoV replicated transiently in the respiratory and, to a lesser extent, the intestinal tracts and internal ...","Zoonotic viruses that emerge from wildlife and domesticated animals pose a serious threat to human and animal health. In many instances, mouse models have improved our understanding of the human immune response to infection; however, when dealing with emerging zoonotic diseases, they may be of limited use. This is particularly the case when the model fails to reproduce the disease status that is seen in the natural reservoir, transmission species or human host. In this Review, we discuss how researchers are placing more emphasis on the study of the immune response to zoonotic infections in the natural reservoir hosts and spillover species. Such studies will not only lead to a greater understanding of how these infections induce variable disease and immune responses in distinct species but also offer important insights into the evolution of mammalian immune systems. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The online version of this article (doi:10.1038/nri3551) contains supplementary material, which...","In 2012, a novel human coronavirus emerged and was tentatively named \u201cMiddle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus\u201d (MERS-CoV). The high mortality rate of MERS-CoV focused attention on the ecology of the virus. It has been found that MERS-CoV belongs to the group C lineage of the genus Betacoronavirus. Coronavirus surveillance studies in different populations of bats have suggested that they are probable reservoirs for this novel virus, and phylogenetic analysis of both the spike (S1) and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase proteins of MERS-CoV have revealed that it is related to bat viruses. Recently, the MERS-CoV and its neutralizing antibodies were detected in dromedary camels. Despite the limited number of reported cases of person-to-person transmission, the rapid evolution of the virus poses a continuous threat to humans worldwide. This paper reviews the current state of knowledge regarding the virology, clinical spectrum, evolution, diagnosis and treatment of MERS-CoV infections.","","BACKGROUND The outbreak of the new coronavirus infection in Wuhan City, Hubei Province in December 2019, poses a huge threat to China and even global public health security. Respiratory droplets and contact transmission are the main routes of transmission of new coronaviruses. Compared with SARS and Ebola viruses, new coronavirus infections are infectious during the incubation period. Traditional SEIR (susceptibility-exposure-infection-Removal) There are some differences in conditions for the prediction of the epidemic trend of new coronavirus infection. The outbreak of the new coronavirus infection coincided with the Spring Festival before and after the Chinese Spring Festival.It is necessary to make appropriate optimization and amendments to the traditional model to meet the actual evolution of the epidemic situation. METHODS The traditional SEIR model assumes that the virus-infected person is not infectious during the incubation period and that the infected person did not take isola...","Publisher Summary Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is caused by a coronavirus (CoV), SARSCoV. SARS-CoV belongs to the family Coronaviridae, which are enveloped RNA viruses in the order Nidovirales. Global research efforts are continuing to increase the understanding of the virus, the pathogenesis of the disease it causes (SARS), and the \u201cheterogeneity of individual infectiousness\u201d as well as shedding light on how to prepare for other emerging viral diseases. Promising drugs and vaccines have been identified. The milestones achieved have resulted from a truly international effort. Molecular studies dissected the adaptation of this virus as it jumped from an intermediary animal, the civet, to humans, thus providing valuable insights into processes of molecular emergence.","Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is one of the major threats to the healthcare systems in some countries, especially in the Arabian Peninsula. MERS-CoV is considered an ideal example of the One Health concept. This is due to the animals, especially dromedary camels, play important roles in the transmission and sustainability of the virus, and the virus can be transmitted through aerosols of infected patients into the environment. However, there is some debate regarding the origin of MERS-CoV either from bats or other unknown reservoirs. The dromedary camel is the only identified animal reservoir to date. These animals play important roles in sustaining the virus in certain communities and may act as an amplifier of the virus by secreting it in their body fluids, especially in nasal and rectal discharges. MERS-CoV has been detected in the nasal and rectal secretions of infected camels, and MERS-CoV of this origin has full capacity to infect human airway epithelium...","The geographic spread of 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) infections from the epicenter of Wuhan, China, has provided an opportunity to study the natural history of the recently emerged virus. Using publicly available event-date data from the ongoing epidemic, the present study investigated the incubation period and other time intervals that govern the epidemiological dynamics of COVID-19 infections. Our results show that the incubation period falls within the range of 2&amp;ndash;14 days with 95% confidence and has a mean of around 5 days when approximated using the best-fit lognormal distribution. The mean time from illness onset to hospital admission (for treatment and/or isolation) was estimated at 3&amp;ndash;4 days without truncation and at 5&amp;ndash;9 days when right truncated. Based on the 95th percentile estimate of the incubation period, we recommend that the length of quarantine should be at least 14 days. The median time delay of 13 days from illness onset to death (17 days with rig...","The geographic spread of 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) infections from the epicenter of Wuhan, China, has provided an opportunity to study the natural history of the recently emerged virus.

The subsequent efficient human-to-human transmission of this virus eventually affected more than 30 countries worldwide, resulting in a mortality rate of ~10% of infected individuals. The spread of the virus was ultimately controlled by isolation of infected individuals and there has been no infections reported since April 2004. However, the natural reservoir of the virus was never identified and it is not known if this virus will re-emerge and, therefore, research on this virus continues. The SARS-CoV genome is about 30 kb in length and is predicted to contain 14 functional open reading frames (ORFs). The genome encodes for proteins that are homologous to known coronavirus proteins, such as the replicase proteins (ORFs 1a and 1b) and the four major structural proteins: nucleocapsid (N), spike (S), membrane (M) and envelope ...","Abstract: The 2019-nCoV outbreak has raised concern of global spread. While person-to-person transmission within the Wuhan district has led to a large outbreak, the transmission potential outside of the region remains unclear. Here we present a simple approach for determining whether the upper limit of the confidence interval for the reproduction number exceeds one for transmission in the United States, which would allow endemic transmission. As of February 7, 2020, the number of cases in the United states support subcritical transmission, rather than ongoing transmission. However, this conclusion can change if pre-symptomatic cases resulting from human-to-human transmission have not yet been identified.","Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), the first global epidemic in the 21st century, affected over 8500 people in approximately 30 countries (1\u20137). With a crude mortality of 9%, its cause was quickly identified as a novel coronavirus that jumped species from animals to man. The SARS coronavirus epidemic, which began in the Fall of 2002, was related to the exotic food industry in southern China, initially involving disproportionate numbers of animal handlers, chefs, and caterers. Subsequently, person-to-person transmission spawned the outbreak. What distinguished this illness clinically was the fact that approximately half of the victims were health care workers (8), infected while caring for recognized or unrecognized patients with SARS. There are many curiosities and uncertainties surrounding the epidemic of SARS with lessons that may be useful to the community of infectious diseases physicians, especially when looking ahead to the next epidemic. Herein we relate our perspectives ...","Summary Background An ongoing outbreak of pneumonia associated with a novel coronavirus was reported in Wuhan city, Hubei province, China. Affected patients were geographically linked with a local wet market as a potential source. No data on person-to-person or nosocomial transmission have been published to date. Methods In this study, we report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, radiological, and microbiological findings of five patients in a family cluster who presented with unexplained pneumonia after returning to Shenzhen, Guangdong province, China, after a visit to Wuhan, and an additional family member who did not travel to Wuhan. Phylogenetic analysis of genetic sequences from these patients were done. Findings From Jan 10, 2020, we enrolled a family of six patients who travelled to Wuhan from Shenzhen between Dec 29, 2019 and Jan 4, 2020. Of six family members who travelled to Wuhan, five were identified as infected with the novel coronavirus. Additionally, one family m...","The world is braced for a public health emergency of international concern caused by a novel emerging infectious disease, a coronavirus with similarities to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV). Person-to-person transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), started in December, 2019, in Wuhan, China and has spread to become a global pandemic, with, as of Feb 26, 2020, community transmission in Italy, Iran, and South Korea. Modelling studies have aided understanding of COVID-19 dynamics from the first announcement of the epidemic and publication of the genetic sequence of the causative virus. Initial phylogenetic analysis of closely related viruses suggested highly linked person-to-person spread of SARS-CoV-2 originating from mid-November to early December, 2019.1, 2 Following this, modellers provided simple calculations that identified a mismatch between reported cases in China and reported importations of cases from travell...","Infections with 2019-nCoV can spread from person to person, and in the earliest phase of the outbreak the basic reproductive number was estimated to be around 2.2, assuming a mean serial interval of 7.5 days [2]. The serial interval was not precisely estimated, and a potentially shorter mean serial interval would have corresponded to a slightly lower basic reproductive number. Control measures and changes in population behaviour later in January should have reduced the effective reproductive number. However, it is too early to estimate whether the effective reproductive number has been reduced to below the critical threshold of 1 because cases currently being detected and reported would have mostly been infected in mid- to late-January. Average delays between infection and illness onset have been estimated at around 5\u20136 days, with an upper limit of around 11-14 days [2,5], and delays from illness onset to laboratory confirmation added a further 10 days on average [2].","Teaser: Our review found the average R0 for 2019-nCoV to be 3.28, which exceeds WHO estimates of 1.4 to 2.5.Here we review the basic reproduction number (R0) of the 2019-nCoV virus. R0 is an indication of the transmissibility of a virus, representing the average number of new infections generated by an infectious person in a totally na\u00efve population. For R0 greater than one the number infected is likely to increase, and for R0 less than one transmission is likely to die out. The basic reproduction number is a central concept in infectious disease epidemiology, indicating the risk of an infectious agent with respect to epidemic spread.","An ongoing outbreak of pneumonia caused by a novel coronavirus, currently designated as the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), was reported recently. However, as SARS-CoV-2 is an emerging virus, we know little about it. In this review, we summarize the key events occurred during the early stage of SARS-CoV-2 outbreak, the basic characteristics of the pathogen, the signs and symptoms of the infected patients as well as the possible transmission pathways of the virus. Furthermore, we also review the current knowledge on the origin and evolution of the SARS-CoV-2. We highlight bats as the potential natural reservoir and pangolins as the possible intermediate host of the virus, but their roles are waiting for further investigation. Finally, the advances in the development of chemotherapeutic options are also briefly summarized.","Our society is currently experiencing an unprecedented challenge, managing and containing an outbreak of a new coronavirus disease known as COVID-19. While China - were the outbreak started - seems to have been able to contain the growth of the epidemic, different outbreaks are nowadays being detected in multiple countries. Much is currently unknown about the natural history of the disease, such as a possible asymptomatic spreading or the role of age in both the susceptibility and mortality of the disease. Nonetheless, authorities have to take action and implement contention measures, even if not everything is known. To facilitate this task, we have studied the effect of different containment strategies that can be put into effect. Our work specifically refers to the situation in Spain as of February 28th, 2020, where a few dozens of cases have been detected. We implemented an SEIR-metapopulation model that allows tracing explicitly the spatial spread of the disease through data-driven..."],"title":["Transmission Potential of SARS-CoV-2 in Viral Shedding

The animals become infected through fighting and bites, although some arenaviruses are transmitted vertically to offspring, thereby maintaining the infected population. The rodents are unaffected by the virus but remain chronically infected, shedding virus into the environment through urine and feces. Humans become infected when abraded skin comes in contact with rodent excretions, or when they ingest contaminated food or inhale aerosolized particles. Some arenaviruses have been shown to be transmitted from person-to-person, including Lassa virus and Machupo virus, through infectious droplets or bodily secretions. Fatality rates for the arenaviruses that cause hemorrhagic fever range from 5% to 35%, although rates up to 50% have been documented in certain outbreaks.","A great deal is known about a range of animal coronaviruses, and this understanding may provide some insights into the possible future behaviour of the newest coronavirus. Many of these coronaviruses do exhibit a distinct seasonal pattern of incidence in their natural hosts. This is true for the bovine coronavirus associated with winter dysentery of calves, 34, 35 as well as for the feline infectious peritonitis virus and others. 36 The two previously described human coronaviruses (229E and OC43) both show distinct winter seasonality. 37 The forces underlying these seasonal patterns are not well understood, but a common feature of most coronaviruses is their ability to establish long-term persistence in a subset of infected animals. For example, most cats recover from their feline influenza virus (FEIV) infection and stop shedding virus, but a minority are persistently infected, shedding virus in their stools for up to 7 years or more, and it is these animals that are the continuing source for FEIV outbreaks in catteries. 36, 38 Symptomless and intermittent shedding of porcine coronavirus was documented on 24 occasions over a period of 18 months in one sow, and virulence of the shed virus was documented by the ability to infect 3-day-old piglets. 39 Human coronaviruses may also establish persistent infections in vitro. 40 Persistence of these RNA viruses involves changes in both virus and host cell, but evidence points to features of the host immune response to the initial infection that determines whether the animal will become a persistent shedder or will eradicate the infection. 38, 40 It is plausible that the infection of animal SARS coronavirus in its natural host, be it palm civets or other animals yet to be identified, also assumes seasonality in such a way that it might increase the likelihood of animalto-human transmission in the winter season. In January 2004, after the first two cases of SARS were reported in Guangdong, the Chinese government banned trading and farming of all civets in Guangdong province as soon as it was noted that civets shed high titres (10 9 ) of virus. Decision making for such a policy clearly included considerations for the impending winter high season of SARS virus activity.","Theoretically, asymptomatic carriers might arise when host antiviral defence is either strong or decoupled. When the immune response effectively limits but could not completely block SARS-CoV-2 replication, asymptomatic shedding might occur. In this scenario, the risk of transmitting to others is relatively low because of a low viral load. Alternatively, if the immune response against SARS-CoV-2 is decoupled from viral replication as in the infection of natural primate hosts with SIVs, the viral load would be higher, posing a higher risk for person-to-person transmission. A careful quantitative analysis of the replication dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 in asymptomatic carriers over time is required to clarify the validity of the two models.","Several features of SARS are especially noteworthy. These include (1) a relatively long incubation period (mean 4.6 days, range 2 to 14 days); (2) minimal transmissibility early in the course of illness (viral shedding in respiratory secretions followed a crescendo-decrescendo pattern with peak titers on day 10 of illness); (3) a high proportion of illnesses (21%) in health care workers; (4) a low-to-moderate basic reproductive number (R0), estimated at 2 to 4 secondary cases per average infectious case 92 ; (5) the occurrence of \"super-spreader\" events facilitated by inpatient therapeutic procedures that promoted aerosolization of the virus and accounted for much of the observed personto-person transmission (the majority of cases resulted in no secondary transmission); (6) a rarity of asymptomatic infections; and (7) a striking age-dependent case-fatality ratio (&lt;1% in persons &lt;24 years of age vs. &gt;50% in those &gt;65 years). [88] [89] [90] Epidemiologic investigations found that people with early SARS cases in Guangdong Province often had contact with exotic live animal markets. Several species (especially palm civet cats) in the live markets had evidence of SARS-CoV infection, leading to mass culling as a control measure. 88 The virus was not detected in these animals in the wild, and experimental infections showed the animals developed SARS-like symptoms. Both factors suggested they were not the natural host. In 2005, viruses similar to SARS-CoV (SARS-like coronaviruses [SL-CoV]) were identified in horseshoe bats in southern China and bats are now considered to represent the natural reservoir. 87,93-95 Subsequent studies have shown bats in many parts of the world harbor SL-CoVs. 87, 95 Various therapies were employed during the SARS outbreak, including ribavirin, corticosteroids, antiretroviral drugs, and immunotherapy. Some appeared beneficial, but none could be systematically evaluated. 89 SARS-CoV is known to act through a spike protein that targets angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, offering potential therapeutic options. 88, 96 Vaccine development research using a variety of approaches is underway. 97 A novel human coronavirus (initially referred to as HCoV-EMC for Erasmus Medical Center in the Netherlands and now known as Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus [MERS-CoV]) was first identified in July 2012 in a 60-year-old man from Saudi Arabia with fatal lower respiratory tract infection. 17 As of July 2013, a total of 81 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with this virus have been reported internationally. 98 Cases have been reported from nine countries, all with a direct or indirect link to locations in and around the Arabian peninsula. The earliest recognized cases were retrospectively identified in 2 persons in Jordan who were part of an 11-person hospital cluster of respiratory illnesses in April 2012. 99 Of the 81 confirmed cases, the median age is 55 years (range, 2 to 94 years) and 45 (56%) have died; 64% of the cases for whom gender is known occurred in males. Illness has been characterized by severe respiratory distress and pneumonia often requiring mechanical ventilation, and some cases have been accompanied by renal insufficiency. 99 A three-person cluster in Great Britain where the index case was exposed in the Middle East and disease subsequently occurred in two close contacts in Great Britain with no history of travel, as well as an instance of nosocomial transmission in France where the index case was exposed in the Middle East, provide evidence the virus can be spread person to person. 99 In addition to the 2012 Jordanian hospital cluster, another outbreak in April 2013 involving 22 persons, including health care workers, and 9 deaths in an eastern Saudi Arabian hospital suggests nosocomial transmission. 100 Genetic analyses of this novel coronavirus show it is the first lineage C betacoronavirus infecting humans and has a close relationship to betacoronaviruses HKU4 and HKU5 found in bats, including insectivorous bat species present in the Middle East. 101-103 A virus with 100% sequence homology to the MERS-CoV isolated from the 2012 Saudi Arabian index case was found in an Egyptian tomb bat (Tapho zous perforatus) trapped in the vicinity of that patient's home. 104 These findings suggest bats play an important role in the ecology of MERS-CoV and could be the reservoir for this new coronavirus. The virus targets a unique receptor and appears capable of infecting multiple mammalian cell lines, suggesting the potential for a zoonotic intermediary, and serologic evidence of infection with MERS-CoV has been reported in mammalian species. [105] [106] [107] even as influenza surveillance, including surveillance during and after the H1N1 pandemic, has improved in affected areas. Better surveillance would likely detect less severely ill individuals.","Contact tracing has identified asymptomatic infections, but studies of their frequency and transmissibility have been limited. Many of those infected are health care workers in whom these questions could be systematically studied. Relatively little is known about the natural history of human asymptomatic infections. Further studies of virus shedding, seroconversion, and transmission in asymptomatic infections are needed. Some evidence suggests that secondary cases have lower average CFRs and that subsequent links in the chain of MERS-CoV infection may decrease in severity.","Nathan D. Wolfe has defined five stages of transformation of an animal pathogen into a specifically human pathogen, resulting in a ''true'' emergence, with the possibility of an evolutionary interruption at each stage. Stage 1 corresponds to a situation in which a known virus in animals has never yet been detected in humans in natural conditions. In Stage 2, the virus known in animals is capable of infecting humans in natural conditions, but without the capability of person-to-person transmission. In Stage 3, some cycles of secondary person-toperson transmission are possible. In Stage 4, the virus circulates among humans through several secondary person-to-person transmission of varying duration. Stage 5 is reached when the virus becomes exclusively human, and also contagious.","Coronavirus is an enveloped, positive single-strand RNA virus. It belongs to the Orthocoronavirinae subfamily, as the name, with the characteristic \"crown-like\" spikes on their surfaces. 5 Together with SARS-CoV, bat SARS-like CoV and others also fall into the genus beta-coronavirus. COVID-19 (caused by 2019-nCoV infection) is classified as a fifth-category notifiable communicable disease in Taiwan on January 15, 2019. 12 The genus beta-coronavirus can be divided into several subgroups. The 2019-nCoV, SARS-CoV, and bat SARS-like CoV belong to Abstract: In late December 2019, a previous unidentified coronavirus, currently named as the 2019 novel coronavirus # , emerged from Wuhan, China, and resulted in a formidable outbreak in many cities in China and expanded globally, including Thailand, Republic of Korea, Japan, United States, Philippines, Viet Nam, and our country (as of 2/6/2020 at least 25 countries).

It is also named as Severe Pneumonia with Novel Pathogens on January 15, 2019 by the Taiwan CDC, the Ministry of Health and is a notifiable communicable disease of the fifth category. COVID-19 is a potential zoonotic disease with low to moderate (estimated 2%-5%) mortality rate. Person-to-person transmission may occur through droplet or contact transmission and if there is a lack of stringent infection control or if no proper personal protective equipment available, it may jeopardize the first-line healthcare workers.

To promptly identify patients and prevent further spreading, physicians should be aware of the travel or contact history of the patient with compatible symptoms.

[5] [6] [7] The exact origin, location, and natural reservoir of the 2019-nCoV remain unclear, although it is believed that the virus is zoonotic and bats may be the culprits because of sequence identity to the bat-CoV. 5, 13 According to previous studies on the SARS-and MERS-CoV, epidemiologic investigations, their natural reservoir is bat, while palm civet or raccoon dog may be the intermediate (or susceptible) host for SARS-CoV and the dromedary camel for MERS-CoV. 5, 13 A field study for the SARS-CoV on palm civet ruled out the possibility as the natural reservoir (low positive rate); instead, the prevalence of bat coronavirus among wild life is high and it shares a certain sequence identity with the human SARS-CoV. 14 Therefore, bats are considered the natural host reservoir of SARS-like coronavirus. 13 However, the origin or natural host for the 2019-nCoV is not clear, although it might come from a kind of wild life in the wet market. 1 Theoretically, if people contact or eat the reservoir or infected animal, they could be infected. However, to result in large scaled person-to-person transmission as in the past SARS outbreak, the virus must spread efficiently. Initially, the 2019-CoV outbreak was reported as limited person-to-person transmission and a contaminated source from infected or sick wild animals in the wet market may have been the common origin. 1,2 But more and more evidences came out with clusters of outbreaks among family confirmed the possibility of personto-person transmission. 8, 10, 11, 15, 16 In addition, the involvement of human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) as the cellular receptor (like SARS) made droplet transmission to the lower respiratory tract possible. 5, 17 Furthermore, contact transmission like SARS is also likely although the survival time in the environment for the 2019-nCoV is not clear at present. Currently, there was no evidence of air-borne transmission. Viral RNAs could be found in nasal discharge, sputum, and sometimes blood or feces. 1, 9, 10, 13, 15 But whether oral-fecal transmission can happen has not yet been confirmed. Once people are infected by the 2019-nCoV, it is believed that, like SARS, there is no infectivity until the onset of symptoms. 15 However, one report describes infection from an asymptomatic contact but the investigation was not solid. 10 The infectious doses for 2019-nCoV is not clear, but a high viral load of up to 10 8 copies/mL in patient's sputum has been reported. 10 The viral load increases initially and still can be detected 12 days after onset of symptoms. 9 Therefore, the infectivity of patients with 2019-nCoV may last for about 2 weeks. However, whether infectious viral particles from patients do exist at the later stage requires validation.","Coronavirus is an enveloped, positive single-strand RNA virus.

The disproportionality between the number of zoonotic infections and the high seroprevalence of BV in breeding age animals is a function of the BV life cycle. The biology of BV infection in macaques is characterized by a lifelong persistence with infrequent, and usually subclinical, shedding at mucosal surfaces. Although the natural history of BV has not been described in detail, the replication cycle of HSV serves as a precedent (Roizman and Sears, 1993) . Virus is transmitted across a mucosal surface, such as the oral or genital mucosa. Following localized replication in mucosal epithelial cells, the virus is transmitted directly to sensory nerve endings. The prevailing thought is that there is no associated bloodborne stage of infection, except in rare systemic infections (Simon et al., 1993) . The virus particle is carried, by axonal transport, to the dorsal root ganglia where the virus establishes a true latent infection in neurons.","Different respiratory viruses utilise different routes of transmission (Table 2 ). Rhinovirus and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) are spread by direct hand contact with contaminated skin and environmental surfaces. This is followed by self-inoculation of virus into the nasal mucosa or conjunctiva [6] . Airborne transmission of rhinovirus is also possible, but this depends on the duration of exposure to infected individuals [7] . Transmission of parainfluenza virus (PIV) is by direct person-to-person contact or by large particle aerosol spread. The high rate of infection in childhood, coupled with the frequency of reinfection, suggests that they spread from person to person. There is evidence to suggest that the infectious dose of PIV is small, as two-thirds of volunteers developed flu-like symptoms following low-titre PIV intranasal challenge [8] . RSV is spread by infected respiratory secretions. The major route of transmission appears to be by large particle aerosol or direct contact with self-inoculation. Spread requires either close contact with the infected individual or contamination of the hands followed by introduction into conjunctiva. Influenza tends to spread by small-particle aerosols [9] . The relative efficacy of the various transmission routes under natural conditions for each virus is unknown.","However, data from experimental camel infections conducted in the Middle East suggest that MERS-CoV causes only mild respiratory infection in camels (Adney et al. 2014) despite high levels of seropositivity. It has also been observed that camel calves found shedding MERS-CoV in natural field settings did not have overt clinical symptoms (Hemida et al. 2015a, b; Wernery 2014; Wernery et al. 2015). Furthermore, virus-shedding adult camels sampled at abattoirs did not have overt MERS-CoV clinical symptoms (Hemida et al. 2015a).","If well tracked, early introductions of an emerging pathogen provide a unique opportunity to characterize its transmission, natural history, and the effectiveness of screening. The careful monitoring of cases and low probability of infection from the general community enables inferences, critical to modeling the course of the outbreak, that are difficult to make during a widely disseminated epidemic. In particular, we are able to make assumptions about when and where cases were likely infected that are impossible when the pathogen is widespread. Furthermore, during these early phases, uninfected and asymptomatic contacts are often closely tracked, providing critical information on transmission and natural history. Combined, this data on early introductions can be used to give insights into disease natural history 9 , transmission characteristics 10 , and the unseen burden of infection 11 .","In an analysis of the first 425 confirmed cases of infection, 73% of cases with illness onset between 12 and 22 January reported no exposure to either a wet market or another person with symptoms of a respiratory illness [2]. The lack of reported exposure to another ill person could be attributed to lack of awareness or recall bias, but China\u2019s health minister publicly warned that pre-symptomatic transmission could be occurring [6]. Determining the extent to which asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic transmission might be occurring is an urgent priority, because it has direct implications for public health and hospital infection control. Data on viral shedding dynamics could help in assessing duration of infectiousness. For severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (SARS-CoV), infectivity peaked at around 10 days after illness onset [7], consistent with the peak in viral load at around that time [8]. This allowed control of the SARS epidemic through prompt detection of cases and strict isolation. For influenza virus infections, virus shedding is highest on the day of illness onset and relatively higher from shortly before symptom onset until a few days after onset [9]. To date, transmission patterns of 2019-nCoV appear more similar to influenza, with contagiousness occurring around the time of symptom onset, rather than SARS.","Additional work has been focused on understanding the course of infection in camels and related species. Experimental infection of camels leads to mild clinical illness and high loads of viral shedding from nasal discharge.14 Analysis of the upper respiratory tracts of camels has shown the presence of the MERS-CoV receptor, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 expressed in respiratory epithelial cells.14 These experimental results were similar to what has been documented in natural infection of camels with MERS-CoV.8, 15, 16 Alpacas, due to their close genetic relationship to camels, have also been shown under natural settings to be seropositive for MERS-CoV17 and under experimental settings were able to be infected with and shed MERS-CoV.18","There has been a continued flurry of documents and communications emerging at a speed almost equalling that of the spread of the virus. Having had two recent 'near misses', first with the emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome caused by a novel coronavirus (SARSCoV) in 2002e3 and then the ongoing spread of H5N1 since 1999 (particularly in the Far East), many of us already had guidance prepared. Therein lies a problem, in that swH1N1 is neither SARSCoV nor H5N1. The natural history of these viruses is quite different. It is unlikely that patients with SARS were infectious before they became ill, which is not the case with swH1N1 (and every other influenza virus causing illness in humans). 4 H5N1, on the other hand, does not easily spread from person-to-person, possibly due to the cell receptors it selects to initiate infection.","In our report, the duration of viral shedding from illness onset in Case 1 has persisted for 49 days, which has been the longest in ever reported in symptomatic patients. Previous studies indicated the level and duration of viral shedding is a critical indicator to access the risk of transmission and to guide the isolation of patients as well as predicting the prognosis [5] [6] . In viral infection, prolonged viral shedding was associated with inferior outcome 6 . Interestingly, . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license It is made available under a is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity. Given that Case 2 has a history of long-term use of glucocorticoids, which is the high-risk factor for severe infection and progression, overall, the severity of Case 2 was much optimistic than average status in her age group, since it was reported elder people infected SARS-CoV-2 have much worse prognosis 10 .","We model viral spread using a renewal-equation framework [6] , which allows us to model the current incidence of infected individuals (i.e., the rate at which new infections occur in the population) as a function of previous incidence and how infectiousness of an infected individual varies over the course of their infection. We divide incidence i into two categories -i a and i s -corresponding to incidence of asymptomatic and symptomatic cases, respectively. Newly infected individuals that are either asymptomatically or symptomatically infected can transmit the disease to others, but they differ in their intrinsic reproduction numbers, R a and R s , respectively, as well as intrinsic generation-interval distributions [7] , g a (\u03c4 ) and g s (\u03c4 ). Generation intervals, which are defined as the time between when an individual is infected and when that individual infects another person [8] , depend on the natural history of infection: individuals with subclinical infections may have fast clearance and short generation intervals, or slow viral reproduction and long generation intervals (cf. [9] ). The shape of the generation-interval distribution characterizes the relationship between the epidemic growth rate r and the reproduction number [10] .","There are two prominent hallmarks of the persistent phase of RCMV infection: chronic viral shedding and stability of the antiviral immune responses. These characteristics are identical to HCMV. Infected monkeys can remain viuric for years following primary infection, probably for the life of the host (Asher et al., 1974; Swack and Hsiung, 1982) . The frequency of CMV shedding is variable between animals, although some monkeys appear to be constantly shedding infectious virus at the oral and genital mucosa. Historically, shedding has been assayed by culturing virus. More recently, sensitive molecular techniques, such as realtime PCR, have been used to detect and quantify CMV DNA purified from mucosal swabs . Approximately 50% of seropositive monkeys are DNA-positive in mucosal fluids at any one time. Thus, there is active and ongoing virus replication at mucosal surfaces within a persistently infected host. Occasionally, antigen-positive cells can be detected by immunohistochemistry in other tissues, although the tissues are usually histologically normal without an accompanying inflammatory response.","There were clear differences in periods of virus shedding after corticosteroid treatment between the groups of calves primary infected with different BHVl strains, e.g. calves given the Cooper strain had by far the longest virus shedding periods from nose and eye. These differences in virus shedding did, however, not result in marked differences in isotypespecific antibody responses between the groups of calves.","Second, screening depends on whether exposure risk factors exist that would facilitate specific and reasonably sensitive case detection by questionnaire. For COVID-19, there is so far limited evidence for specific risk factors; we therefore assumed that at most 40% of travellers would be aware of a potential exposure. It is plausible that many individuals aware of a potential exposure would voluntarily avoid travel and practice social distancing--if so, the population of infected travellers will be skewed toward those unaware they have been exposed. Furthermore, based on screening outcomes during the 2009 influenza pandemic, we assumed that a minority of infected travellers would self-report their exposure honestly, which led to limited effectiveness in questionnaire-based screening. The confluence of these two factors led to many infected people being fundamentally undetectable in our model. Even under our most generous assumptions about the natural history of COVID-19, the presence of undetectable cases made the greatest contribution to screening failure. Correctable failures, such as missing an infected person with fever or awareness of their exposure risk, played a more minor role.","Phylogenetic analysis clusters MERS-CoV to the same group as bat CoV-HKU4 and bat CoV-HKU5. Bat CoV-HKU4 and MERS-CoV utilize the same host receptor, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), for virus entry 49. RNA-dependent RNA polymerase sequences of MERS-CoV are phylogenetically closer to counterparts in bat beta-CoVs identified from Europe and Africa 50,51. Up to now, no live MERS-CoV can be found in wild bats. MERS-CoV and its closest relative bat CoV-HKU25 share only 87% nucleotide sequence homology 52,53. Thus, bats might not be the immediate reservoir host of MERS-CoV. On the other hand, studies in Middle East have shown that dromedary camels are seropositive for MERS-CoV-specific neutralizing antibodies 54, same as camels of Middle East origin in multiple African countries 55. Live MERS-CoV identical to the virus found in humans was isolated from the nasal swabs of dromedary camels, further indicating that camels serve as the bona fide reservoir host of MERS-CoV 56. It is also noteworthy that generally mild symptoms but massive virus shedding were observed in camels experimentally infected with MERS-CoV 57. Notably, infected camels shed viruses not only through respiratory route but also through fecal-oral route, which is also the main route for virus shedding from bats. However, questions still remain since many confirmed cases of MERS have no contact history with camels prior to symptom onset 58, plausibly ascribed to human-to-human transmission or unknown transmission routes involving unrecognized animal species that harbour MERS-CoV. These merit further investigations.","Since 2001, outbreaks of NiV in Bangladesh and India have occurred almost on an annual basis with a total of 302 cases and 210 human deaths (69.5% case fatality) [22, 23] . In Bangladesh and India, NiV shedding in P. giganteus bats appears to result in direct transmission to humans via consumption of raw date palm sap contaminated with bat excreta (saliva, urine, faeces) without transmission through an intermediate host [24 ,25] . Person to person transmission has also been observed [26, 27] .","The shedding of MERS-CoV was more extensive in the immunosuppressed animals, both in duration as in peak shedding. This suggests that the immune status has direct influence on virus shedding and subsequent potential of transmission. The epidemiological analyses of the 2015 MERS-CoV outbreak in South Korea clearly showed that only the level of MERS-CoV shedding was directly associated with transmission potential. Where spreaders had statistically lower Ct values compared to non-spreaders (25). The persistent MERS-CoV shedding in immunocompromised patients (23) could, therefore, contribute to enhanced nosocomial transmission.","Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a highly successful human pathogen; by 2 years of age, 95% of all children will have been infected [29] . It spreads from person to person or through exposure to contaminated environment surfaces. However, transmission via aerosolised droplets is unlikely because the virus is inactivated in aerosols. Incubation is from a few days to a week. Natural immunity to RSV is incomplete, and reinfection is the rule.","An alternative vaccine, the 248/404/1030/ SH virus was also tested and found to have lower rate of infection and titer of shedding. Additional testing with these attenuated strains showed that increasing the initial vaccine inoculum titer does not substantially increase viral shedding or immunogenicity. Finally, studies in children less than 3 months old showed a comparable level of viral shedding in the presence or absence of maternal antibodies. The young infants had minimal antibody responses, although there were detectable serum levels of IgG and IgA to the G protein. Mucosal antibodies were produced but at far lower levels than are seen in children older than 3 months of age. A second dose of vaccine, the response to which can be used as a surrogate for reinfection, resulted in rare shedding of the virus and no evidence of enhanced RSV illness once infected. These findings suggest that the vaccine may be protective without detectable increases in antibody level. Finally, a NS-2 protein deleted 248/404 virus, a change that may make the virus more susceptible to interferon, has been found to have markedly reduced viral shedding, particularly in seronegative children, when compared to the other attenuated vaccine strains. Although the study of these live-attenuated vaccines against RSV have given limited information about efficacy, they have given significant data to support continued develop of these vaccines.","On 13 January 2020, Thai health authorities reported an imported case in a person in their 60s who had travelled from Wuhan. This person had onset of an upper respiratory illness on 5 January and landed in Bangkok on 8 January, and was screened out by the thermal scanners at the airport. They did not visit the Southern China Seafood Wholesale Market, but reported visiting another wet market in Wuhan. On 16 January, Japanese health authorities reported a confirmed imported case in a person in their 30s who had travelled from Wuhan and landed in Kanagawa on 6 January. Illness onset was on 3 January and the person has since recovered. The person had not visited any wet market in Wuhan, but had visited a close relative who was in hospital in Wuhan with pneumonia. A third case was reported by Thai health authorities on 17 January. This person was in their 70s and had landed in Bangkok on 13 January, reporting an illness onset on 6 January and unclear history of exposure to the market in Wuhan. On 20 January, the fourth exported case from Wuhan, a person in their 30s visiting South Korea, was identified in Seoul. This person reported no previous visit to wet markets in Wuhan nor contact with any other case within 2 weeks before illness onset. The lack of exposure history to wet markets in Wuhan in two of four generally-mild exported cases indicated that there might be a larger number of undetected infections in Wuhan.","The general means for slowing down infections is well-known: distancing, and ultimately quarantine. If contagious persons do not meet susceptible persons anymore, then the virus cannot spread any further. Also, spreading does not necessarily have to be reduced to zero: Once every infected person infects less than one other person, the virus dies out. The general dynamics is captured in the socalled SIR model, with S = susceptible, I = infected, and R = recovered (Kermack, McKendrick, and Walker 1927; R. M. Anderson and May 1979) . Every time a susceptible and an infected person meet, there is a probability that the susceptible person becomes infected. Some time after the infection, the person typically recovers.","The genomic sequence of MERS-CoV was closely related to bat CoVs HKU4 and HKU5 [18]. Bat CoVs that are evolutionarily closer to MERS-CoV, sharing \u223c75% nucleotide sequence homology and using the same DPP4 receptor, were also identified [32]. Although bats are the evolutionary reservoir host and bat CoVs serve as the gene pool of MERS-CoV, humans acquire MERS-CoV from diseased dromedary camels, but not directly from bats. These camels are the natural reservoir host of MERS-CoV. MERS-CoVs isolated from dromedaries are identical to those found in humans. Experimental infection of dromedary camels with MERS-CoV results in mild disease, shedding large quantities of the virus from the upper respiratory tract [33]. In addition, other non-camelid domestic animals in close contact with infected camels, including sheep, goats, a cow, and donkeys, are also infected by MERS-CoV [34]. These domestic animals could also pose a risk to humans and should, therefore, be included in the MERS-CoV surveillance programme.","The natural history of SARS in relation to the viral dynamics of SARS-CoV is poorly understood. SARS is primarily a respiratory disease and the highest concentration of virus can be found in the respiratory tract during the febrile phase [3] . Logically, the infectivity of respiratory secretions at the febrile stage is very high. The infectivity at the incubation period that ranges from 2 -16 days before fever occurs is uncertain [1] . Most patients have fever settled within two weeks, and this is accompanied by resolution of chest symptoms and radiological changes [1, 13] . However, SARS-CoV can still be found in the stool samples by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) after two weeks of convalescence [3] . This indicates a delayed fecal viral shedding and a potential fecal-oral route of transmission. Droplets of SARS-CoV-contaminated sewage in the soil stack extracted by the bathroom exhaust fans might be responsible for the outbreak of SARS among the residents of Amoy Gardens in Hong Kong [see the Hong Kong Department of Health Report (2003) Outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) at Amoy Gardens, Kowloon Bay, Hong Kong. Main findings of the investigation; http://www.info.gov.hk/dh/ap.htm]. To understand the viral load and infectivity at different stages of SARS, quantification of serial viral titer by realtime PCR to study the viral dynamics in the blood, respiratory secretions and excreta is required. This information will be important in the implementation of public health measures to prevent the spreading of SARS in the community.","The transmission of influenza can be mathematically modeled to help predicting how the virus will spread in a population [27, 28] . People who contract influenza are most infectious between the second and third days after infection, and infectivity lasts for around 10 days [27] . Children are much more infectious than adults, and shed virus from just before they develop symptoms until 2 weeks after infection [27, 29] . For influenza control it is very important to investigate viral shedding and resistant viruses [29] . According to Mitamura and colleagues [29] , viral loads are decreased after the start of antiviral agents, but resistant viruses are detected in some patients. Influenza can be spread by direct transmission when an infected person sneezes mucus into the eyes, nose, or mouth of another person; through people inhaling the aerosols produced by infected people with coughing, sneezing, and spitting; and through hand-to-mouth transmission from contaminated surfaces or direct personal contact [30, 31] . The relative importance of airborne, droplet, and contact transmission of influenza A virus and the efficiency of control measures depends on the inactivation of viruses in different environmental media. Weber and colleagues [31] systematically reviewed information on the environmental inactivation of influenza A viruses and modes of transmission. The airborne route is a potentially important transmission pathway for influenza in indoor environments. The importance of droplet transmission has to be reassessed. Contact transmission can be limited by fast inactivation of influenza virus on hands, and is more dependent on behavioral parameters than airborne transmission. However, the potentially large inocula deposited in the environment through sneezing and the protective effect of nasal mucus on virus survival could make contact transmission a key transmission mode. In the airborne route, it has been demonstrated that the inhalation of just one inhalable droplet (0.5-5 lm in diameter) might be enough to cause an infection [31] . Although a single sneeze releases up to 40,000 droplets [32] , most of these droplets are large and will quickly settle out of the air [31] . The influenza virus can also be transmitted by contaminated surfaces. Successful control of a viral disease requires knowledge of the different vectors that could promote its transmission among hosts. Thomas and colleagues [33] assessed the survival of human influenza viruses on banknotes, given that billions of these notes are exchanged daily worldwide. Banknotes were experimentally contaminated with representative influenza virus subtypes at various concentrations, and survival was tested after different time periods. Influenza A viruses tested by cell culture survived up to 3 days when they were inoculated at high concentrations. The same inoculum in the presence of respiratory mucus showed a striking increase in survival time (up to 17 days). B/Hong Kong/335/2001 virus was still infectious after 1 day when it was mixed with respiratory mucus. When nasopharyngeal secretions of naturally infected children were used, influenza virus survived for at least 48 h in one-third of the cases. The investigators concluded that unexpected stability of influenza virus in this nonbiological environment suggests that unusual environmental contamination should be considered in the setting of pandemic preparedness [33] . Bean and colleagues investigated the transmission of influenza viruses via hands and environmental surfaces; the survival of laboratory-grown influenza A and influenza B viruses on various surfaces was studied. Both influenza A and B viruses survived for 24 to 48 hours on hard, nonporous surfaces such as stainless steel and plastic, but survived for less than 8 to 12 hours on cloth, paper, and tissues. Measurable quantities of influenza A virus were transferred from stainless steel surfaces to hands for 24 hours and from tissues to hands for up to 15 minutes. Virus survived on hands for up to 5 minutes after transfer from the environmental surfaces. Their observations suggest that the transmission of virus from donors who are shedding large amounts could occur for 2 to 8 hours via stainless steel surfaces and for a few minutes via paper tissues. The investigators concluded that the transmission of influenza virus via fomites may be possible under conditions of heavy environmental contamination [34] . However, if the virus is present in mucus, the virus can survive for longer periods [31] .","The international expansion of COVID-19 cases has led to widespread adoption of symptom and risk screening measures, in travel-associated and other contexts, and programs may still be adopted or expanded as source epidemics of COVID-19 emerge in new geographic areas. Using a mathematical model of screening effectiveness, with preliminary estimates of COVID-19 epidemiology and natural history, we estimate that screening will detect less than half of infected travellers in a growing epidemic, and that screening effectiveness will increase marginally as growth of the source epidemic decelerates. We found that two main factors influenced the effectiveness of screening. First, symptom screening depends on the natural history of an infection: individuals are increasingly likely to show detectable symptoms with increasing time since exposure. A fundamental shortcoming of screening is the difficulty of detecting infected individuals during their incubation period, or early after the onset of symptoms, at which point they still feel healthy enough to undertake normal activities or travel. This difficulty is amplified when the incubation period is longer; infected individuals have a longer window in which they may mix socially or travel with low probability of detection.","The increase of nasal IgA antibodies followed the onset of the virus shedding period with several days, suggesting that existing nasal IgA antibodies, which can neutralise BHVI (Madic et al., 1995) ) did not play a major role in curtailing the amount of virus shedding after reinfection or reactivation. This is further substantiated by the finding that no correlation existed between nasal IgA titres at reinfection and onset of corticosteroid treatment on the one hand, and virus shedding periods on the other.","There are three primary ways to transmit the virus, including close person-to-person contact, aerosol transmission, and transmission by touch [21] [22] [23] . The virus is thought to be transmitted to other people by respiratory droplets during coughing or sneezing. Droplet spread can occur when an infected person sneezes or coughs, whereupon virus containing droplets are propelled up to 3 feet through the air and are deposited on the mucous membranes of the mouth, nose, or eyes of persons who are nearby. A recent report suggests that transmission through the ocular surface is also possible [24] . The other avenues for the spread of the virus are shaking hands with an infected person, touching an infected object/surface, frequent touching of the nose or mouth or coming into contact with a patient's excreta. Another avenue is through \"hidden transmission\" [19] , in which asymptomatic infected individuals or carriers unknowingly transmit the virus to unsuspecting contacts.","According to the US Center for Disease Control and Prevention [11] and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control [12] , the virus is thought to spread mainly from person-to-person via respiratory droplets transmission: an infected person produces droplets containing viable virus and relays them by sneezing, coughing, or exhaling. The droplets can make contact with the nose, mouth, eyes, or upper respiratory tract of another person through three main important routes (see Fig. 1 ) [13] . The first is an airborne transmission in case of close contact between people (within about 6 feet, about 1.8 m). The second is a direct contact transmission as when two people shake their hands and the contaminated hand then touches a risk area on the second person. The last source is an indirect contact transmission where an infected person touches a surface that is then touched by the second person. This latter route is due to the fact that the SARS-CoV-2 (as other coronaviruses) can survive for several hours on inanimate environments (e.g. objects surfaces) [14] . Although this is not considered the main way the virus spreads, it may be possible that a person can get the virus by touching a surface that has the virus on it and then touching own mouth, nose or eyes.","This Article documents the first known person-to-person transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in the USA. Transmission occurred between close household contacts, from an index travel-associated case who subsequently transmitted the infection to her husband. Their prolonged, unprotected close contact occurred across multiple days early in her illness, before Patient 1 sought clinical care. No additional cases of COVID-19 were identified through active symptom monitoring of several hundred community and health-care personnel contacts, testing of symptomatic PUIs, or screening of a subset of asymptomatic healthcare personnel contacts. These data suggest that personto-person transmission of COVID-19 might be most likely to occur through unprotected, prolonged exposure to a patient with symptomatic COVID-19. Our experience of limited transmission of SARS-CoV-2 differs from that documented in Wuhan, where transmission has been reported to occur across the wider community and in health-care personnel, 6 and from experiences of other similar coronaviruses. [17] [18] [19] The severity of illness, the extent of viral shedding, and timing of exposures to a symptomatic patient might all have contributed to the limited transmission described here. Infection control measures within the hospital setting and an aggressive public health response might also have prevented further exposures.","The virus is also frequently detected in urine, feces, or throat specimens of patients, and thus can be transmitted from person to person through contact with the blood or secretions of patients. 12 Several outbreaks of family clusters of SFTS have also provided evidence of person-to-person transmission. 8, 13 Recently, a novel bunyavirus was detected in two patients with a history of tick bite in the USA, whose clinical features were similar to those of SFTS, suggesting that SFTS has become an emerging zoonosis worldwide. 14 ","China, emphasis on these measures is likely to rise in an attempt to prevent community spread 261 of the virus in new geographic areas. Using a mathematical model of screening with preliminary 262 estimates of nCoV epidemiology and natural history, we found that screening will in the best 263 case only detect less than half of infected travellers. We found that two main factors influenced 264 the effectiveness of screening. First, symptom screening depends on the natural history of an 265 infection: individuals are increasingly likely to show detectable symptoms with increasing time 266 since exposure. A fundamental challenge of screening is that many infected individuals will 267 travel during their incubation period, a point at which they still feel healthy enough to travel but 268 are simultaneously most difficult to detect. This effect is amplified when the incubation period is 269 longer; infected individuals have a longer window in which they may travel with low probability of 270 detection. Second, screening depends on whether exposure risk factors exist that would 271 facilitate specific and reasonably sensitive case detection by questionnaire. For nCoV, there is 272 so far limited evidence for specific risk factors; we therefore assumed that at most 40% of 273 travellers would be aware of a potential exposure, and that a minority would self-report their 274 exposure honestly, which led to limited effectiveness in questionnaire-based screening. The 275","It is however likely that immunosuppressed patients may be prone to acquiring the virus at higher risk due to its high efficiency in transmission. The virus shedding has been noted not only in respiratory specimens but also in serum and stool. Importantly, viral shedding can occur for days for weeks furtively in asymptomatic carrier individuals especially children (3, 9, 10) and fecal shedding has been noted in patients without diarrhea.(10) Significant environmental contamination has been noted, including wash-basin, toilet bowl and air outlet fan surfaces in hospitalized patients.(11) Thus, it is prudent to advise transplant recipients to ardently practice mitigation strategies such as social distancing, sanitization, hand hygiene and avoidance of areas known to harbor potentially infected individuals. These recommendations extend to their care providers as well.","In conclusion, we describe the genetic stability of the MERS-CoV in a strain from the recent Jeddah outbreak. Although reassuring, this finding should not limit the level of awareness regarding the increased number of cases in the Arabian Peninsula reported recently and the potential evolution and more efficient transmission of the virus. A WHO committee recently concluded that the conditions for a Public Health Emergency of International Concern have not yet been met. Nevertheless, important gaps in current knowledge about MERS-CoV exist. More investigations to clarify the natural reservoir and modes of transmission are necessary. Persistence of virus shedding in patients' secretions and the effect of immune status and antiviral therapy together with the implementation of appropriate infection control measures are of paramount importance in limiting further spread of this potentially lethal virus.","HCMV is species-specific and will not grow in the NHPs available for study. This limits experimental investigations to tissue culture settings and natural history studies in humans, leaving many experimental questions unanswered. However, the NHP models are ideally suited to fill the experimental void concerning many critical aspects of HCMV natural history and to develop novel immunological and chemotherapeutic strategies that can either prevent infection or limit disease.","The kinetics of SARS-CoV-2 viral load have not yet been well characterised in large numbers of patients. Prolonged nasopharyngeal viral shedding was reported in a series of 18 patients from Singapore, with a median of 12 days between first and last positive samples and an initial large decline in viral load followed by a slower decay of residual low-level virus (8) . Similar kinetics were observed in 17 patients from China, where results were stratified by site tested (nose/throat) suggesting quantitatively greater and more prolonged shedding from the nose (9) . The kinetics of shedding in this case match this pattern, with more prolonged nasal shedding (Figure) .","As previously mentioned SARS virus downregulates cellular expression of ACE2 [102]. Binding of the SARS spike protein induced ADAM-17-dependent shedding of ACE2 N-terminal domain [103] (Figure 3). This shedding has been reported by different groups to be both essential for viral replication [104] and unnecessary [97]. The SARS virus undergoes clathrin-dependent endocytosis upon receptor binding; this process internalises both the SARS virus and its receptor further clearing ACE2 from the cell membrane (Figure 3) and hence allowing enhanced (and damaging) reactivity towards circulating Ang II. In contrast to ectodomain shedding, the cytoplasmic domain of ACE2 appears to play no role in the regulation of internalisation [105]. ","In the absence of vaccines and specific treatment, the only available public health tools to control persontoperson transmittable diseases are isolation and quarantine, social distancing, and community containment measures. 10 Isolation is the separation of ill people from non infected people, and usually occurs in hospital settings, but could also be done at home for mild infections. 11 For isolation to be successful in preventing transmission, case detection should be early-ie, before the onset of viral shedding or at least before the onset of peak viral shedding. For SARS, viral loads peaked at 6-11 days after onset of illness for nasopharyngeal aspirates, enabling early isolation before transmission. 12 The number of secondary cases from an infected patient was clearly reduced if the infected patient was isolated within 4 days after onset of symptoms. 13 For SARS, a highly sensitive case definition was used with a focus on fever or respiratory symptoms, and an epidemiological link (contact or travel history). All suspected patients were isolated until SARS was ruled out. Implementing optimal isolation by itself was modelled to be more costeffective than implementing suboptimal isolation and quarantine together. 14 Secondary household transmission was low in Singapore (6\u00b72%), indicative of rapid detection and isolation of patients. Similarly, in Toronto, secondary attack rate in households was 10%, with a linear association between secondary attack rate and the time that the index patient spent at home after symptom onset. 15 In Singapore, healthcare associated transmission accounted for more than 90% of all cases. 16 Once full measures were in place, almost all patients were promptly isolated before secondary transmission had occurred. The outbreak in Singapore was propagated by five superspreading events, 16 including three super spreading events as a result of atypical clinical manifestations of SARS. 17 Quarantine involves movement restriction, ideally combined with medical observation during the quarantine period, of close contacts of infected patients during the incubation period. 18 The premise for successful quarantine is prompt and comprehensive contact tracing of each and every confirmed patient. Quarantine can take place at home or in designated places such as hotels, and both of these options were used during the SARS epidemic. Quarantined contacts had to record their temperatures, and were visited or telephoned daily by a member of the public healthcare team. If the contact developed symptoms, they were investigated at a designated healthcare facility. The principle is that if the person under quarantine developed illness, that person would not have any close contacts to spread the disease, effectively reducing the R\u2080 of the outbreak to less than 1. As an example of the magnitude of efforts taken, Toronto Public Health investigated 2132 potential cases of SARS and identified 23 103 contacts as requiring quarantine. 19 Legally enforceable quarantine orders were issued to contacts. Police made spot checks in Hong Kong whereas video cameras were installed at the home of each contact in Singapore. 16, 20 Once it is no longer feasible to identify all infectious individuals and their contacts in the attempt to slow the spread of disease, a possible next step is to apply communitywide containment measures. Community wide containment is an intervention that is applied to an entire community, city, or region, designed to reduce personal interactions. 10 These interventions range from measures to encourage personal responsibility to identify disease, increase social distancing among community members including cancellation of public gatherings, and finally implement community quarantine. 11 Enforcement of communitywide contain ment measures is far more complex than isolation or quarantine because of the larger number of people involved. China best exemplified this largescale quarantine by declaring epidemic zones and placing people under collective quarantine in villages, cities, or institutions. 21 In April 2003, the Chinese authorities gained full control of all activities to combat SARS, with guidelines and control measures that were national, unambiguous, rational, and widely followed, under central guidance. The stringent control measures included school closures and closures of all universities and public places, as well as the cancellation of the public holiday in May. Immediately, the R\u2080 decreased greatly and consistently. 22 In May, 2003, China locked down Beijing and closed more than 3500 public places in an effort to curb community spread.","With more than 1,100 species spanning 17 families, it is estimated that bats (order Chiroptera) comprise over 20% of all mammalian species. Their dispersion over much of the globe probably enhances their potential to act as reservoirs for pathogens, some of which are extremely virulent and potentially lethal to other animals and humans, including SARS-CoV48,49. Bats' natural roosting behaviours, in combination with ecological pressures that select for synanthropy, have brought bats closer to humans and to animals that live in proximity to humans, probably increasing the chances of bat-to-animal and bat-to-human transmission48,50. In fact, such a scenario has been proposed for the transmission of SARS-CoV-related coronaviruses from bats to humans: the bats roosted in or near open markets that sold civets in China; viruses were transmitted to civets via faecal and/or oral shedding; and humans handled civets and raw or improperly cooked civet meat, thus completing the transmission chain from bat to human. Alternatively, bats might have directly transmitted the virus to humans via shedding, incidentally co-infecting the civets. There is evidence in support of this hypothesis, as a genetically reconstructed R. sinicus bat SARS-CoV-related coronavirus was able to infect primate cells, mouse cells that expressed human ACE2 molecules and mice used to model SARS-CoV infection, and it was able to produce cross-neutralizing antibodies in these mice51.","CoVs can transmit across species barriers. SARS-CoV originated from bats of the Hipposideridae family, using palm civets as intermediary hosts before dissemination to humans [15, 16] . The earliest patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 in Wuhan ultimately caused the epidemic known as COronaVIrus Disease 2019 (COVID-2019). Some of these patients had a history of contact with a wholesale seafood market in the early stages, suggesting animal-to-person spread. Subsequently, a large number of patients reportedly did not have exposure to the markets, suggesting the development of person-to-person spread [17] [18] [19] [20] .","The routes by which the different respiratory viruses spread from person to person are variable and include combinations of contact, droplet, and aerosol transmission. For example, rhinovirus and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) are primarily spread by direct contact with contaminated skin and environmental surfaces followed by self-inoculation of virus onto the nasal mucosa or conjunctiva. Other viruses, such as measles and varicella-zoster viruses, spread as small-particle aerosols. Other viruses may spread by means of larger-particle aerosols over short distances (1 m). The relative importance of the various transmission routes under natural conditions for each virus varies and in many cases is unknown. ","For survivors, the median duration of viral shedding was 20\u00b70 days (IQR 17\u00b70-24\u00b70) from illness onset, but the virus was continuously detectable until death in nonsurvivors (table 2; figure 1 ). The shortest observed duration of viral shedding among survivors was 8 days, whereas the longest was 37 days. Among 29 patients who received lopinavir/ritonavir and were discharged, the median time from illness onset to initiation of antiviral treatment was 14\u00b70 days (IQR 10\u00b70-17\u00b70) and the median duration of viral shedding was 22\u00b70 days (18\u00b70-24\u00b70). The median duration of viral shedding was 19\u00b70 days (17\u00b70-22\u00b70) in patients with severe disease status and 24\u00b70 days (22\u00b70-30\u00b70) in patients with critical disease status.","Fecal testing for feline coronaviruses by real time RT-PCR is not only a good way to detect shedding, but also a good way to quantitate the level and frequency of shedding. Real time RT-PCR is commercially available and highly accurate if appropriately performed. However, the presence of inhibitors needs to be taken into consideration and can affect quantitative measurements of viral levels (Dye et al., 2008) . Large amounts of virus are shed in the feces for many weeks, and even months, after initial infection, but with time and lack of re-exposure most cats will stop shedding (Pedersen et al., 2008) . However, some cats can shed at high levels for prolonged periods of time and some cats that have stopped shedding become susceptible to reinfection (Pedersen et al., 2008) .","For the large fraction of cases, camels serve as a primary source of infection. Greater than 90% of dromedary camels in the Arabian Peninsula27-30 and North Africa31 are seropositive or actively shedding virus - that suggests a high level of susceptibility to infection. Camels develop a self-limited upper respiratory infection marked by high viral excretion that can exceed 107 PFU/ml.32 Other camelids can serve as natural hosts. Alpacas housed in proximity to camels have high seropositivity rates33 demonstrating the opportunity for additional reservoirs of infection. The global trade in exotic animals such as palm civets served as the vector for transmission of SARS-CoV34 and should provide caution regarding animal-related spread of MERS-CoV.","The diagnostic criteria for SARS were based on a list of clinical features suggested by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) during the initial phase of the epidemic. According to the WHO criteria, a suspected case was defined as a person presenting after 1 November 2002 who had a history of fever &gt;38\u00b0C, with cough or difficulty breathing, and had close contact with a person who was a suspected or probable case of SARS, or had a history of traveling to or residing in an area with transmission of SARS within 10 days before the onset of symptoms. In addition, a person with an unexplained acute respiratory illness resulting in death, with epidemiological exposure similar to that described above, but on whom no autopsy was performed, also fulfilled the clinical criteria of suspected SARS."],"title":["Chapter 16 Emerging and Reemerging Viral Diseases","Seasonality of infectious diseases and severe acute respiratory syndrome\u2013what we don't know can hurt us","A tug-of-war between severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 and host antiviral defence: lessons from other pathogenic viruses","14 Emerging and Reemerging Infectious Disease Threats","What Have We Learned About Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus Emergence in Humans?
