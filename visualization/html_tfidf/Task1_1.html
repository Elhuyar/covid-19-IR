It is being treated as a Class A infectious disease though it was classified as Class B according to the Infectious Disease Prevention Act of China. Accurate estimation of the incubation period of the coronavirus is essential to the prevention and control. However, it remains unclear about its exact incubation period though it is believed that symptoms of COVID-19 can appear in as few as 2 days or as long as 14 or even more after exposure. The accurate incubation period calculation requires original chain-of-infection data that may not be fully available in the Wuhan regions. In this study, we aim to accurately calculate the incubation period of COVID-19 by taking advantage of the chain-of-infection data, which is well-documented and epidemiologically informative, outside the Wuhan regions. Methods: We acquired and collected officially reported COVID-19 data from 10 regions in Ch...","Respiratory viruses have emerged and re-emerged in humans for hundreds of years. In the recent past avian and animal influenza viruses have caused human disease ranging from conjunctivitis to respiratory illnesses, including the 2009\u201310 A(H1N1)pdm09 pandemic. Coronaviruses, human metapneumovirus (hMPV) and enteroviruses have also impacted humans globally. Since the likely public health impacts are common, plans and policies for intervention strategies can be developed, encompassing early detection through surveillance and diagnostics, as well as treatment and prevention through clinical and non-clinical interventions. The global comprehensiveness of these varies according to differing resources, competing health priorities and the causative agent, yet, irrespective of this, activities must be proportional to the threat. Pandemics and severe epidemics enable policies to be tested and gaps identified.","AbstractA discrete dynamic model for human epidemics was developed in present study. The model included major parameters as transmission strength and its decline parameters, mean incubation period, hospitalization time, non-hospitalization daily mortality, non-hospitalization daily recovery rate, and hospitalization proportion, etc. Sensitivity analysis of the model indicated the total cumulative cases significantly increased with initial transmission strength, hospitalization time. The total cumulative cases significantly decreased with transmission strength\u2019s decline and hospitalization proportion, and linearly decreased with non-hospitalization daily mortality and non-hospitalization daily recovery rate. In a certain range, the total cumulative cases significantly increased with mean incubation period. Sensitivity analysis demonstrated that dynamic change of transmission strength is one of the most important and controllable factors. In addition, reducing the delay for hospitalizati...","Background: The current outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has quickly spread across countries and become a global crisis. However, one of the most important clinical characteristics in epidemiology, the distribution of the incubation period, remains unclear. Different estimates of the incubation period of COVID-19 were reported in recent published studies, but all have their own limitations. In this study, we propose a novel low-cost and accurate method to estimate the incubation distribution. Methods: We have conducted a cross-sectional and forward follow-up study by identifying those asymptomatic individuals at their time of departure from Wuhan and then following them until their symptoms developed. The renewal process is hence adopted by considering the incubation period as a renewal and the duration between departure and symptom onset as a forward recurrence time. Under mild assumptions, the observations of selected forward times can be used to consistently estimate ...","Background The outbreak of a new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) disease (Covid-19) has become pandemic. To be more effectively controlling the disease, it is critical to set up an optimal quarantine period so that about 95% of the cases developing symptoms will be retained for isolation. At the moment, the WHO-established quarantine period is 14 days based on previous reports which had studied small sizes of hospitalized cases (10 and ~100, respectively), however, over 80% of adult- and 95% of child-cases were not necessary to stay in hospitals, and therefore, had not been hospitalized. Therefore, we are questioning if the current-inferred median incubation time is representative for the whole Covid-19 population, and if the current quarantine period is optimal. Methods We compiled and analyzed the patient-level information of 2015 laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 cases including 99 children in 28 Chinese provinces. This cohort represents a wide-range spectrum of Covid-19 disease with both hosp...","The rapid spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) raises concern about a global pandemic. Knowledge about the duration of viral shedding remains important for patient management and infection control. We report the duration of viral detection in throat and rectum of a COVID-19 patient treated at the Hospital for Tropical Diseases in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. Despite clinical recovery, SARS-CoV-2 RNA remained detectable by real time RT-PCR in throat and rectal swabs until day 11 and 18 of hospitalization, respectively. Because live SARS-CoV-2 has been successfully isolated from a stool sample from a COVID-19 patient in China, the results demonstrate that COVID-19 patients may remain infectious for long periods, and fecal-oral transmission may be possible. Therefore, our finding has important implications for infection control.","BACKGROUND: Few previous studies have investigated the association between the severity of an infectious disease and the length of incubation period. METHODS: We estimated the association between the length of the incubation period and the severity of infection with the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus, using data from the epidemic in 2003 in Hong Kong. RESULTS: We estimated the incubation period of SARS based on a subset of patients with available data on exposure periods and a separate subset of patients in a putative common source outbreak, and we found significant associations between shorter incubation period and greater severity in both groups after adjusting for potential confounders. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that patients with a shorter incubation period proceeded to have more severe disease. Further studies are needed to investigate potential biological mechanisms for this association.","Abstract Background Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) is a major infectious disease which has affected the Middle Eastern countries, especially the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) since 2012. The high mortality rate associated with this disease has been a major cause of concern. This paper aims at identifying the major factors influencing MERS recovery in KSA. Methods The data used for analysis was collected from the Ministry of Health website, KSA. The important factors impelling the recovery are found using machine learning. Machine learning models such as support vector machine, conditional inference tree, na\u00efve Bayes and J48 are modelled to identify the important factors. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis is also carried out to identify the significant factors statistically. Result The main factors influencing MERS recovery rate are identified as age, pre-existing diseases, severity of disease and whether the patient is a healthcare worker or not. In spit...","Abstract The aetiology of community acquired pneumonia varies according to the region in which it is acquired. This review discusses those causes of CAP that occur in the tropics and might not be readily recognizable when transplanted to other sites. Various forms of pneumonia including the viral causes such as influenza (seasonal and avian varieties), the coronaviruses and the Hantavirus as well as bacterial causes, specifically the pneumonic form of Yersinia pestis and melioidosis are discussed.","The novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is a recently emerged human pathogen that has spread widely since January 2020. Initially, the basic reproductive number, R0, was estimated to be 2.2 to 2.7. Here we provide a new estimate of this quantity. We collected extensive individual case reports and estimated key epidemiology parameters, including the incubation period. Integrating these estimates and high-resolution real-time human travel and infection data with mathematical models, we estimated that the number of infected individuals during early epidemic double every 2.4 days, and the R0 value is likely to be between 4.7 and 6.6. We further show that quarantine and contact tracing of symptomatic individuals alone may not be effective and early, strong control measures are needed to stop transmission of the virus.","Based on publicly released data for 1212 patients, we investigated the epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 in Henan of China. The following findings are obtained: 1) COVID-19 patients in Henan show gender (55% vs 45%) and age (81% aged between 21 and 60) preferences, possible causes were explored; 2) Statistical analysis on 483 patients reveals that the estimated average, mode and median incubation periods are 7.4, 4 and 7 days; Incubation periods of 92% patients were no more than 14 days; 3) The epidemic of COVID-19 in Henan has undergone three stages and showed high correlations with the numbers of patients that recently return from Wuhan; 4) Network analysis on the aggregate outbreak phenomena of COVID-19 revealed that 208 cases were clustering infected, and various people's Hospital are the main force in treating patients. The related investigations have potential implications for the prevention and control of COVID-19.","Abstract The global spread of COVID-19 is placing unprecedented demands on healthcare services. In this time of crisis, innovative and adaptive methods of practising will be required across all health professions. In order to maximise the use of current available resources, it is vital that existing services are comprehensively reviewed and full use is made of any unrealised potential among healthcare providers. Community pharmacy is one of a number of health professions that has a key role to play in responding to the current pandemic. As the scope of community pharmacy practice varies considerably across countries, it is important to examine ways in which the profession can assist with the public health response to COVID-19 and maintaining the continuity of healthcare services. This article seeks to highlight roles and activities that community pharmacists can undertake to help in relieving pressure on other areas of the health service, such as general practice. This information coul...","Background: The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic broke out in Wuhan, China, and it spread rapidly. Since January 23, 2020, China has launched a series of unusual and strict measures, including the lockdown of Wuhan city to contain this highly contagious disease. We collected the epidemiological data to analyze the trend of this epidemic in China. Methods: We closely tracked the Chinese and global official websites to collect the epidemiological information about COVID-19. The number of total and daily new confirmed cases of COVID-19 in China was presented to illustrate the trend of this epidemic. Results: On January 23, 2020, 835 confirmed COVID-19 cases were reported in China. On February 6, 2020, there were 31211 cases. By February 20, 2020, the number reached as high as 75,993. Most cases were distributed in and around Wuhan, Hubei province. Since January 23, 2020, the number of daily new cases in China except Hubei province reached a peak of 890 on the eleventh day and ...","Background: As the COVID-19 epidemic is spreading, incoming data allows us to quantify values of key variables that determine the transmission and the effort required to control the epidemic. We determine the incubation period and serial interval distribution for transmission clusters in Singapore and in Tianjin. We infer the basic reproduction number and identify the extent of pre-symptomatic transmission. Methods: We collected outbreak information from Singapore and Tianjin, China, reported from Jan.19-Feb.26 and Jan.21-Feb.27, respectively. We estimated incubation periods and serial intervals in both populations. Results: The mean incubation period was 7.1 (6.13, 8.25) days for Singapore and 9 (7.92, 10.2)days for Tianjin. Both datasets had shorter incubation periods for earlier-occurring cases. The mean serial interval was 4.56 (2.69, 6.42) days for Singapore and 4.22 (3.43, 5.01) for Tianjin. We inferred that early in the outbreaks, infection was transmitted on average 2.55 and 2....","Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a highly contagious and predominantly pneumonic illness caused by a novel coronavirus now commonly known as SARS-CoV. This article describes the key diagnostic clinical features, radiologic features, and investigation profiles of affected patients. We summarize our understanding from anecdotal experience and limited published data on the use of antiviral and corticosteroid therapy in the management of this highly contagious disease.","ABSTRACT Acute respiratory tract infections (ARTIs) are a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in children worldwide, but the aetiology of many ARTIs is still unknown. In 2001, researchers in The Netherlands reported the discovery of a previously unidentified pathogen called human metapneumovirus (hMPV). Since its initial description, hMPV has been associated with ARTI in Europe (Italy, France, Spain, the UK, Germany, Denmark, Finland and Norway), America (the USA, Canada, Argentina and Brazil), Asia (India, Japan, China and Singapore), Australia and South Africa in individuals of all ages. The incidence of infection varies from 1.5% to 25%, indicating that hMPV is a ubiquitous virus with a worldwide distribution. hMPV seems to play an important role as a cause of paediatric upper and lower respiratory tract infection, with similar, but not identical, epidemiological and clinical features to those of respiratory syncytial virus and influenza virus. Moreover, the socio-economic impa...","Summary Background: Some articles have reported the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in Wuhan, but other cities have rarely been reported. This study explored the epidemiology of COVID-19 in Jingmen. Methods: All confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the First People\u2032s Hospital of Jingmen are included from January 12 to February 14,2020. Cases were analyzed for epidemiological data and were confirmed by real-time PCR. Findings: Of the 213 cases (108 men and 105 women) , 88 (41%) had exposure to Wuhan. The median age was 48 years ( range,2-88 years;IQR,35-58.5). Thirty-three severe patients with a median age of 66 years(range,33-82 years,IQR, 57-76) were treated in intensive care units; out of these patients, 66.7 %(22) were men and 19 (57.5%) had chronic diseases, including hypertension, diabetes, heart failure, stroke, and renal insufficiency. Under the controlled measures, the number of new patients gradually decreased and nearly disappeared aft...","Background: In the beginning of January 2020, new unknown virus pneumonia cases started to emerge in local hospitals in Wuhan, China. This virus epidemic quickly became a public health emergency of international concern by the WHO. Enormous amount of medical supplies as well as healthcare personals from other provinces were mobilized to support Wuhan. This current work tent to help people understanding how infectious disease spread and the purpose and consequences of various efforts based on simulation model. Method: a simulation model was created using known parameters. R0 set to 3 and mean incubation time to be 7.5days. the epidemic was divided to 3 periods. Simulation would run 50 times to mimic different patient0 status. Personal activity index was used to mimic different level of control measures. 141427709 simulated patients were created. Cumulation number of patients at the end of period 1 (day50) is 2868.7 \u00b1 1739.0. Total infected patients could be 913396.5 \u00b1 559099.9 by the en...","We model the evolution of the number of individuals that are reported to be sick with COVID-19 in Germany. Our theoretical framework builds on a continuous time Markov chain with four states: healthy without infection, sick, healthy after recovery or after infection but without symptoms and dead. Our quantitative solution matches the number of sick individuals up to the most recent observation and ends with a share of sick individuals following from infection rates and sickness probabilities. We employ this framework to study inter alia the expected peak of the number of sick individuals in a scenario without public regulation of social contacts. We also study the effects of public regulations. For all scenarios we report the expected end of the CoV-2 epidemic. We have four general findings: First, current epidemiological thinking implies that the long-run effects of the epidemic only depend on the aggregate long-run infection rate and on the individual risk to turn sick after an infec...","Abstract Zoonotic viral infections represent an important public health problem across the globe. Unlike infectious agents that are limited to humans, the presence of domestic and wild animal reservoirs and insect and arthropod vectors greatly complicate transmission dynamics and make control measures very difficult to implement. Some viral zoonoses are categorized as \u201cemerging infectious diseases\u201d because they are newly recognized or have shown significant changes in their geographic range and/or epidemiologic characteristics. This article provides updated information on the current status of the most important viral zoonotic diseases. The recent upsurge in Ebola virus infections in West Africa and the emergence of Zika virus in the Western Hemisphere are highlighted.","The growth and development of Covid-19 transmission have significantly cut the attention of many societies, particularly Iran that has been struggling with this contagious, infectious disease since late February 2020. In the present study, the known SIR model was used for the dynamics of an epidemic to provide a suitable assessment of the COVID-19 virus epidemic in Iran. The epidemic curve and SIR model parameters were obtained with the use of Iran statistical data. The recovered people were considered alongside the official number of confirmed victims as the reliable long-time statistical data of Iran. The results offered many important predictions of the COVID-19 virus epidemic such as realistic number of victims, infection rate, peak time, and other characteristics.","We calculated the structural properties of &gt;2500 coronaviruses and computed &gt;100000 human protein interactions with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Using the CROSS method, we found that the SARS-CoV-2 region encompassing nucleotides 23000 and 24000 is highly conserved at the structural level, while the region 1000 nucleotides up-stream varies significantly. The two sequences code for a domain of the spike S protein that binds to the host receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) that mediates human infection and in the homologue from Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) interacts with sialic acids. We predicted structured regions at the 5 prime and 3 prime ends where our calculations indicate strong propensity to bind proteins. Using the catRAPID method, we computed 3500 protein interactions with the 5 prime end and identified Cyclin T1 CCNT1, ATP-dependent RNA helicase DDX1, Zinc Finger Protein ZNF175 and other 20 high-confidence ...","The COVID-19 outbreak has been a serious public health threat worldwide. We use individually documented case descriptions of COVID-19 from China (excluding Hubei Province) to estimate the distributions of the generation time, incubation period, and periods from symptom onset to isolation and to diagnosis. The recommended 14-day quarantine period may lead to a 6.7% failure for quarantine. We recommend a 22-day quarantine period. The mean generation time is 3.3 days and the mean incubation period is 7.2 days. It took 3.7 days to isolate and 6.6 days to diagnose a patient after his/her symptom onset. Patients may become infectious on average 3.9 days before showing major symptoms. This makes contact tracing and quarantine ineffective. The basic reproduction number is estimated to be 1.54 with contact tracing, quarantine and isolation, mostly driven by super spreaders.","An increasingly large proportion of immigrants to developed countries is arriving from less developed countries in Africa, Asia, and Latin America. When these immigrants return to their country of origin to visit friends and relatives, they are at high risk of acquiring tropical infections, compared with other travelers. Immigrants who return to their country of origin to visit friends and relatives (VFRs) are more likely to travel to rural areas for long periods of time, to consume contaminated food and beverages, and to have more prolonged, intimate contact with local populations. As a group, they are less likely to seek pretravel advice or take antimalarial chemoprophylaxis. This article discusses the increased risk of tuberculosis, malaria, food- and waterborne illnesses, hepatitis A, and HIV and other sexually transmitted infections in VFRs.","Abstract The pneumonia caused by novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) in Wuhan, China in December 2019 is a highly contagious disease. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared the ongoing outbreak as a global public health emergency. Currently, the research on novel coronavirus is still in the primary stage. Based on the current published evidence, we systematically summarizes the epidemiology, clinical characteristics, diagnosis, treatment and prevention of knowledge surrounding COVID-19. This review in the hope of helping the public effectively recognize and deal with the 2019 novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), and providing a reference for future studies.","","BACKGROUND: A novel human coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), was identified in China in December 2019. There is limited support for many of its key epidemiologic features, including the incubation period for clinical disease (coronavirus disease 2019 [COVID-19]), which has important implications for surveillance and control activities. OBJECTIVE: To estimate the length of the incubation period of COVID-19 and describe its public health implications. DESIGN: Pooled analysis of confirmed COVID-19 cases reported between 4 January 2020 and 24 February 2020. SETTING: News reports and press releases from 50 provinces, regions, and countries outside Wuhan, Hubei province, China. PARTICIPANTS: Persons with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection outside Hubei province, China. MEASUREMENTS: Patient demographic characteristics and dates and times of possible exposure, symptom onset, fever onset, and hospitalization. RESULTS: There were 181 confirmed cases with iden...","Introduction: the current worldwide outbreak of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) due to a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) is seriously threatening the public health. The number of infected patients is continuously increasing and the need for Intensive Care Unit admission ranges from 5 to 26%. The mortality is reported to be around 3.4% with higher values for the elderly and in patients with comorbidities. Moreover, this condition is challenging the healthcare system where the outbreak reached its highest value. To date there is still no available treatment for SARS-CoV-2. Clinical and preclinical evidence suggests that nitric oxide (NO) has a beneficial effect on the coronavirus-mediated acute respiratory syndrome, and this can be related to its viricidal effect. The time from the symptoms onset to the development of severe respiratory distress is relatively long. We hypothesize that high concentrations of inhaled NO administered during early phases of COVID-19 infection can prevent ...","","Since the emergence of the first cases in Wuhan, China, the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection has been quickly spreading out to other provinces and neighboring countries. Estimation of the basic reproduction number by means of mathematical modeling can be helpful for determining the potential and severity of an outbreak and providing critical information for identifying the type of disease interventions and intensity. A deterministic compartmental model was devised based on the clinical progression of the disease, epidemiological status of the individuals, and intervention measures. The estimations based on likelihood and model analysis show that the control reproduction number may be as high as 6.47 (95% CI 5.71\u20137.23). Sensitivity analyses show that interventions, such as intensive contact tracing followed by quarantine and isolation, can effectively reduce the control reproduction number and transmission risk, with the effect of travel restriction adopted by Wuhan on 2019-nCoV ...","Objective: This paper studied the relationship between personality traits and mental health conditions of medical personnel to provide a basis and reference for the implementation of targeted education on mental health. Methods: A self-report inventory, the Symptom Checklist-90 (SCL-90), was used to investigate the mental health status of 548 medical personnel dealing with the new coronavirus pneumonia in eight provinces and cities of China. Results: The overall mean SCL-90 score and mean values of factors (somatization, obsessive-compulsive, anxiety, phobic anxiety, and psychoticism) of the medical personnel were significantly higher than in the norm group (p &lt; 0.05), while their average interpersonal sensitivity score was significantly lower (p &lt; 0.01). In addition, personal factors affecting the mental health status of medical personnel were identified. ( all p &lt; 0.05). Conclusion: The overall mental health status of medical personnel responding to new coronavirus pneumonia is gener...","Abstract Over 12 years have elapsed since severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) triggered the first global alert for coronavirus infections. Virus transmission in humans was quickly halted by public health measures and human infections of SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) have not been observed since. However, other coronaviruses still pose a continuous threat to human health, as exemplified by the recent emergence of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) in humans. The work on SARS-CoV widens our knowledge on the epidemiology, pathophysiology and immunology of coronaviruses and may shed light on MERS coronavirus (MERS-CoV). It has been confirmed that T-cell immunity plays an important role in recovery from SARS-CoV infection. Herein, we summarize T-cell immunological studies of SARS-CoV and discuss the potential cross-reactivity of the SARS-CoV-specific immunity against MERS-CoV, which may provide useful recommendations for the development of broad-spectrum vaccines against coronavirus...","Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is now a global public health threat with many medical, ethical, social, economic, political, and legal implications. The nonspecific signs and symptoms of this disease, coupled with a relatively long incubation period and the initial absence of a reliable diagnostic test, limited the understanding of the magnitude of the outbreak. This paper outlines our experience with public health issues that have arisen during this outbreak of SARS in Hong Kong. We confirmed that case detection, reporting, clear and timely dissemination of information, and strict infection control measures are essential in handling such an infectious disease outbreak. The need for an outbreak response unit is crucial to combat any future outbreak.","Infections with bat-origin coronaviruses have caused severe illness in humans by \u2018host jump\u2019. Recently, novel bat-origin coronaviruses were found in pigs. The large number of mutations on the receptor-binding domain allowed the viruses to infect the new host, posing a potential threat to both agriculture and public health.","Background The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization, while several key epidemiological parameters of the disease remain to be clarified. This study aimed to obtain robust estimates of the incubation period, upper limit of latent period (interval between exposure of infector and infectee), serial interval, time point of exposure and basic reproduction number (R0) of COVID-19. Methods Between late February and early March of 2020, the individual data of laboratory confirmed cases of COVID-19 were retrieved from 10728 publicly available reports released by the health authorities of and outside China and from 1790 publications identified in PubMed and CNKI. To be eligible, a report had to contain the data that allowed for estimation of at least one parameter. As relevant data mainly came from clustering cases, the clusters for which no evidence was available to establish transmission order were all excluded to ensure ...","Prolonged viral shedding is associated with severe status and poor prognosis of COVID-19 patients. Unexpectedly, here we report a non-severe patient with the longest duration of viral shedding. According to the investigation on the clinical and epidemiological information of this case, we concluded that this type of virus might have a low toxicity and transmissibility, but have a prolonged infective ability and was hardly to be eliminated in the body with regular therapy. However, infusion of plasma from recovered patients showed high efficiency in elimination of this virus. Our findings might shed light on the management of COVID-19.","Abstract The pandemic of new coronavirus disease COVID-19 is threatening our health, economy and life style. Collaborations across countries and sectors as a One Health World could be a milestone. We propose a general protocol, for setting timely active random surveillance of COVID-19, at the human community level, with systematic repeated detection efforts. Strengths and limitations are discussed. If considered applicable by public health, the protocol could evaluate the status of COVID-19 epidemics consistently and objectively.","The last decades have been characterized by the appearance of a substantial number of newly recognized or novel infectious agents and by the re-emergence of infectious diseases with a global impact. The objective of this article is to briefly describe the model of hospital response for early diagnosis and prompt management of patients with highly contagious infectious diseases. We reviewed the main components of hospital preparedness in response to clustering of highly contagious diseases. A model for the initial hospital response to an epidemic in our referral Institute is discussed. Prompt recognition and identification is the initial and indispensable step in facing any communicable diseases, regardless of whether it is a prevalent, a newly emerging one or deliberately released. The importance of developing and implementing nontraditional methods of public health surveillance and a system that allows a wide and immediate dissemination of information and exchange of views on risk ass...","2019-nCoV had caused pneumonia outbreak in Wuhan. Existing evidence have confirmed the human-to-human transmission of 2019-nCoV. We retrospectively collected infection data from 2 January to 22 January at six departments from Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University. In our study, we found N95 respirators, disinfection and hand washing can help to reduce the risk of 2019-nCoV infection in medical staffs. Our results call for re-emphasizing strict occupational protection code in battling this novel contagious disease. The risk of 2019-nCoV infection was higher in the open area than in the quarantined area. N95 may be more effective for 2019-nCoV infections.","Exotic and emerging viral pathogens associated with high morbidity and mortality in humans are being identified annually with recent examples including Lujo virus in southern Africa, Severe Fever with Thrombocytopenia Syndrome virus in China and a SARS-like coronavirus in the Middle East. The sporadic nature of these infections hampers our understanding of these diseases and limits the opportunities to design appropriate medical countermeasures against them. Because of this, animal models are utilized to gain insight into the pathogenesis of disease with the overall goal of identifying potential targets for intervention and evaluating specific therapeutics and vaccines. For these reasons it is imperative that animal models of disease recapitulate the human condition as closely as possible in order to provide the best predictive data with respect to the potential efficacy in humans. In this article we review the current status of disease models for highly pathogenic and emerging viral p...","The present status of COVID\u201519 is analyzed and the end of the disease is forecasted. The peak of the epidemic is different in three regions, Wuhan, Hubei province except Wuhan, and mainland China except Hubei. In two regions except Wuhan, the peak of the epidemic passed ten days ago. If the trend until February 11 does not change, the disease may end by the end of February. In Wuhan, the epidemic reached a peak but the reported number of newly infected patients fluctuates largely. We need to know the reason for the big fluctuation to forecast the end of the disease.","Animal coronaviruses, such as infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), and arteriviruses, such as porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), are able to manifest highly contagious infections in their specific native hosts, thereby arising in critical economic damage to animal industries. This review discusses recent progress in studies of virus-host interactions during animal and human coronavirus and arterivirus infections, with emphasis on IBV-host cell interactions. These interactions may be directly involved in viral replication or lead to the alteration of certain signaling pathways, such as cell stress response and innate immunity, to facilitate viral replication and pathogenesis.","Many new infectious diseases in humans have been derived from animal sources in the past 20 years. Some are highly contagious and fatal. Vaccination may not be available and antiviral drugs are not effective enough. Infectious control is important in clinical medicine and in Ophthalmology. Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), as an example, is a highly contagious respiratory disease that has recently been reported in Asia, North America, and Europe. Within a matter of weeks, the outbreak has evolved to become a global health threat and more than 30 countries have been afflicted with a novel Coronavirus strain (SARS-CoV) that is the aetiologic agent of SARS. The primary route of transmission of SARS appears involving close person-to-person contact through droplets. Ophthalmologists may be particularly susceptible to the infection as routine ophthalmic examinations like direct ophthalmoscopy and slit-lamp examination are usually performed in a setting that has close doctor\u2013patient c...","Here we report the clinical features of 25 discharged patients with COVID-19 recovery. Our analysis indicated that there was a significant inverse correlation existed between serum D-Dimer level and the duration of antiviral treatment, while lymphocyte concentration significantly positively correlated with the duration of virus reversal.","Purpose: The COVID-19 death-rate in Italy continues to climb, surpassing that in every other country. We implement one of the first nationally representative surveys about this unprecedented public health crisis and use it to evaluate the Italian government's public health efforts and citizen responses. Findings: (1) Public health messaging is being heard. At this point, the Italian people understand how to keep themselves and others safe from the SARS-Cov-2 virus. This is true for all population groups we studied, with the partial exception of slightly lower compliance among young adults. Remarkably, even those who do not trust the government, and those who think the government has been untruthful about the crisis mostly believe the public health message and claim to be acting in accordance. (2) The quarantine is beginning to have serious negative effects on the population's mental health. Policy Recommendations: Public health messaging is being heard and understood. The focus now sho...","This paper deals with an advanced analytical epidemic diffusion model which is capable to predict the status of epidemic impacts. This newly propose model well describes an epidemic growth and it could be widely applied into various topics including pathology, epidemiology, business and data sciences. The Advanced Analytical Epidemic Diffusion Model (AAEDM) is a dynamic diffusion prediction model which is theoretically intuitive and its tractable closed formula could be easily adapted into versatile Bigdata driven analytics including the machine learning system. This dynamic model is still an analytical model but the periods of prediction are segmented for adapting the values from the dataset when the data is available. The epidemiologically vital parameters which effect on the AAEDM are also introduced in this paper. The evaluation of this theoretical model based on the Covid-19 data in Korea has been accomplished with relative fair future prediction accuracies. Although this analytic...","Abstract SARS-CoV-2 can be shed in the stool of patients in the recovery phase. Children show a longer shedding time than adults. We analyzed the possible causes of this finding and recommend that a negative stool sample be included in a patient\u2019s discharge criteria.","Because of the constant threat posed by emerging infectious diseases and the limitations of existing approaches used to identify new pathogens, there is a great demand for new technological methods for viral discovery. We describe herein a DNA microarray-based platform for novel virus identification and characterization. Central to this approach was a DNA microarray designed to detect a wide range of known viruses as well as novel members of existing viral families; this microarray contained the most highly conserved 70mer sequences from every fully sequenced reference viral genome in GenBank. During an outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in March 2003, hybridization to this microarray revealed the presence of a previously uncharacterized coronavirus in a viral isolate cultivated from a SARS patient. To further characterize this new virus, approximately 1 kb of the unknown virus genome was cloned by physically recovering viral sequences hybridized to individual array e...","Balkan endemic nephropathy (BEN), originally described in 1956, is a unique familial, chronic renal disease encountered with a high-prevalence rate in Serbia, Bulgaria, Romania, Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina. The most prominent features of the disease are its endemic nature, long-incubation period, familial clustering of the disease and an unusually high incidence of associated upper urothelial cancer (UUC). There are no clear-cut data on BEN incidence and prevalence, since the studies carried out in different endemic areas yielded contradictory information. In spite of intermittent variations, the incidence of new cases has remained stable over time. It has been estimated that almost 100 000 people are at risk of BEN, whereas 25 000 have the disease. The clinical signs and symptoms of BEN are non-specific and often remain unrecognized for years. There are no pathognomonic diagnostic features of BEN, but the set of epidemiological, clinical and biochemical data along with the patt...",""],"title":["Estimate the incubation period of coronavirus

Transmission is thought to occur via touching infected surfaces (skin-to-skin, touching infected inanimate objects) then mediating the COVID-19 infection through the mouth, nose, or eyes. Transmission can also be through inhalation of exhaled virus in respiratory droplets. It has been reported that infectious viruses, including coronavirus, can survive for long periods outside of its host organism.2 COVID-19 virus is thought to survive for several hours on surfaces such as aluminum, sterile sponges, or latex surgical gloves, increasing the opportunity for transmission via touch. Transmission via the inhalation of small, exhaled respiratory droplets may occur as the aerosol droplets remain airborne for prolonged periods, mediating long-range human-to-human transmission via air movement. The relative contributions of large respiratory droplets, smaller airborne aerosol, or direct surface contacts to the transmissibility of COVID-19 still need to be evaluated to enable a fully effective control of transmission and infection.","In this study, the isolation measures refer to that from the time of publication TI, individuals in I-status stop moving and are isolated and treated by the hospital. It can be found that with the isolation measures implemented at four time points, the Estatus user changes are not obvious. The possible reason is that this isolation is only implemented for I-status users, but one of the characteristics of 2019-nCoV is that not only I-status is contagious, but E-status is also contagious. Although the I-status is being treated in isolation, there are still many members of the E-status in the incubation period.","The fitted curves from the three methods are shown in Fig.3 A. Comparing among the three methods, it seems that the fitted curve from the ME method has the smallest variance, the variances of the OLS and MLE approaches are both very high. High variance indicates higher proportions of patients with long incubation periods. The ME method may well mimic the actual long right tail of the incubation period, while the OLS estimation could well describe the cases with middle incubation periods (incubation periods 2 \u223c 14). The MLE approach seems in between the ME and OLS approaches. The estimated interquartile range from the ME method is [4.1495, 9.3523] , which closes to the result from the 483 patients ( [4, 11] ).","In general, it is not easy to build a true epidemic growth curve in a timely fashion for any newly emerging epidemic, and the chances of building a true growth picture worsen with poor disease reporting. As we know, preparedness for the epidemic spread is a primary public health concern for any health department. Epidemic reporting of a disease is a fundamental event in understanding two key parameters in epidemiology, namely, epidemic diffusion within a population and growth at a population level. Normally, for a real-time epidemic, the reporting of cases is rarely complete, especially if the epidemic is new or symptoms are unknown or are yet to be discovered. For viruses with shorter incubation periods without virus shedding during the incubation period, any delay in reporting or lack of reporting could lead to a severe epidemic due to the absence of control measures. For example, for the Ebola virus, the average incubation period is between 2 and 21 days, and an individual diagnosed with the Ebola virus does not spread the virus to others during this period. If some of these individuals with Ebola are not diagnosed (and hence not reported to health care facilities) then after 21 days, these individuals will (unknowingly) spread the virus to others. There are other viruses whose incubation period is short but they are contagious during this period, for example, influenza. Even for epidemics with established symptoms, reporting could be nowhere close to complete. The impact of reporting on epidemic surveillance can then be theoretically measured ( Rao, 2012 ) .","Finally, there is an individual mortality rate and a recovery rate. Both rates depend on many individual characteristics. At the aggregate level, they rise in the stock of sick individuals. We specify them as 23 (N 2 (t)) and 24 (N 2 (t)) with corresponding rates 23 and 24 ; respectively. 12 For our analysis below, we will assume that both rates are constants. Concerning recovery, we are aware that it strongly varies across age (e.g. Guan et al., 2020) and that recovery is not a state that is identical for each individual. As we abstract from ex-ante heterogeneity, we assume a recovery rate that is identical across individuals and that it takes on average n rec days until recovery. Given the exponential distribution of duration in each state, this means that 1= 24 = n rec or 24 = n 1 rec :","In particular, in many studies that use SEIRD models, the parameter \u03c3 is set equal to the inverse of the mean incubation period (time from exposure to the development of symptoms) of a virus. However, the incubation period does not 125 generally coincide with the time from exposure to the time that someone starts to be infectious. Regarding COVID-19, it has been suggested that an exposed person can be infectious well before the development of symptoms [15] . With respect to the incubation period for SARS-CoV-2, a study in China [16] suggests that it may range from 2-14 days, with a median of 5.2 days. Another study 130 in China, using data from 1,099 patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV ARD from 552 hospitals in 31 provinces/provincial municipalities suggested that the median incubation period is 4 days (interquartile range, 2 to 7). In our model, as explained above, 1 \u03c3 represents the period from exposure to the onset of the contagious period. Thus, based on the above clinical studies, for 135 our simulations, we have set 1 \u03c3 = 3. Regarding the recovery period, the WHO-China Joint Mission in a study that is based on 55,924 laboratory-confirmed cases has reported a median time of 2 weeks from onset to clinical recovery for mild cases, and 3-6 weeks for severe or critical cases [17] . Based on the above and on the fact that within the subset 140 of confirmed cases the mild cases are the 81% [14] , we have set the recovery period for the confirmed cases' compartment to be \u03b4 c = 1/21 in order to balance the recovery period with the corresponding characterization of the cases (mild, severe/critical).

There were 6 (0.13%) symptom-free cases including 4 females with a median age of 25.5 years (IQR 24.0-27.0) and 2 males with a median age of 36 years (IQR 24.0-48.0). These symptom-free cases were much younger than the majority of the patients.","Our studies indicate that incubation periods of the age&gt;=40 years and age&lt;40 years groups not only statistically significant but also linearly separable in machine learning. It may suggest different treatments should be considered for the two different groups. It will be more interesting to estimate different incubation time for them separately. That the estimated 97.5 th percentile of COVID-19 incubation is 12.89 days (95% CI: (11.00, 16.13)) may suggest a long isolation or quarantine time (e.g. 17 days) can be better than the widely accepted 14 days. Furthermore, different quarantine time should be applied to the age&gt;=40 years and age&lt;40 years groups for their different incubation periods. Generally speaking, a longer quarantine time can be considered for the old patients (&gt;=40 years) than young patients (&lt;40 years old). Our ongoing work is to collect more qualified data to extend our existing results and investigate incubation of COVID-19 for different groups besides comparing our incubation estimation with other studies [23] .","This model used the spot daily reported deaths which may lag the true date of death due to delays in confirming and then reporting causes of death if COVID-19 was not diagnoses ante mortem. Our estimate of point prevalence varies proportionally to the error in deaths. Deaths due to infection not reported will cause an underestimate in prevalence. Estimating true mortality rates is difficult, and our estimate varies with the reciprocal of the error in the mortality rate. Underestimating mortality will lead to increase in predicted cases. As shown in Figure 3 due to this our model is relatively robust for an error in case fatality ratio 4-10%, which is comparable to reported case fatality ratio estimates. This is an evolving pandemic and due to the long incubation and time to death periods only a short period of point prevalence's can be estimated. Especially during the incubation period it's possible for those infected with SARS-CoV2 to travel into Italy, meaning cases predicted may not have acquired the infection in Italy. 5 All rights reserved.

To halt a pandemic, a suitable quarantine period should be set by investigating incubation periods. Thus, understanding the characteristics of the incubation period is crucial to design public health efforts. In this cohort, the full range of incubation periods of the Covid-19 cases ranged from 0 to 33 days among 2015 cases. Both male and female adults had their median incubation periods of 7-day, which is 1.8-day longer than those in other reports 3,4 (see discussion). However, a similar result was released in the recent news from the Chinese Medical Association that the median incubation periods were 5-7 days 5 . The median incubation period (9-day) of children were significantly longer than those of adults (t-test P = 0.02). For adults, the incubation periods for the majority (66.5%) of the cases were 1-9 days: most of them (57.6% and 52.0% for males and females, respectively) had 1-5 days incubation. Importantly, we found that the incubation periods of 11.5% (n=233, 123 and 105 were male and female, respectively) of the cases were longer than 14 days, the current WHO-set 14-day quarantine period. These results agree with a recent study which also reported 12.7% (n=13) of the cases whose incubation periods were longer than 14 days 4 . These data suggested that the official 14-day quarantine period only captured 88.5% of the population developing Covid-19.","Among the collected data, the incubation periods of 483 confirmed patients can be estimated. Statistical results are shown in Fig.3 and Tab.1. The estimated incubation periods for the 483 patients roughly follow the logarithm normal distribution, with a long right tail. Specifically, the 483 confirmed patients were with average estimated incubation period\u03c4 D = 7.4 days, the mode was 4 days (50 out of the 483 cases) and the median was 7 days (48 out of the 483 cases). About 55% patients were with incubation periods lower than 7 days, while more than 92% patients were lower than 14 days. About 7.45% patients were overestimated with more than 14 days incubation periods.","The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.23.20041707 doi: medRxiv preprint exposure were assigned into the short incubation period group and the remaining patients were assigned into the long incubation period group (Table 4 ). There was no significant difference on age, viral load in the early stage of illness and the risk of critical status between the groups. However, the median seroconversion time was shorter for the short incubation period group than for the long incubation period group (13d.p.e v.s. 21d.p.e, p&lt;0.001). In contrast, the median seroconversion day post onset was longer for the short incubation period group than the long incubation period","Infection with Sin Nombre virus or other agents of HPS have relatively long incubation periods (median 14 to 17 days; range 1 to 51 days), 92 and antibody and cellular responses in humans are usually detectable at the time of presentation. 93 Neutralizing antibody is directed against the surface glycoproteins G1 and G2, and lower titers on presentation correlate with greater disease severity. 94 Viremia is detectable at presentation and declines promptly after resolution of fever.","The mean incubation period of SARS-CoV2 was estimated to be 3-7 days, ranging from 2 to 14 days [46, 47] , which indicates a long transmission period of SARS-CoV2. It is estimated that SARS-CoV2 latency is consistent with those of other known human CoVs, including non-SARS human CoVs (mean 3 days, range 2-5 days) [48] , SARS-CoV (mean 5 days, range 2-14 days) [49] , and MERS-CoV (mean 5-7 days, range 2-14 days) [50] . Besides, it has been reported that asymptomatic COVID-19 patients during their incubation periods can effectively transmit SARS-CoV2 [51, 52] , which is different from SARS-CoV because most SARS-CoV cases are infected by \"super spreaders\", and SARS-CoV cases can not infect susceptible persons during the incubation period [53] . Taken together, these data fully support the current period of active monitoring recommended by the WHO of 14 days.","Disease improvement or favorable clinical outcome included full recovery and discharge, progression from critical/severe to non-severe disease status, PCR positive to negative, and/or maintenance of non-severe status. Disease progression or unfavorable clinical outcome included death, progression from non-severe to severe/critical disease status or severe to critical status, and/or maintenance of severe or critical status.","The inhibition of propulsive bowel activity usually is referred to as ileus. Ileus is ascribed most frequently to the condition that occurs after laparotomy and is termed simple or uncomplicated postoperative ileus (POI). The term complicated or paralytic ileus describes intestinal motility disturbed for longer periods after surgery. POI in horses is associated most commonly with surgery of the small intestine, particularly after resection and anastomosis, 1,2 is a common complication of small intestinal surgery, and can have a negative effect on short-term postoperative survival. 3, 4 Motility dysfunction likely is present in all horses after laparotomy, but many are affected subclinically and require minimal or no specific intervention. In symptomatic animals, clinical signs are apparent shortly after recovery and include colic, tachycardia, dehydration, decreased borborygmi and fecal output, and sequestration of fluid within the stomach. Rectal examination and ultrasound reveal small intestinal distention with rare or absent wall movement. The severity and duration of intestinal stasis varies, lasting from minutes to days.","The basic reproductive number (R 0 ) was estimated in various studies 9-19 starting at 1.4, up to 7.23. Most countries have now implemented control strategies involving contact tracing, quarantine, and isolation measures, which are likely to significantly reduce the R 0 . Li and colleagues used individually documented case descriptions from China to estimate a reproductive number in the context of control measures (R c ) 17 . It was estimated to be 1.54. Zhou and colleagues 19 estimated a controlled reproduction number between 1.46 and 2.99. They also estimated mean incubation and contagious periods of 5 and 11 days, respectively.","Traditionally, incubation period is defined as the period between the infection of an individual by a pathogen and the manifestation of the illness or disease it causes [32, 33] . Different infectious diseases have different incubation periods. However, for a certain infectious disease, its incubation period is relatively fixed. Since the number of pathogens entering the body, virulence and reproductive capacity, as well as power of resistance are different for different people, thus, it is reported that the incubation periods obtained from patients for a certain disease should follow logarithm normal distribution [16, 33] . Generally, incubation period can be measured by physiological observations and biological experiments [33] . The determination of incubation period has great implications for disease transmission control and policy making.","The virus is related to the SARS coronavirus and MERS coronavirus, but is distinct from each of those viruses [2] , such that the epidemiological key parameters have to be identified for this new virus from incoming case reports as the epidemic continues. Chief among these key parameters is the incubation period distribution. The range of the values for the incubation period is essential to epidemiological case definitions, and is required to determine the appropriate duration of quarantine. Moreover, knowledge of the incubation period helps to assess the effectiveness of entry screening and contact tracing. The distribution of the incubation period is also used in estimating the size of the epidemic [3 -5] and the transmission potential [6, 7] . In absence of data on the 2019-nCoV incubation period, the WHO has worked with a broad range of 0 to 14 days, the CDC has taken a range of 2 to 14 days, and several studies have assumed incubation periods of SARS or MERS coronaviruses.","We explored a range of scenarios informed by the latest evidence on transmission of 2019-nCoV. Similar analyses using branching models have already been used to analyse the Wuhan outbreak to find plausible ranges for the initial exposure event size and the basic reproduction number 15, 19 . Our analysis expands on this by including infectiousness before the onset of symptoms, case isolation, explicit modelling of case incubation periods and time to infectiousness. A key area of uncertainty is if and for how long individuals are infectious before symptom onset, and if asymptomatic or subclinical infection occurs. Both are likely to make the outbreak harder to control 24 .","The population is assumed constant due to the rapid disease spread, i.e. the births and natural death have the same value. The recovery rate and death rate are time-dependant. The model also assumes that susceptible individuals (S) are contagious upon coming into contact with infected (I) individuals not detected. It is assumed, however, that the infected are all quarantined (Q) and that they do not have contact with susceptible individuals. In turn, the susceptible population can be protected by confinement by moving to the protected population compartment (C). This assumption on Q means that hospital infections are not considered under this framework, therefore resulting in a potential underestimation of the real contagion extent. However, we chose this option in an attempt to be conservative and our results should be interpreted as the current best-case scenario. It is assumed also that the protected population does not have contact with the infected individuals and therefore cannot be infected. The COVID-19 dynamics is modelled by the following equations system:","Our understanding of virus-host interactions is in its infancy. The virus-bat interface is impacted by the extrinsic factors mentioned above, as well as viral and host factors (intrinsic factors). There are multiple intrinsic factors of the reservoir host such as age, body condition, reproductive status, sex and social status that are impacted by stress. For instance, stresses due to starvation and the breeding season for males may play an important role in the epidemiology of disease as stress caused by these factors may dampen the immune response making individuals more susceptible to infection [62] . In the case of EBOV, it is thought that starvation leads to fruit bats and primates coming into close proximity during their quest for food, facilitating spillover [63] . Transmission of viruses could also occur following changes in the hierarchy of the colony that lead to fighting for dominance, and during courtship and mating via grooming and biting [7] . Seasonal periods when juveniles have waning maternal antibody and are therefore susceptible to virus infection have been associated with increased transmission of Marburg virus to humans [64 ] and have been thought to have a role in increasing the incidence of transmission within bat colonies for HeV as well as Marburg virus [46, 62, 64] . Bats live on average 3.5 times longer than a mammal of similar size [65] , hence longevity in bats promotes persistence of viruses in the reservoir host, while the ability to fly allows long-distance dispersal of the infectious agent. Aerosols, direct contact and arthropods could also serve as vectors for transmission within the colony or to other species.","The copyright holder for this preprint . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03. 21 contract the infection at rate \u03b2 , \u03b2 or r\u03b2 * \u03b2 , respectively, and enters the latent non-infectious compartment where he is infected but not yet infectious. During the non-infectious period, each individual has a probability of ni \u03b5 of becoming presymptomatic infectious. The presymptomatic cases have probability i\u03b5 of developing severe or mild COVID-19 symptomes, with probabilities pS and 1-pS respectively. Transition from symptomatic groups occurs at \u03bc rate. Individuals who developed severe symptoms do not travel within and between modelled subpopulations and may be either diagnosed with probability pDS , or recover with probability of 1-pDS . Individuals whose mild (or non-existent) symptoms are not stopping them from traveling may be diagnosed with probability pDM or recover with probability 1-pDM . The diagnosed individuals are considered isolated and effectively non-contagious and recover with rate \u03bc . The recovery does not discriminate between true recovery and fatal cases.

These values are negatively correlated with Spearman correlation coefficient of 95% CI ranging from -0 \u00b7 291 to -0 \u00b7 945 and (n=10).","Different chiropteran species are widely accepted as reservoir hosts for lyssaviruses and other viral pathogens, as described above. However, for the lyssaviruses, this interaction is poorly understood. Indeed, lyssaviruses and bats do not typically exhibit the classical symbiotic relationship expected of co-evolution, as the lyssavirus infection of bats is most commonly detected following the observation of clinical disease. This contrasts with other viral pathogens, for which bats are considered natural reservoirs, including filo- and henipa-viruses. Both the natural and experimental infection of bats with these other pathogens results in the shedding of the virus, often in the complete absence of clinical disease. Furthermore, evidence has shown that bats, and other mammals, are able to mount a sufficient immunological response following viral exposure, and successfully manage to clear the virus before the onset of clinical disease. For lyssaviruses, the repeated detection of healthy seropositive bats in different roost populations strongly suggests that exposure events can result in viral clearance, following the development of a localised and/or systemic immune response. Alongside this, recent studies have described serologically positivity in unvaccinated humans within Amazonian populations [141]. Again, this suggests that lyssavirus exposure can result in clearance, most likely where detected, through the development of a humoral response. What drives this human exposure to RABV, however, is less clear with hunting of bats, as well as the feeding of vampire bats on humans being plausible exposure opportunities. Certainly, the structure of Amazonian populations, and the overlap in bat and human habitations, may facilitate the exposure to a lyssavirus, whether it be via bite or non-bite transmission. Also, the mechanisms involved in clinical disease manifestation following natural infection remain ill-defined, so the outcome of lyssavirus infection/exposure in bats versus another mammal cannot yet be accurately compared. It may be so that bats exhibit much longer incubation periods than other mammals, facilitating in the maintenance of the virus in bat populations. However, the lack of knowledge surrounding, specifically, the innate signalling mechanisms in bats following exposure, prohibits any understanding surrounding their status as the lyssavirus reservoir host. Related to this is the observation of clinical disease in a U.K. Daubenton\u2019s bat nine months following captive care [142]. This, again, demonstrates that these viruses can exist within bat species for long periods of time, before the development of clinical disease. How the virus is maintained and where the virus hides during prolonged periods post infection before the development of disease remains unknown. ","There are various choices one can make about the parametric form of the incubation period distribution. The results with the three often-used forms we report here suggest that there is little impact on the mean and dispersion of the incubation periods. Of these three, the lognormal distribution assigns higher probabilities to longer incubation periods. Although we found that this distribution provided a poorer description of the data than the Weibull and the gamma distributions, it is prudent not to dismiss the possibility of incubation periods up to 14 days at this stage of the epidemic.","There are various choices one can make about the parametric form of the incubation period distribution.

Note that compared with the SIR model we have differentiated the \"infected\" state into infected and contagious, in order to take account of the relatively long incubation times of COVID-19.","The incubation and infectious periods have been a most important issue in the present epidemic and estimates have varied as more information is available on the dynamics of the disease. We will use incubation period 1/\u03b3 = 6 days [3, [7] [8] [9] . The same situation occurs with the infectious period that we take 1/\u03b7 = 10 days [7, 10, 11] . One of the first articles to calculate the basic reproduction number R 0 of the new coronavirus in Wuhan China, estimated (Jan 24, 2020) its value as 2.68(2.47 \u2212 2.86) with an epidemic doubling time of 6.4 days (5.8 \u2212 7.1) [3] . Other authors have estimated the basic reproductive number to be around 2.5, value that we use here for the Wuhan original outbreak but again there exist some variability and uncertainity in the different estimates [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] . In what follows some simple models are described related to three specific situations described above and occurring during this epidemic: disease dispersion due to long range population movement, behavioral change imposed on individuals as an strategy of containment, and the effect of social distancing on the general fate of the epidemic.","maximum. An important characteristic of the data is that the ratio is very small for both countries (20% in the case of China and 5% in the case of South Korea). To reproduce these observed ratios within SEIR models, very long mean infection periods are required, exceeding 100 days. Such long infection periods are unrealistic and lead to a t &gt; tpeak decrease in the number of infected people that is much slower than observed. The discrepancy between SEIR models and the available data becomes even worse if one considers the fact that the time lag for reporting a recovered person is likely to be much shorter than the incubation time for the disease. Therefore, the \"instantaneous\" predicted quantities and from the models do not correspond to the observed and but to \"corrected\" quantities that can approximated as , (1) where T is the mean incubation time. Using T = 7 days, in line with a reported incubation time between 5 and 11 days [6] , one obtains the data in Fig. 1 and Fig. 2 . In the case of China, for example, the ratio has now become as small as 8%.","On January 30, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) labeled the outbreak as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). On February 12, 2020, WHO named the disease caused by the novel coronavirus \u201cCoronavirus Disease 2019\u201d (COVID-19). A team of international experts, with a range of specializations, has tried to manage this outbreak (10, 11). Pneumonia caused by COVID-19 is a highly contagious and infectious disease declared a health emergency by the World Health Organization (11-13). ","Accurate diagnosis often is difficult. Because many infected infants have no symptoms or the clinical manifestations are nonspecific, laboratory diagnostic tests must be used to determine the virus responsible for the illness. Laboratory diagnosis may involve direct isolation of the virus in culture; detection of viral antigen or antibodies by immunologic, genetic, or electron microscopic study; or histopathologic methods (Guerina &amp; Goldmann, 1993; Overall, 1992; Smith, 1993) . The best method of diagnosis varies, depending upon the specific characteristics of the virus. Recovery of virus from clinical specimens usually is more difficult than recovery of other microorganisms (Strodtbeck, 1986) . A negative result may mean an unsuccessful recovery of virus present. Clinical judgment is important for determining the likelihood for additional management and treatment of the suspected viral illness.","The copyright holder for this preprint : Effective infectious increment (can be negative); : Total non-isolated cases (asymptomatic carriers); : Patient increment (symptom onset); : Total isolated cases (confirmed patients after symptom onset); Figure 4 : Basic principle of the cybernetics-based dynamic infection model be made. For example, as SARS-COV-2 is contagious in its incubation, it is spreading much faster than SARS and more hard to be controlled. Consequently, experiences from SARS should not be simply copied to control the current status. This is very important issue at the early stage that should be but was not emphasized in Hubei province.","is the (which was not peer-reviewed) The copyright holder for this preprint . https://doi.org /10.1101 /10. /2020 The full range of incubation periods of the Covid-19 cases ranged from zero to 33 days in this study, including ~30 cases whose incubation periods ranged 22-33 days, and 6 symptom-free cases, suggesting that a wide-range heterogeneous response to the SARS-CoV-2 virus in the population, and the challenges for preventing virus-spreading. Furthermore, some cases start to transmit this virus before the symptom onset. This is very different from the transmission patterns of SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome), for which transmission rarely occurred until after the 4-5 days after symptom onset 8 . When a virus has infectiousness before symptom onset, control of outbreaks using contact tracing and isolation is more challenging 9 .","Thomas E. Eckland (Medical Microbiology and Immunology, Creighton University in Omaha, NE, USA) introduced prion disease, and how prion strain interactions during incubation periods affect strain dynamics. Prion diseases are a group of inevitably fatal neurodegenerative diseases affecting mammals, including humans. Prion diseases are caused by a misfolded isoform of the prion protein, PrPSc. Prion strains are operationally defined a heritable phenotype of disease under controlled transmission conditions that are hypothesized to be encoded by strain-specific conformations of PrPSc. Prion strains can interfere with each other when a long incubation period strain (i.e., blocking strain) inhibits the replication of a short incubation period strain (i.e., non-blocking). Prion strain interference influences prion strain dynamics and the emergence of a strain from a mixture. However, it is unknown if two long incubation period strains can interfere with each other. To investigate this, they used a combination of protein misfolding cyclic amplification strain interference (PMCAsi) and animal bioassay. Using PMCAsi, they found a PrPSc migration pattern consistent of a mixture of both strains, suggesting that strain interference is not occurring. Animal bioassay experiments are consistent with these in vitro findings. This is the first example of prion strain combinations that do not interfere with each other both in vitro and in vivo. This observation changes the paradigm of the interactions of prion strains in a mixture and has implication for interspecies transmission and emergence of prion strains from a mixture.","We use a very simply Markov chain model to represent the dynamics of the epidemic. In Figure 1 it is illustrated how individuals can move between states. Starting from being healthy, they move to becoming infected, then to shedding the virus (i.e. being contagious) before becoming symptomatic. From symptomatic they can become sick (which we use to represent hospitalised) and may die. The recovery back to healthy (represented as immune, which seems plausible [13] , although it is not yet well-understood if reinfections can occur) can happen from either the shedding, symptomatic or sick state.","The long-term health consequences in ARDS survivors are significant. Herridge and associates studied 1-year outcomes in 109 survivors of the ARDS. 144 Muscle weakness and fatigue were the major reasons for the functional limitation observed after 1 year, whereas normalization of lung volumes and spirometric measurements were seen by 6 months. Other studies found residual obstructive or restrictive defects to persist for a year or more in a subset of patients. 145, 146 All three of the foregoing studies, however, found diffusing capacity to remain low on long-term follow-up. Orme and colleagues found no significant differences in pulmonary function between surviving patients treated with a low or high tidal volume strategy. 146 Direct measures of the quality of life in patients who survive ARDS indicate impairment in general physical health, mental health, and neuropsychological function. 147, 148 Hopkins and associates stressed the significant cognitive impairments in memory, attention, concentration, or mental processing speed exhibited by 78% of the 55 ARDS survivors they evaluated at 1 year after the onset of ARDS. 149 Decrements in quality of life and functional status appear to stabilize by 6 months. An unresolved issue is the extent to which the decrement in quality of life is the result of ARDS or of other factors such as prior health status or other elements of the acute illness. Further research is needed to characterize patients' recovery from ARDS and ALI and the extent to which recovery may be influenced by treatment in the ICU and during rehabilitation.","We used bootstrapping to explore the range for the point estimates of \u00b5 and \u03c3 from the mixture model. Figure S1 shows the results. The mean of the bootstrapped mean estimates is 4.26 \u00b1 1.02 for Tianjin and 4.57 \u00b1 0.95 days in Singapore. Bootstrap values are consistent with a serial interval that is considerably shorter than the incubation periods in both datasets. Table S3 shows the sensitivity analysis; we varied the the number of cases per cluster to include in the ICC interval data and we explored sorting the cases in the clusters according to the time of last exposure (ie the putative index status assigned to the individual with the earliest end to their exposure window, instead of the first symptomatic individual).","The transmissibility of COVID-19or at least its geographical distribution (figure 2)seems to be higher and broader than initially expected (Horton, 2020). Compared to SARS-CoV (9.56% mortality) and MERS-CoV (34.4% mortality), the COVID-19 appears to be less virulent at this point except for the elderly and those with underlying health conditions (table 1). COVID-19 was confirmed as subject to human-to-human transmission and it is very contagious. The basic reproduction number R0 for COVID-19 was estimated by WHO and some research institutes in the range of 1.4-6.6 (table 2). This value is slightly higher than that of the 2003 SARS epidemic, and much higher than that of influenza and Ebola. The incubation days of COVID-19 in Wuhan city is 5-10 days with a mean of 7 days (Fan et al., 2020). On average, the duration from confirmed stage to cure or death is 10 days in nation-wide reporting according to Guan et al. (2020) . A long incubation period and an associated large number of patients with mild symptoms increase the difficulty of prevention and control of the epidemic. The likelihood of travel-related risks of the disease spreading has been noted by Bogoch et al. (2020) and Cao et al. (2020a) wherein they indicated the potentials for further regional and global spread (Leung et al., 2020).","Multiple factors may influence this pattern of transmission. Firstly, an increase in the viral loads as disease progresses could be an important factor. Despite limited evidence about the viral shedding kinetics of MERS-CoV over the disease course, it is expected that viral load increases with disease progression up to a point [21]. Therefore, it seems plausible that close contacts in Hospital B were exposed to a higher infective dose than those in Hospital A. In addition, worsening respiratory symptoms and the consequent need for respiratory procedures during the later stage of disease could facilitate viral transmission [2223]. Since the index case received nebulizer therapy in a six-bed room, aerosols generated by the nebulizer might amplify viral transmission to those who shared the room in Hospital B. The shorter incubation period and rapid disease progression among secondary cases in Hospital B are consistent with these explanations. In contrast, individuals in Hospital A might have been exposed to different levels of viral loads depending on when and for how long they were exposed during the disease progression in the first week of illness of the index case. These differences in exposure can partly explain the wide range of incubation periods and diverse clinical features among secondary cases in Hospital A. Secondly, underlying comorbidities in secondary cases can affect the explosive nature of transmission and the clinical consequences. Given that the index patient was hospitalized in the pulmonary ward in Hospital B, a large proportion of affected patients had underlying pulmonary diseases. This comorbidity combined with a high infective dose could exacerbate the disease progression, resulting in the high mortality among secondary cases in Hospital B.","Due to the definition, the estimated incubation periods in this paper may be longer than the real cases. However, the distribution has some implications. It indicates that a few patients may be with very long incubation period, which increase the difficulty to control and prevent the COVID-19.","Thus, understanding of incubation time of a wide-range spectrum of Covid-19 for establishing an optimal quarantine period is crucial to designing public health interventions. Two recent studies have reported incubation periods for Covid-19 cases 3, 4 , but only for the hospitalized patients, .

Instead, the participants could choose themselves when to run the app which might have biased some to choose a particularly 'interesting' day when they are going to meet a lot of people, or travel somewhere unusual. In addition, the participants themselves were not sampled at random from the population but instead chose to take part. How they heard about the study might might have varied from whether they were reached through social media in the drive to recruit participants before broadcast, or consequent to watching the BBC4 programme, or through hearing about it from friends -all of which could lead to selection bias. Given the big social media exposure around the citizen science project, our participants were recruited largely in two time periods: in October 2017 after the launch of the app, and in March 2018 after the airing of the documentary 'Contagion! The BBC4 Pandemic', but the uneven recruitment of participants over time should not have much impact. There is evidence, at least among school-aged children, that social contact structure during term-time is relatively consistent over a period of several months [19] . Contacts can also change between term-time and school-holidays [8] and with the health status of participants; individuals typically make fewer social contacts when they have ILI compared to a normal day [28] ]. It may therefore be necessary to combine the matrices presented here with other datasets to fully explore transmission dynamics over long periods and account for changes in behaviour according to health status.","In the absence of complete and robust contact-tracing data, we have inferred the distribution of the incubation period of COVID-19 from the durations between departure from Wuhan and symptom onset for the confirmed cases. More than 1000 cases were collected from publicly available data. The proposed approach has a solid theoretical foundation and enhances the accuracy of estimation by reducing recall bias and utilizing a large pool of samples. Quarantine of individuals with exposure to infectious pathogens has always been an effective approach for containing contagious diseases in the past. One of the critical factors to determine the optimal quarantine of asymptomatic individuals is a good understanding of the incubation period, and this has been lacking for COVID-19.","It is evident from Table 3 that all the four variables are highly significant with p-value less than 0.01. It can be inferred from Table 3 that the most significant factor influencing recovery is the severity of the disease (indicated by initial status). The most important factors identified by the various machine learning methods are initial status, healthcare worker or not, age and pre-existing diseases.","The specific exposures that lead to sporadic MERS-CoV infections are unknown, therefore it is impossible to estimate the incubation period in primary cases. However, based on data from cases of human-to-human transmission, the incubation period is a median of 5-7 days, with a range of 2-14 days (median 5\u00b72 days [95% CI 1\u00b79-14\u00b77]). 2,10,21,61-63 Immunocompromised patients can present with longer incubation periods of up to 20 days. 64","The rapid increase in the number of 2019-nCoV cases in a short period of time has forced society to respond quickly. At present, 2019-nCOV is still spreading rapidly, and the origin of the new virus, transmission modes other than saliva droplets and airborne transmission, the window period, the contagious period after clinical recovery, and patient prognosis are unknown e but the efforts of all parties have begun to bear fruit. In particular, it should be noted that on January 24, 2020, Hubei Province launched the most stringent anti-epidemic traffic control measures in human history, as measured in the number of human individuals affected.","In this scenario, 2019-nCoVs might have been fully evolved when they emerged from their secondary host into human populations. These viruses could have \"cut their teeth\" as a lowly contagious virus between the secondary host and humans, becoming gradually adapted to humans in the process. The recent outbreak may have happened after the last step was taken. If pangolins are indeed the secondary host, as has been reported, then the small differences between the viruses in pangolins and humans might be this last step. The low evolutionary rate, the high contagious rate and the modest virulence all seem to suggest 2019-nCoVs to be in a mature stage of evolution in humans.","We developed a deterministic, age-structured, compartmental, Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Removed (SEIR) model, as a set of differential equations ( Figure 3 ). The population was divided into 17 age-groups (5 years age-band), and can be either susceptible (S), exposed to the virus but not infectious (E), infected and infectious (I), or removed from the chains of infection (R). We used an inter-individual contacts matrix for the French population estimated by Prem and colleagues 25 to simulate age-dependent mixing. We considered an incubation period of 5 days and a contagious period of 11 days 19 . We assumed an average length of stay in hospitals and in ICU wards of 15 days for all patients, of all ages. We estimated the age-dependent susceptibility of the population based on the age distribution of infected cases reported by Wu and colleagues in China 11 . We standardized the Chinese age distribution of cases to the French population to estimate the expected age distribution of cases for France. We then fitted the age dependent susceptibility vector using the R implementation of the subplex algorithm provided by the nloptr package.","To calculate the recovery rate ( ), an estimation of 26 days with a range of 21 to 32 days for the time from symptom onset to recovery was taken, compatible with several recent studies (8, (10) (11) (12) . The average incubation period was approximated to be 5.1 (6-8).","Syndromic screening designed to prevent infected and potentially infectious cases entering undetected is highly vulnerable to asymptomatic infections and long incubation periods. If the baseline scenario is modified to have 0% asymptomatic infections and 100% sensitivity of entry screening, the incubation period will need to be approximately 10-fold shorter than the period from symptom onset to severe disease (e.g. hospitalisation) in order to detect more than 90% of infected travellers that would not otherwise report illness at either exit or entry screening."],"title":["An Imperative Need for Research on the Role of Environmental Factors in Transmission of Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19)","Beware of asymptomatic transmission: Study on 2019-nCoV prevention and control measures based on extended SEIR model","Epidemiological characteristics of 1212 COVID-19 patients in Henan, China","True epidemic growth construction through harmonic analysis","Projecting the Spread of COVID19 for Germany","Tracing DAY-ZERO and Forecasting the Fade out of the COVID-19 Outbreak in Lombardy, Italy: A Compartmental Modelling and Numerical Optimization Approach.","Is a 14-day quarantine period optimal for effectively controlling coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)?","Estimate the incubation period of coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19)","Estimating Spot Prevalence of COVID-19 from Daily Death Data in Italy","Is a 14-day quarantine period optimal for effectively controlling coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)?","Epidemiological characteristics of 1212 COVID-19 patients in Henan, China","Serology characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 infection since the exposure and post symptoms onset","32 Viral Infections","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): current status and future perspective","Risk Factors Associated with Clinical Outcomes in 323 COVID-19 Patients in Wuhan, China","Chapter 13 Disorders of the Gastrointestinal System","COVID-19: Forecasting short term hospital needs in France","Epidemiological characteristics of 1212 COVID-19 patients in Henan, China","The incubation period of 2019-nCoV infections among travellers from Wuhan, China","Feasibility of controlling 2019-nCoV outbreaks by isolation of cases and contacts","A modified SEIR model to predict the COVID-19 outbreak in Spain: simulating control scenarios and multi-scale epidemics","Bats and their virome: an important source of emerging viruses capable of infecting humans","From a single host to global spread.
