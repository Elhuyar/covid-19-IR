The number of affected pregnant women is increasing, but scarce information is available about the clinical features of COVID-19 in pregnancy. This study aimed to clarify the clinical features and obstetric and neonatal outcomes of pregnant patients with COVID-19. Methods In this retrospective, single-centre study, we included all pregnant women with COVID-19 who were admitted to Tongji Hospital in Wuhan, China. Clinical features, treatments, and maternal and fetal outcomes were assessed. Findings Seven patients, admitted to Tongji Hospital from Jan 1, to Feb 8, 2020, were included in our study. The mean age of the patients was 32 years (range 29\u201334 years) and the mean gestational age was 39 weeks plus 1 day (range 37 weeks to 41 weeks plus 2 days). Clinical manifestations were fever (six [86%] patients), cough (one [1...","BACKGROUND Person to person spread of COIVD-19 in the UK has now been confirmed. There are limited case series reporting the impact on women affected by coronaviruses (CoV) during pregnancy. In women affected by SARS and MERS, the case fatality rate appeared higher in women affected in pregnancy compared with non-pregnant women. We conducted a rapid, review to guide management of women affected by COVID -19 during pregnancy and developed interim practice guidance with the RCOG and RCPCH to inform maternity and neonatal service planning METHODS Searches were conducted in PubMed and MedRxiv to identify primary case reports, case series, observational studies or randomised-controlled trial describing women affected by coronavirus in pregnancy and on neonates. Data was extracted from relevant papers and the review was drafted with representatives of the RCPCH and RCOG who also provided expert consensus on areas where data were lacking RESULTS From 9964 results on PubMed and 600 on MedRxiv,...","Abstract The current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia pandemic, caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus, is spreading globally at an accelerated rate, with a basic reproduction number (R0) of 2 \u2013 2.5, indicating that 2 \u2013 3 persons will be infected from an index patient. A serious public health emergency, it is particularly deadly in vulnerable populations and communities in which healthcare providers are insufficiently prepared to manage the infection. As of March 16, 2020, there are more than 180,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19 worldwide, with over 7,000 related deaths. The SARS-CoV-2 virus has been isolated from asymptomatic individuals, and affected patients continue to be infectious two weeks after cessation of symptoms. The substantial morbidity and socioeconomic impact have necessitated drastic measures across all continents, including nationwide lockdowns and border closures. Pregnant women and their fetuses represent a high-risk populat...","INTRODUCTION: The outbreak of the new Coronavirus in China in December 2019 and subsequently in various countries around the world has raised concerns about the possibility of vertical transmission of the virus from mother to fetus. The present study aimed to review published literature in this regard. METHODS: In this narrative review, were searched for all articles published in various databases including PubMed, Scopus, Embase, Science Direct, and Web of Science using MeSH-compliant keywords including COVID-19, Pregnancy, Vertical transmission, Coronavirus 2019, SARS-CoV-2 and 2019-nCoV from December 2019 to March 18, 2020 and reviewed them. All type of articles published about COVID-19 and vertical transmission in pregnancy were included. RESULTS: A review of 13 final articles published in this area revealed that COVID-19 can cause fetal distress, miscarriage, respiratory distress and preterm delivery in pregnant women but does not infect newborns. There has been no report of verti...","BACKGROUND There is little information about the coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) during pregnancy. This study aimed to determine the clinical features and the maternal and neonatal outcomes of pregnant women with Covid-19. METHODS In this retrospective analysis from five hospitals, we included pregnant women with Covid-19 from January 1 to February 20, 2020. The primary composite endpoints were admission to an intensive care unit (ICU), the use of mechanical ventilation, or death. Secondary endpoints included the clinical severity of Covid-19, neonatal mortality, admission to neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), and the incidence of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) of pregnant women and newborns. RESULTS Thirty-three pregnant women with Covid-19 and 28 newborns were identified. One (3%) pregnant woman needed the use of mechanical ventilation. No pregnant women admitted to the ICU. There were no moralities among pregnant women or newborns. The percentages of pregnant women...","Abstract Objective This document summarizes the limited experience of SARS in pregnancy and suggests guidelines for management.

The objective of this study was to assess the frequency, severity, and consequences of respiratory viral infection during pregnancy in women with and without asthma. Methods In this prospective cohort study, common cold symptoms were assessed during pregnancy in 168 women with asthma and 117 women without asthma using the common cold questionnaire and by self-report. Nasal and throat swabs were collected for suspected infections and tested by polymerase chain reaction for respiratory viruses. Pregnancy and asthma outcomes were recorded. Results Pregnant women with asthma had more prospective self-reported and questionnaire-detected common colds than pregnant women without asthma (incidence rate ratio, 1.77; 95% CI, 1.30-2.42; P &lt; .0001). Retrospectively reported common colds in early pregnancy and post partum were increased in women with asthma compared with women...","Background The ongoing epidemics of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have caused serious concerns about its potential adverse effects on pregnancy. There are limited data on maternal and neonatal outcomes of pregnant women with COVID-19 pneumonia. Methods We conducted a case-control study to compare clinical characteristics, maternal and neonatal outcomes of pregnant women with and without COVID-19 pneumonia. Results During January 24 to February 29, 2020, there were sixteen pregnant women with confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia and eighteen suspected cases who were admitted to labor in the third trimester. Two had vaginal delivery and the rest took cesarean section. Few patients presented respiratory symptoms (fever and cough) on admission, but most had typical chest CT images of COVID-19 pneumonia. Compared to the controls, COVID-19 pneumonia patients had lower counts of white blood cells (WBC), neutrophils, C-reactive protein (CRP), and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) on admission. Incr...","Abstract The 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) was first detected in December 2019 and became epidemic in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. COVID-19 has been rapidly spreading out in China and all over the world. The virus causing COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2 has been known to be genetically similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) but distinct from it. Clinical manifestation of COVID-19 can be characterized by mild upper respiratory tract infection, lower respiratory tract infection involving non-life threatening pneumonia, and life-threatening pneumonia with acute respiratory distress syndrome. It affects all age groups, including newborns, to the elders. Particularly, pregnant women may be more susceptible to COVID-19 since pregnant women, in general, are vulnerable to respiratory infection. In pregnant women with COVID-19, there is no evidence for vertical transmission of the virus, but an increased prevalence of preterm deliveries has been noticed. The COVID...","Abstract Background The ongoing outbreak of COVID-19 pneumonia is globally concerning. We aimed to investigate the clinical and CT features in the pregnant women and children with this disease, which have not been well reported. Methods Clinical and CT data of 59 patients with COVID-19 from January 27 to February 14, 2020 were retrospectively reviewed, including 14 laboratory-confirmed non-pregnant adults, 16 laboratory-confirmed and 25 clinically-diagnosed pregnant women, and 4 laboratory-confirmed children. The clinical and CT features were analyzed and compared. Findings Compared with the non-pregnant adults group (n = 14), initial normal body temperature (9 [56%] and 16 [64%]), leukocytosis (8 [50%] and 9 [36%]) and elevated neutrophil ratio (14 [88%] and 20 [80%]), and lymphopenia (9 [56%] and 16 [64%]) were more common in the laboratory-confirmed (n = 16) and clinically-diagnosed (n = 25) pregnant groups. Totally 614 lesions were detected with predominantly peripheral and bilater...","In early December 2019 a cluster of cases of pneumonia of unknown cause was identified in Wuhan, a city of 11 million persons in the People&amp;rsquo;s Republic of China. Further investigation revealed these cases to result from infection with a newly identified coronavirus, termed the 2019-nCoV. The infection moved rapidly through China, spread to Thailand and Japan, extended into adjacent countries through infected persons travelling by air, eventually reaching multiple countries and continents. Similar to such other coronaviruses as those causing the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), the new coronavirus was reported to spread via natural aerosols from human-to-human. In the early stages of this epidemic the case fatality rate is estimated to be approximately 2%, with the majority of deaths occurring in special populations. Unfortunately, there is limited experience with coronavirus infections during pregnancy, and it now appears certai...","Summary Background Previous studies on the pneumonia outbreak caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) were based on information from the general population. Limited data are available for pregnant women with COVID-19 pneumonia. This study aimed to evaluate the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 in pregnancy and the intrauterine vertical transmission potential of COVID-19 infection. Methods Clinical records, laboratory results, and chest CT scans were retrospectively reviewed for nine pregnant women with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia (ie, with maternal throat swab samples that were positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 [SARS-CoV-2]) who were admitted to Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China, from Jan 20 to Jan 31, 2020. Evidence of intrauterine vertical transmission was assessed by testing for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in amniotic fluid, cord blood, and neonatal throat swab samples. Breastmilk samples were also collected ...","Human coronavirus 229E (HCoV) has been recently recognized as a potential agent of nosocomial viral respiratory infections (NRVI) in high-risk infants. We have confirmed this as fact through the study of a 1-year period of HCoV outbreaks occurring during a prospective survey of NRVI in a paediatric and neonatal intensive care unit (PNICU) using new molecular techniques for HCoV detection. Nasal samples obtained at admission and weekly thereafter for all hospitalised children, as well as monthly nasal samples from staff, were analysed using immunofluorescence for respiratory syncitial virus (RSV), influenza viruses A and B, paramyxoviruses 1, 2, 3 and adenoviruses. RT-PCR was used for HCoV detection. During the year 1998, 43 HCoV-related NRVI were detected in 152 neonates (incidence 28.3%), and 7 HCoV-related NRVI were found in 92 children (incidence 7.6%). Three HCoV-related outbreaks were observed (February, August and December), associated with a high prevalence of HCoV infection in ...","","Abstract Establishing immunological memory in female piglets at a young age with PRCV was effective in inducing a secondary immune response to a limiting dose of virulent TGEV given orally 13\u201318 days prior to farrowing. Subsequently, because of passive antibody transfer, the offspring of these primed gilts were more efficient in surviving a lethal TGEV challenge. An average survival rate of 89% occurred in 6 litters of piglets from primed gilts that were boosted with 2.8\u00d7106 plaque forming units (PFU) of TGEV whereas 76% of the piglets survived in three litters that suckled primed gilts boosted with 3.0\u00d7105 PFU of TGEV. Non-primed gilts given identical pre-farrowing doses of TGEV had litter survival rates of 63 and 55%, respectively. Moreover, both groups of litters from primed gilts suffered less clinical illness (as measured by the extent of weight loss post-challenge) than control litters. Priming of the piglets as neonates and boosting the pregnant gilts produced an anamnestic syst...","R\u00e9sum\u00e9 Un nouveau coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) mis en \u00e9vidence en fin d\u2019ann\u00e9e 2019 en Chine se diffuse \u00e0 travers tous les continents.

We estimated the disease burden and impact of birth-related, maternal, household, and seasonal factors on HCoV infections among children from birth to 6 months old in rural Nepal. METHODS: Prospective, active, weekly surveillance for acute respiratory infections (ARIs) was conducted in infants over a period of 3 years during 2 consecutive, population-based randomized trials of maternal influenza immunization. Midnasal swabs were collected for acute respiratory symptoms and tested for HCoV and other viruses by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction. Association between HCoV incidence and potential risk factors was modeled using Poisson regression. RESULTS: Overall, 282 of 3505 (8%) infants experienced an HCoV ARI within the first 6 months of life. HCoV incidence overall was 255.6 (95% confidence interval [CI], 227.3\u2013286.5) per 1000 person-years...","Abstract Objective This study was undertaken to evaluate the pregnancy and perinatal outcomes of pregnant women with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). Study design All pregnant women (12) who presented with SARS in Hong Kong between February 1 and July 31, 2003, were included. The pregnancy and perinatal outcomes were collected. Evidence of perinatal transmission of virus was assessed with the SARS-associated coronavirus reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction on cord blood, placenta tissue, and subsequent follow-up of the neonate on serology. Results Three deaths occurred among the 12 patients, giving a case fatality rate of 25%. Four of the 7 patients (57%) who presented in the first trimester had spontaneous miscarriage. Four of the 5 patients who presented after 24 weeks were delivered preterm. Two mothers recovered without delivery, but their ongoing pregnancies were complicated by intrauterine growth restriction. No newborn infant had clinical SARS and all investi...","The SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) novel coronavirus represents a significant health risk, particularly in older patients. Cancer is one of the leading causes of death in most rich countries, and delivering chemotherapy may be associated with increased risk in the presence of a pandemic infection. Estimating this risk is crucial in making decisions about balancing risks and benefits from administering chemotherapy. However, there are no specific data about chemotherapy risks per se. Here we develop a simple model to estimate the potential harms in patients undergoing chemotherapy during a COVID outbreak. We use age-related case fatality rates as a basis for estimating risk, and use previous data from risk of death during influenza outbreaks to estimate the additional risk associated with chemotherapy. We use data from randomised trials to estimate benefit across a range of curative and palliative settings, and address the balance of benefit against the risk of harm. We then use those data to es...","Tang and colleagues, in this Journal, drew readers attention to emerging COVID19.1 We focused on the pregnant COVID19 patients. Given the maternal physiologic and immune function changes in pregnancy,2 pregnant individuals might face greater risk of getting infected by SARS-CoV-2 and might have more complicated clinical events. We described epidemiological, clinical characteristics, pregnancy and perinatal outcomes of all hospitalized pregnant patients diagnosed with COVID-19 in China. We identified all hospitalized pregnant patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection between December 8, 2019, and February 25, 2020 officially reported by the central government, in areas outside Wuhan, China. Information including age, geographic location, epidemiological history, prenatal course, maternal and newborn hospital course, discharge data and outcome were obtained by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and Local Health Commission. When necessary, we attempted to contact loc...","BACKGROUND: Strategies are urgently needed to mitigate the risk of zoonotic disease emergence in southern China, where pathogens with zoonotic potential are known to circulate in wild animal populations. However, the risk factors leading to emergence are poorly understood, which presents a challenge in developing appropriate mitigation strategies for local communities. METHODS: Residents in rural communities of Yunnan, Guangxi and Guangdong provinces were recruited and enrolled in this study. Data were collected through ethnographic interviews and field observations, and thematically coded and analysed to identify both risk and protective factors for zoonotic disease emergence at the individual, community and policy levels. RESULTS: Eighty-eight ethnographic interviews and 55 field observations were conducted at nine selected sites. Frequent human\u2013animal interactions and low levels of environmental biosecurity in local communities were identified as risks for zoonotic disease emergence...","BACKGROUND: While the risk of severe complications of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and its determinants have been explored in previous studies, a systematic analysis of published articles with different designs and populations has yet to be conducted. The present study aimed to systematically review the risk of death associated with MERS as well as risk factors for associated complications. METHODS: PubMed and Web of Science databases were searched for clinical and epidemiological studies on confirmed cases of MERS. Eligible articles reported clinical outcomes, especially severe complications or death associated with MERS. Risks of admission to intensive care unit (ICU), mechanical ventilation and death were estimated. Subsequently, potential associations between MERS-associated death and age, sex, underlying medical conditions and study design were explored. RESULTS: A total of 25 eligible articles were identified. The case fatality risk ranged from 14.5 to 100%, with the p...","Importance: The recent outbreak of Novel Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) Disease (COVID-19) has put the world on alert, that is reminiscent of the SARS outbreak seventeen years ago. Objective: We aim to compare the severity and mortality between male and female patients with both COVID-19 and SARS, to explore the most useful prognostic factors for individualized assessment. Design, Setting, and Participants: We extracted the data from a case series of 43 hospitalized patients we treated, a public data set of the first 37 cases died of COVID-19 in Wuhan city and 1019 survived patients from six cities in China. We also analyzed the data of 524 patients with SARS, including 139 deaths, from Beijing city in early 2003. Main Outcomes and Measures: Severity and mortality. Results: Older age and high number of comorbidities were associated with higher severity and mortality in patients with both COVID-19 and SARS. The percentages of older age (\u226565 years) were much higher in the deceased group than i...","","Abstract Objective This document summarizes the limited experience of SARS in pregnancy and suggests guidelines for management.

The growth of AI-driven techniques to identify epidemiologic risks early will be key to our improvement of prediction, prevention, and detection of future global health risks. The devastating situation in Wuhan, China and future epidemics will also find value in ongoing research in 2019-nCov case detection, spread prediction, treatment effectiveness, and containment. The wide variety, velocity, and veracity of data now available in crises yield data sets that many researchers will now need to incorporate into evermore complex models. This requires expansion of talent within AI for healthcare applications. AI is no longer a niche research area nor is it a tool for the most advanced healthcare systems only, its global impact on healthcare is real and its potential to save lives in this epidemic as well as future epidemics should not be underestimated. It is critical to the global health of all humankind for t...","Summary Background Public health measures to prevent, detect, and respond to events are essential to control public health risks, including infectious disease outbreaks, as highlighted in the International Health Regulations (IHR). In light of the outbreak of 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), we aimed to review existing health security capacities against public health risks and events. Methods We used 18 indicators from the IHR State Party Annual Reporting (SPAR) tool and associated data from national SPAR reports to develop five indices: (1) prevent, (2) detect, (3) respond, (4) enabling function, and (5) operational readiness. We used SPAR 2018 data for all of the indicators and categorised countries into five levels across the indices, in which level 1 indicated the lowest level of national capacity and level 5 the highest. We also analysed data at the regional level (using the six geographical WHO regions). Findings Of 182 countries, 52 (28%) had prevent capacities at leve...","Objective: To compare the sex differences in the clinical findings among patients with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Methods: We retrospectively collected data of 47 patients diagnosed as severe type of COVID-19 from February 8 to 22, 2020, including demographics, illness history, physical examination, laboratory test, management, and compared differences between men and women. Results: Of the 47 patients, 28 (59.6%) were men. The median age was 62 years, and 30 (63.8%) had comorbidities. The initial symptoms were mainly fever (34 [72.3%]), cough (36 [76.6%]), myalgia (5 [10.6%]) and fatigue (7 [14.9%]). Procalcitonin level was higher in men than in women (0.08 vs. 0.04ng/ml, p=0.002). N-terminal-pro brain natriuretic peptide increased in 16 (57.1%) men and 5 (26.3%) women (p=0.037). Five men (17.9%) had detected positive influenza A antibody, but no women. During 2-week admission, 5 (17.9%) men and 1 (5.3%) woman were reclassified into the critical type due to deteriorat...","ABSTRACT Objective The aim of this systematic review was to report pregnancy and perinatal outcomes of Coronavirus (CoV) spectrum infections, and particularly COVID-19 disease due to SARS-COV-2 infection during pregnancy. Data sources Medline, Embase, Cinahl and Clinicaltrials.gov databases were searched electronically utilizing combinations of word variants for \u201ccoronavirus\u201d or \u201csevere acute respiratory syndrome\u201d or \u201cSARS\u201d or \u201cMiddle East respiratory syndrome\u201d or \u201cMERS\u201d or \u201cCOVID-19\u201d and \u201cpregnancy\u201d. The search and selection criteria were restricted to English language. Study eligibility criteria Inclusion criteria were pregnant women with a confirmed Coronavirus related illness, defined as either SARS, MERS or COVID-19. Study appraisal and synthesis methods We used meta-analyses of proportions to combine data and reported pooled proportions. The pregnancy outcomes observed included miscarriage, preterm birth, pre-eclampsia, preterm prelabor rupture of membranes, fetal growth restrict...","BACKGROUND: Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is a viral respiratory disease. Most people infected with MERS-CoV develop severe acute respiratory illness. It was first reported in Saudi Arabia in 2012 and has since spread to several other countries. We report the clinical course of MERS-CoV infection in a pregnant woman who acquired the infection during the last trimester. CASE PRESENTATION: The patient is a 33-year-old female working as a critical care nurse. She was 32 weeks pregnant when she presented with respiratory symptoms after direct contact with a MERS-COV patient. Although the patient was in respiratory failure, necessitated mechanical ventilation, and intensive care (ICU) admission, a healthy infant was delivered. The mother recovered. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported case of a laboratory-confirmed Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus in a pregnant woman. CONCLUSIONS: Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-Co...","OBJECTIVE: When faced with an emergent epidemic with high mortality and morbidity potential, policy makers must decide what public health interventions to deploy at different stages of the outbreak. However, almost nothing is known about how the public view these interventions or how they trade off risks (of disease) with inconvenience (of interventions). In this paper, we aim to understand public perceptions on pandemic interventions, as well as to identify if there are any distinct respondent preference classes. DESIGN: A discrete choice experiment. SETTING: This study was fielded in Singapore between November 2012 and February 2013. PARTICIPANTS: A random sample of 500 Singapore residents aged 21 and over, including 271 women and 229 men, was analysed. OUTCOME MEASURES: Demographic information was collected from each participant. Participants were also shown a series of pairs of alternatives, each combining interventions and morbidity, mortality and cost outcomes and declared a pref...","Policies and public health efforts have not addressed the gendered impacts of disease outbreaks.1 The response to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) appears no different. We are not aware of any gender analysis of the outbreak by global health institutions or governments in affected countries or in preparedness phases. Recognising the extent to which disease outbreaks affect women and men differently is a fundamental step to understanding the primary and secondary effects of a health emergency on different individuals and communities, and for creating effective, equitable policies and interventions. Although sex-disaggregated data for COVID-19 show equal numbers of cases between men and women so far, there seem to be sex differences in mortality and vulnerability to the disease.2 Emerging evidence suggests that more men than women are dying, potentially due to sex-based immunological3 or gendered differences, such as patterns and prevalence of smoking.4 However, current sex-disaggrega...","Publisher Summary Kawasaki disease (KD) is an acute febrile systemic vasculitis usually occurring in children younger than five years, and rarely reported in neonates and adults. This chapter discusses the epidemiology, etiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and treatments of KD. The etiology still remains unknown, although epidemiological and clinical features strongly suggest an infectious cause. Immunological abnormalities in the acute phase of the disease reflect activation of immune system and marked production of cytokines by activated cells. KD has some similarities to toxin-mediated diseases, both from a clinical and an immunological point of view. The role of one or more superantigens competent of stimulating large numbers of T cells produced by certain strains of Staphylococcus or Streptococcus is discussed in the chapter, in the context of the etiology of KD. Atypical cases are those with fever, acute surgical symptoms, or neurological manifestations as presenting ...","ABSTRACTTo combat the pandemic of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19), numerous governments have established phone hotlines to prescreen potential cases. These hotlines have struggled with the volume of callers, leading to wait times of hours or, even, an inability to contact health authorities. Symptoma is a symptom-to-disease digital health assistant that can differentiate more than 20,000 diseases with an accuracy of more than 90%. We tested the accuracy of Symptoma to identify COVID-19 using a set of diverse clinical cases combined with case reports of COVID-19. We showed that Symptoma can accurately distinguish COVID-19 in 96.32% of clinical cases. When considering only COVID-19 symptoms and risk factors, Symptoma identified 100% of those infected when presented with only three signs. Lastly, we showed that Symptoma\u2019s accuracy far exceeds that of simple \u201cyes-no\u201d questionnaires widely available online. In summary, Symptoma provides unparalleled accuracy in systematically identifying...","","The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) is a newly discovered infectious disease caused by a novel coronavirus, which can readily spread in the healthcare setting. A recent community outbreak in Hong Kong infected a significant number of pregnant women who subsequently required emergency caesarean section for deteriorating maternal condition and respiratory failure. As no neonatal clinician has any experience in looking after these high risk infants, stringent infection control measures for prevention of cross infection between patients and staff are important to safeguard the wellbeing of the work force and to avoid nosocomial spread of SARS within the neonatal unit. This article describes the infection control and patient triage policy of the neonatal unit at the Prince of Wales Hospital, Hong Kong. We hope this information is useful in helping other units to formulate their own infection control plans according to their own unit configuration and clinical needs.","Abstract 2020 has become the year of coping with COVID-19. This year was to be the \u201csuper year\u201d for sustainability, a year of strengthening global actions to accelerate the transformations required for achieving the 2030 agenda. We argue that 2020 can and must be a year of both. Thus we call for more utilisation of the health-emergency disaster risk management (Health-EDRM) framework to complement current responses to COVID-19 and the patent risk of similar phenomena in the future. To make our case, we examine current responses to COVID-19 and their implications for the SFDRR. We argue that current mechanisms and strategies for disaster resilience, as outlined in the SFDRR, can enhance responses to epidemics or global pandemics such as COVID-19. In this regard, we make several general and DRR-specific recommendations. These recommendations concern knowledge and science provision in understanding disaster and health-related emergency risks, the extension of disaster risk governance to m...","Since the emergence of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) (formerly known as the 2019 novel coronavirus [2019-nCoV]) in Wuhan, China in December 2019, which is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), more than 75,000 cases have been reported in 32 countries/regions, resulting in more than 2,000 deaths worldwide. Despite the fact that most COVID-19 cases and mortalities were reported in China, the WHO has declared this outbreak as the sixth public health emergency of international concern. The COVID-19 can present as an asymptomatic carrier state, acute respiratory disease, and pneumonia. Adults represent the population with the highest infection rate; however, neonates, children, and elderly patients can also be infected by SARS-CoV-2. In addition, nosocomial infection of hospitalized patients and healthcare workers, and viral transmission from asymptomatic carriers are possible. The most common finding on chest imaging among patients with pneumonia was...","Abstract COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) is currently a global pandemic. This paper will attempt to estimate global infection rates and potential resultant mortality in the absence of effective treatment and/or vaccination. Calculations are based on World Health Organisation data from Wuhan in China: 14% of infected cases are severe, 5% require intensive care and 4% die. Estimated infection rates and mortality rates at the level of continents and some individual countries (when these are of sufficient size) are tabulated. This pandemic may cause close to half a billion deaths, i.e. 6% of the global population \u2013 and potentially more. At the risk of sounding sensational, but with a sober sense of realism, healthcare risks being plunged into the Middle-Ages if the public do not do their part. Infection cannot occur in the absence of contact. The only way to mitigate these numbers is to apply social distancing and take the standard precautions so frequently reiterated by Public Health: hand washing,...","Abstract Epidemic outbreaks are a special case of supply chain (SC) risks which is distinctively characterized by a long-term disruption existence, disruption propagations (i.e., the ripple effect), and high uncertainty. We present the results of a simulation study that opens some new research tensions on the impact of COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) on the global SCs. First, we articulate the specific features that frame epidemic outbreaks as a unique type of SC disruption risks. Second, we demonstrate how simulation-based methodology can be used to examine and predict the impacts of epidemic outbreaks on the SC performance using the example of coronavirus COVID-19 and anyLogistix simulation and optimization software. We offer an analysis for observing and predicting both short-term and long-term impacts of epidemic outbreaks on the SCs along with managerial insights. A set of sensitivity experiments for different scenarios allows illustrating the model\u2019s behavior and its value for decision-mak...","Since December 2019, COVID-19 has raged in Wuhan and subsequently all over China and the world. We propose a Cybernetics-based Dynamic Infection Model (CDIM) to the dynamic infection process with a probability distributed incubation delay and feedback principle. Reproductive trends and the stability of the SARS-COV-2 infection in a city can then be analyzed, and the uncontrollable risks can be forecasted before they really happen. The infection mechanism of a city is depicted using the philosophy of cybernetics and approaches of the control engineering. Distinguished with other epidemiological models, such as SIR, SEIR, etc., that compute the theoretical number of infected people in a closed population, CDIM considers the immigration and emigration population as system inputs, and administrative and medical resources as dynamic control variables. The epidemic regulation can be simulated in the model to support the decision-making for containing the outbreak. City case studies are demon...","Emerging infections, many zoonotic, are caused by a variety of pathogens with global distribution. Previously rare pathogens have emerged; global travel facilitates their rapid spread. Human encroachment on remote areas has brought contact with zoonotic diseases never before characterized. Although systematic study of rare outbreaks can be challenging, knowledge of emerging pathogens and their effects on women is accumulating. This article discusses effects of lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus, West Nile virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, avian influenza A virus, viral hemorrhagic fevers, spirochetal illnesses, and Chagas' disease. The potential impact of candidate bioterror agents and issues of prophylaxis and therapy are discussed.","AbstractThe outbreak of 2019-nCoV pneumonia (COVID-19) in the city of Wuhan, China has resulted in more than 70,000 laboratory confirmed cases, and recent studies showed that 2019-nCoV (SARS-CoV-2) could be of bat origin but involve other potential intermediate hosts. In this study, we assembled the genomes of coronaviruses identified in sick pangolins. The molecular and phylogenetic analyses showed that pangolin Coronaviruses (pangolin-CoV) are genetically related to both the 2019-nCoV and bat Coronaviruses but do not support the 2019-nCoV arose directly from the pangolin-CoV. Our study also suggested that pangolin be natural host of Betacoronavirus, with a potential to infect humans. Large surveillance of coronaviruses in pangolins could improve our understanding of the spectrum of coronaviruses in pangolins. Conservation of wildlife and limits of the exposures of humans to wildlife will be important to minimize the spillover risks of coronaviruses from wild animals to humans.","SUMMARY The French public health institute is responsible for promoting and coordinating threats the detection and assessment of health risks, and for suggesting possible responses. Transmissible diseases affecting both human and animal health are the focus of surveillance networks. Early detection of potential infectious threats is based on the screening of \u201c alert signals \u201c identified through routine surveillance networks and other systems. The quality and accuracy of these signals is first verified, before assessing, through a multidisciplinary approach, the risk of introduction and dissemination. This article examines specific cases illustrating the process of detection, risk analysis and response, with respect to infectious threats that are endemic in tropical regions and have the potential to be imported into metropolitan France. For both novel pathogens and exotic diseases \u2014 which, not being endemic in France, are less well known \u2014 the analysis and response process must regularl...","An estimated 1.9 million children travel overseas annually. Infectious disease risks associated with international travel are diverse and depend on the destination, planned activities, and baseline medical history. Children have special needs and vulnerabilities that should be addressed when preparing for travel abroad. Children should have a pretravel health assessment that includes recommendations for both routine and special travel-related vaccination; malaria chemoprophylaxis, if indicated; and prevention counseling regarding insect and animal exposures, food and water safety, and avoiding injuries. Special consideration should be given to children with chronic diseases. Families should be given anticipatory guidance for management of potential illnesses and information about the location of medical resources overseas.","Background: Since the outbreak of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in China, respiratory manifestations of the disease have been observed. However, as a fatal comorbidity, acute myocardial injury (AMI) in COVID-19 patients has not been previously investigated in detail. We investigated the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients with AMI and determined the risk factors for AMI in them. Methods: We analyzed data from 53 consecutive laboratory-confirmed and hospitalized COVID-19 patients (28 men, 25 women; age, 19-81 years). We collected information on epidemiological and demographic characteristics, clinical features, routine laboratory tests (including cardiac injury biomarkers), echocardiography, electrocardiography, imaging findings, management methods, and clinical outcomes. Results: Cardiac complications were found in 42 of the 53 (79.25%) patients: tachycardia (n=15), electrocardiography abnormities (n=11), diastolic dysfunction (n=20), elevated myocardial enzymes (n=...","BACKGROUND: The outbreak of COVID-19 has laid unprecedented psychological stress on health workers (HWs). We aimed to assess the immediate psychological impact on HWs at Tongji Hospital in Wuhan, China. METHODS: We conducted a single-center, cross-sectional survey of HWs via online questionnaires between February 8th and 10th, 2020. We evaluated stress, depression and anxiety by Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R), Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), and Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item (GAD-7), respectively. We also designed a questionnaire to assess the effect of psychological protective measures taken by Tongji Hospital. Multivariate logistic regression was used to identify predictors of acute stress, depression, and anxiety. RESULTS: We received 5062 completed questionnaires (response rate, 77.1 percent). 1509 (29.8 percent), 681 (13.5 percent) and 1218 (24.1 percent) HWs reported stress, depression and anxiety symptoms. Women (hazard ratio[HR], 1.31; P=0.032), years of wo...","The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in China has been declared a public health emergency of international concern. The cardiac injury was dominate in the process. However, whether N terminal pro B type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) predicted outcome of COVID-19 patients was unknown. The study initially enrolled 102 patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia from a continuous sample. After screening out the ineligible cases, 54 patients were analyzed in this study. Results found that patients with higher NT-proBNP (above 88.64 pg/mL) level had more risks of in-hospital death. After adjusting for potential cofounders in separate modes, NT-proBNP presented as an independent risk factor of in-hospital death in patients with severe COVID-19.","Abstract We present here the proceedings of the 5th seminar on emerging infectious diseases, held in Paris on March 22nd, 2016, with seven priority proposals that can be outlined as follows: encourage research on the prediction, screening and early detection of new risks of infection; develop research and surveillance concerning transmission of pathogens between animals and humans, with their reinforcement in particular in intertropical areas (\u201chot-spots\u201d) via public support; pursue aid development and support in these areas of prevention and training for local health personnel, and foster risk awareness in the population; ensure adapted patient care in order to promote adherence to treatment and to epidemic propagation reduction measures; develop greater awareness and better education among politicians and healthcare providers, in order to ensure more adapted response to new types of crises; modify the logic of governance, drawing from all available modes of communication and incorpor..."],"title":["Clinical features and obstetric and neonatal outcomes of pregnant patients with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China: a retrospective, single-centre, descriptive study","CORONAVIRUS IN PREGNANCY AND DELIVERY: RAPID REVIEW AND EXPERT CONSENSUS","Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Pandemic and Pregnancy","Risks of Novel Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) in Pregnancy; a Narrative Review","Clinical features and the maternal and neonatal outcomes of pregnant women with coronavirus disease 2019","Management Guidelines for Obstetric Patients and Neonates Born to Mothers With Suspected or Probable Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS)","No. 225-Management Guidelines for Obstetric Patients and Neonates Born to Mothers With Suspected or Probable Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS)","A Prospective Study of Respiratory Viral Infection in Pregnant Women With and Without Asthma","Maternal and neonatal outcomes of pregnant women with COVID-19 pneumonia: a case-control study","Why are pregnant women susceptible to COVID-19?

December, 2019, the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which originated in Wuhan, China, has become a global public health threat. 1 On Feb 28, 2020, WHO upgraded their assessment of the risk of spread and the risk of impact of COVID-19 to very high at global level. By March 10, 2020, 116 166 cases have been reported globally, causing 4088 deaths. The epidemic has spread to 118 countries around the world. 2 With immunocompromised status and physiological adaptive changes during pregnancy, pregnant women could be more susceptible to COVID-19 infection than the general population. As COVID-19 is rapidly spreading, maternal management and fetal safety become a major concern, but there is scarce information of assessment and management of pregnant women infected with COVID-19, and the potential risk of vertical transmission is unclear. In The Lancet Infectious Diseases, Nan Yu and colleagues 3 report the clinical features and obstetric and neonatal outcomes of pregnancy with COVID-19 pneumonia in Wuhan, China. Seven pregnant women with COVID-19 pneumonia were assessed and the onset symptoms were similar to those reported in non-pregnant adults with COVID-19. All patients received oxygen therapy and antiviral treatment in isolation. All patients had caesarean section after consultation with a multidisciplinary team and the outcomes of the pregnant women and neonates were good. Three neonates were tested for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and one was found to be infected with COVID-19 36 h after birth. The findings of the study provide some indications for clinical assessment and management of pregnant women with COVID-19, but questions remain on how to manage pregnant women infected with COVID-19.","The Lancet by Huang and colleagues 2 reported the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics, as well as treatment and clinical out comes, of patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia. However, Huang and colleagues' report mainly focused on non-pregnant adults. The clinical characteristics and vertical transmission potential of COVID-19 pneumonia in pregnant women is unknown. Urgent questions that need to be addressed promptly include whether pregnant women with COVID-19 pneumonia will develop distinct symptoms from non-pregnant adults, whether pregnant women who have confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia are more likely to die of the infection or to undergo preterm labour, and whether COVID-19 could spread vertically and pose risks to the fetus and neonate. Answers to these questions are essential for formulating the principles of obstetric treatment for pregnant women with COVID-19 infection. Therefore, to facilitate efforts, both in China and glo bally, to prevent and control COVID-19 pneumonia in children and pregnant women, 3 we retrospectively collected and analysed detailed clinical data from pregnant women with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 infection at Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China. In this study we present clinical features of pregnant women with confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia and examine the vertical trans mission potential of COVID-19. ","Stephanie colleagues did not find any evidence of the presence of SARSCoV2 viral particles in the products of conception or in neonates, in accordance with the findings of a previous study on SARSCoV1 done by Wong and colleagues. 9 Two neonatal cases of COVID19 infection have been confirmed so far, 10 with one case confirmed at 17 days after birth and having a close contact history with two confirmed cases (the baby's mother and maternity matron) and the other case confirmed at 36 h after birth and for whom the possibility of close contact history cannot be excluded. However, no reliable evidence is as yet available to support the possibility of vertical transmission of COVID19 infection from the mother to the baby. Previous studies have shown that SARS during pregnancy is associated with a high incidence of adverse maternal and neonatal complications, such as spontaneous miscarriage, preterm delivery, intrauterine growth restriction, application of endotracheal intu bation, admission to the intensive care unit, renal failure, and disseminated intravascular coagulopathy. 9, 11 However, pregnant women with COVID19 infection in the present study had fewer adverse maternal and neonatal complications and outcomes than would be anticipated for those with SARSCoV1 infection. Although a small number of cases was analysed and the findings should be interpreted with caution, the findings are mostly consistent with the clinical analysis done by Zhu and colleagues 12 of ten neonates born to mothers with COVID19 pneumonia. The clinical characteristics reported in pregnant women with confirmed COVID19 infection are similar to those reported for nonpregnant adults with confirmed COVID19 infection in the general population and are indicative of a relatively optimistic clinical course and outcomes for COVID19 infection compared with SARSCoV1 infection. 13, 14 Nonetheless, because of the small number of cases analysed and the short duration of the study period, more followup studies should be done to further evaluate the safety and health of pregnant women and newborn babies who develop COVID19 infection. As discussed in the study, pregnant women are susceptible to respiratory pathogens and to development of severe pneumonia, which possibly makes them more susceptible to COVID19 infection than the general population, especially if they have chronic diseases or maternal complications. Therefore, pregnant women and newborn babies should be considered key atrisk populations in strategies focusing on prevention and management of COVID19 infection. Based on evidence from the latest studies and expert recommendations, as well as previous experiences from the prevention and control of SARS, the National Health Commission of China launched a new notice on Feb 8, 2020, 15 which proposed strengthening health counselling, screening, and followups for pregnant women, reinforcing visit time and procedures in obstetric clinics and units with specialised infection control preparations and protective clothing, and emphasised that neonates of pregnant women with suspected or confirmed COVID19 infection should be isolated in a designated unit for at least 14 days after birth and should not be breastfed, to avoid close contact with the mother while she has suspected or confirmed COVID19 infection.","We assessed the incubation period, clinical manifestations, laboratory findings, chest CT scans, maternal and fetal management, therapeutic schedule, and maternal and fetal outcomes of full-term pregnant women confirmed to have COVID-19 pneumonia caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection. With intensive, active management, the outcomes of the pregnant women and neonates were good. Although one neonate was found to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 36 h postpartum, up to the follow-up day, no pneumonia and other clinical symptoms and signs were found in all seven neonates. To the best of our knowledge, we provide the first evidence that clinical features of COVID-19 in full-term pregnant women were similar to those of non-pregnant adult patients with COVID-19 and outcomes were good following intensive active management of the disease.","We retrospectively examined 114 patients with febrile bacterial infections admitted to our department over a period of 2 (two) years. No one had a history of established cardiac failure. The diagnostic of the sepsis was based on clinical and laboratory data. We measured BNP, PCT and CRP in blood samples, taken the first 2 (two) days of hospitalization. The outcome was determined as survivors and nonsurvivors. Results: We had 66 female and 48 male patients. Among those patients, 68 were survivors (59,6%) and 46 (40,4%) non-survivors. There was a significant increase of BNP levels in non-survivors patients (1027) vs. BNP levels in survivors patients (432, 55) . Also the PCT mean levels were higher in the non-survivors's group (20,65) vs. the survivors's group (3, 6) . Finally, the mean levels of CRP in survivors was 167,21 and in the non-survivors was 166,4. Conclusions: In our study BNP and PCT levels measured soon after admission were increased significantly in sepsis and they seem to be a valuable prognostic marker in the outcome of these patients. The difference of the CRP mean levels in the 2 (two) groups was not significant. T. Cirkin Guzel*, N. Baykam, S. Menekse Yilmaz, A. Kocagul Celikbas, S. Eren Gok, H. Esener, S. Yaprakci, B. Dokuzoguz (Ankara, TR) Introduction: H1N1 influenza pandemic caused higher morbidity and mortality among pregnant women than in the general population underscores the medical community's urgent need for data regarding the safe and effective use of medications during pregnancy. Although the benefits of treatment appears to outweigh the theoretical risks of antiviral use there is few data about the newborns who borned from mothers who took medications for H1N1 during their pregnancy. In this study we aimed to investigate the clinical characteristics of H1N1 influenza in pregnant women and follow up the health status of newborns of these mothers after delivery. Methods: Twenty pregnant women with clinical symptoms and diagnosis of influenza A (H1N1) were included in this study from October 2009 to January 2010. All the study population were followed up until delivery and newborns were evaluated for any complication associated with infection or medication. Results: Twenty of 276 hospitalized patients with pandemic H1N1 influenza were pregnant (7.2%). The mean age was 24\u00b13 (17\u221230years). Thirteen (65%) pregnant women were in 2nd trimestre, 5 (25%) were in 3rd trimestre and 2 (10%) were in 1st trimestre when they admitted to hospital. Although 80% of patients had pathologic respiratory auscultation findings, only 4 pregnant patients accepted chest X-ray test and all of them had bilateral patchy alveolar opacities. Two of them required mechanical ventilation. One of the mechanically ventilated pregnant woman died at the second day of hospitalization. Six of the patients didn't accept to get antiviral medication. Only one pregnant women who got antiviral medication (oseltamivir) had premature birth at 36th week. All other deliveries were in term and no complications were detected in newborns up to 4th week of their life. Conclusion: Although early evidence suggests that pregnant women may be at higher risk for severe complications (including stillbirth) from novel H1N1, the benefits of treatment appears to outweigh the theoretical risks of antiviral use. Early anti-viral therapy, may bring clinical benefits to pregnant patients. ","Midwives are another major group of HCWs who contribute significantly to the provision of quality health services in the community (14). Although the impact of COVID- 19 is not yet clear on pregnant women, they might be at greater risk of acquiring the infection since pregnant women are more susceptible to respiratory viruses (19) . As COVID-19 infection has been reported from close contact of neonates with confirmed cases, it is important to consider pregnant women and their newborn infants as at-risk populations while preventing and managing COVID-19 infection (19) . Accordingly, nurses and midwives should be trained to appropriately comply with IPC guidelines including hand hygiene when providing care for this group (20) .","However, this study has several limitations. First, only seven pregnant women with COVID-19 were included in the analyses. More infected pregnant women and comparative studies (eg, cohorts, case-control) should be analysed to get a more comprehensive understanding of COVID-19 in pregnancy. Second, all enrolled patients were in the third trimester, so the effect of the virus infection on the fetus in the first or second trimester is unknown. Third, due to the short time of the outbreak, the long-term out comes of the neonates and whether mother-to-child transmission exists require further study. However, the data in this study permit an early assessment of the clinical characteristics and maternal and fetal outcomes of COVID-19 in late pregnancy in women in Wuhan, China.","Yu and colleagues' 3 report of the clinical features and obstetric and neonatal outcomes of pregnant women with COVID-19 provides a reference for clinical assessment and management of this patient population. However, understanding of SARS-CoV-2, especially the effect on pregnant women and neonates, is still insufficient. We need to further strengthen research to provide an evidence-based foundation for the medical management of pregnant patients with COVID-19.","The time of delivery in the study was 37 weeks to 41 weeks plus 5 days, all by caesarean section. In cases of pregnant women with COVID-19, more evidence is needed to establish when to deliver and when caesarean sections should be recommended. Previous treatment experience has been inconclusive about which delivery method is safer in this patient population. Zhu and colleagues 6 reported nine pregnant women with COVID-19. Seven of the women delivered their babies by cesarean section and two by vaginal delivery. All three neonates delivered vaginally (including two who were twins) had an Apgar score of at least 9 and negative nucleic acid test. Yudin and colleagues 7 reported a pregnant woman with SARS at 31 weeks of gestation; the patient stayed for 21 days in the hospital and did not require intensive care admission or ventilatory support, and a healthy baby girl was delivered by vaginal birth. It is unknown whether vaginal delivery increases the infection risk. Further research is needed to assess the risk and to produce guidelines for delivery times and methods in patients with COVID-19.","According to our study, pregnant women with COVID-19 pneumonia showed a similar pattern of clinical characteristics to non-pregnant adult patients, as recently reported. 2, 15 Common symptoms at the onset of COVID-19 pneumonia for these women included a fever and cough, whereas less common symptoms were myalgia, malaise, sore throat, diarrhoea, and shortness of breath. Laboratory tests indicated that lymphopenia is also likely to occur. Additionally, increased concentrations However, none of these symptoms was present in every patient, nor were the symptoms specific to pregnant women with COVID-19 pneumonia. By contrast, chest CT might have a high diagnostic value because of its typical images of virus infection, high accuracy with a low false negative rate, and time efficiency. Therefore, we recommend that, in addition to using nucleic acid tests as the gold standard for the diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia, relevant clinical examinations are done, including blood counts and chest CT and a comprehensive evaluation of a patient's medical history, epidemiological exposure, and symptoms. All nine pregnant women in this study underwent a caesarean section. Indications for a caesarean section included severe pre-eclampsia, a history of caesarean sections, and fetal distress. Importantly, uncertainty about the risk of intrapartum mother-to-child transmission by vaginal delivery was another reason for carrying out caesarean sections. Four of the nine patients had preterm labour. However, the causes of premature birth were not related to COVID-19 pneumonia: one patient had severe pre-eclampsia, one had a history of two stillbirths, one had a history of two caesarean sections and irregular contractions; and one had premature rupture of the membrane for about 12 h and suspected intrauterine infection. Moreover, one neonate in our study had a birthweight of 1880 g at 36 gestational weeks plus 2 days, and this case was complicated by preeclampsia. Furthermore, the time period from onset of COVID-19 pneumonia to admission was only 3 days for this patient; therefore we reasoned that the fetal intrauterine growth restriction was more likely to be a symptom associated with pre-eclampsia. Importantly, all nine livebirths had a 1-min Apgar score of 8-9 and 5-min Apgar score of 9-10. One infant had a mild increase in myocardial enzymes on the day of birth, but without any clinical symptoms. None of the neonates needed special paediatric treatment.","As we face emerging and re-emerging health threats, we will need to understand how these novel diseases will affect pregnant women. In some cases, such as SARS, the hemorrhagic fevers, and smallpox, it appears that pregnant women may have more severe clinical courses compared with nonpregnant adults. In some cases, it appears that the rapid diagnosis of the disease may be delayed due to pregnancy. For example, in one of the reported anthrax cases, there was probably a delay in diagnosis of anthrax peritonitis because the pregnancy complicated the presenting clinical picture [41] . In terms of prophylaxis and treatment of emerging diseases, in many cases, such as anthrax, tularemia, and plague, first-line therapies and postexposure prophylaxis is similar in pregnant and nonpregnant adults. Although vaccinations such as those for smallpox and anthrax are not generally recommended for pregnant women, in some cases they may be used for postexposure prophylaxis. For example, for pregnant women exposed to monkeypox or smallpox, use of the vaccinia vaccine is recommended. In some cases, such as with ribavirin, which is generally contraindicated in pregnancy due to its teratogenic and embyrocidal effects, decisions about use in pregnancy need to be carefully weighed. In the case of SARS, where treatment is generally supportive and the effectiveness of ribavirin has not been convincingly demonstrated, use of ribavirin may not be indicated. By contrast, ribavirin has been shown to be effective treatment for some of the viral hemorrhagic fevers, such as Lassa fever, and despite the risks, treatment of pregnant women may be warranted given the severity of illness. In terms of perinatal transmission, there are cases of intrauterine transmission of West Nile virus, monkeypox, and smallpox virus reported in the literature.","Since SARS-CoV-2 is a novel virus, herd immunity is not present, which makes all populations susceptible. Pregnant women are more susceptible to respiratory pathogens; hence, they may be more susceptible to COVID-19 infection than the general population. Moreover, due to the characteristic immune responses during pregnancy and potential risks from the cytokine-storm by COVID-19 infection, pregnant women with COVID-19 may face severe morbidity and even mortality. Although existing evidence does not support the intrauterine vertical transmission, the maternal infection and inflammation occurred in response to COVID-19 could affect the developing fetus and even postnatal life. With the continuing pandemic of COVID-19, more efforts should be made to protect both mothers and fetuses. Further studies are warranted to investigate the pregnant women with COVID-19 in the first and second trimester and follow-up the pregnancy outcomes and postnatal development of the fetus.","Risk factors for severe COVID-19 disease include advanced age, chronic medical conditions, immunocompromise, and cancer. 46 Data regarding pregnancy and COVID-19 are limited. 47 Pregnant women and fetuses may be more vulnerable to COVID-19 infection compared to the general population. 48 There are case reports of pregnant women diagnosed with COVID-19 complicated by adverse outcomes including preterm birth. 47 Historically, infants born to mothers with other coronaviruses such as MERS-CoV or SARS-CoV have been small for gestational age or preterm. 47 Newborn infants are also an at-risk population. 48 Occupational exposure to pathogens is an inherent risk of working in healthcare settings. 49 During the 2003 SARS outbreak, 9% of healthcare professionals (HCPs) in Toronto, Canada participating in endotracheal intubation of infected patients became infected themselves. 50 In another study, 77% of SARS patients in Toronto had ties to the hospital setting, and 51% of cases were HCPs. 51 During the H1N1 influenza pandemic, J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f HCPs were significantly more likely to develop infection (odds ratio [OR] 2.08, 95% CI 1.73-2.51) with a pooled prevalence of 6.3%. 52 As COVID-19 has disproportionately affected HCPs, emergency physicians must be vigilant about potential exposure risks and adhere to appropriate infection prevention precautions. 53, 54 In Italy, anywhere from 8-30%","This study is limited by the small sample size and retrospective method. Several considerations should be taken into account when interpreting the findings. First, all enrolled patients were in the third trimester. The effect of COVID-19 infection on the fetus in the first or second trimester of pregnancy remains to be clarified. Second, whether vaginal delivery increases the risk of mother-to-child intrapartum transmission, and whether uterine contraction could increase the possibility of the virus ascending, needs to be further investigated. Third, the risk of infection in pregnant women and the effects of the time or mode of delivery on pregnancy outcomes were not evaluated. Fourth, whether COVID-19 could damage the placenta, which represents an important link in vertical transmission, also needs to be further investigated. Future investigations of these issues and follow-up studies of pregnant women with COVID-19 infection, as well as neonates, will be necessary to ascertain the safety and health of mothers and babies exposed to SARS-CoV-2.","In a review of 11 pregnant women infected with MERS-CoV, 3 ten (91%) presented with adverse outcomes, six (55%) neonates required admission to the intensive care unit, and three (27%) died. Two neonates were delivered prematurely for severe maternal respiratory failure.","COVID-19 disease cases in the USA are on a quicker upward trajectory than any country in the world, even Italy, 1 and both SARS-CoV2 infections and deaths is the US will soon make us the most affected country in the world. Pregnant women are at higher risk of developing pneumonia from viruses, like the flu virus as an example. The limited early data shows that pregnant women hospitalized with COVID-19 pneumonia are at higher risks of being intubated and critically ill (about 8%), and having complications such as miscarriage, preterm birth (41%), preeclampsia (14%), cesarean (91%), and their babies of stillbirth (2.4%), admission to the intensive care unit (8%), and neonatal death.2 While no maternal deaths have been reported in the world so far (3/21/2020), the first ones are happening even today in the US. Pregnancy should be considered a co-morbidity, and pregnant women may be at higher risk of complications from COVID-19.","Early detection and intervention of COVID-19 may reduce potential obstetrical complications such as pregnancy loss, intrauterine growth restriction, and preterm delivery, and may be beneficial for improving pregnancy outcomes. Anti-viral therapy for COVID-19, such as lopinavir and ritonavir, should be determined by weighing the risks and benefits. Treatment can be initiated when the potential benefits outweigh the potential risks to the fetus. Even after the viral infection is controlled, the intrauterine development of the fetus should be closely monitored since the early gestation data is lacking, and placental inflammation may persist for a prolonged time. Pregnant women with COVID-19 should be carefully monitored throughout pregnancy and the postpartum period since they had anti-viral drug therapy and radiation exposure from CT examinations.","The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03. 22.20041061 doi: medRxiv preprint respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) 6,10,11 . The clinical outcomes among pregnant women with SARS or MERS were worse than those occurring in non-pregnant women 6, 10 . However, our data suggest the contrary to Covid-19. Among the 33 pregnant women with confirmed Covid-19, 39.4% of women presented mild, 57.6% presented moderate, and 3% presented with severe symptoms. For most pregnant women (87.9%), oxygen therapy supplied via a nasal cannula or mask was sufficient for supportive care. Only one (3%) pregnant woman needed the use of mechanical ventilation. At the end of the follow-up, no pregnant women had severe complications or needed to be transferred to the ICU or died. Compared with the general population, in which 5.0% who were admitted to the ICU, 2.3% who needed mechanical ventilation, and 1.4% who died 12 , it seems that the severity and mortality rate of Covid-19 in pregnant women are lower.","Therapeutics announced as being under consideration and trial in the outbreak include Kaletra (Lopinavir and Ritonavir), Remdesivir and Chloroquine. Kaletra (24) is used in the UK during pregnancy for treatment of HIV where the benefits of treatment outweigh the risks of toxicity seen in animal studies. The use of Chloroquine outweighs the risks in the prevention and treatment of malaria during pregnancy (25). Remdesivir has been used for the treatment of Ebola in pregnant women(26), however it should be acknowledged that Ebola is a condition with a CFR of 50% for which there would be higher tolerance for adverse effects of a potentially beneficial treatment than would be the case for COVID-19 where the CFR is around 1%. It would seem reasonable not to exclude seriously ill pregnant women from trials of these therapies for COVID-19.","We report clinical data from nine pregnant women with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia. The clinical characteristics of these patients with COVID-19 infection during pregnancy were similar to those of non-pregnant adults with COVID-19 infection, as previously reported. 2 None of the nine patients developed severe pneumonia or died, as of Feb 4, 2020. Notably, based on our findings in these nine patients, there is currently no evidence to s uggest that development of COVID-19 pneumonia in the third trimester of pregnancy could lead to the occurrence of severe Pregnant women are particularly susceptible to respiratory pathogens and severe pneumonia, because they are at an immunosuppressive state, and physiological adaptive changes during pregnancy (eg, diaphragm elevation, increased oxygen consumption, and oedema of respiratory tract mucosa) can render them intolerant to hypoxia. For example, the 1918 influenza pandemic caused a mortality rate of 2\u00b76% in the overall population, but 37% among pregnant women. 8 Pregnant women were reported to be at an increased risk of complications from the pandemic H1N1 2009 influenza virus infection, and were more than four times more likely to be admitted to hospital than the general population (relative risk 4\u00b73 [95% CI 2\u00b73-7\u00b78]). 9 Wong and colleagues 10 also reported that around 50% of pregnant women who developed SARS were admitted to the intensive care unit, around 33% of pregnant women with SARS required mechanical ventilation, and the mortality rate was as high as 25% for these women. In the current study, we treated nine pregnant women with COVID-19 pneumonia in 11 days from Jan 20 to Jan 31, 2020. Considering that SARS-CoV-2 has up to 85% sequence similarity with SARS, [11] [12] [13] [14] although none of our patients developed severe pneumonia or died of COVID-19 infection, we should be alert to the possibility that the disease course and prognosis of COVID-19 pneumonia could follow the same trend as SARS in pregnant women. However, our obser vations are based on a small number of cases and the time between illness onset and delivery was short.","As discussed in the study, although all mothers and infants showed good outcomes, all enrolled pregnant women were in the third trimester, and all had only mild symptoms. Hence, the effect of SARS-CoV-2 infection on the fetus in the first or second trimester or in patients with moderate to severe infection is unknown. As a previous study reported, SARS coronavirus infection during pregnancy might cause preterm birth, intrauterine growth restriction, intrauterine death, and neonatal death. 8 Considering that the potential of SARS-CoV-2 to cause severe obstetric and neonatal adverse outcomes is unknown, rigorous screening of suspected cases during pregnancy and long-term follow-up of confirmed mothers and their neonates are needed.","Of 9 pregnant women, 4 (44%) had premature delivery [5] . In a previous study of MERS-CoV, there were 11 pregnant women [7] . A comparison between MERS-CoV and COVID-19 cases in pregnancy is shown in table 1. There was no difference in the age group of the patients, however, the gestational age was lower among MERS than COVID-19 patients. Of the MERS-CoV cases in pregnancy, 63.6% required intensive care unit admission and this is comparable to 50% of SARS pregnant women [8] . There was no mention about the death rate among pregnant women with COVID-19, however, the case fatality rate among MERS-pregnant patients was about 35% and was not statistically different when compared to the overall MERS case fatality rate [7] . In the MERS cases, 40% had C-section and this is much lower than 100% C-section rate in the case of COVID-19. This difference may reflect a variance in the practices between different countries. Another difference is the high fetal demise rate of 30% among pregnant women with MERS compared to 0% among COVID-19. The fetal demise rate among 12 pregnant women with SARS was 25% [8] . Thus, similar to the difference in the clinical presentation and course among SARS, MERS-CoV and COVID-19, there is also differences in the outcome and course of pregnant women with these coronaviruses' infection. Understanding the impact of COVID-19 on pregnancy and outcome would guide healthcare authorities and public health on further risk mitigation and advise for pregnant women around the world.

The course of influenza in pregnancy was first reported during the epidemic of 1918, when 1350 cases in pregnant women who had an influenza-like illness were evaluated. Pneumonia complicated 585 (43%) of the cases. In 52% of these patients, the pregnancy was interrupted. There were 308 (23%) maternal deaths. Mortality was highest in the last 3 months of pregnancy, and increased if complicated by pneumonia [6] . During the influenza epidemic of 1957, 22 pregnant women in New York City died from complications of the flu. Pregnant women accounted for nearly half the deaths of women of childbearing age [7] . During the same epidemic, 11 pregnant women died in Minnesota. All deaths were attributed to respiratory insufficiency secondary to pulmonary edema and pneumonia [8] . Mullooly and colleagues [9] reviewed influenza complicating pregnancy from 1975 to 1979. There were four epidemics in that 5-year time period. Pregnant women sought outpatient medical attention for acute respiratory disease during the influenza season significantly more often than nonpregnant women; however, unlike the previously reported epidemics, there were no maternal deaths attributable to influenza, and the hospitalization rate was low at 2 per 1000.","Viral pneumonia is caused most commonly by influenza and varicella-zoster virus (VZV).

The boy with his father returned from Wuhan on January 11. His father also had fever since January 14. The father was admitted to a hospital because of fever and progressive cough, and soon was diagnosed as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on January 19. Blood test showed WBC 16,000/mm 3 (neutrophil 70% and lymphocytes 23%) and normal platelet and hemoglobulin. Nasal and throat swabs taken on January 19 were positive for SARS-CoV-2. Follow-up testing for SARS-CoV-2 on January 24 (day 5) and January 28 (day 9) were still positive but turned negative on January 31 (day 12) and February 1 (day 13). He recovered gradually after supportive treatment. The child's mother, who did not go to Wuhan but came to hospital to take of him was tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by nasal and throat swabs. The mother remained symptomless throughout his admission. The case reported by Cai et al. probably was the first evidence indicating children as a source of adult infection. 9 Perinatal infection can occur if the baby is born to a pregnant woman with confirmed infection (Fig. 1B) . A recent study by Chen et al. reported the clinical characteristics of nine livebirths born to nine pregnant women with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 via cesarean section; all nine neonates were later confirmed negative for the infection. 10 We assume that neonates born to infected mothers via vaginal delivery could still be at risk for the infection due to close baby-mother contact during the delivery. The retrospective case report by Chen et al., however, still suggests that there is no evidence of intrauterine infection. 10 As of February 20, 2020, there were 3 neonatal cases in China. 1 The first case was a 17-day-old male newborn, who contracted the infection via contact with his parents, who have had fever and cough for 3 days. 11 The baby, also from Wuhan, was found to have runny nose and vomiting for one week before he was brought to the hospital. He was then tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by a throat swab test. The initial WBC count was 7660/mm 3 (neutrophil 15% and lymphocyte 73%). Chest CT showed mildly increased bilateral linear opacities.

In several reports from India, pregnant women had a higher case-fatality rate and a sevenfold increased risk of a severe hemorrhagic type of smallpox compared with nonpregnant adults [47] . Rates of spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, and preterm delivery are very high among women who have smallpox [46] . In addition, congenital cases of smallpox have been reported [46] . Therefore, the potential impact that an intentional attack with smallpox in the United States would have specifically on pregnant women is particularly concerning.","\u2022 Neonates born to mothers with potential SARS close contact are considered to be potentially infectious until 10 days postpartum \u2022 Preliminary testing for SARS is performed on the neonate only if mother or neonate has symptoms or signs of SARS \u2022 If the mother remains asymptomatic, consider discharge of the neonate with the mother Communications \u2022 Parents and family are counselled to look for symptoms and signs of SARS in the mother and newborn, especially in the first 10 days following delivery, and to report to any findings to the health care team SUMMARY SARS, a life-threatening respiratory illness caused by a novel coronavirus, was responsible for a worldwide outbreak in 2003. SARS has been responsible for serious illness in over 250 Canadians and for 43 deaths since 2003. Given the highly infectious nature of SARS, diagnosis, treatment and containment procedures must be aggressively pursued in all medical communities to prevent epidemic spread. Special consideration must be given to the labour and delivery ward where mothers, their babies, and families are potentially placed at risk by exposure to an infected individual. In addition, special procedures must be instituted to protect labour and delivery personnel, who may have prolonged contact with labouring women and substantial exposure to body fluids at the time delivery and neonatal resuscitation. This document outlines a suggested management strategy for pregnant patients with SARS on the labour and delivery ward. This protocol may be of use for other emerging life-threatening infectious diseases.","In conclusion, our report showed pregnant women are also susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection. SARS-CoV-2 may increase health risks to both mothers and infants during pregnancy. Efforts should be taken to reduce the infection rate of SARS-CoV-2 both in pregnant and perinatal period, and more intensive attention should be paid to pregnant patients.","Aerosol transmission might also be a way of transmission. In addition, researchers also detected SARS-CoV-2 in the samples of stool, gastrointestinal tract, saliva and urine. Based on bioinformatics evidence indicated that digestive tract might be a potential route of SARS-CoV-2 infection [23] . Consistently, SARS-CoV-2 RNA was also dectected in gastrointestinal tissues from COVID-19 patients [24] . Moreover, SARS-CoV-2 was detected in the tears and conjunctival secretions of covid-19 patients [25] . Meanwhile, a retrospective study based nine pregnant women with COVID-19 had for the first time indicated that the possibility of intrauterine vertical transmission between mothers and infants in the late pregnancy was temporarily excluded [26] . However, available data on pregnant women infected with SARS-CoV-2 were inadequate, and hence further studies are required to verify the potential vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in pregnant women.","A second type of primary prevention is antimicrobial prophylaxis, often referred to as chemoprophylaxis. Use of effective chemoprophylaxis requires that the infectious agent be susceptible to the antimicrobial drug used. As a primary prevention strategy, it may be used before or after exposure to prevent infection. Examples of chemoprophylaxis in the postexposure setting include erythromycin after exposure to pertussis; rifampin after N. meningitidis; amantadine, rimantadine, zanamir, or oseltamivir after influenza A virus; and zidovudine after HIV exposure. Use of antiretroviral drugs by HIV-infected pregnant women has been shown to substantially reduce the risk of perinatal HIV infection. 128 Prophylaxis against surgical wound infections with broad-spectrum coverage before surgery and prophylaxis of neonates against ophthalmia neonatorum are examples of chemoprophylaxis used in the hospital setting. In such situations, chemoprophylaxis is origin, socioeconomic status, and geographic location. For example, persons born outside the United States are at increased risk for infectious diseases such as tuberculosis and for being chronic carriers of infections such as hepatitis B. Screening programs targeted to these populations, with subsequent interventions such as isoniazid prophylaxis for persons with M. tuberculosis infection or immunization of susceptible household contacts of HBV carriers, can serve as important community-based strategies to prevent infectious disease occurrence. [115] [116] [117] Another example of defining risk at the community level is assessing behavior that increases the risk for specific diseases, such as injection drug use as a risk behavior for acquiring HIV or HCV infection. Education and drug treatment programs targeted to this population can serve as an important disease prevention and control strategy. Finally, assessing the population of species-specific mosquitoes and viability of local breeding sites can provide a risk assessment of the likelihood of vector-borne disease transmission (e.g., West Nile virus infection). 118, 119 In developing control programs, the feasibility of a strategy also needs to be assessed. Feasibility is dependent on the sociodemographic factors of the population involved. For example, high immunization rates can clearly prevent the occurrence of infectious diseases. In the United States, immunizations should be readily available; however, in the late 1980s, numerous large outbreaks of measles occurred in U.S. inner-city populations because of low immunization rates. 120 A variety of sociodemographic factors contributed to these low rates, such as inadequate access to medical care and other barriers to immunization. Until such barriers are removed and control strategies are developed to specifically target at-risk populations, adequate control of vaccinepreventable diseases in the United States cannot be accomplished. 121 Cost and availability of resources also need to be considered when developing control strategies. Adequate water treatment facilities and distribution systems in developing countries would do much to eliminate the spread of cholera. However, in many countries, resources to build and develop such facilities are not available. Consequently, control strategies need to be focused on simpler, less expensive methods, such as boiling water or improving water storage in the home.","Fulminant hepatitis is a complication of both HSV1 and HSV2 infection. 83 Organ transplantation and treatment of hematologic malignancies are the most frequent underlying predispositions. [84] [85] [86] Other individuals at risk include neonates, patients taking steroids, HIV-infected patients, and patients with cancer or myelodysplastic syndromes. 83,85-90 Fatal HSVrelated hepatitis has also rarely been reported in immunocompetent adults. 91 HSV-related hepatitis has high mortality (&gt;80%) and resembles septic endotoxic shock; jaundice is not always present. 85 in the EBV nuclear antigen-3 genes, two types of EBV have been identified 102 that show divergent prevalence throughout the world: in Western countries, EBV1 is 10 times more prevalent than EBV2, whereas in Africa, the two EBV genomes are distributed equally. 103 Because few pregnant women are susceptible, intrauterine EBV infection is rare but in isolated cases may lead to diverse congenital anomalies, including biliary atresia. 104 In infants and young children, primary infection is common and frequently asymptomatic, whereas in adults, it results in the infectious mononucleosis syndrome, which begins with malaise, headache, and low-grade fever before more specific symptoms such as pharyngitis/tonsillitis, swelling of the cervical lymph nodes, and moderate to high-grade fever develop. 105 Patients have peripheral blood lymphocytosis with characteristic large abnormal lymphocytes in their blood smears. Nausea, vomiting, and anorexia are common findings and probably reflect the mild hepatitis that accompanies infectious mononucleosis fever in approximately 90% of patients. Liver histology shows diffuse lymphocytic infiltrates in the sinusoids, and focal apoptotic hepatocytes can occasionally be seen ( Fig. 34-3, A) . 106, 107 These infiltrates may be atypical and must then be carefully differentiated from leukemia/lymphoma. Nonnecrotic hepatic granulomas are occasionally detected in treatment are risk factors for this complication. 100 In severe VZV infection, hepatic lesions are similar to herpes simplex hepatitis, with massive liver necrosis and inclusion bodies but little inflammation. Electron microscopy and immunohistochemistry reveal abundant VZV. The diagnosis is best made by PCR, 93 and treatment and prophylaxis are similar to that for HSV, with acyclovir also being effective against VZV. In addition, VZV has been reported to trigger severe autoimmune hepatitis. 101","Women were matched on sex, age, timing of contracting SARS, health care worker status, 173 underlying illness and whether the woman resided in a housing area where there was a large 174 outbreak. Pregnancy appeared to have no effect on clinical symptoms or time to presentation 175 after symptom onset. However, complications and adverse outcomes were more common among 176 pregnant women: women who were pregnant had a longer hospital stay, were statistically 177 significantly more likely to develop renal failure, sepsis, and DIC, and were more likely to 178 require intensive care unit admission. Forty percent of pregnant women required mechanical 179 ventilation, compared to 13% of non-pregnant patients (p=0.07). Pregnant women were also 180 significantly more likely to die (p=0.01). 181 We identified five reports of additional cases of SARS during pregnancy treated in Hong 182 Kong (n=2), United States (n=2), and Canada (n=1). [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] Two of the five women required mechanical ventilation, one required hemodialysis for acute renal failure, and one had seizures 184 and positive cerebrospinal fluid for SARS-CoV, suggestive of a central nervous system infection.","Severe acute respiratory syndrome SARS is an acute viral infection with a novel coronavirus [17, 18] , which in 2003 caused outbreaks of more than 50 cases in 6 countries, but affected 25 countries [19] . The largest case series of pregnant women comes from Hong Kong, where 12 pregnant women who had SARS were hospitalized in 2003 [20] [21] [22] [23] . Three of the 12 pregnant patients who had SARS died, for a case-fatality rate of 25%. Among the 7 women who presented in their first trimester of pregnancy, 4 had spontaneous abortions between 2 and 5 weeks after onset of illness, and 2 electively terminated their pregnancies after recovery from SARS. Among the 5 women who presented in the late second or third trimesters, 4 had preterm deliveries, with 3 patients delivered by emergency cesarean section due to inadequate maternal oxygenation and 1 due to fetal distress. Two patients had evidence of intrauterine growth restriction and oligohydramnios. Six patients were admitted to the intensive care unit [22] . Among the five newborn infants, there was no evidence of clinical or serologic evidence of perinatal transmission, as assessed by SARS-associated coronavirus reverse-transcriptase PCR and viral culture on cord blood, placenta tissue, and amniotic fluid [21] . A matched study in Hong Kong [20] comparing the clinical course and outcomes of 10 pregnant SARS patients with 40 nonpregnant controls found that pregnant and non-pregnant patients had similar clinical symptoms and presentation, but that pregnant patients had evidence of more severe illness. Pregnant patients were more likely to require endotracheal intubation and admission to the intensive care unit, and they were more likely to develop renal failure and disseminated intravascular coagulopathy compared with nonpregnant patients. There were three deaths among the pregnant patients compared, with no deaths in the nonpregnant group.","A review of pregnant women infected with COVID-19 revealed that pregnant women are not at increased risk of poor outcomes when compared to the general adult population (47) , and there seems to be no evidence of vertical transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus from mother to baby during birth or during breastfeeding at present (20, 47) . All the women who gave birth with COVID-19 had cesarean sections, so there is no data about vertical transmission for women who are infected earlier in the pregnancy or who deliver vaginally. More studies are clearly warranted to examine the potential impact of COVID-19 on pregnancy.","The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03. 10.20033605 doi: medRxiv preprint As suggested by Favre et al, [19] vaginal delivery could be considered for the benefit of patients, when there is a labor room properly equipped for airborne precautions. All healthcare workers in close contacts should strictly adhere to contact and airborne precautions in addition to standard precautions. Similar to two previous reports of nine and one pregnant women with confirmed COVID-19 infection [7, 20] , we did not find any evidence to support the vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from mother to fetus via placenta or during cesarean section. Our study also added some evidence to suggest that the risk of vertical transmission during vaginal delivery might also be trivial. There were two patients with vaginal delivery, one was two days before the onset of symptoms and another was during the course of illness. Neither of their newborns had respiratory systems after birth. Unfortunately, none of them gave us the consent to collect the respiratory specimens of their neonates. Given the small sample size of our study, the possibility of vertical transmission during vaginal delivery still cannot be ruled out.","These findings suggest that the hospital environment could potentially be a source of virus spread, including among HCWs, patients, and visitors. It is noteworthy that the hospital surface samples were collected from February 7 to February 27, 2020, which was after human-to-human spread of SARS-CoV-2 was identified. It is plausible to assume that the hospital surface contamination would have been more severe before the sampling period, when environmental cleaning protocols were not as extensive and isolation practices that should be implemented rapidly. In addition, pregnant women and neonates are highly susceptible populations. They are more sensitive to the chemicals released by the internal infection control processes. It is, therefore, a standardize procedure to lessen the intensity and to reduce frequency of the internal infection control processes in the department, which may have led to the high positive detection rates discovered from our study. It was not surprising that the Fever Clinic had a low positive detection rate for SARS-CoV-2 (6.5%). Early on, the Fever Clinic was relocated to a semi-open area, .

More evidence is needed to develop effective preventive and clinical strategies. The latest research by Huijun Chen and colleagues 5 reported in The Lancet provides some insight into the clinical characteristics, pregnancy outcomes, and vertical transmission potential of COVID19 infection in pregnant women. Although the study analysed only a small number of cases (nine women with confirmed COVID19 pneumonia), under such emergent circum stances these findings are valuable for preventive and clinical practice in China and elsewhere. Although neonatal nasopharyngeal swab samples have been collected in some hospitals across China, this study also collected and tested amniotic fluid, cord blood, and breastmilk samples for the presence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARSCoV2), thus allowing a more detailed assessment of the vertical transmission potential of COVID19 infection.","In this study, we reported a case series of pregnant women with Covid-19 and newborns born to these women. The primary composite endpoint occurred in one (3%) pregnant woman who needed the use of mechanical ventilation, while no pregnant women admitted to the ICU or died. For the secondary outcomes, the percentages of pregnant women with mild, moderate, and severe symptoms were 13 (39.4%),19(57.6%), and 1(3%). One (3.6%) newborn developed ARDS and was admitted to the NICU. There were no moralities among newborns.","Severe acute respiratory syndrome is a highly infectious disease with high rates of morbidity and mortality. The major therapeutic modalities in its treatment have been empirical. Critically, affected pregnant women had to be treated with potentially teratogenic drugs. The most commonly used firstline medications during the outbreak were ribavirin and corticosteroids [5, 8, 9] . Ribavirin has an FDA pregnancy category X, indicating high teratogenic probability based on consistent animal studies and biological plausibility. Hence, the drug is contraindicated in women who are or may become pregnant. If the use of ribavirin is considered critical by the physician, the pregnant patient should be made aware of the potential teratogenic effects of ribavirin and the limited information on its use in human pregnancy. While concerns of teratogenicity are higher in the first trimester during organogenesis, ribavirin may theoretically also cause functional defect even after the first trimester [17] . The manufacturer (Schering Corp. http://www.ribavirinpregnancyregistry.com) maintains a registry of pregnancy-related exposures and advises all women to wait 6 months following discontinuation of ribavirin before attempting to get pregnant.","As Yu and colleagues 3 reported, five pregnant women were treated with steroids after caesarean section. Two were also treated with traditional Chinese medicine. However, no reliable evidence recommends any specific COVID-19 treatment for pregnant women. WHO guidance and some clinical evidence does not recommend the use of corticosteroids for COVID-19. 4, 5 Use of drugs in pregnant women needs to be on the basis of solid evidence. Clinical trials are needed to prove the effectiveness of drugs and the effects on the fetus to establish a standardised treatment for pregnant women with COVID-19. More evidence of the safety of traditional Chinese medicine is also warranted.","During the anthrax attacks of 2001, which resulted in 22 cases and five deaths [38] , guidelines were rapidly developed and disseminated to address prophylaxis for exposed persons as well as recommendations for treatment. Both the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) and the CDC recommend that pregnant women who have a high-risk environmental exposure should receive prophylaxis [43, 44] ; however, decisions about whether an exposure is risky enough to merit prophylaxis for a pregnant woman should be made by public health officials, not by the woman's obstetrician-gynecologist or other care provider [44] . The first-line regimen for prophylaxis of pregnant women should be a 60-day course of ciprofloxacin. If the specific strain of B anthracis is found to be penicillin-sensitive, then a switch to amoxicillin may be considered. Due to effects on fetal bone and dental enamel, doxycycline, the other first-line agent for anthrax prophylaxis among nonpregnant adults, should be used with caution in asymptomatic pregnant women, and only when contraindications proscribe use of other drugs. If doxycycline is used in pregnant women, periodic liver function testing should be performed because of the small increased risk of maternal hepatic necrosis. Although anthrax vaccine supplies are currently limited, anthrax vaccination has been proposed as an adjunct to microbial prophylaxis for optimal postexposure prophylaxis [38] ; however, there are no animal or human safely studies of the anthrax vaccine during pregnancy, and the vaccine is not recommended for use in pregnancy [45] . For initial therapy of inhalational anthrax among nonpregnant adults, intravenous ciprofloxacin or doxycycline, along with one or two additional agents, is recommended [38] . For pregnant women, the recommendations for treatment are similar to those of nonpregnant adults, although ciprofloxacin would be generally preferable to doxycycline.","Due to physiologic changes that occur in pregnancy, when compared with their non-pregnant counterparts, pregnant women with lower respiratory tract infections often experience worse outcomes, including higher rates of hospital and intensive care unit admission. [3] Since 2002 there have been two other global outbreaks of highly-pathogenic coronaviruses: severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). While SARS and MERS are not identical to SARS-CoV-2 in their genetic structures or clinical manifestations, the recent outbreaks of these viruses may provide insights on the effects of COVID-19 in the context of pregnancy. The literature on SARS and MERS in pregnancy are limited to a handful of case reports and series. [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9] Many of these cases involved severe morbidity including the need for intensive care and cardiorespiratory support. Notably, there were cases of maternal mortality associated with SARS and MERS infection. The only published case-control study showed that pregnant women with SARS experienced worse outcomes than nonpregnant women of similar age. [10] Reports varied with respect to the effects of SARS and MERS on pregnancy outcomes. Spontaneous abortion has been reported among women infected with SARS and MERS in the first trimester.4 As well, stillbirth, intrauterine growth restriction, and preterm birth have been reported in pregnancies affected by SARS and MERS in the second and third trimesters. [4, 9] It is important to note, however, that a number of pregnancies had good outcomes despite maternal infection with SARS or MERS. [6, 7, 8] Broadly speaking, and drawing upon our knowledge of other respiratory illnesses in pregnancy, adverse It remains to be seen whether the effects of COVID-19 on pregnant women and their fetuses will be similar to those of SARS and MERS. To date, the reported case-fatality rate for the general population infected with COVID-19 is lower than that of either SARS or MERS (estimated at 1%-2% vs. 9%-10% and 35%-40%, respectively). Similarly, by now, there have been over 60 cases of pregnant women with confirmed COVID-19 in China and the vast majority of these women have had mild to moderate pneumonia. [11, 12, 13, 14] To date here has been one case of severe maternal morbidity secondary to COVID-19 reported. [12] This 31-year-old woman was infected at 34 weeks gestation and went on to experience severe respiratory compromise and multi-organ dysfunction requiring extra-corporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). The pregnancy outcomes of the reported cases have been largely good, [11, 12, 13] with spontaneous and iatrogenic preterm labour being the most commonly reported adverse pregnancy outcomes. One stillbirth has been reported and this occurred in the case of severe maternal illness reported by Liu et al. [12] Given the limited data, it is too early to determine if higher rates of adverse outcomes are expected in pregnant women infected with COVID-19. As with SARS and MERS, pregnancy outcomes are likely to be strongly correlated with degree of maternal illness. [12] There has been no evidence of vertical (mother-to-infant) transmission found in any cases of SARS, MERS, or COVID-19. Additionally, analyses of amniotic fluid, serum, placenta, and breastmilk from pregnant women confirmed to have SARS or COVID-19 infection have found no detectable viral RNA, [8, 13] further supporting that vertical transmission is unlikely. Importantly, maternal infection with SARS, MERS, or COVID-19 has not been associated with teratogenicity. However, because of the small number of reported cases of infection during the first trimester (when embryogenesis occurs), risk of congenital anomaly associated with COVID-19 cannot be completely excluded.","Our data showed a down-trend in the number of parturients with COVID-19, which implied the importance of proper home quarantine and personal protection to reduce exposure, and ultimately reduced the chance of COVID-19 infection in pregnant women. Besides, the delivery of infected parturients to designated hospitals was to ensure the safety of the pregnant women and their newborns, while preventing and controlling newborns' infection with SARS-Cov-2. Potential multi-target organ damage caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection in pregnant women may increase the chance of COVID-19 parturients received caesarean section. Taken more precaution care for those patients are necessary. Cesarean delivery increased the risk of microenvironmental aerosols. Consequently, the fetus should be cleaned of amniotic fluid and blood from the mouth and nose and then transferred to incubator rapidly after delivery to reduce neonatal infection. Additionally, SARS-CoV-2 virus may also invade the central nervous system, indicating that the risk of maternal nervous system injury cannot be ignored. While, none was diagnosed with postpartum depression in the present study, which might be attributed to the implementation of multimode analgesia management in our patient population 17 .","Five women had ongoing pregnancy without severe obstetrical complications at the time of manuscript preparation. The overall rate of obstetrical complications was 22.2%, including three cases of preterm premature rupture of membranes, two cases of hypertensive diseases of the pregnancy, two cases of gestational diabetes mellitus, and one case of spontaneous preterm labor. Therefore, the obstetrical outcomes from pregnant women with SARS-CoV-2 infection appear better than that for pregnant women with SARS. However, it's worth noting that most pregnant women were infected with SARS-CoV-2 during the third trimester in this study. The gestational age when women are infected may affect obstetrical outcomes.","A highly active attenuated live-vaccine is available, which induces seroconversion rates &gt;95% and provides a high level of protection. Due to potential risks associated with a live virus vaccine children below the age of 9 months, pregnant women and immunosuppressed individuals should not receive the vaccine, nor should subjects be vaccinated who are allergic to egg proteins. Infrequently two serious vaccine-related complications may occur: a form of encephalitis termed yellow fever-associated neurotropic disease and a syndrome resembling natural infection designated as yellow fever vaccine-associated viscerotropic disease.","Management of active pulmonary tuberculosis during pregnancy is similar to that in nonpregnant women. INH, rifampin, and ethambutol (EMB) should be used in initial treatment regimens. If local prevalence of isolates that are resistant to INH is high, pyrazinamide should be added to this regimen until the results of susceptibility testing are available. These medications cross the placenta, but were not shown to have teratogenic effects [25] . Women who are being treated can breastfeed. Although these medications are found in breast milk, the amount of drug does not reach therapeutic levels, and is not sufficient for treatment of the newborn [79] . Pregnant and postpartum women should receive pyridoxine. Table 1 lists the medications that are used in the treatment of tuberculosis. INH dosing can be daily or two to three times per week. Side effects include aminotransferase elevations, hepatitis, peripheral neurotoxicity, and a lupuslike syndrome. Hepatitis seems to be more common in pregnant patients who take INH; thus, liver enzymes should be evaluated frequently and pyridoxine should be administered. The dose of pyridoxine in prenatal vitamins can vary, and generally, the dose is inadequate for this purpose. Rifampin also is a first-line agent with dosing once daily or two to three times per week. Side effects include rash, nausea/vomiting, and hepatitis. Patients must be warned that rifampin will turn urine, sweat, sputum, and tears orange [80, 81] . EMB is a first-line drug for treating all forms of tuberculosis. It is included in initial treatment regimens, primarily to prevent emergence of rifampin resistance when primary resistance to INH may be present. Adverse effects include retrobulbar neuritis, peripheral neuritis (rare), and skin reactions that require discontinuation of the drug. EMB is considered safe for use in pregnancy [25] . Pyrazinamide is a first-line agent that is highly active against dormant and semidormant bacterial populations [82] . Hepatotoxicity that is attributable to standard doses of pyrazinamide (PZA) occurs in approximately 1% of cases [83] . Mild anorexia and nausea are common. Transient morbilliform rash also can occur but usually is self-limited. There is little information about the safety of PZA in pregnancy. The benefits of PZA may outweigh the possible risks in areas in which drug-resistant tuberculosis is endemic [84, 85] . Streptomycin should be avoided in pregnancy because of an increased risk of congenital deafness.","Therapy should be based on a step approach. 15 Mild intermittent asthma is best managed with inhaled short-acting \u03b2 2 -agonists, for symptomatic relief. Asthma that causes more than occasional symptoms should be treated daily with anti-inflammatory therapy, with the preferred choice being inhaled corticosteroids. Budesonide is the best studied and hence preferred, although substantive safety data exist for beclomethasone as well. Alternative therapies include cromolyn, sustained-release theophylline, or a leukotriene antagonist. 15 Frequent need for short-acting \u03b2 2 -agonists should prompt institution of, or an increase in, the use of anti-inflammatory agents to treat, rather than to mask, a deteriorating clinical course. Long-acting \u03b2-agonists should only be used concurrently with long-acting inhaled corticosteroids. 21 Finally, the addition of rapidly tapered courses of oral corticosteroids should be considered for those with acute severe asthma or patients with active symptoms who are already using inhaled steroids and \u03b2-agonists. Daily or alternate-day oral steroid administration (e.g., prednisone 40 mg/day) is sometimes required. 15 Extensive practice algorithms have been made available by the NAEPP Working Group on Asthma and Pregnancy. 15 A large body of literature has examined the topic of possible teratogenicity of agents used in the pharmacotherapy of asthma in pregnancy. In general, the risks of poorly controlled asthma far outweigh the possible hazards of drug therapy. Both animal and human studies of \u03b2 2 -agonists, administered either by inhalation or systemically, have strated good maternal and neonatal outcome in women with CF. [34] [35] [36] Premature delivery was more common in women with worse baseline FEV 1 , and gestational diabetes was common. In a large U.S. review of 680 gravid women with CF enrolled in the U.S. Cystic Fibrosis Foundation National Patient Registry, from 1985 to 1997, survival was actually better in the gravid group than in the matched 3327 control patients with CF. 37 Women with CF who became pregnant had higher predicted percentages of FEV 1 and higher weights. Pregnancy was not clearly harmful in any subgroup, after severity adjustment for age, Pseudomonas aeruginosa colonization, pancreatic function, and FEV 1 .","The outcomes of the pregnant women were good. There were no intesive care unit admissions for mothers throughout the study period, including before and after delivery. At the end of follow-up (March 12, 2020), all patients had been discharged from the hospital per the following discharge criteria: body temperature returned to normal for more than 3 days; respiratory symptoms improved significantly; pulmonary imaging showed a significant improvement in acute exudative lesions; and nucleic acid test of respiratory specimens such as results of sputum and nasopharyngeal swabs were negative twice in a row (sampling interval \u226524 h). The neonatal birthweights and Apgar scores were normal. Four infants were taken home and were not tested for SARS-CoV-2; no fever, pathological jaundice, or other symptoms were reported during the follow-up call at 28 days after birth. Another three infants remained for observation in the neonatology department and were tested for SARS-CoV-2. Nucleic acid test for the throat swab of one neonate (child of patient 1) was positive at 36 h after birth; nucleic acid tests for the other two were negative. Subsequently, this infected neonate was transferred to Wuhan Children's Hospital, a designated hospital for children infected with COVID-19. After admission, the neonate had no fever and cough, with mild shortness of breath symptoms. Chest x-ray revealed mild pulmonary infection. The shortness of breath relieved quickly under neonatal care and monitoring. The neonate was discharged after 2 weeks following two consecutive negative nucleic acid test results. At 28 days after birth, the remaining three neonates were healthy and had no respiratory symptoms or fever (table 2) ."],"title":["Management of pregnant women infected with COVID-19","Clinical characteristics and intrauterine vertical transmission potential of COVID-19 infection in nine pregnant women: a retrospective review of medical records","What are the risks of COVID-19 infection in pregnant women?","Clinical features and obstetric and neonatal outcomes of pregnant patients with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China: a retrospective, single-centre, descriptive study","Abstracts accepted for publication only","Hand hygiene and the novel coronavirus pandemic: The role of healthcare workers","Clinical features and obstetric and neonatal outcomes of pregnant patients with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China: a retrospective, single-centre, descriptive study","Management of pregnant women infected with COVID-19","Management of pregnant women infected with COVID-19","Clinical characteristics and intrauterine vertical transmission potential of COVID-19 infection in nine pregnant women: a retrospective review of medical records","Emerging Infections and Pregnancy: West Nile Virus, Monkeypox, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, and Bioterrorism","Why are pregnant women susceptible to COVID-19?
