In 2001, researchers in The Netherlands reported the discovery of a previously unidentified pathogen called human metapneumovirus (hMPV). Since its initial description, hMPV has been associated with ARTI in Europe (Italy, France, Spain, the UK, Germany, Denmark, Finland and Norway), America (the USA, Canada, Argentina and Brazil), Asia (India, Japan, China and Singapore), Australia and South Africa in individuals of all ages. The incidence of infection varies from 1.5% to 25%, indicating that hMPV is a ubiquitous virus with a worldwide distribution. hMPV seems to play an important role as a cause of paediatric upper and lower respiratory tract infection, with similar, but not identical, epidemiological and clinical features to those of respiratory syncytial virus and influenza virus. Moreover, the socio-economic impa...","This paper examines the role of various socioeconomic factors in mediating the local and cross-city transmissions of the novel coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) in China. We implement a machine learning approach to select instrumental variables that strongly predict virus transmission among the rich exogenous weather characteristics. Our 2SLS estimates show that the stringent quarantine, massive lockdown and other public health measures imposed in late January significantly reduced the transmission rate of COVID-19. By early February, the virus spread had been contained. While many socioeconomic factors mediate the virus spread, a robust government response since late January played a determinant role in the containment of the virus. We also demonstrate that the actual population flow from the outbreak source poses a higher risk to the destination than other factors such as geographic proximity and similarity in economic conditions. The results have rich implications for ongoing global effor...","The recent outbreak of COVID-19 in Mainland China is characterized by a distinctive algebraic, sub-exponential increase of confirmed cases with time during the early phase of the epidemic, contrasting an initial exponential growth expected for an unconstrained outbreak with sufficiently large reproduction rate. Although case counts vary significantly between affected provinces in Mainland China, the scaling law t^\u03bc is surprisingly universal, with a range of exponents \u03bc = 2.1 \u00b1 0.3. The universality of this behavior indicates that, in spite of social, regional, demographical, geographical, and socio-economical heterogeneities of affected Chinese provinces, this outbreak is dominated by fundamental mechanisms that are not captured by standard epidemiological models. We show that the observed scaling law is a direct consequence of containment policies that effectively deplete the susceptible population. To this end we introduce a parsimonious model that captures both, quarantine of sympto...","The disease known as coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19), potentially caused by an outbreak of the severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in Wuhan, China, has hit the world hard, and has led to an unprecedent health and economic crisis. In order to develop treatment options able to stop or ameliorate SARS-CoV-2 effects, we need to understand the biology of the virus inside cells, but this kind of studies are still scarce. A recent study investigated translatome and proteome host cell changes induced in vitro by SARS-CoV-2. In the present study, we use the publicly available proteomics data from this study to re-analyze the mechanisms altered by the virus infection by impact pathways analysis and network analysis. Proteins linked to inflammatory response, but also proteins related to chromosome segregation during mitosis, were found to be regulated. The up-regulation of the inflammatory-related proteins observed could be linked to the propagation of inflammatory reac...","Two months after the emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the possibility of established and widespread community transmission in the European Union and European Economic Area (EU/EEA) is becoming more likely. We provide scenarios for use in preparedness for a possible widespread epidemic. The EU/EEA is moving towards the \u2018limited sustained transmission\u2019 phase. We propose actions to prepare for potential mitigation phases and coordinate efforts to protect the health of citizens.","Background China is running a national level antivirus campaign against the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). Strict control measures are being enforced in either the populated areas and remote regions. While the virus is closed to be under control, tremendous economic loss has been caused. Methods and findings We assessed the pandemic risk of 2019-nCoV for all cities/regions in China using the random forest algorithm, taking into account the effect of five factors: the accumulative and increased numbers of confirmed cases, total population, population density, and GDP. We defined four levels of the risk, corresponding to the four response levels to public health emergencies in China. The classification system has good consistency among cities in China, as the error rate of the confusion matrix is 1.58%. Conclusions The pandemic risk of 2019-nCoV is dramatically different among the 442 cities/regions. We recommend to adopt proportionate control policy according to the risk level to reduce...","Abstract We present here the proceedings of the 5th seminar on emerging infectious diseases, held in Paris on March 22nd, 2016, with seven priority proposals that can be outlined as follows: encourage research on the prediction, screening and early detection of new risks of infection; develop research and surveillance concerning transmission of pathogens between animals and humans, with their reinforcement in particular in intertropical areas (\u201chot-spots\u201d) via public support; pursue aid development and support in these areas of prevention and training for local health personnel, and foster risk awareness in the population; ensure adapted patient care in order to promote adherence to treatment and to epidemic propagation reduction measures; develop greater awareness and better education among politicians and healthcare providers, in order to ensure more adapted response to new types of crises; modify the logic of governance, drawing from all available modes of communication and incorpor...","As the Coronavirus (COVID-19) expands its impact from China, expanding its catchment into surrounding regions and other countries, increased national and international measures are being taken to contain the outbreak. The placing of entire cities in \u2018lockdown\u2019 directly affects urban economies on a multi-lateral level, including from social and economic standpoints. This is being emphasised as the outbreak gains ground in other countries, leading towards a global health emergency, and as global collaboration is sought in numerous quarters. However, while effective protocols in regard to the sharing of health data is emphasised, urban data, on the other hand, specifically relating to urban health and safe city concepts, is still viewed from a nationalist perspective as solely benefiting a nation\u2019s economy and its economic and political influence. This perspective paper, written one month after detection and during the outbreak, surveys the virus outbreak from an urban standpoint and adva...","Abstract Human coronavirus, hCoV-19, is highly pathogenic with severe pneumonia associated with rapid virus replication. Arising in Wuhan China December 2019, the current COVID-19 epidemic has rapidly grown with person-to-person infection expanding to become a global health emergency now on pandemic scale. In mitigation of this current COVID-19 pandemic, according to Anderson et al. 2020 [1], governments will not be able to minimise both deaths from COVID-19 and the economic impact of viral spread. Keeping mortality as low as possible will be the highest priority for individuals; hence governments must put in place measures to ameliorate the inevitable economic downturn. The current global picture shows small chains of transmission in many countries and large chains resulting in extensive spread in a few countries, such as Italy, Iran, South Korea, and Japan. Most countries are likely to have spread of COVID-19, at least in the early stages, before any mitigation measures have an impac...","Abstract An increase in on-farm mortality (euthanasia and death) in dairy herds has been reported in several countries in the last decade. This does not only imply possible problems with animal welfare, but it also causes economic losses to the farmer. The objective of this study was to evaluate time trends in on-farm dairy cow mortality in Sweden and identify potential herd-level risk factors. Data were retrieved on all Swedish dairy herds enrolled in the milk recording scheme between 2002 and 2010. Herds with a herd size of &lt;20 cows or a mortality rate (MR) of &gt;40 dead or euthanized cows per 100 cow-years were excluded. Two different models were used: 1 multiple-year analysis, which included 6,898 herds during the period 2002 to 2010 and 1 single-year analysis including 4,252 herds for the year 2010, where other variables that were not present during the entire multiple year study were analyzed. The outcome variable was the number of euthanized and dead cows per year and season. A ne...","An outbreak of the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19 respiratory disease, has infected over 290,000 people since the end of 2019, killed over 12,000, and caused worldwide social and economic disruption. There are currently no antiviral drugs with proven efficacy nor are there vaccines for its prevention. Unfortunately, the scientific community has little knowledge of the molecular details of SARS-CoV-2 infection. To illuminate this, we cloned, tagged and expressed 26 of the 29 viral proteins in human cells and identified the human proteins physically associated with each using affinity-purification mass spectrometry (AP-MS), which identified 332 high confidence SARS-CoV-2-human protein-protein interactions (PPIs). Among these, we identify 67 druggable human proteins or host factors targeted by 69 existing FDA-approved drugs, drugs in clinical trials and/or preclinical compounds, that we are currently evaluating for efficacy in live SARS-CoV-2 infection assay...","Abstract Farmers attempting to reduce first-calving age (FCA) need to understand which rearing management factors influence FCA and first-lactation milk production (FLP). Reduced FCA might be associated with lower FLP. This study describes the association between herd FCA, FLP, and several herd-level health and rearing management variables and describes the association between FCA and FLP at the cow level. It uses data from a 2010 survey of 100 Dutch dairy farms about general management, colostrum and milk feeding, housing, cleanliness, healthcare, disease, and breeding. It also used available data on FCA and 305-d FLP at both cow and herd level. The associations between median FCA and median FLP of the herd and herd-level health and rearing management variables were determined using multivariate regression analysis. The median FCA was associated with minimum age of first insemination, feeding of waste milk, and the amount of milk given preweaning. The median FLP was associated with me...","The cumulative incidence of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) cases is showing similar trends in European Union/European Economic Area countries and the United Kingdom confirming that, while at a different stage depending on the country, the COVID-19 pandemic is progressing rapidly in all countries. Based on the experience from Italy, countries, hospitals and intensive care units should increase their preparedness for a surge of patients with COVID-19 who will require healthcare, and in particular intensive care.","","Widespread, non-stop, and often sensational coverage of the coronavirus (COVID-19) has caught many governments flat-footed in efforts to protect the health and safety of their citizens. In response to the current global health event, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic. Mass gatherings present a historic challenge in protecting the health and safety of attendees. The majority of the prominent mass gatherings are religious in nature. Global sporting events, such as the Olympics and the World Cup, pose unique health risks to attendees and host nations. Deferment or cancellation of such mass gatherings may exert an extraordinary economic loss to the host nation. Universal adoption of best practices for infection control is the surest way for governments to prepare for mass gatherings. In these uncertain times, it is up to intergovernmental organizations to be the voice of reason.","We investigate the effects of social distancing in controlling the impact of the Covid-19 epidemic using a simple SIR epidemic model. We show that an alternative or complementaryapproach based on targeted isolation of the vulnerable subpopulation may provide a moreefficient and robust strategy at a lower economic and social cost within a shorter timeframe.","","Abstract Medicine shortages have been spreading in European countries. In many cases, the unavailability of medicinal products has a substantial impact on the capability of National Healthcare Systems in ensuring the continuity of care. Shortages originate from multifactorial causes. In particular, they can be due to supply-related factors (e.g., manufacturing issues, regulatory issues, logistics, distribution) and demand-related ones (e.g., fluctuating drug demand, parallel market, tendering, price and reimbursement policies). However, some extraordinary geopolitical events (e.g., Brexit) may also affect medicines\u2019 availability. The capability of European Regulatory Authorities and other stakeholders, which are involved in the pharmaceutical distribution chain and the healthcare assistance services, to define suitable problem-solving strategies has been limited for years by the fragmentation of the European regulatory framework, starting from the lack of a univocal definition of a med...","","The impact of the drastic reduction in travel volume within mainland China in January and February 2020 was quantified with respect to reports of novel coronavirus (COVID-19) infections outside China. Data on confirmed cases diagnosed outside China were analyzed using statistical models to estimate the impact of travel reduction on three epidemiological outcome measures: (i) the number of exported cases, (ii) the probability of a major epidemic, and (iii) the time delay to a major epidemic. From 28 January to 7 February 2020, we estimated that 226 exported cases (95% confidence interval: 86,449) were prevented, corresponding to a 70.4% reduction in incidence compared to the counterfactual scenario. The reduced probability of a major epidemic ranged from 7% to 20% in Japan, which resulted in a median time delay to a major epidemic of two days. Depending on the scenario, the estimated delay may be less than one day. As the delay is small, the decision to control travel volume through res...","The impact of the drastic reduction in travel volume within mainland China in January and February 2020 was quantified with respect to reports of novel coronavirus (COVID-19) infections outside China.

However, the risk factors leading to emergence are poorly understood, which presents a challenge in developing appropriate mitigation strategies for local communities. METHODS: Residents in rural communities of Yunnan, Guangxi and Guangdong provinces were recruited and enrolled in this study. Data were collected through ethnographic interviews and field observations, and thematically coded and analysed to identify both risk and protective factors for zoonotic disease emergence at the individual, community and policy levels. RESULTS: Eighty-eight ethnographic interviews and 55 field observations were conducted at nine selected sites. Frequent human\u2013animal interactions and low levels of environmental biosecurity in local communities were identified as risks for zoonotic disease emergence...","Abstract The impact of communicable diseases (infectious diseases) on human health is obvious. The sudden outbreak of COVID-19 (Corona Virus Disease 2019), making people realize the threat of communicable diseases to mankind. As a city composed of migrants, Zhuhai Special Economic Zone experienced great challenges brought about by COVID-19 epidemic. Experience has been acquired from all aspects. A highly reactive, multifunctional and efficient emergency management system would be established, and the significance of information communication should be fully understood in the future.","The outbreak of novel coronavirus (COVID-19) has the potential for global spread, infecting large numbers in all countries. In this case, estimating the country-specific basic reproductive ratio is a vital first step in public-health planning. The basic reproductive ratio (R0) is determined by both the nature of pathogen and the network of contacts through which the disease can spread - with this network determined by socio-demographics including age-structure and household composition. Here we focus on the age-structured transmission within the population, using data from China to inform age-dependent susceptibility and synthetic age-mixing matrices to inform the contact network. This allows us to determine the country-specific basic reproductive ratio as a multiplicative scaling of the value from China. We predict that R0 will be highest across Eastern Europe and Japan, and lowest across Africa, Central America and South-Western Asia. This pattern is largely driven by the ratio of ch...","We present a timely evaluation of the impact of lockdown on the 2019-nCov epidemic in Hubei province, China. The implementation appears to be effective in reducing about 60% of new infections and deaths, and its effect also appears to be sustainable even after its removal. Delaying its implementation reduces its effectiveness. However, the direct economic cost of such a lockdown remains to be seen and whether the model is replicable in other Chinese regions remains a matter of further investigation.","Objective: To investigate psychological and behavioral responses to the threat of SARS-CoV-2 infections and their associations with public perceptions in China Design: Cross sectional population-based telephone survey via random digital dialing between 1 and 10 February, 2020 Setting: Wuhan (the epicentre and quarantined city), and Shanghai (a typical major city with close transportation link with Wuhan) Participants: Random sample of 510 residents in Wuhan and 501 residents in Shanghai aged above 18 Main outcome measures: Anxiety (measured by the 7-item generalized anxiety disorder [GAD-7] scale), recommended and avoidance behaviors (engaged in all six behaviors such as increasing surface cleaning and reducing going out). Results: The prevalence rates of moderate or severe anxiety (score \u226510 on GAD-7) were 32.7% (n=167) among Wuhan participants and 20.4% (n=102) among Shanghai participants. 78.6% (n=401) of Wuhan participants and 63.9% (n=320) of Shanghai participants had carried out ...","Summary Several new viral respiratory tract infectious diseases with epidemic potential that threaten global health security have emerged in the past 15 years. In 2003, WHO issued a worldwide alert for an unknown emerging illness, later named severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). The disease caused by a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV) rapidly spread worldwide, causing more than 8000 cases and 800 deaths in more than 30 countries with a substantial economic impact. Since then, we have witnessed the emergence of several other viral respiratory pathogens including influenza viruses (avian influenza H5N1, H7N9, and H10N8; variant influenza A H3N2 virus), human adenovirus-14, and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). In response, various surveillance systems have been developed to monitor the emergence of respiratory-tract infections. These include systems based on identification of syndromes, web-based systems, systems that gather health data from health facilities (suc...","Objective: Establishing a social contact data sharing initiative and an interactive tool to assess mitigation strategies for COVID-19. Results: We organized data sharing of published social contact surveys via online repositories and formatting guidelines. We analyzed this social contact data in terms of weighted social contact matrices, next generation matrices, relative incidence and R0. We incorporated location-specific isolation measures (e.g. school closure or telework) and capture their effect on transmission dynamics. All methods have been implemented in an online application based on R Shiny and applied to COVID-19 with age-specific susceptibility and infectiousness. Using our online tool with the available social contact data, we illustrate that social distancing could have a considerable impact on reducing transmission for COVID-19. The effect itself depends on assumptions made about disease-specific characteristics and the choice of intervention(s). Keywords: social contact ...","Abstract A COVID-19 epidemic has been spreading in China and other parts of the world since December 2019. The epidemic has brought not only the risk of death from infection but also unbearable psychological pressure. We sampled college students from Changzhi medical college by using cluster sampling. They responded to a questionnaire packet that included the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7) and those inquiring the participants\u2019 basic information. We received 7,143 responses. Results indicated that 0.9% of the respondents were experiencing severe anxiety, 2.7% moderate anxiety, and 21.3% mild anxiety. Moreover, living in urban areas (OR = .810, 95% CI = .709 - .925), family income stability (OR = .726, 95% CI = .645 - .817) and living with parents (OR = .752, 95% CI = .596 - .950) were protective factors against anxiety. Moreover, having relatives or acquaintances infected with COVID-19 was a risk factor for increasing the anxiety of college students (OR = 3.007, 95% C...","Abstract Newcastle disease (ND) and infectious bronchitis (IB) are two major viral diseases affecting the respiratory tracts of birds and whose impact on African poultry is still poorly known. In the present study we aimed at assessing NDV and IBV prevalences in Ivory-Coast by molecular screening of &gt;22,000 avian swabs by nested PCR and by serology testing of close to 2000 avian sera from 2010 through 2012. The NDV and IBV seroprevalences over the study period reached 22% and 72%, respectively. We found 14.7% pooled swabs positive by PCR for NDV and 14.6% for IBV. Both pathogens are therefore endemic in Ivory-Coast. Economic losses associated with NDV and IBV infections still need to be evaluated.","The SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) novel coronavirus represents a significant health risk, particularly in older patients. Cancer is one of the leading causes of death in most rich countries, and delivering chemotherapy may be associated with increased risk in the presence of a pandemic infection. Estimating this risk is crucial in making decisions about balancing risks and benefits from administering chemotherapy. However, there are no specific data about chemotherapy risks per se. Here we develop a simple model to estimate the potential harms in patients undergoing chemotherapy during a COVID outbreak. We use age-related case fatality rates as a basis for estimating risk, and use previous data from risk of death during influenza outbreaks to estimate the additional risk associated with chemotherapy. We use data from randomised trials to estimate benefit across a range of curative and palliative settings, and address the balance of benefit against the risk of harm. We then use those data to es...","Problem: Due to the spread of SARS CoV-2 virus infection and COVID-2019 disease, there is an urgent need to analyze COVID-2019 epidemic perception in Poland. This would enable authorities for preparation of specific actions minimizing public health and economic risks. Methods: We study the perception of COVID-2019 epidemic in Polish society using quantitative analysis of its digital footprints on the Internet (on Twitter, Google, YouTube, Wikipedia and electronic media represented by Event Registry) from January 2020 to 12.03.2020 (before and after official introduction to Poland on 04.03.2020). To this end we utilize data mining, social network analysis, natural language processing techniques. Each examined internet platform was analyzed for representativeness and composition of the target group. Results: We identified three major cluster of the interest before disease introduction on the topic COVID-2019: China- and Italy-related peaks on all platforms, as well as a peak on social me...","Much of the uncertainty about the progression of the COVID-19 pandemic stems from questions about when and how non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPI) by governments, in particular social distancing measures, are implemented, to what extent the population complies with these measures, and how compliance changes through time. Further uncertainty comes from a lack of knowledge of the potential effects of removing interventions once the epidemic is declining. By combining an epidemiological model of COVID-19 for the United Kingdom with simple sub-models for these societal processes, this study aims to shed light on the conceivable trajectories that the pandemic might follow over the next 1.5 years. We show strong improvements in outcomes if governments review NPI more frequently whereas, in comparison, the stability of compliance has surprisingly small effects on cumulative mortality. Assuming that mortality does considerably increase once a country's hospital capacity is breached, we show...","The ongoing COVID-19 outbreak has expanded rapidly throughout China. Major behavioral, clinical, and state interventions are underway currently to mitigate the epidemic and prevent the persistence of the virus in human populations in China and worldwide. It remains unclear how these unprecedented interventions, including travel restrictions, have affected COVID-19 spread in China. We use real-time mobility data from Wuhan and detailed case data including travel history to elucidate the role of case importation on transmission in cities across China and ascertain the impact of control measures. Early on, the spatial distribution of COVID-19 cases in China was well explained by human mobility data. Following the implementation of control measures, this correlation dropped and growth rates became negative in most locations, although shifts in the demographics of reported cases are still indicative of local chains of transmission outside Wuhan. This study shows that the drastic control mea...","Animal coronaviruses, such as infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), and arteriviruses, such as porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), are able to manifest highly contagious infections in their specific native hosts, thereby arising in critical economic damage to animal industries. This review discusses recent progress in studies of virus-host interactions during animal and human coronavirus and arterivirus infections, with emphasis on IBV-host cell interactions. These interactions may be directly involved in viral replication or lead to the alteration of certain signaling pathways, such as cell stress response and innate immunity, to facilitate viral replication and pathogenesis.","During the current COVID-19 pandemic, testing kit and RNA extraction kit availability has become a major limiting factor in the ability to determine patient disease status and accurately quantify prevalence. Current testing strategies rely on individual tests of cases matching restrictive diagnostic criteria to detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA, limiting testing of asymptomatic and mild cases. Testing these individuals is one effective way to understand and reduce the spread of COVID-19. Here, we develop a pooled testing strategy to identify these low-risk individuals. Drawing on the well-studied group testing literature, modeling suggests practical changes to testing protocols which can reduce test costs and stretch a limited test kit supply. When most tests are negative, pooling reduces the total number of tests up to four-fold at 2% prevalence and eight-fold at 0.5% prevalence. At current SARS-CoV-2 prevalence, randomized group testing optimized per country could double the number of tested ind...","The World Health Organization currently recommends that governments scale up testing for COVID-19 infection. We performed health economic analyses projecting whether the additional costs from screening would be offset by the avoided costs with hospitalizations. We analysed Portuguese COVID-19 data up until the 22nd March 2020, and estimated the additional number of cases that would be detected if different testing rates and frequencies of positive results would have been observed. We projected that, in most scenarios, the costs with scaling up COVID-19 tests would be lower than savings with hospitalization costs, rendering large scale testing cost-saving.","Timely detection of novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection cases is crucial to interrupt the spread of this virus. We assessed the required expertise and capacity for molecular detection of 2019-nCoV in specialised laboratories in 30 European Union/European Economic Area (EU/EEA) countries. Thirty-eight laboratories in 24 EU/EEA countries had diagnostic tests available by 29 January 2020. A coverage of all EU/EEA countries was expected by mid-February. Availability of primers/probes, positive controls and personnel were main implementation barriers.","The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and recently emerged Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) epidemics have proven the ability of coronaviruses to cross species barrier and emerge rapidly in humans. Other coronaviruses such as porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) are also known to cause major disease epidemics in animals wiith huge economic loss. This special issue in Virology Journal aims to highlight the advances and key discoveries in the animal origin, viral evolution, epidemiology, diagnostics and pathogenesis of the emerging and re-emerging coronaviruses in both humans and animals.","This year marks the 15th anniversary of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in Canada and the 100th anniversary of the 1918 Spanish influenza pandemic. These, and other recent public health events, provide an opportunity for us to review and reflect on the evolution of Canada\u2019s public health emergency response over the past 15 years\u2014from SARS, to the 2009 H1N1 pandemic influenza, to Ebola virus and Zika virus disease. Key lessons have been learned and milestones achieved that have shaped and sharpened our response approach and structures. While SARS was a wake-up-call to strengthen infection prevention and control capacity in health care settings and led to the formation of the Public Health Agency of Canada, it also strengthened our Federal/Provincial/Territorial (FPT) senior-level governance and led to agreements for pan-Canadian mutual aid and infectious disease information sharing. As well, our collective public health laboratory capacity has been strengthened through ongoing ...","The rapid spread of COVID-19 is a global public health challenge. To prevent the escalation of its transmission, China locked down one-third of its cities and strictly restricted human mobility and economic activities. Using timely and comprehensive air quality data in China, we show that these counter-COVID-19 measures led to remarkable improvement in air quality. Within weeks, the Air Quality Index and PM2.5 concentrations were brought down by 25%. The effects are larger in colder, richer, and more industrialized cities. We estimate that such improvement would avert 24,000 to 36,000 premature deaths from air pollution on a monthly basis.","ABSTRACT SARS-CoV-2, the novel coronavirus from China, is spreading around the world, causing a huge reaction despite its current low incidence outside China and the Far East. Four common coronaviruses are in current circulation and cause millions of cases worldwide. This article compares the incidence and mortality rates of these four common coronaviruses with those of SARS-COV-2 in Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries. It is concluded that the problem of SARS-CoV-2 is probably being overestimated, as 2.6 million people die of respiratory infections each year compared with less than 4000 deaths for SARS-CoV-2 at the time of writing.","Traveller screening is being used to limit further spread of COVID-19 following its recent emergence, and symptom screening has become a ubiquitous tool in the global response. Previously, we developed a mathematical model to understand factors governing the effectiveness of traveller screening to prevent spread of emerging pathogens (Gostic et al., 2015). Here, we estimate the impact of different screening programs given current knowledge of key COVID-19 life history and epidemiological parameters. Even under best-case assumptions, we estimate that screening will miss more than half of infected people. Breaking down the factors leading to screening successes and failures, we find that most cases missed by screening are fundamentally undetectable, because they have not yet developed symptoms and are unaware they were exposed. Our work underscores the need for measures to limit transmission by individuals who become ill after being missed by a screening program. These findings can suppo...","Abstract Neonatal calf diarrhea is still one of the most important diseases in calf rearing, and severe diarrhea has a marked effect on animal welfare. Furthermore, significant economic losses can result from this disease due to high mortality rates, high medical costs, and low weight gain. To avoid a fatal outcome of the disease, it is crucial that vulnerable calves are identified as early as possible. Interleukin-6 is described as an early and reliable prognostic marker in several diseases. In this study, 20 scouring calves were tested by ELISA for their IL-6 serum concentrations. Samples were collected twice, at the beginning of diarrhea and 7 to 10d later. Regarding the clinical outcome after 7 to 10d, calves were classified as recovered or nonrecovered. A receiver operating characteristic analysis was conducted to determine the prognostic value of IL-6 for the progress of clinical symptoms. At the beginning of diarrhea, the IL-6 concentration was significantly higher in nonrecover...","ABSTRACT It has been 2 months since the first case of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was reported in Wuhan, China. So far, COVID-19 has affected 85 403 patients in 57 countries/territories and has caused 2924 deaths in 9 countries. However, epidemiological data differ between countries. Although China had higher morbidity and mortality than other sites, the number of new daily cases in China has been lower than outside of China since 26 February 2020. The incidence ranged from 61.44 per 1 000 000 people in the Republic of Korea to 0.0002 per 1 000 000 people in India. The daily cumulative index (DCI) of COVID-19 (cumulative cases/no. of days between the first reported case and 29 February 2020) was greatest in China (1320.85), followed by the Republic of Korea (78.78), Iran (43.11) and Italy (30.62). However, the DCIs in other countries/territories were &lt;10 per day. Several effective measures including restricting travel from China, controlling the distribution of masks, extensive...","Coronaviruses (CoVs) can cause mild to severe disease in humans and animals, their host range and environmental spread seem to have been largely underestimated, and they are currently being investigated for their potential medical relevance. Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) belongs to gamma-coronaviruses and causes a costly respiratory viral disease in chickens. The role of wild birds in the epidemiology of IBV is poorly understood. In the present study, we examined 1,002 cloacal and faecal samples collected from 26 wild bird species in the Beringia area for the presence of CoVs, and then we performed statistical and phylogenetic analyses. We detected diverse CoVs by RT-PCR in wild birds in the Beringia area. Sequence analysis showed that the detected viruses are gamma-coronaviruses related to IBV. These findings suggest that wild birds are able to carry gamma-coronaviruses asymptomatically. We concluded that CoVs are widespread among wild birds in Beringia, and their geographic sprea...","The paper evaluates total inclusive costs of three public health approaches to address the COVID-19 epidemic in the US based on epidemiological projections in Ferguson et al (2020). We calculate and add costs of lost productivity and costs of mortality measured through the value of statistical life. We find that the aggressive approach which involves strict suppression measures and a drastic reduction of economic activity for three months with extensive testing and case tracking afterwards results in the lowest total costs for the society. The approach of doing no non-pharmaceutical measures results in the lowest total costs if the infection fatality rate falls below 0.15%.","ABSTRACTHuman coronavirus HKU1 (HCoV-HKU1) is associated with respiratory disease and is prevalent worldwide, but in vitro model for virus replication is lacking. Interaction between the coronaviral spike (S) protein and its receptor is the major determinant of virus tissue and host specificity, but virus entry is a complex process requiring a concerted action of multiple cellular elements. Here, we show that KLK13 is required for the infection of the human respiratory epithelium and is sufficient to mediate the entry of HCoV-HKU1 to non-permissive RD cells. We also demonstrated HCoV-HKU1 S protein cleavage by KLK13 in the S1/S2 region, proving that KLK13 is the priming enzyme for this virus. Summarizing, we show for the first time that protease distribution and specificity predetermines the tissue and cell specificity of the virus and may also regulate interspecies transmission. It is also of importance that presented data may be relevant for the emerging coronaviruses, including SARS...","Recent outbreaks of infectious pathogens such as Zika, Ebola, and COVID-19 have underscored the need for the dependable availability of vaccines against emerging infectious diseases (EIDs). The cost and risk of R&amp;D programs and uniquely unpredictable demand for EID vaccines have discouraged vaccine developers, and government and nonprofit agencies have been unable to provide timely or sufficient incentives for their development and sustained supply. We analyze the economic returns of a portfolio of EID vaccine assets, and find that under realistic financing assumptions, the expected returns are significantly negative, implying that the private sector is unlikely to address this need without public-sector intervention. We have sized the financing deficit for this portfolio and propose several potential solutions, including price increases, enhanced public-private partnerships, and subscription models through which individuals would pay annual fees to obtain access to a portfolio of vacc...","Abstract Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), caused by SARS-coronavirus (SARS-CoV), is a dreadful infection worldwide having economic and medical importance and a global threat for health. It was turned into an epidemic in South China followed by a chain of infections across three generations. A number of pathogeneses in human may occur due to the virus. This infection has not been taken into account before the SARS outbreak, and still it is a neglected one. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop small molecule antivirals to combat the SARS-CoV. No vaccines are available till date though a number of SARS-CoV 3C-like and 3C protease inhibitors were reported. In this chapter, quantitative structure\u2013activity relationship technique is used for development of anti-SARS and anti-HRV drugs and outcome discussed in details. This approach may be a useful strategy to design novel and potential anti-SARS drugs to combat these dreadful viral diseases."],"title":["Human metapneumovirus in paediatric patients","Impacts of social and economic factors on the transmission of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in China","Effective containment explains sub-exponential growth in confirmed cases of recent COVID-19 outbreak in Mainland China","Re-analysis of SARS-CoV-2 infected host cell proteomics time-course data by impact pathway analysis and network analysis.

For within city transmissions, we consider the mediating effect of population density, degree of economic development, number of doctors, and environmental factors such as temperature, wind and rain. To measure the spread of the virus from Wuhan, we include an estimate of the number of people traveling from Wuhan. The empirical model including these mediating variables is as follows,","The response to an EID should take into account not only factors linked to EIDs, but also to a constellation of political, economic and socio-cultural constraints. The decision to put in place such a battle is in fact a political decision which involves, beyond the scientific aspects, the intervention's impact upon the popularity of the acting political powers-that-be. If governments are judged according to their ability to prevent epidemic crises, they are equally judged on their ability to avoid expenditures deemed excessive given the existing risk. These political considerations can run counter to the scientific rationale behind the response. This is how, in the case of the 2014 Ebola virus epidemic, the United States became involved: through the declaration by the Liberian President on August 6, 2014, on the threat to national security posed by Ebola, and the danger of the spread of the epidemic to the U.S. soil. In parallel with vaccine research and development, the actions of the U.S., the WHO and the United Nations have focused on treatment of infected patients and the epidemiological securing of burials. In addition, despite a sometimes limited human impact, the economic impact of epidemics involving indirect costs (consequence for certain sectors of activity) has shown a marked increase. However, what characterizes modern epidemics is the duration of the economic ''shock'', in that it is temporary, as opposed to previous epidemics during which the shock tended to be drawn out in particular due to the persistence of infectious sources. There are many examples of this: among others, the ''Spanish influenza'' of 1918, the effects of which (company closures, loss of revenue) faded out in 1921, or, more recently, the SARS-CoV epidemic, when the recession, that had been triggered by alerts against travel to Southeast Asian destinations communicated in March, ceased once these alerts were lifted two or three months later. It is of note that during the SARS-CoV epidemic only certain sectors (especially tourism) were affected in Asia and in Ontario, Canada, and not the entire global economy.","In summary, countries took dramatically different approaches in managing the pandemic. The variation is marked by prior experiences and preparation, early reinforcement of strict vigilance, testing and isolation, late law enforcement, strong vs weak public awareness, self-restraint, commitments, and other factors. Some aspects of risk perception, awareness and response is a cultural issue, and powerfully linked to the socio-economic structure of the country and community. But in a strongly interconnected world, there surely needs to be a global standard and protocol for regional and national response. It is imperative to build mechanisms that decrease risks of infection and enhance community safety and resilience.","There is a new Coronavirus causing significant to severe respiratory infections in humans, causing human misery and death. This Coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2 is alarming health organisations around the world and has already caused significant social and economic losses to China and the Asian Pacific Region, and increasingly, the Globe [1]. The virus portends to cause the loss of trillions of dollars through direct and indirect effects. This harmful viral-driven-economic damage, which has primarily hit Wuhan, Hubei Province, the economic industrial heartland of China, is compounding the effects of the recent economic slowdown in China [2]. These socio-economic pressures alone would highlight the One-Health aspect of the new Coronavirus, but there are more fundamental reasons for calling this a One Health issue.","Countries at the highest risk of importation, based on current epidemic situation in China, had moderate to high capacity scores. These may however correspond to different contributions to the mean SPAR indicators, reflecting different aspects of a country's functional capacity. For example, South Africa had the maximum score for the laboratory capacity (100), but a low score in risk communication (20). Conversely, Nigeria had a fairly low score in the laboratory capacity (27) and the maximum score in the IHR coordination capacity (100). Conversely, countries with the lowest SPAR capacity score had moderate (Kenya, Tanzania, Ghana) to low introduction risk. The evaluation of additional factors (demographic, socio-economic, political) included in the IDVI that may influence the overall potential impact of an unfolding epidemic identifies several countries that had a significant importation risk with a low to medium IDVI, such as Nigeria, Ethiopia, Egypt and Algeria. The risk of importation from other points of entry, such as for example sea ports was not evaluated here.","Briefly, the factors that this committee identified were the following: human demographics and behavior; technology and industry; economic development and land use; international travel and commerce; microbial adaptation and change; and the breakdown of public health measures. It is notable that five of these six factors are social factors that are consequences of changes in society. Even microbial adaptation and change, such as the development of antimicrobial resistance as a response to selective pressure, has a large behavioral dimension. This is partly a response to a technical innovation -the development of antimicrobials -and partly a response to a behaviorthe prescribing of those antimicrobials. Of course, one dimension of this factor is the nonselective and improper prescribing of antimicrobials. This has several dimensions: The prescription of antibiotics when none are needed, the prescription of broad-spectrum antibiotics when narrowspectrum antibiotics are sufficient, the free availability of antibiotics in many developing countries on the street and in pharmacies where no prescription is needed, and the free use of late-generation antibiotics in the food industry to promote the growth of cattle, chickens, and other animals intended for human consumption. So, in fact, all of the six factors of emergence are social and behavioral in nature.","Human mobility contributes to the transmission of infectious diseases that pose serious threats to global health. Indeed, in response to pandemic threats many countries consider and impose measures that restrict human mobility flows as one of their response plans (Bajardi et al., 2011; Wang and Taylor, 2016; Charu et al., 2017) . However, restrictions on human mobility are controversial not only because of their negative economic impacts, but also because of the uncertainty about their effectiveness in controlling the epidemic. Even if restricting human movement could lead to improvements in disease control and reductions in health risks, it is empirically challenging to quantify the impact of human mobility on the spread of infectious diseases, and to understand the detailed spatial patterns of how the infectious disease spreads. Both granular disease occurrence data and human mobility data (Charu et al., 2017 ) are hard to obtain; moreover, it is difficult to disentangle the impact of human mobility from other potential contributing factors in the spread of epidemics Hollingsworth et al., 2006) . In this paper, we exploit the exogenous variations in human mobility created by lockdowns of Chinese cities during the outbreak of the Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV), and utilize a variety of high-quality data sets, to study the effectiveness of an unprecedented cordon sanitaire of the epicenter of COVID-19, and provide a comprehensive analysis on the role of human mobility restrictions in the delaying and the halting of the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. 1 The fast-moving 2019-nCoV that infected 266,073 people and claimed 11,184 lives as of March 21, 2020 is deteriorating into one of the worst global pandemics. 2 The virus emerged in the city of Wuhan in the Hubei Province of China in early December of 2019, spread mainly through person-to-person contact (Chan et al., 2020) , and rapidly reached more than 183 countries as of March 21, 2020. 3 Currently, there are no licensed vaccines or specific therapeutics to combat COVID-19. The lockdown of 11 million people in Wuhan from January 23, 2020 represents by then the largest quarantine in public health history, and offers us an opportunity to rigorously examine the effects of the city lockdown and understand the relationship between human mobility and virus transmission.","The emergence and spread of an epidemic disease occurs not only because of factors related to the virulence and infection capacity of the virus itself, but also due to socio-economic and environmental factors such as population movement [6, 7] . In effect, this is an integrated human-environment system characterised by complex interactions and feedbacks [8] . To contain and control infectious diseases such as COVID-19, in addition to extensive medical treatment, systematic methods need to be carried out to isolate the source of infection, cut off transmission routes, and protect vulnerable groups. Based on the ''classification-coordination-collaboration\" approach of advancing sustainable development goals [9] , the systematic approaches towards fighting COVID-19 adopted by China can be summarized as a combination of actions involving coordination, classification, and collaboration ( Fig. 1 ).","Viewing Nipah virus emergence through a social\u2013ecological lens, we can generate and examine a range of hypotheses for the cascading factors that led to the unusually close proximity of bats, pigs, and farmers. These factors range from global socio-economic pressures driving the development of intensive agriculture in Malaysia, to regional and local occupational trends leading farm laborers to seek employment on intensive pig farms, and possibly increased contact between bats and humans due to suburban encroachment on bat habitat. Furthermore, feedback loops acting positively (in terms of its relationship with its intermediate pig host) or negatively (in terms of effects on the Malaysian economy) for the virus are reminders that social and ecological systems interact at multiple spatial and temporal scales. The challenges of capturing the complexity of this zoonotic disease outbreak, particularly its social\u2013ecological dynamics, will be explored in the discussion section.","is the (which was not peer-reviewed) The copyright holder for this preprint . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03. 17.20037770 doi: medRxiv preprint Timing to Implement Finite Time Intervention. Previous modeling studies have shown that community level control measures are effective in reducing disease transmissibility, however, prolonged closures of schools and businesses, as well as limited public gatherings have negative socio-economic impacts that must be considered (30, 31) . The negative socio-economic impacts dictate that the community-level interventions can only last a finite amount of time. Therefore, it is of utmost importance to understand when and for how long those interventions should be put into effect, so as to maximize the net benefit. Figure 5(a) shows the output of the SEIR model under a conditional 25% reduction in transmissibility within a time window defined with an intervention start time, , and an end time, + (where represents intervention duration). Effectiveness of interventions (lasting for a variable ), which is quantified with the normalized reduction of infected population at the national epidemic peak, is plotted in Fig. 5 (a) as a function of implementation timing, which is quantified with number of weeks between and the national epidemic peak. The trends in Fig. 5 (a) show that unless the intervention could last indefinitely, a premature implementation of a finite-time intervention plan could be counterproductive. Figure 5 (b) plots the best implementation timing, * , as a function of , and a power-law relationship * \u2248 0.85 is conceived. This empirical relationship informs the optimal timing to enforce communitylevel interventions given a practically affordable intervention duration. The earliness of the statewise epidemic peaks are presented in Fig. 5 (c).","In models of the spread of COVID-19, the key parameters are the basic reproduction number which refers to the average number of secondary cases generated from a contagious person, and a dispersion parameter that can provide further information about outbreak dynamics and potential for superspreading events [Riou and Althaus 2020] . It is estimated that the basic reproductive number of COVID-19 is around 1.5 to 4 [Rabajante 2020]. Parameters in models of disease spread are usually considered constant for the entire population with time-variation [Liu, et.al. 2020] . However, these parameters vary considering the heterogeneity of the population, location of virus transmission, and socio-economic and political factors [Rabajante, 2020] .","Wild bird species serve as a natural reservoir of many emerging zoonotic pathogens and thus have a significant impact on public health. They are also the source of pathogens dangerous to domestic animals, and such infections could have socio-economic consequences. This is the reason why over the years wild birds have been under epidemiological surveillance. Among the viruses transmitted by wild birds, the most well-known are influenza A viruses (9). Wild birds are also implicated in the spread of the West Nile virus, Borrelia burgdorferi, and other bacterial infections such as Salmonella or Campylobacter, and with them also resistance genes to antibiotics (35). Studies from the last 10 years have also shown the presence of CoVs in wild birds (22, 24, 25, 53). Among factors which make birds an excellent reservoir of various pathogens and also a bioreactor contributing to their variability, there are the high biodiversity of bird species, their ecological traits such gathering/grouping during feeding and roosting, but most importantly their capability to fly long distances (8).","Keeping the uncertainty considerations in mind (but not graphed due to clutter), Figure 4 shows results based on best-fit parameters. If our best case scenario on the reduction of contacts and benefits of seasonality for containment hold, the number of infected cases will peak soon at approximately 494,000 (90% CI: 274K-813K), and will go down later on. This optimistic scenario will still lead to over a million infections and some 58,000 deaths (90% CI: 32K-97K) by the end of June. The less aggressive scenarios point to continued spread of the epidemic. A reduction in contagion is realized only when reproduction number remains below one as a result of natural contact reduction in response to recent deaths, government interventions that reduce contacts, and seasonality. Among these three, the first (behavioral response) is endogenous to recent death rate. When death rate comes under control (due to the combination of all those factors), our model assumes the contract rate rebounds, weakening the first channel. Economic pressures, normalization of death, and behavioral modeling after the more risk seeking (or those already recovered and thus presumably immune) could all weaken the behavioral response when the perceived risks have faded. The increased contact would then, with a delay, bring up the death rate close to levels sustaining a reproduction number around or slightly above one. This creates a strong attractor in the dynamics where in steady state contact rate is high enough to sustain the contagion but not so high to lead to the rapid infection of all the population. Therefore it is only with strong weather and/or government interventions that reduced reproduction number brings the epidemic under control. This dynamic offers a cautionary tale against declaring victory early in the fight against the epidemic. However the actual magnitude of such rebound effect is not known in this setting and our data offers no guidance on the relevant parameters. Therefore these results are only qualitatively suggestive but not quantitatively reliable.","We estimate a multiple regression version of Equation 6 using ordinary least squares. We include a vector of sub-national unit-fixed effects \u03b8 0 (i.e. varying intercepts captured as coefficients to dummy variables) to account for all time-invariant factors that affect the local growth rate of infections, such as differences in demographics, socio-economic status, culture, or health systems. 24 We include a vector of day-of-week-fixed effects \u03b4 to account for weekly patterns in the growth rate of infections that are common across locations within a country. We include a separate singleday dummy variable each time there is an abrupt change in the availability of COVID-19 testing or a change in the procedure to diagnose positive cases. Such changes generally manifest as a discontinuous jump in infections and a re-scaling of subsequent infection rates (e.g. See China in Figure 1 ), effects that are flexibly absorbed by a single-day dummy variable because the dependent variable is the first-difference of the logarithm of infections. Denote the vector of these testing dummies \u00b5.","Nigeria is one such place with high prevalence of many of the risk factors implicated in ARI among children including; age, sex, overcrowding, nutritional status, socio-economic status, and where study of ARIs is currently limited [6]. These broad risk factors alongside limited resources have indicated the need for community-based initiatives for surveillance and interventions [6, 7]. For ARI surveillance in particular, infections in the community are those that do not get reported clinically. Clinical data generally represents the most severe cases, and those from locations with access to healthcare institutions. In Nigeria, hospitals are visited only when symptoms are very severe. Thus, it is hypothesized that viral information from clinical sampling is insufficient to either capture disease incidence in general populations or its predictability from symptoms [8]. Efforts worldwide including in East and Southern Africa have been focused on developing community-based participatory disease surveillance methods [9\u201313]. Community-based approaches have been shown useful for learning more about emerging respiratory infections such as assessing under-reporting [14], types of viruses prevalent in communities [10], and prediction of epidemics [15].","The recent identification of a presumably old virus pathogen is an exciting development in the field of respiratory viruses. Considering the available studies as a whole, hMPV appears to play an important role as a cause of paediatric upper and lower respiratory tract infection. In general, many of the epidemiological and clinical features of hMPV infection seem to be similar to those of RSV and influenza, although some differences have been noted [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] . Moreover, the socio-economic impact of hMPV-infected children on their families seems to be significant, suggesting that, like influenza, hMPV infection may be a substantial public health problem for the community [16, 17] . hMPV can cause morbidity and mortality in pre-term infants [35] and children with underlying clinical conditions, including immunocompromised patients [33, 34, 45, 46] , although further adequately controlled studies are needed to confirm this.","By providing a rigorous estimation of the impact of within and cross-city migration on the spread of the 2019-nCoV virus in China, our study contributes to fast-growing literature on 2019-nCoV infection, mostly in the medical and public health fields. Huang et al. (2020) describe high rates of respiratory distress, intensive care admission, and abnormal findings on chest computed tomography (CT) in the first 41 patients hospitalized from December 16 to January 2 in Wuhan, as well as a 15% death rate. Chan et al. (2020) investigate a family cluster and confirm the human-to-human transmission of this Novel Coronavirus within hospitals and families. The basic reproduction number (R0) for COVID-19 in 12 studies has a mean of 3.28 and a median of 2.79 (Liu et al., 2020 ) (compared to 3 for SARS (WTO, 2003) ). This study is also related to disaster-induced migration, which has often occurred during flooding (Gray and Mueller, 2012) , drought (Munshi, 2003) , earthquake (Lu et al., 2012) , and other destructive climatic phenomena. Given that the 2019-nCoV has rapidly spread worldwide due to human travel and caused severe illness and significant mortality, it is therefore essential to understand the impact of various control measures on human mobility and the virus transmission. Qiu et al. (2020) apply machine learning tools and use exogenous temperature, wind speed, and precipitation in the preceding third and fourth weeks as the instruments to show that the massive lockdown and other control measures significantly reduced the virus transmission. Their results highlight that the population outflow from the outbreak source city poses higher risks to the destination cities than other social and economic factors, such as geographic proximity and similarity in economic conditions. Our results are also in line with the results of the latest modeling exercises, which mostly rely on model calibrations of various parameters, such as generation time, incubation period, detection rates, and changes in travel flow. Using the Global Epidemic and Mobility model, Chinazzi et al. (2020) project the impact of travel limitation on the national and international spread of the 2019-nCoV. The study finds that only 24.4% of infected cases were reported as of February 1, and the Wuhan lockdown reduced the cases by 10% in cities outside Wuhan by January 31. The study most closely related to ours is Li et al. (2020) , which shows that contagious but undocumented COVID-19 cases facilitated the geographic spread of the epidemic in China. Using a networked dynamic meta-population model and Bayesian inference, Li et al. (2020) find that 86% of all infections were undocumented before the Wuhan lockdown and reported infections would have been reduce by 78.7% in China, without transmission from undocumented cases between January 10 and January 23. Lai et al. (2020) build a travel network-based susceptibleexposed-infectious-removed (SEIR) model to simulate the outbreak across cities in mainland China. They use epidemiological parameters estimated from the early stage of outbreak in Wuhan to parameterize the transmission before the non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPI) were implemented. The NPIs they consider include travel bans and restrictions, contact reductions and social distancing, early case identification and isolation. Through their sim-ulations, they find that the NPIs deployed in China appear to be effectively containing the COVID-19 outbreak, but the efficacy of the different interventions varied, with the early case detection and contact reduction being the most effective. Moreover, deploying the NPIs early is also important to prevent further spread. Relative to our study, it is important to point out that in their simulations, they assumed that the pattern of population movements was the same in years when there were no outbreaks and interventions. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first to provide a causal interpretation of the impact of city lockdown on human mobility and the spread of 2019-nCoV, and to clearly disentangle the lockdown effects from other potential contributing factors such as panic and virus effect, as well as the seasonal Spring Festival effect (see Section 3).","The average age onboard the ship was 58, so our estimates of cCFR cannot directly be applied to a younger population; we therefore scaled our estimates to obtain values for a population equivalent to those in the early China outbreak. There were some limitations to our analysis. Cruise ship passengers may have a different health status to the general population of their home countries, due to health requirements to embark on a multi-week holiday, or differences related to socio-economic status or comborbities. Deaths only occurred in individuals 70 years or older, so we were not able to generate age-specific cCFRs; the fatality risk may also be influenced by differences in healthcare between countries. Because of likely age-specific differences in reporting, we focused on overall cCFR in China, rather than calculating agespecific cCFRs [7] .","At present, the data suggest that in some countries, including China, Korea, Japan, and a couple of other Asian countries, the peak of the COVID-19 may be over. It is imperative to continue taking precautions, including screening, isolation of suspected cases and social distancing. However, it is also important to start developing early recovery planning, which needs to be gender and disability inclusive. The socio-economic fall-out from this crisis is already high, and quite literally rising by the day. Concerns about preventing a protracted global recession, if not outright depression, are leading to focused intervention in capital markets and other areas. Aviation, energy, hotels, and other concerns that appear -to their investors and to policymakers -to be too big to allow to fail seem about to be given relief. Yet pandemic risks increase when general community health and well-being weaken. Thus it is critical that measures also be taken to identify the most vulnerable and include them in recovery packages.","There are two challenges to causal estimation in this setting. First, surface temperatures generally fall as one moves away from the equator towards higher latitude locations. Because similar latitude-dependent gradients exist for other potentially relevant environmental conditions like UV exposure and socio-economic indicators like GDP, a cross-sectional analysis of local mean temperature and COVID-19 transmission may be biased by such confounding factors. Second, for a given location, surface temperatures tend to trend over the course of a calendar year. COVID-19 transmission rates trend as well which may also confound temperature effects with other gradually evolving determinants of transmission.","To construct the dependent variable, we transform location-specific, sub-national time-series of infections into first-differences of their natural logarithm, which is the per day growth rate of infections (see Methods). We use data from first-or second-level administrative units and data on active or cumulative cases, depending on availability (see Appendix Section 2). We then employ widely-used panel regression models 23, 24 to estimate how the daily growth rate of infections changes over time within a location when different combinations of large-scale social policies are enacted (see Methods). Our econometric approach accounts for differences in the baseline growth rate of infections across locations due to differences in demographics, socio-economic status, culture, or health systems across localities within a country; it accounts for systemic patterns in growth rates within countries unrelated to policy, such as the effect of the work-week; it is robust to systematic under-surveillance; and it accounts for changes in procedures to diagnose positive cases (see Methods and Appendix Section 2). The reduced-form statistical techniques we use are designed to measure the total magnitude of the effect of changes in policy, without attempting to explain the origin of baseline growth rates or the specific epidemiological mechanisms linking policy changes to infection growth rates (see Methods). Thus, this approach does not provide the important mechanistic insights generated by process-based models; however, it does effectively quantify the key policyrelevant relationships of interest using recent real-world data when fundamental epidemiological parameters are still uncertain.","There is a small amount of evidence that location can affect the out-of-home activities children take part in during school closures, from a study of behaviour in children from two different school districts [27] . In this study, children in Jujuy were more likely to attend religious events, use public transport, and go to plazas and recreation areas than children in Ushuaia; children in Ushuaia were more likely to go to the movie theatre and restaurants than children in Jujuy. Socio-economic differences may well be the reason for this: Ushuaia has one of the lowest poverty rates in the country, whereas Jujuy has one of the highest.","Initial evaluation of COVID-19 transmission dynamics showed that the basic reproductive number (R 0 ) of 2019-nCoV is estimated to be 1.4-3.9 [12] . The R 0 of SARS-CoV in the absence of interventions was 2.3-3.7 [22, 23] . Breban et al. estimated MERS-CoV R 0 to be 0.50-0.92 by analysis of 55 of the first 64 laboratory-confirmed cases [24] . With the implementation of rapid diagnosis, coupled with effective isolation of patients, the R 0 of SARS-CoV dropped to less than 1, explaining why the SARS-CoV outbreak could eventually be controlled [25] [26] [27] . However, it is worth noting that R 0 estimates may vary upon numerous biologic, socio-behavioral, and environmental factors, and must be interpreted with caution [28] .","An end to illegal and unregulated sex tourism in Thailand and elsewhere is, however, problematic because of the economic rewards. It represents a major industry in some places and can be a vital source of income; for example, over 90% of young female Cambodian prostitutes may be the principal family breadwinner. Many commentators also question the commitment of offi cials to the drive against prostitution in general and involving children in particular. There is a lack of political will and changes will require immense effort. Campaigns do not always receive the full support of the local police and other bodies, corruption being a major obstacle. Sexual exploitation has socio-economic roots and is a product of poverty, lack of education and drug addiction. Until these issues are addressed, it seems that the more unacceptable manifestations of sex tourism in the developing world will continue to thrive (BBC News, 2000; UNESCAP, 2004) .","To explore the heterogeneity, we assemble the cities' socio-economic status from the 2017 China City Statistical Yearbook. It contains the city-level statistics such as GDP, population, amount of traffic, pollutant emission, and industrial output.","Since the 2001 anthrax alert in the United States (23 American case patients, 5 deaths, and approximately 2500 anthrax-suspect patients in France) and the international severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2003, an organization has been developed in France to address the clinical management of patients suspected of having an infectious disease (ID) related to a natural epidemic or an intentional biological risk (\"Epidemic and Biological Risk\"-EBR). The response to nuclear, radiological, biological, and chemical risks in France is organized through 12 civil zones of defense (2003 application decree). In each zone 1-2 hospitals are identified as a reference for these risks (16 reference hospitals, among which the military reference center of the Paris -\u00cele-de-France zone and the Guadeloupe-associated reference hospital were included) as presented in Fig. 1 [1] . For biological risks, each of these hospitals has a dedicated ID department, reference microbiology laboratory, zonal prehospital emergency medical service unit (SAMU center 15) including the medical regulation of emergency calls, and departments which include infection control unit, intensive care unit, and a pharmacy involved in the care of these patients. EBR alerts might lead to disruption within the public health sector and the society related to fear of transmission and to the potential negative socio-economic impacts [2] . Immediate access to ID expertise was requested by frontline healthcare workers (HCWs), especially SAMU Center 15 which is responsible for centralized medical calls in France. It is unlikely that EBR-suspect patients would present themselves directly to one of the reference centers identified by the health authorities; they would rather first consult other closer health facilities within the national health system. Therefore, the need for a multidisciplinary network to deliver the operational expertise to frontline HCWs for initial patient management (mainly SAMU Center 15, in-hospital emergency departments, and family physicians [FPs]) was urgent. The 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic highlighted the importance for timely delivery of appropriate care to patients and for informing the general population about means of protection. This reinforced the concept that the mid/long-term outcome of an epidemic depends heavily on adequate and coherent coordination of individual care and collective measures, decisions and actions undertaken during the initial phase of the alert. In 2009, a dedicated regional EBR Coordination unit (Coordination op\u00e9rationnelle du risque \u00e9pid\u00e9mique et biologique [COREB] ) was created in Paris -\u00cele-de-France. In 2012, the French Infectious Diseases Society (SPILF) established a national SPILF-COREB-Emergences (SCE) group to coordinate ID specialists' response to EBR in collaboration with other key stakeholders, such as other specialists and institutions.","The ongoing outbreak is accompanied by many human casualties and significant socio-economic losses globally and has now reached the proportions of a pandemic, with more than 81,000 COVID-19 confirmed cases and more than 2,760 related fatalities worldwide (February 26, 2020) .","In some countries, pharmacists have moved away from product-oriented services toward service-oriented and then patient-oriented services, increasingly emphasizing the patient's health outcomes (the economic, clinical, and humanistic outcomes model) (Drabinski, 2000; Kozma, Reeder, &amp; Schulz, 1993) . Outcomes refer to the consequences (results) of interventions that are made to achieve therapeutic goals. Outcomes can have economic, social/behavioral, or physiological characteristics. When community pharmacists are serving the public, in addition to health outcomes, at least four important parameters should be monitored: accessibility, availability, affordability, and acceptability. When patients benefit from the medications that they take, their health improves, which ultimately reduces costs (Wiedenmayer et al., 2006) .","Notes: The X-axis shows the estimated coefficients and their 95% confidence intervals. Each row corresponds to separate regression using a corresponding subsample. We use the mean values to separate the \"high\" group from the \"low\" group for each pair of heterogeneity analyses. For example, if a city's GDP is higher than the mean GDP, it falls into a \"high\" GDP group. For temperature (colder or warmer group), we use data measured in the first week of our study period. North and South are divided along the Huai River. Other socio-economic data for the classification are measured in 2017.","In Europe, Italy is the worst hit with a comparatively high percentage of deaths among the infected. This outcome has been attributed to lack of regulation and testing, which prompted the community spreading. Gradually, stricter government regulation and vigilance systems have been implemented and enforced, along with social distancing among the people. However, the open border among the EU countries has helped in spreading the disease to Spain, France, Germany and Switzerland, as well as to the UK. The European Union (EU) has been surprisingly slow in coordinating a response to the outbreak. High rates of infection and deaths eventually prompted the European Commission to coordinate a common European response to the outbreak. The response includes resolute action to reinforce the country's public health sectors and mitigate the socio-economic impact in the European Union. In terms of funding, the French announced $49 billion, Italy announced a $28 billion plan on March 11 to be divided over two separate spending packages, while the UK announced a \u00a35 billion COVID-19 fund (UKGov, 2020).","In terms of limitations for this review, the generalisability of the individual studies we identified is unclear. In particular a lot may depend on the cultural context, perceptions of the illness in question, the length of the closure, the socio-economic status of the families that are affected and the information or instructions that are given to them by public health authorities.","Efforts to reverse the recent trend of increased epidemic activity and geographic expansion of dengue are not promising. New dengue virus strains and serotypes will likely continue to be introduced into many areas with high population levels of A. aegypti. In the absence of a vaccine or new mosquito control technology, public health authorities have emphasized disease prevention and mosquito control through community efforts to reduce larval breeding sources. Improved of specific ecologic and behavioral factors that facilitate the introduction of animal pathogens into human populations (e.g., increased human presence or other changes in wildlife habitats) and allow newly introduced pathogens to become established in new areas (e.g., suitable insect vectors). 353 Dengue Dengue is the most important mosquito-borne viral disease that affects humans. Its global distribution is comparable to that of malaria, and an estimated 2.5 billion people live in areas at risk for epidemic transmission. The disease is endemic in Africa, the Americas, and parts of the Middle East, Asia, and the western Pacific. The frequency of dengue and its more severe complications-dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) and dengue shock syndrome-has been increasing dramatically since 1980. 354 It is generally estimated that 50 to 100 million infections occur annually, but recent data suggest that approximately 390 million dengue infections occurred worldwide in 2010, including 96 million symptomatic illnesses. 355 Dengue is caused by any of four antigenically distinct virus serotypes (DEN-1, -2, -3, -4) of the genus Flavivirus. Infection with one of these serotypes is not cross protective. Infection with dengue viruses produces a spectrum of clinical illness that ranges from a nonspecific viral syndrome to severe and fatal hemorrhagic disease. 356 DHF is a life-threatening condition characterized by capillary permeability that may lead to hypovolemic shock and death. Important risk factors for DHF include the strain and serotype of the infecting virus, as well as the age, immune status, and genetic predisposition of the patient. In endemic areas, most deaths from dengue infection occur in children younger than 15 years of age. 356 Economic impact analyses in both the Americas and Asia indicate that the burden of dengue-related illness in children is substantial, especially when nonhospitalized patients are considered. 357, 358 Dengue is transmitted primarily by Aedes aegypti, a domestic, daybiting mosquito, and secondarily by A. albopictus. A. aegypti was historically found in Africa but spread throughout the tropical regions of the world during the past 2 centuries through international commerce. It is well adapted to the urban environment, feeding on humans and breeding in containers in areas where water is stored or allowed to accumulate, such as discarded cans, bottles, plastic containers, and tires. Epidemics caused by multiple serotypes (hyperendemicity) have become more frequent, and the geographic distribution of both the viruses and their mosquito vectors has expanded.","Notes: The X-axis shows the estimated coefficients and their 95% confidence intervals. Each row corresponds to separate regression using a corresponding subsample. We use the mean values to separate the \"high\" group from the \"low\" group for each pair of heterogeneity analyses. For example, if a city's GDP is higher than the mean GDP, it falls into a \"high\" GDP group. For temperature (colder or warmer group), we use data measured in the first week of our study period. North and South are divided along the Huai River. Other socio-economic data for the classification are measured in 2017. Each regression implements the Equation and controls for weather, city fixed effects, and month-by-week fixed effects. Standard errors are clustered at the city level.","We separate the regional level into Europe, Asia, and Africa. Concerning the former, the European Commission (EC) leads the planning and implementation of European Union (EU) strategy, its role in setting priorities, and its implementation through EU policy. A dedicated website is https:// ec.europa.eu/info/live-work-travel-eu/health/coronavirus-response_en. The EU has established a common European response to the outbreak of COVID-19, focusing on public health sectors and socio-economic impact particularly mobility and economy in the European Union (EU, 19th March 2020). Italy is the most severely impacted country in the EU. The EC support for the Sendai Framework identifies health as one of the issues interlinked with DRR (EC Web, 2020). Yet it is unclear whether the EU response to COVID-19 features coordinated involvement by DRR-related agencies and mechanisms. The opportunity for integration may be possible through the Integrated Political Crisis Response (IPCR). The IPRC provides a flexible crisis mechanism for supporting the presidency of the Council of the European Union in dealing with major natural or man-made crosssectorial disasters, as well as acts of terrorism. The IPCR works through common Monitoring and Information-sharing (EU, 2016).","The COVID-19 outbreak was declared by the WHO a Public Health Emergency of International Concern on January 30, 2020 and since then, it has infected more than 125,000 individuals in more than 130 countries, reaching pandemic proportions (1) . As of mid-March, Italy is by far the most affected country other than China that faced a sustained local transmission, which is putting a substantial burden on the Italian healthcare system and is threatening the socio-economic stability of the country.","It should be pointed out that the socio-economic developments and civilization evolution have always been facing grand challenges including climate/environmental changes and extremes [9] , and epidemics are one kind of them [10, 11] . The direct and indirect causes of this 2019-nCoV epidemic are still unclear. Consumption of wild animals, sanitation and hygiene practices should be responsible, while environment evolutions including climate change and extreme events may also contribute [12] [13] [14] . But these critical topics are beyond the purview of this note.","Outside China, the EEI never dropped below 1.0 from the beginning to the current date (ie March 22, 2020), indicating that the global epidemic is still developing. Countries with a rapidly increasing number of confirmed cases, such as Iran, Republic of Korea and Italy, can learn from Chinas prevention and control experience and integrate it with their own economic situation and socio-cultural background. Governments in these countries should value public health measures, such as closing public places, restricting urban traffic and delaying school.","Every location has a different socio-economic profile such that the growth rate of the epidemic (and hence R 0 ) might differ. The superposition of many such subpopulations with a range of R 0 values and seasonal variation in transmission will result in dynamics that are qualitatively different from a single population SIR model. In particular, such variation result in a pandemic spread out over 2 years before the virus possibly becomes endemic. Fig. 4 shows the result of such a simulation of 1,000 populations. Populations were divided between northern temperate (50%), southern temperate (10%), and tropical (40%) and assigned parameters as follows:","With the continuous transmission of the virus across borders and increasing health burden on the global scale, SARS-CoV-2 demands an urgent immunization therapy. As depicted by Shan Lu, the Community Acquired Coronavirus Infection (CACI) caused by this virus can shatter the socio-economic condition worldwide and the development of vaccine against the SARS-CoV-2 should be encouraged to manage the present situation as well as it can serve as a prototype for other coronaviruses [30, 31] . Thereby, our analysis provides a platform for the development of a protective vaccine candidate that can be tested in-vitro and in-vivo and may lead to faster development of an efficient vaccine against the SARS-CoV-2 infection.","We now consider a more realistic population which consists of coupled sub-populations, so effectively a metapopulation model. The most obvious reason for this setup could be location/geographic or by age, but other alternatives exist including religion, ethnicity or socio-economic status. We again consider one-shot interventions that either target the entire population at once or that target individual sub-populations at different times. A typical plot of the prevalence level in each sub-populations is shown in figure 4 in the absence of intervention. The epidemic starts in sub-population two but it then spreads to all the other.","In order to prepare and manage the crisis in an optimal way, a deeper perception analysis in the form of reliable quantitative and qualitative analysis is required. Especially, according to the results of empirical research (Taranowicz [46] ), society expects institutional activities and in the event of an epidemic, it is the \"state (...) that is responsible for the poor health of the population\". Perhaps one of the reasons the Chinese have been so successful in controlling the spread of the infection is that social media like Wechat (Wang et al. [47] , Zhang et al. [48] ), or Internet forums (Liu and Lu [49] ) were analyzed by algorithms (Lu et al. [50] , Paul and Dredze [51] , Salathe et al. [52] ) with a goal to mitigate the spread of COVID-19. Combining the behavior changes detected via social media analysis with the detailed information on human mobility via e.g. mobile phone tracking (Schneider et al. [53] ), sophisticated computational models of infectious disease spread could be implemented (Belik et al. [54] , Vespignani [55] ) allowing to simulate various scenarios and assess possible human and economic losses. Furthermore, impact of public information campaigns could be measured by internal surveys of public opinion. In addition, Internet media analysis could fill gaps in socio-medical research on collective actions during an important public health disruption event such as infectious diseases. (Jarynowski and Belik [56] ).","Just over half (51.3%) of all cases were contributed by four occupation groups: healthcare workers (17.3%, revised from 16.2%); 4 government officials (12.9%); retired people (11.4%); and factory workers (9.7%). These four occupational groups contributed more than half (66.3%) of all deaths, with retired people having sustained the highest death rate (24.5%), followed by factory worker cases (8.8%), government officials (5.3%), and healthcare workers (2.5%). Those whose socio-economic status would seems to be low (e.g. retired people, farmers and unemployed people), sustained the greatest proportion of deaths (24.5%, 11.7% and 10.6%, respectively).","COVID-19 and its effects afford ample evidence of the imperative of bringing health into DRR. The economic fall-out from COVID-19 appears to be profound, at least $20 trillion in a few short weeks, and may exceed the 2008-2009 Great Recession. The direct costs of COVID-19 travel bans, social distancing, and other responses are merely one aspect. Far more devastating is the uncertainty that has gripped capital markets. Declining economic activity and large drops in capital markets have a mutually reinforcing impact, undermining the capacity of heavily indebted businesses and households to cover their debts. Uncertainty is the primary driver of such crises, and stems in large measure from lack of close coordination and science-based decision-making. Were there more certainty, households, investors and other economic agents would be less inclined to panic. COVID-19 appears certain to become a very costly lesson that DRR does indeed save many more multiples in avoided costs than its initial investment. An additional point in this regard is that health is a critical infrastructure. The resilience of critical infrastructure is well identified in DRR literature (e.g. [18, 19] ). Resilience is fostered not just by sciencebased decisions and coordination, but also via redundancy to ensure buffer capacity when a particular system collapses [20] . Disaster-illiterate economic policy tends to see redundancy as inefficiency. But in order to cope with COVID-19 and alleviate -if not prevent -future emergencies, supply chains for at least some critical items need to be more local. In tandem, governments and private businesses will have to broaden their crisis planning to ensure timely availability of items essential to limiting pandemic risks.","In mid-December 2019, the first cases of a hitherto unknown coronavirus were reported in Wuhan, China [1] . After a slow month and a half, the virus spread through the rest of the world with a ferocity that has taken doctors, scientists as well as public health officials by surprise. As we write this, the number of cases globally is almost 4,20,000 with more than 18,500 fatalities on record. China remains the most severely affected country with 81,000 cases, Italy is a close second with almost 70,000 and USA is third at 55,000. Whereas the rate of growth of new cases has slowed down to a crawl in China on account of the earlier start of the outbreak as well as several other factors, the growth rates in the rest of the world remain frighteningly high [2] . The worldwide explosion in the number of cases, together with a very high mortality rate in some countries, has resulted in extreme public health measures being adopted across the globe. Full lockdowns have already been imposed in Italy, Spain, France and in California and New York State in USA. These lockdowns followed a slew of increasingly strict social distancing measures such as cancellation of sporting events, suspension of classes, limitation of public gatherings to size 50, and closure of bars, discotheques and other entertainment venues. On Monday, a nationwide lockdown was declared in the United Kingdom, after weeks of deliberation and debate on the adverse socio-economic impacts of such a move, as the growth in new Coronavirus cases kept accelerating relentlessly. Just yesterday, a similar move was announced in India, and today in New Zealand, both ostensibly less-affected countries, after several days of steady and continuous increments in the numbers of cases.","The importance of working across boundaries is demonstrated by the innovative approach to HIV/AIDS taken by the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) and China (Hsu et al., 2000, 2004). The Early Warning Rapid Response System (EWRRS) relies upon simultaneously addressing international, regional, and local dimensions of HIV transmission, and has been a key development arising from the socio-economic cooperation among the 10 ASEAN member countries (Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Viet Nam) and China, a member of the Greater Mekong River Group. All of these countries have rapidly growing populations and are linked by the ASEAN Highway Network.","In our first five years, we have published articles on design for complex socio-technical systems; scientific, technical, and philosophical problems in fourth order design;3 design driven innovation for social and economic change; design practices in management, consulting, and public service; design for alternative economies and industrial transformation; design for sustainability; design for social innovation, organizational change, and education; design, computation, and algorithms; design and cybernetics; cultural and societal aspects of design and innovation; philosophy of design; philosophy of science for design research; design theory, methods, and methodology; and research methods and skills for the design field. Our website sets forth our journal's aims and scope. These topics reflect our content.","Aiming to reduce instances of person to person transmission, social distancing is a measure that is customarily put into action to decrease the number of contacts among individuals [24] . Examples of social distancing include closing of schools, non-essential workplace closures, and avoiding large gatherings (i.e. public transport, concerts, religious gatherings) in which a large number of individuals are in close contact and facilitating the contagion process [15] . In most cases, due to socio-economic and logistic reasons [13] , social distancing measures can only be in effect for a finite period of time (e.g., 2 weeks, 1 month, 2 months) that is typically much shorter than the full duration of the epidemic.","The emergence of Nipah virus as a human pathogen highlights the numerous opportunities, as well as some of the obstacles, to linking across disciplines to understand systemic factors influencing EIDs. Nipah virus, first identified in northern Malaysia in 1998 (Chua, 2003), is a highly virulent paramyxovirus, with case fatality rates ranging from 40%\u201370%; its reservoir hosts are several species of fruit bats (Pteropus species). In Malaysia, Nipah virus was transmitted to humans through an intermediate host, pigs. In its initial outbreak over a 35-week period, the virus caused a severe febrile encephalitis in 265 patients, of whom 115 died; 93% of the patients worked in the pig-rearing industry (Lam, 2003). Preceding the outbreak in humans was an outbreak of encephalitis and respiratory disease in pigs (Mohd Nor, 2000). The virus spread to various regions of Malaysia via movement of infected pigs, then briefly to Singapore. Economic losses in Malaysia were estimated at US $500 million (Lam, 2003). Nipah virus\u2019 high fatality rate has placed it on the US government\u2019s list of potential bio-terrorism agents.","A range of analyses of various disease emergences through a social\u2013ecological lens, from E. coli (Ali, 2004), to leptospirosis (Barcellos and Sabroza, 2001), schistosomiasis (Clennon et al., 2004) and cholera (Foll\u00e9r, 2001; Collins, 2004), already exists. Key themes emerging from such analyses are that nonlinear processes frequently operate across variable scales (Turner et al., 2003; Foley et al., 2005; Wilcox and Colwell, 2005), that improved surveillance and intervention are necessary across the socio-behavioral and ecological spectra, and that new hypotheses about disease emergences can be generated when researchers are not limited by disciplinary constraints in research design and implementation.","The immediate and long-term consequences of COVID-19 upon children is vast in terms of their health, safety and well-being. Although children have a low risk of serious illness, the unprecedented disruption of daily life for all families can affect them greatly. The isolation and restrictive measures that have been imposed upon children cause significant disruptions that are not well understood, confusing and even frightening. Not only do parents need to continuously monitor their children's health exposure and illness potential in the short-term but they now must deal with a host of uncertainties that surround their families. These uncertainties are pervasive and of paramount concern such as obtaining sufficient food and supplies, having to stay home from work with or without pay, home-schooling their children and meeting household expenses. These are vulnerable times for all families and their children, especially for families living paycheck to paycheck. Many of the long-term impacts of COVID-19 will go well beyond the initial phase of pandemic containment. COVID-19 has no specific viral affinity for the poor but those from lower socio-economic backgrounds will assume the greatest social burden."],"title":["Impacts of social and economic factors on the transmission of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in China","Need for integrative thinking to fight against emerging infectious diseases.
