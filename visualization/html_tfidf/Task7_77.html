Preventive measures for COVID-19, including case and contact tracing, quarantine and screening, as well as education to encourage good hand hygiene practices, should be in place. Additional and pre-emptive measures must be taken for malaria control in these countries, anticipating the potential challenge that would be faced by the public health system during an outbreak of COVID-19. In the case of Ebola, it was estimated that malaria cases in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone could have increased by up to 1 million in 2014 as a result of a cessation of distribution of insecticide-treated bednets (ITNs). 10 Governments and health leaders in malaria-endemic regions must ensure that such stresses to medical infrastructure are minimised in the event of an outbreak of COVID-19. Resource allocation should be optimised whenever possible to ensure minimal disruption to malaria control should COVID-19 management become necessary. Management of medical supplies and stockpiling of surgical masks and other protective equipment should be done in advance and medical staff should be adequately trained in their use. In cases of emergency, mass drug administration and the distribution of ITNs might be considered for short-term malaria relief in hyperendemic areas. Such measures would also aid efforts in COVID-19 management by reducing the strain on medical resources and minimising confounding factors in diagnosis. Previous successful implementation of such measures occurred during Ebola outbreaks in Sierra Leone in 2014-15 and in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in 2018, in accordance with WHO guidelines. 11, 12 In malaria-endemic regions, malaria diagnostics should be systematically added to fever management, including for suspected cases of COVID-19, and health-care facilities should be well stocked with artemisinin combination therapy drugs. Infection management protocols, such as social distancing, mask-wearing, and prompt seeking of diagnostic testing and necessary treatment, should be communicated in advance. These measures will require collective political will and unity in a coordinated effort by African countries.","It is widely recognized that screening is an imperfect barrier to spread (Bitar et al., 2009; Cowling et al., 2010; Gostic et al., 2015; Mabey et al., 2014; Quilty et al., 2020), due to: the absence of detectable symptoms during the incubation period; variation in the severity and detectability of symptoms once the disease begins to progress; imperfect performance of screening equipment or personnel; or active evasion of screening by travellers. Previously we estimated the effectiveness of traveller screening for a range of pathogens that have emerged in the past, and found that arrival screening would miss 50\u201375% of infected cases even under optimistic assumptions (Gostic et al., 2015). Yet the quantitative performance of different policies matters for planning interventions and will influence how public health authorities prioritize different measures as the international and domestic context changes. Here we use a mathematical model to analyse the expected performance of different screening measures for COVID-19, based on what is currently known about its natural history and epidemiology and on different possible combinations of departure and arrival screening policies.","The variation in practice patterns worldwide points to the need for a network of international ophthalmology partners, to develop evidence-based consensus on risk mitigation protocols that adequately protect the public, patients, staff, and ophthalmologists. Clear consensus statements with regards to operational issues such as clinic flow protocols, instrument cleaning protocols and the appropriate use of PPE under different circumstances will help systems in the appropriate allocation of scarce resources. In addition, the mandate to gather evidence during this pandemic that will guide our approach to this and future outbreaks is clear. Following the tragic loss of life and health during the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) epidemic of 2003, many countries have used lessons learned to inform their policies during the current COVID-19 pandemic. We must all do the same. As we face the unique, extraordinary challenges of this pandemic, rapid adaptations are required in the U.S. and around the world.","During this period, 238 people were infected and 33 fatalities occurred in Singapore, five of whom were health care professionals 8 . Infection and quarantine of healthcare workers caused a widespread disruption of patient care. 44% (12 of 27) of current senior NCIS faculty were practicing during the SARS epidemic, bringing \"institutional memory\" to this outbreak. Below are specific lessons that were considered vital to the business continuity operations of a cancer center during an outbreak: a. Staff need to be protected from infection risk and burnout due to manpower shortage from quarantine, necessitating drastic workflow changes b. Limited resources and facilities for oncological care and infection control, including blood products, isolation rooms and PPE will be depleted during outbreaks, necessitating careful allocation or re-designation c. The difficulty in identifying viral infection in cancer patients poses unique challenges to screening and in-hospital transmission; requiring distinct surveillance protocols from non-cancer patients d. Workflows and policies evolve rapidly during an outbreak, requiring an adaptable framework for clinical care and therapeutic trials, that can be escalated or de-escalated quickly in coordination with the hospital/ nation.","Hospitals did not consistently have written policies for SARS infection control practices, triage of patients with possible SARS, and visitation requirements to rooms of patients with possible SARS. Even when available, the policies were not consistently applied. For example, 2 of the 9 hospitals with written protocols on SARS triage admitted patients with possible SARS infection directly to the regular ward before being evaluated and isolated.","This limited initial US experience suggests a need for immediate changes in obstetric clinical practice. Two of seven (28.6%) confirmed COVID-19-positive patients in this early series were asymptomatic upon admission to the obstetrical service, and these same two patients ultimately required unplanned ICU admission. Importantly, their care prior to COVID-19 diagnosis involved exposures to multiple health care workers, all of whom lacked appropriate PPE. Further, five of seven confirmed COVID-19-positive women were afebrile on initial screen, and four did not first report a cough (Table 1) . COVID-19 screening and testing protocols currently vary by institution, but in some locations where testing availability remains limited, the minimal symptoms reported for some of these cases might have been insufficient to prompt COVID-19 testing.","Presently, RT-PCR detection of MERS-CoV RNA remains the most reliable method for laboratory confirmation of infection. However, an actual \"gold standard\" is yet to be classified, with most assays relying on the 2 gene UpE/Orf1a signatures for screening and confirmation of MERS-CoV RNA. This comparative analysis of MERS-CoV rRT-PCR assays evaluates their clinical sensitivity and presents their C T values to enable a robust comparison of diagnostic assay performances on NPOP specimens under our testing conditions. Although C T values from different assays can be affected by various assay components and platforms used, our analyses of 34 URT specimens showed the TIB MolBiol\u00ae LightMix assays to be the most sensitive (94.12%), followed by the Anyplex\u2122 Seegene and GeneSig\u00ae protocols. Discordant results between the assays were seen with those specimens containing low virus concentrations (high C T values), reflecting differences in the limits of detection (LOD) . Evaluating the LOD is critical to preventing underdiagnoses of MERS-CoV infections, and should be a consideration when selecting a commercial assay for routine diagnostics. For these purposes, the European Virus Archive has produced quantitative standards for UpE and Orf1a. However, we were unable to obtain these standards during this investigation. Nevertheless, the TIB MolBiol\u00ae LightMix and GeneSig\u00ae protocols (Assays 2-3) produced some single gene-positive (indeterminate) results, which in a clinical diagnostic setting would require further confirmation by screening a secondary specimen (ideally from the LRT where a higher viral load is expected) before overall interpretation as \"MERS-CoV negative\". Additionally, the GeneSig\u00ae and Anyplex\u2122 Seegene assays also produced several negative classifications for our sequence-confirmed specimens. No such indeterminate or negative results were observed with the RealStar\u00ae assay.","We deliver an R software package that is able to output the MCMC estimation, inference and prediction under the epidemiological model with two proposed extended SIR models that incorporate time-varying quarantine protocols. These new models have been discussed in detail in Sections 2.2 and 2.3. Our R package, named eSIR, uses daily-updated time series of infected and removed proportions as input data. The R package is available at GitHub lilywang1988/eSIR, and its user manual is appended as the supplementary material of this paper. The quarantine functions are predefined and will be treated as known functions of protocols/policies in the estimation and 9 All rights reserved.

We also assumed traveller adherence and no active evasion of screening. However, there are informal reports of people taking antipyretics to beat fever screening (Mahbubani, 2020), which would further reduce the effectiveness of these methods. With travel restrictions in place, individuals may also take alternative routes (e.g. road rather than air), which would in effect circumvent departure and/or arrival screening as a control measure. Our quantitative findings may overestimate screening effectiveness if many travellers evade screening.","As country-specific screening policies can change rapidly in real-time, we focused on a general 301 screening framework rather than specific case studies. We also assumed traveller adherence 302 and no active evasion of screening. However, there are informal reports of people taking 303 antipyretics to beat fever screening (Mahbubani, 2020), which would further reduce the 304 effectiveness of these methods. With travel restrictions in place, individuals may also take 305 alternative routes (e.g. road rather than air), which would in effect circumvent departure and/or 306 arrival screening as a control measure. Our quantitative findings may overestimate screening 307 effectiveness if many travellers evade screening. 308 309","4. \" adm2_name \": If the dataset contains observations at the \"Adm2\" level, then this is the name of the \"Adm2\" region to which this observation belongs. 5. \" adm [1, 2] _id \": Any alphanumeric ID scheme to identify different administrative units (e.g. FIPS code). 6. \" lat \": The latitude of the centroid of the administrative unit. 7. \" lon \": The longitude of the centroid of the administrative unit. 8. \" policies_enacted \": The number of active policies that are in place for the administrative unit as of that date. This variable is not population weighted. 9. \" testing_regime \": A categorical variable used to identify when an administrative region (or country) changed their COVID-19 testing regime. This is zero-indexed, with the ordering only indicating chronological progression (there is no external meaning to Regime 2 vs. Regime 1 vs. Regime 0, and there is no consistency enforced for coding across countries). For example, if China changes their testing regime twice, all observations prior to the first regime change would be coded \" testing_regime =0,\" all observations in between the two changes would be coded \" testing_regime =1,\" and all observations after the second change would be coded \" testing_regime =2.\"","The third, and perhaps largest objective of the Working Group, is to strengthen influenza-related public health practices, infrastructure, and research. A successful component of this objective is the promotion of adult immunization programs with improved vaccine coverage of individuals at increased risk of complications from influenza. Several groups are developing communications networks and protocols to disseminate up-to-date information to healthcare providers and the public. Research on influenza biology and epidemiology, animal surveillance, and vaccine and antiviral development has been and will continue to be supported by NIH through grants to academic researchers and through grants that support public-private partnerships. Development of cell culture-based vaccines and the testing in humans of candidate pandemic vaccines made using reverse genetics or classical reassortment techniques should be encouraged. There is also a need to test adjuvanted vaccines and to develop new antiviral agents. It is noteworthy that there are currently only two influenza vaccine manufacturers licensed to distribute vaccine in the US for the 2003-2004 influenza season. It is also noteworthy that 80-90% of produced vaccine is purchased privately, and it takes nearly a full year from the time of selection of strains to the production of usable vaccine. As a result, it will be essential to encourage new vaccine manufacturers and new approaches, including reverse genetics to prepare seed strains, in addition to developing and implementing a vaccine policy that ensures adequate and fair procurement and distribution of the vaccine during an influenza pandemic. Such policies will need to take into account liability protection and equitable global access. Finally, identifying appropriate antiviral drugs to stockpile and developing plans to prioritize use of these antivirals are necessary for pandemic preparedness.","\u2022 Social distancing -keeping at least six feet (1.8 meters) between individuals in waiting rooms and work spaces as much as feasible. \u2022 Encourage sick employees to stay home. Personnel who develop respiratory symptoms (e.g., cough, shortness of breath) or unexplained fever should be instructed not to report to work. \u2022 Ensure that your sick leave policies are flexible and consistent with public health guidance and that employees are aware of these policies. Make contingency plans for increased absenteeism \u2022 Screen patients and visitors for symptoms of acute respiratory illness (e.g., fever, cough, difficulty breathing) or gastrointestinal symptoms and coronavirus exposure in the last 2 weeks before entering one's healthcare facility (4). \u2022 Ensure technologist and CCT imager hand hygiene best practices. If soap and water are not readily available, use of a hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol. \u2022 Consider standard droplet precautions for patients and healthcare personnel as per institutional infection control protocols. \u2022 Increase scheduling intervals or appointment times to allow adequate time to clean equipment as needed. \u2022 Leverage telemedicine technologies and isolated workstations to allow for reading and interpretation, that allow for social distancing to limit staff exposure, when possible. \u2022 Assign a team member to monitor and incorporate regular updates from the CDC and appropriate regional jurisdictions.","We assumed a constant ascertainment period of d =5 days between symptom onset and testing (Ferguson et al., 2020) . Because of the evidence of pre-symptomatic transmission (Tindale et al., 2020), we also assumed that cases become infectious one day before symptom onset. To account for substantial uncertainty around reporting rates, we assigned different reporting rates to individual locations based on the testing criteria enacted in that location (Niehus et al., 2020) . For each country and state, we first extracted testing criteria from the department or ministry of health website. We assumed that countries or states with similar testing criteria policies captured similar proportions of true infections. Using the respective testing criteria, we categorized countries or states as having narrow, moderate, or broad testing levels. We then assigned reporting rates to each testing level by using the mean and 95% confidence interval of the reporting rate estimated by Nishiura et al. (Nishiura et al., 2020) : 0.092 (95% CI= 0.05-0.20). The reporting rate for the broadest testing level, \u03c1=0.20, also corresponded to the reporting rate in Mainland China (Chinazzi et al., 2020) . We thus assigned Iran, Florida, Washington, and Illinois to a \"narrow\" testing level (\u03c1=0.05); Spain, Italy, and Louisiana to a \"moderate'' testing level (\u03c1=0.092); and China, Germany, and California to a \"broad\" testing level (\u03c1=0.20, Data S2 , \"testing-criteria\" ).","Next, we assess the overall effectiveness of a screening program by modeling screening outcomes in a hypothetical population of infected travellers, each with a different time since exposure (and hence a different probability of having progressed through incubation to show detectable symptoms). Crucially, the distribution of times since exposure will depend on the epidemiology of the source population, so this overall measure is not a simple average of the individual-level outcomes. We estimate the fraction of infected travellers detected, breaking down the ways in which screening can succeed or fail. An alternate measure of program success is the extent to which screening delays the first importation of cases into the community, possibly providing additional time to train medical staff, deploy public health responders or refine travel policies (Cowling et al., 2010). To quantify the potential for screening to delay case importation, we estimate the probability that a given screening program would detect the first n or more imported cases before missing an infected person.","An essential component of infection-control strategy is staff training and the implementation of clear management protocols, including the use of PPE, monitoring staff health, quarantining staff, transport of patients, transfer to ICU, airway management, aerosol-generating procedures, environment and equipment disinfection, and visitation policies.","On 30 January 2020, the World Health Organization declared that the COVID-19 outbreak constituted a Public Health Emergency of International Concern and the development of reliable laboratory diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 became mandatory to identify, isolate and provide optimized care for patients early 1 . RT-qPCR testing of respiratory secretions is routinely used to detect causative viruses in acute respiratory infection and, during a Public Health Emergency of International Concern, the establishment of standardized processes and protocols, as well as sharing of specimens, data, and information is critical. RT-qPCR in-house protocols to detect the SARS-CoV-2 have been described 2 . Validations of these protocols are considered a key knowledge gap for COVID-19, especially if executed in a high throughput format. Here, we investigate the analytical sensitivity and specificity of two interim RT-qPCR protocols 3,4 for the qualitative detection of SARS-CoV-2 executed in a fully automated platform.","Our analysis accounts for some known changes in the availability of testing for COVID-19 and changes in testing procedures; however, it is likely that other unobserved changes in patterns of testing could affect our results. For example, if growing awareness of COVID-19 caused an increasing fraction of infected individuals to be tested over time, then unadjusted infection growth rates later in our sample would be biased upwards. Because an increasing number of policies are active later in these samples as well, this bias would cause our current findings to understate the overall effectiveness of anti-contagion policies.","In summary, we find that targeting air-travellers with syndromic screening at exit or entry and sensitisation for signs of symptoms following their arrival may delay a major outbreak in the early stages of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak. In most countries, air-traveller sensitisation and rapid contact tracing protocols are already in place in response to the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak. We find that syndromic screening at arrival may further enhance such control efforts while the number of infected passengers is less than about 10 per week, but only in the absence of syndromic screening at departure.","We obtained 107 registered protocols of clinical studies on COVID-19: 84 from chictr.org.cn and 23 from clinicaltrials.gov. After screening, 78 protocols met the eligibility criteria: 52 with interventions of chemical or biological drugs and 26 with traditional Chinese medicine plus standard treatments.","Pharmacists could also provide public services, such as local guidelines and treatment protocols, medication use review and evaluation, national medicine policies and essential medicine lists, pharmacovigilance, needs assessment, and pharmacoepidemiology (Wiedenmayer et al., 2006) . Pharmacists should be at the front line to promote safe sex, birth control education, advice on nursing babies, and caring for elderly parents and relatives. In addition, pharmacists could work with local authorities in the direction of a cleaner and safer environment (air, water, and ground) and for safe food handling. Pharmacists should only carry in stock and sell products with proven medical value, not selling tobacco products, and not supplements and homeopathic medicines that have no clear scientific evidence of safety and effectiveness.","The single drug approach used initially to treat or prevent malaria has now given way to combination therapy including artemisinin (Box 4.6) as resistance emerges across the world. The molecular basis for drug resistance is complex involving many genes including pfCRT, pfMDR which is an ortholog of the P-glycoproteins found in mammals in association with multidrug resistance in cancer (Chapter 7), and mutations in the DHFR gene that produce resistance to antifolate drugs. and plasma-derived products. Previously, blood transfusion services based their donor and blood screening programs on detecting antibodies or antigens in the donor or blood supply. However, this has proved to be inadequate, and an important addition to the screening protocols is the use of PCR to identify viral DNA or RNA. The advantages of a NAT include higher sensitivity and greater reliability during the window period -which is the time between a blood donor becoming infectious and donor screening tests becoming positive, i.e. seroconversion has occurred. The use of NAT, better serologic-based assays and more effective regulatory controls have made contemporary blood products considerably safer. Ultimately, transfusion services must balance safety against access to blood and its products. What is screened for will depend on the types of infections found within a geographic region as well as affordability of the screening tests.","As of 14 January 2020, protocols for RT-PCR of 2019-nCoV are being published on the WHO website [7]. At survey closure (29 January 2020), the envelope (E)-gene screening test as published by Corman et al. [6,7], had been implemented by 35 laboratories and the confirmatory RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp)-gene test and nucleoprotein (N)-gene test by respectively 33 and 21 laboratories. Sixteen laboratories indicated to have additional tests, i.e. in house tests (n = 5), pan-CoV tests (n = 12) or an assay based on Poon et al. (n = 1) [7]. Two laboratories indicated to base 2019-nCoV testing solely on previously published pan-CoV tests [8]. ","The composition of haplotypes changed substantially from early targeted testing to later targeted testing (Figure 4) . The A2a1 and A2a2 haplotypes which had collectively made up 103 out of 157 haplotypes (65.6%) in the early targeted testing were reduced to 44 of 144 haplotypes (30.6%) in the late targeted testing, mostly because of the increased frequency of the A1a and A2a haplotypes, the two most common haplotypes in the population screening. This is probably because the population screening identified clusters of infected individuals who seeded from areas that had not been designated as high-risk e.g. the UK. The later targeted testing was then more likely to find new individuals from these clusters, both because the targeted testing was extended to include more high-risk areas and because the population screening had identified cases that could be used to inform further contact tracking efforts.","As of February 20, 2020, the 2019 novel coronavirus (now named SARS-CoV-2, causing the disease COVID-19) has caused over 75,000 confirmed cases inside of China and has spread to 25 other countries (World Health Organization, 2020b). (HCoV-19 has been proposed as an alternate name for the virus; Jiang et al., 2020). Until now, local transmission remained limited outside of China, but as of this week, new epidemic hotspots have become apparent on multiple continents (World Health Organization, 2020a; Jankowicz, 2020; Sang-Hun, 2020; Schnirring, 2020a). Many jurisdictions have imposed traveller screening in an effort to prevent importation of COVID-19 cases to unaffected areas. Some high-income countries have escalated control measures beyond screening-based containment policies, and now restrict or quarantine inbound travellers from countries known to be experiencing substantial community transmission. Meanwhile, in many other countries, screening remains the primary barrier to case importation (Guardian reporting team, 2020; Schengen Visa Info, 2020). Even in countries with the resources to enforce quarantine measures, expanded arrival screening may be the first logical response as the source epidemic expands to regions outside China. Furthermore, symptom screening has become a ubiquitous tool in the effort to contain local spread of COVID-19, in settings from affected cities to cruise ships to quarantines. Our analysis is pertinent to all of these contexts.","Previous WHO guidelines for screening of the novel coronavirus were determined by travel to, or residence in, the Arabian Peninsula. 2, 10, 11 Although by defi nition these might indicate the pattern of diagnosed infections, the focus on the Middle East would have led to individuals with this viral infection in other geographical regions being missed. Latest WHO guidelines now recommend universal screening to defi ne the epidemiology of this novel coronavirus. 12 Available molecular tests for detection of active cases of infection and screening of contacts are experimental and their sensitivity and specifi city require defi nition. Serological tests for the novel coronavirus are urgently needed for accurate assessment of infection in asymptomatic contacts and for large-scale serosurveys to improve understanding of the epidemiology and global geographical distribution of this virus. Validated standard treatment protocols and case investigation forms are also needed. Findings of controlled studies of cases and contacts could provide information that leads to the source of infection.","All successful strategies for preventing healthcare-associated infections require a multifaceted evidence-based approach that includes providing practitioners with best evidence for clinically effective practice and then supporting them to understand and use this evidence to minimise infection risks and increase patient safety. This presentation will describe how national evidence-based guidelines from the Department of Health and the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence in England form the foundations for ensuring the availability of best evidence to practitioners in the National Health Service (NHS) and, how the development of an associated e-learning/blended learning programme is now supporting all practitioners to effectively use this evidence to protect patients from the risk of preventable infections during care. By incorporating these national guidelines into local policies and protocols and then into routine daily clinical practice, patient safety can be enhanced and the risk of patients acquiring an infection during episodes of healthcare in NHS facilities in England minimised.","Furthermore, in cases of emergencies like the current outbreak of COVID-19 and any other, the need for observance of regulatory practices and international healthcare guidelines are paramount. This would ensure that both healthcare professionals and the general populace are informed, protected and remain within the prescribed rules and regulations. As noted by the WHO [40] , the healthcare guidelines and regulatory practices are advanced to also ensure that the health risk in question is reduced together with its consequences. In the current era of technological advancement, such regulations and guidelines are paramount as they have potential to lead to positive or negative outcomes. The position of this paper is to advance that it now possible to integrate technologies like the use of smart devices through IoT networks and wearable devices, data from mobile apps and others to help users to share information with accredited and certified health professionals, and in this case, improve the outcomes for better cross disciplinary and more resilient protocols and policies.","Healthcare strategy is a key driver of successful infection control in healthcare settings. Policies and plans of healthcare service, patient delivery, human resources, financial and material resources, and communication are all important for the improvement of the management strategy of a hospital [23]. A strategy for the prevention of HAIs should not only provide bio-security of HCWs and patients but also ensure a positive practice environment. For example, many medical instruments can become sources of infection because of the difficulty in cleaning them [24]. However, emergency plans are necessary for healthcare systems to respond effectively to an outbreak of a highly infectious disease [25]. Studies in North America show that nearly all hospitals (99.0%) have emergency medical response plans for chemical emergencies, natural disasters, disease outbreaks, and biological attacks [26]. These plans include HCWs training, patient evacuation, communication, and medical resource supporting. Furthermore, emergency medical response protocols should be updated and distributed in time, thus minimizing confusion from healthcare staff when the disaster strikes [27].","The estimates above describe the superposition of all policies deployed in each country, i.e. they represent, for each country, the average effect of policies on infection growth rates that we would expect to observe, if all policies enacted anywhere in the country were implemented simultaneously in a region of the country. We also estimate the effects of individual types of policies or clusters of policies that are grouped based on their similarity in goal (e.g., closing libraries and closing 5 . museums are grouped) or timing (e.g., policies that are generally deployed simultaneously in a certain country). In many cases, our estimates for these effects are statistically noisier than the estimates for all policies combined (presented above) because we are estimating multiple effects simultaneously. Thus, we are less confident in individual estimates and in their relative rankings. Estimated effects differ between countries, and policies are neither identical nor perfectly comparable in their implementation across countries or, in many cases, across different localities within the same country. Nonetheless, overall we estimate that almost all policies likely contribute to slowing the growth rate of infections (Figure 2c ), except two policies (social distancing in France and Italy) where point estimates are slightly positive, small in magnitude, and not statistically different from zero.","We propose a pooling extension to existing SARS-CoV-2 testing protocols to boost efficiency and better utilize scarce resources. These are not meant to be a replacement for wide-spread testing, but instead might act as a stop-gap measure to reduce the number of RNA extractions and testing steps performed while still identifying asymptomatic or mild cases. Even so, there are numerous reasons why the use of such strategies is not popular.","The first step of stem cell product manufacture is acquisition of stem cells from a suitable donor source. Whether human or animal donors are used, the principles of donor suitability are similar and rely on detailed knowledge of medical status and history of the donor. Infectious adventitious agents are of primary concern in terms of safety. For nonhuman stem cells, Public Health Service (PHS) and FDA guidance documents 3,6 put forth extensive recommendations for animal husbandry, health surveillance, disease screening, and veterinary care of donor animals. For human sources the FDA advises medical history screening and infectious agent testing and may recommend genetic screening or testing depending on patient populations, donor pool, and evolution of genetic testing technology. Details of donor suitability and screening are described in more detail in the subsection on donor screening in the section on manufacturing and characterization issues for stem cell products.","It was disconcerting that almost 11% of physicians attended work regardless of reporting new SARS-like symptoms, and that additionally some of the \"non-SARS symptoms\" reported were in fact SARS symptoms listed on screening protocols that every hospital staff member completed daily on hospital entry. The screening protocol does specify \"unexplained\" myalgia or malaise, \"severe\" headache, and shortness of breath that is \"worse than what is normal for you,\" and included temperature assessment. Because the self-report nature of our survey precluded deeper probing regarding physicians' perceptions regarding the severity of their symptoms or whether there was a direct alternative explanation for their symptoms, we cannot definitively conclude that physicians failed to comply with the screening precautions (although Occupational Health and the Department of Infectious Diseases reported that only a few physicians consulted them concerning their symptoms). However, our findings may reflect low perceived susceptibility, 18 a sense of invulnerability to contracting SARS, or an optimistic bias, 19 despite the fact that health care workers in affected hospitals are at greatly increased risk 20, 21 and almost half of our respondents knew an infected colleague. Considering that this behavior could lead to further transmission of this highly virulent infection, additional investigation and preventive action are imperative.","Objectives: The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) determines the minimum drug concentration inhibiting 100,000 cfu/ml of bacteria in vitro whereas the mutant prevention concentration (MPC) determines the minimum drug concentration required to block the growth of first-step mutants when \u2021 1 billion cfu are applied to drug containing agar plates. While MIC testing is standardized and controlled using American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) strains, similar standardized protocols are not yet available for MPC testing. We compared MIC and MPC results with 2 ATCC strains repeatedly tested against 5 quinolones to document MIC and MPC QC ranges. Methods: MIC testing was based on current Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute procedures using a 100,000 cfu/ml inoculum and for MPC testing \u2021 1 billion cfu was inoculated to drug containing media-each in 2-fold concentration increments. Optimal media, incubation in established atmospheres and temperatures were used. For each organism type, lowest drug concentration preventing growth was recorded as either the MIC or MPC. ATCC strains included S. aureus (SA) 29213 and S. pneumoniae (SP) 49619 tested against garenoxacin (GAR), gatifloxacin (GAT), gemifloxacin (GEM), levofloxacin (LFX) and moxifloxacin (MFX). Results: Following 12-42 repeat MIC assays, MICs were within acceptable QC limits with the majority of MICs being at the middle of the QC range (53-87%) for all organisms/compounds tested. By MPC testing, the following QC organism MPC results (ug/ml) were noted against ATCC strains 29213, 49619:GAR 0.063-2, 0.063-0.5; GAT 0.125-0.5, 0.25-2; GEM 0.063-0.5, 0.125-2; LFX 0.5-1, 1-4; MFX 0.063-0.25, 0.125-2. As with MIC results, the QC strains MPC values fell within the middle of the MPC ranges (62-86%) for the majority of the compounds and strains tested. Conclusion: As with MIC testing, MPC testing provides reproducible QC organism results that are consistent over narrow drug concentration ranges with the majority of MPCs being at the middle of the range. The MPC drug concentration ranges presented may serve as a useful guide to insuring MPC assay accuracy for clinical isolates of SP and SA tested against quinolones.","Before delving into the details of the proposed procedure, a word of caution is needed since, unfortunately, a visual inspection of the database suggests the presence of a number of anomalous data both at a regional and country level. The detected anomalies might be associated to the biological samples collecting process and the testing procedures. In fact, the typical lab-workflow is governed by a set of rigid protocols which might be critically affected by factors such as the availability of manpower, swabs, reagents and other laboratory materials. In emergency situations, such a workflow can be disrupted and temporal inconsistency might appear as a result. For example, a set of samples might be delivered to a laboratory with longer than usual delays with respect to the time of collection or a given lab can only complete a screening process for a certain number of samples. In both the cases, one day (or more) shift in the release of the lab results can be reasonably expected. A further source of anomalies is represented by the data entry and data editing processes, carried out in working environment necessarily affected by the risk of contagious and under rigid deadlines.","Objective: The aim of the present study was to evaluate the performance of VIDAS and LIAISON toxoplasmosis, cytomegalovirus and rubella panels in routine conditions in our laboratory. Material: A study was performed during 3 weeks on 269 sera either from the laboratory routine or from the site sample collection for toxoplasmosis, 126 sera cytomegalovirus and 125 for rubella IgG testing. We have evaluated the performance of the VIDAS TOXO IgG II, VIDAS TOXO IgM, VIDAS CMV IgG, VIDAS CMV IgM, RUB IgG, VIDAS assays (bioM\u00e9rieux, Marcy l'Etoile, France) in comparison with the LIAISON Toxo IgG, LIAISON Toxo IgM, LIAISON CMV IgG, LIAISON CMV IgM, LIAISON Rub IgG assays (DiaSorin, Saluggia, Italy). The VIDAS TOXO IgG and CMV IgG avidity and LIAISON Toxo IgG and CMV IgG avidity assays were used in case of IgG and IgM positive results (14 sera for toxoplasmosis and 13 for CMV). Complementary testing was performed in case of discrepancies such as immunofluorescence, ISAGA, IF and other ELISA tests. In addition, the following parameters were assessed for both systems: instrument set up, maintenance, time to result, ergonomics, general practicability. Results: The correlation obtained for rubella IgG, CMV IgG, Toxo IgG and avidity assay for CMV or toxoplasmosis was good for both systems. Regarding the CMV, we obtained 1 discrepant result for the IgG when 9 were found for the IgM; perfect correlation on the avidity tests between both system was found. Regarding the Toxoplasmosis we observed 3 discrepant results for the IgG and 10 for the IgM, for the avidity 2 samples were equivocal, 1 in each method. The VIDAS System is more specific for IgM detection, in fact the LIAISON results showed more frequently no specific or residual IgM detection. The ergonomics of each system shows advantages and disadvantages inconvenient. The decision to choose one of these two systems is related to organisation strategies according to the laboratory specificity and panels available. Conclusion: The results obtained during this study demonstrate that VIDAS is more specific for the diagnosis of acute CMV or Toxoplasmosis infections even if the LIAISON is more adapted to high throughput routine testing. These two systems can be easily integrated and used in the same laboratory. Background and aims: Sensitivity is the fundamental analytical requisite of assays for the surface antigen (HBsAg) of hepatitis B virus (HBV), since the determination of HBsAg is carried out both for blood donation screening and for screening and diagnosis of the general population; assay specificity is also important in low-prevalence settings. We aimed to investigate the diagnostic accuracy of two automated chemiluminescent immunoassays for HBsAg (Abbott Architect and Ortho Vitros) on selected repository specimens. Materials and methods: We selected 94 serum samples who gave a repeat reactivity by our routine screening assay for HBsAg (Abbott AxSYM HBsAg) and that were classified as true or false positives according to the result of a confirmatory neutralization assay and/or by serological or clinical criteria. All specimens were assayed under code by Architect and Vitros HBsAg in a different lab and the results were reported to our Center. Results: The samples were divided into two groups: (a) 30 false positives by AxSYM, all negative by Vitros and 28 (93.3%) negative by Architect; (b) 64 true positives (57 neutralized, 3 viremic, 4 positive for other markers and with a history of HBV infection). The Architect assay gave a positive result on 63 specimens, the only negative being a patient clearing HBsAg after an acute infection. In contrast, the Vitros assay was positive only in 34 cases, grayzone negative in 4 and negative in 26. Interestingly, 7 of the samples negative by Vitros showed a strong reactivity by Architect, [sample/cutoff (S/CO) ratios from 100 to &gt;5000], and three showed also a strong reactivity for anti-HBs (&gt;240 mUI/mL), suggesting the possible presence of surface antigens escape mutations. Conclusions: The assay for HBsAg on the Architect analyser was accurate in the discrimination of true from false positives, whereas the Vitros assay gave a surprisingly high rate of false negatives. In 19 cases this was probably due to a lower analytical sensitivity, but for the remaining seven specimens, showing a strong positivity for HBsAg by both AxSYM and Architect HBsAg, the negativity by Vitros may be related to its limited capability to recognize HBsAg mutants, as reported in the literature. In our opinion, it is urgent to clarify the prevalence and clinical impact of surface antigen variants in the current epidemiological setting in Italy as well as in the other countries in which anti-hepatitis B vaccination policies are established.","In the above case, though major cities are known to prepare themselves for potential outbreaks, their health policies and protocols are observed to diverge from one another. Thus, without a global collaborative approach, progress towards working for a cure and universally acceptable policy approach can take longer. Such fears, of a lack of international collaboration, were highlighted by the World Health Organization (WHO) during an emergency meeting in Geneva on 22nd January 2020 to determine whether the virus outbreak had reached a level warranting international emergency concern. However, WHO was satisfied that China was being proactive in this case, unlike in 2002, when China withheld information on the outbreak for far too long, causing delays in addressing the epidemic [3] . As in this instance, it is the opinion in this paper that if there was seamless collaboration and seamless sharing of data between different cities, it would not warrant such a high-level meeting to result in action, and instead, a decision could have been made much earlier. On this, the saddest part is that some global cities are less prepared to handle the challenges posed by this type of outbreak for lack of information on issues like symptoms of the virus, the protective measures to be taken, and the treatment procedures that an infected person should be processed through, amongst other issues.","During SARS 2003, Taiwan implemented a nationwide version of TCB that proved effective at minimizing nosocomial infection of healthcare workers (HCWs), patients, and visitors to hospitals. 3, 4 Traffic Control Bundling is a version of multi-modal care that Taiwan has successfully implemented in the past. 7,8 TCB is an integrated infection control strategy that include triage prior to entering hospitals; strict separation among zones of risk, and; strict requirements and protocols for personal protective equipment (PPE) use coupled with checkpoint hand disinfection. 3 TCB protocols include initial \"triage outside of hospitals\" -patients found to be infected with SARS-CoV during triage at outdoor fever screening stations are sent directly through a guarded control route to a designated contamination zone; \"zones of risk\" -clearly distinguished contamination, transition and clean zones. HCWs moving from contamination to clean zones must undertake decontamination and degowning in the transition zone, and hand disinfection at every checkpoint between the zones.","One reason for successful Tay Sachs screening was the nature of the target group, which comprised individuals of Jewish origin who had better educational opportunities and social infrastructure. Another contrast between the two programs was the close community consultation undertaken prior to testing for Tay Sachs. Because of the problems associated with sickle cell screening, changes were made, including the removal of legal compulsion to be screened and improved counseling and education facilities. These enabled more successful testing to be pursued. Experiences with these programs illustrate the necessity for counseling and public education to explain the significance of mass screening results as key ethical considerations in design. Today, there are other population DNA screening dilemmas including: (1) Cystic fibrosis population screening, and (2) Sickle cell trait screening in sport.","Bottom line: I do not believe ophthalmic screening is necessary for COVID-19 patients who take CQ or HCQ for less than 2 weeks as anti-viral therapy, since the likelihood of retinal damage is exceedingly low even with high doses. In a time of pandemic with world-wide shortages of medical personnel, funds, hospital beds, equipment, screening tests, and proven therapy, it would be counterproductive (and raise inappropriate fears) to suggest the addition of labor-intensive and expensive eye exams that are of low yield. However, as new protocols arise these will have to evaluated relative to the risk of retinopathy that their particular doses and durations of use may pose.","Fortunately for screening programs faced with evaluation of tens to thousands of hits, the most informative experiments are among the easiest to perform and are the most amenable to high-throughput methods. Often, the experimental assay that initially identified the screening hit can be easily modified to accomplish many of the initial tests of promiscuity. Additionally, these protocols can be used to assay for other mechanisms of promiscuity, such as chemical reactivity. If the original assay lacks sufficient dynamic range or is otherwise difficult to alter, it may be simpler to use easily purchased model enzyme systems such as chymotrypsin or b-lactamase. Colorimetric, kinetic assays have proven to be especially robust for these purposes.","3. Health care worker screening: According to the COVID-19 diagnosis guidelines, the staff returning to work must be screened for the disease. Only those cleared the screening could return to posts. 4. Staff training: Before returning to posts, the staff receives training to learn about COVID-19 prevention and protection. The staff learns the protection level of their corresponding role, the appropriate personal protection equipment (PPE) for the role (a radiation therapist wearing PPE during treatment delivery is shown in Fig 1) , as well as the dons and doffs. 5. Zoning: The radiotherapy center is zoned into different contamination levels (Clean Zone; Semi-soiled/semi-contaminated Zone; and Soiled/Contaminated Zone) and is periodically disinfected following corresponding frequencies and protocols.","Policies and guidelines should also mention implementation of a comprehensive respiratory protection program for respirator use, which includes selection of certified respirators, training and fit checking and testing, and inspection, maintenance and storage ( Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) 2002 ). Certified respirators should be used in healthcare settings and certification processes should be managed by a regulatory body, for example in the US the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health regulates the certification process under regulation 42 CFR 84 ( National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) 1995 ). Similarly, in Europe, the European Norm standard ( European Directive ) and in Australia, AS/ NZS 1716 standard regulates respirator use ( Standards Australia Limited/Standards New Zealand 2012 ). All guidelines, except the WHO and the Australian guidelines, briefly discuss the need for fit testing but do not provide detail on fit testing procedures. The WHO and the Australian guidelines do not mention fit testing and instead mention fit check (or seal-check) which is not equivalent to fit testing. All guidelines however highlight the importance of training for respiratory (and other personal protective equipment) use.","The standard ECG stress test can be performed by using any one of several well-known protocols (Bruce, Naughton) or custom protocols that address the particular needs of a testing population. Tests could be modified to most closely reproduce the loads the athlete would encounter when engaging in his or her sport. Information about the subject's fitness or aerobic capacity can be obtained by calculating the subject's double product. This value can be obtained by multiplying the peak systolic blood pressure times peak heart rate.","Our results have several implications for the design and implementation of traveller screening policies. If the infection is not yet present in a region, then arrival screening could delay the introduction of cases, but consistent with previous analyses, (Cowling et al., 2010), our results indicate such delays would be minimal. Our findings indicate that for every case detected by travel screening, one or more infected travellers were not caught, and must be found and isolated by other means. We note that even with high R0 and no control measures in place, a single case importation is not guaranteed to start a sustained chain of transmission (Kucharski et al., 2020; Lloyd-Smith et al., 2005). This is particularly true for infections that exhibit a tendency toward superspreading events, as increasingly reported for COVID-19, but the flipside is that outbreaks triggered by superspreading are explosive when they do occur (Lloyd-Smith et al., 2005).","We found that in countries with low connectivity to China but with relatively high R loc , the most beneficial control measure to reduce the risk of outbreaks is a further reduction in their importation number either by entry screening or travel restrictions (see Figure 5 ). Countries with high connectivity but low R loc benefit the most from policies that further reduce R loc . Countries in the middle should consider a combination of such policies.","Each clinical department arranged their personnel to attend a standardized COVID-19 protection and prevention training session. The training included learning the latest versions of \"COVID-19 Diagnosis and Treatment Plan\" and \"COVID-19 Protection and Prevention Plan\", hand hygiene, proper handling of PPE, disinfection policies and procedures, and quarantine/isolation policies. The training interweaved online education and hands-on training. Each employee was required to pass a hospital-wide standardized test to reflect the completion of training. Additionally, employees also needed to pass a COVID-19 screening to return to work.","Another consideration is that of shared treatment machines. Members of this patient group are treated on one of a few machines shared amongst many patients daily, depending on the center. It is therefore imperative that radiation oncology clinics review established infection control protocols and adapt as necessary to the unique considerations of SARS-CoV-2, in accordance with CDC recommendations. Screening by front desk staff upon check-in and triage with nursing and physicians is necessary in order to protect patients, and to prevent possible exposures in both waiting rooms and treatment vaults from infected individuals. How to implement screening in the optimal fashion is a question that is evolving rapidly, and triaging patients remotely is vital. 13 Remote screening has the potential to offset the load of individuals presenting to emergency rooms and clinics, avoiding possible exposures. 13 Lastly, areas contaminated by a person under investigation (PUI), or confirmed COVID-19 patient, should ideally be decontaminated. Currently, the CDC recommends routine cleaning and disinfection procedures as appropriate for SARS-CoV-2 in the healthcare setting. 14 Unique considerations in Radiation Oncology may include active breathing control devices, handles for arm positioning, and any attachments of the treatment couch that contact the patient. Attention should also be paid to the time of day suspected COVID-19 patients are treated. High-risk patients should be treated at times that facilitate appropriate sterilization and minimize staff and patient exposure. Finally, cognizant efforts must be made to discard of potentially contaminated PPE and/or garments prior to leaving the hospital so as not to carry viral particles outside. Table 2 provides a selection of strategies to reduce infectious risk to patients and staff members in the clinic. Bass &amp; Washington provide a more thorough array of the unique considerations in their book chapter dedicated to \"Infection Control in Radiation Oncology Facilities.\" 27","2. Many SARS-CoV-2 testing laboratories are using pipetting robots to rapidly and accurately scale RNA extractions and assays to large numbers of individuals. While protocols do not exist to our knowledge for group testing on these platforms, they are ideally suited to tasks such as this. We propose such a strategy should be validated using traditional pipetting before using valuable robotic platform resources.","While more and more affected populations are moving from containment towards risk mitigation plans for Covid-19, it is important to understand the engaged mechanisms underlying this pandemic-spread. Outcomes of social distancing : social distancing phase with 70% lower infection rate (50 to 100 days) followed by one year of high frequency testing with a 1.7666 times higher detection rate. Dashed lines represent the immune (n s,init \u2212 n s (t)), dash-dotted lines the infected (n i|u + n i|d ) and solid lines the deceased (n k ) population; on the top with linear and in the middle with logarithmic scaling. In the bottom logarithmic plots the detected infected population (dotted lines) is shown together with the intensive care unit capacity (horizontal long dashed lines). The values are in % of the initial susceptible population size and are plotted over number of days.

It is found that the latter can significantly reduce the percentage of people getting infected and the death toll. It is important to emphasize here that more testing has to be applied to individuals without symptoms, since those with symptoms contain themselves automatically in most cases. As improved testing capacities are built up, our approach may help to decide when alternative mitigation methods may not only complement, but eventually replace the current social distancing regime. This may help to minimize the socio-economical impacts resulting from severe social isolation policies. While social distancing is currently essential, it is of utmost importance that the testing capabilities are upgraded such that they cover large portions of affected populations in the near future."],"title":["Preparedness is essential for malaria-endemic regions during the COVID-19 pandemic","Estimated effectiveness of symptom and risk screening to prevent the spread of

Current testing strategies rely on individual tests of cases matching restrictive diagnostic criteria to detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA, limiting testing of asymptomatic and mild cases. Testing these individuals is one effective way to understand and reduce the spread of COVID-19. Here, we develop a pooled testing strategy to identify these low-risk individuals. Drawing on the well-studied group testing literature, modeling suggests practical changes to testing protocols which can reduce test costs and stretch a limited test kit supply. When most tests are negative, pooling reduces the total number of tests up to four-fold at 2% prevalence and eight-fold at 0.5% prevalence. At current SARS-CoV-2 prevalence, randomized group testing optimized per country could double the number of tested ind...","BACKGROUND Limited data exist on how SARS-CoV-2 enters and spreads in the general population. METHODS We used two strategies for SARS-CoV-2 testing: targeted testing of high-risk individuals (n=4,551) and a population screening (n=5,502). We sequenced SARS-CoV-2 from 340 individuals. RESULTS On March 22 2020, 528 had tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in the targeted testing (11.6%) and 50 in the population screening (0.9%); approximately 0.2% of the Icelandic population. Large fractions of positives had travelled outside Iceland (38.4% and 34.0%). Fewer under 10 years old were positive than those older: 2.8% vs. 12.3% for targeted testing (P=1.6e-9) and 0.0% vs. 1.0% for population screening (P=0.031). Fewer females were positive in the targeted testing than males (9.5% vs. 14.6%, P=6.8e-9). SARS-CoV-2 came from eight clades, seven A clades and one B clade. The clade composition differed between the testing groups and changed with time. In the early targeted testing, 65.0% of clades were ...","The recent emergence of SARS-CoV-2 lead to a current pandemic of unprecedented levels. Though diagnostic tests are fundamental to the ability to detect and respond, many health systems are already experiencing shortages of reagents associated with this test. Here, testing a pooling approach for the standard RT-qPCR test, we find that a single positive sample can be detected even in pools of up to 32 samples, with an estimated false negative rate of 10%. Detection of positive samples diluted in even up to 64 samples may also be attainable, though may require additional amplification cycles. As it uses the standard protocols, reagents and equipment, this pooling method can be applied immediately in current clinical testing laboratories. We hope that such implementation of a pool test for COVID-19 would allow expanding current screening capacities thereby enabling the expansion of detection in the community, as well as in close integral groups, such as hospital departments, army units, or...","The World Health Organization declared that COVID-19 outbreak constituted a Public Health Emergency of International Concern and the development of reliable laboratory diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 became mandatory to identify, isolate and provide optimized care for patients early. RT-qPCR testing of respiratory secretions is routinely used to detect causative viruses in acute respiratory infection. RT-qPCR in-house protocols to detect the SARS-CoV-2 have been described. Validations of these protocols are considered a key knowledge gap for COVID-19, especially if executed in a high throughput format. Here, we investigate the analytical sensitivity and specificity of two interim RT-qPCR protocols for the qualitative detection of SARS-CoV-2 executed in a fully automated platform. Under our conditions, the N1 and RdRP (modified) showed the highest analytical sensitivity for their RNA targets. E assay, in its original concentration, was considered a tertiary confirmatory assay. Taken together, N...","Objectives: To report our experiences screening and managing patients with suspected or confirmed novel coronavirus (COVID-19) disease using a hospital-specific protocol. Design: Longitudinal cohort study. Setting: A 1,200 bed tertiary care teaching hospital in Chengdu, Sichuan, China. Participants: 802 adults presenting to hospital with concerns of having COVID-19, 1,246 inpatients and 2,531 hospital visitors. Interventions: Screening and management of patients using a hospital-specific protocol, which included fever triage, monitoring visitors and patients, emergency response, personnel training for healthcare team members, health education for patients and family, medical materials management, disinfection and wastes disposal protocols. Results: Between 23 January and 28 February 2020, 73 people were identified as having fever plus respiratory signs with/without a history of exposure and were tested for the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) by our hospital...","BACKGROUND: Coronaviruses (CoVs) are large ribonucleic acid (RNA) viruses causing primarily respiratory disease in humans. A novel human coronavirus, subsequently named middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), was first reported in Saudi Arabia in September of 2012. With increasing numbers of infections and deaths from MERS-CoV, development of a rapid and reliable kit was crucial to prevent further spread of MERS-CoV. OBJECTIVES: In this study, we present two real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) assays for in-house rapid and sensitive diagnostic testing of MERS-CoV, detecting the regions upstream of the envelope gene (upE) and open reading frame (ORF) 1b, respectively, for initial screening and final confirmation of MERS-CoV infection, as recommended by the world health organization (WHO). MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this experimental study, acquiring patient samples was difficult; thus, according to WHO recommendations and standard protocol...","Objectives: To examine heterogeneity of outcomes in protocols of clinical trials of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) and to identify outcomes for prioritization in developing a core outcome set (COS) in this field. Design: This study is a review. Data sources: Databases of ICMJE-accepted clinical trial registry platform were searched on February 14, 2020. Eligibility Criteria: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and non-RCTs of COVID-19 were considered.Conditions of patients include common type, severe type or critical type. Interventions include traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) and Western medicine. We excluded trials that for discharged patients, psychological intervention and complications of COVID-19. Data extraction and synthesis: The general information and outcomes, outcome measurement instruments and measurement times were extracted. The results were analysed by descriptive analysis. Results: 19 registry platforms were searched. A total of 97 protocols were included from 1...","We develop a health informatics toolbox that enables public health workers to timely analyze and evaluate the time-course dynamics of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) infection using the public available data from the China CDC. This toolbox is built upon a hierarchical epidemiological model in which two observed time series of daily proportions of infected and removed cases are emitted from the underlying infection dynamics governed by a Markov SIR infectious disease process. We extend the SIR model to incorporate various types of time-varying quarantine protocols, including government-level macro isolation policies and community-level micro inspection measures. We develop a calibration procedure for under-reported infected cases. This toolbox provides forecast, in both online and offline forms, of turning points of interest, including the time when daily infected proportion becomes smaller than the previous ones and the time when daily infected proportions becomes smaller than that o...","Governments around the world are responding to the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic with unprecedented policies designed to slow the growth rate of infections. Many actions, such as closing schools and restricting populations to their homes, impose large and visible costs on society. In contrast, the benefits of these policies, in the form of infections that did not occur, cannot be directly observed and are currently understood through process-based simulations. Here, we compile new data on 936 local, regional, and national anti-contagion policies recently deployed in the ongoing pandemic across localities in China, South Korea, Iran, Italy, France, and the United States (US). We then apply reduced-form econometric methods, commonly used to measure the effect of policies on economic growth, to empirically evaluate the effect that these anti-contagion policies have had on the growth rate of infections. In the absence of any policy actions, we estimate that early infections of COVI...","Background Transmission of Middle East respiratory syndrome-coronavirus (MERS-CoV) among health care workers (HCWs) and patients has been documented with mortality rate approximating 36%. We propose advanced infection control measures (A-IC) used in conjunction with basic infection control measures (B-IC) help reduce pathogen transmission. B-IC include standard and transmission-based precautions. A-IC are initiatives implemented within our center to enhance effectiveness of B-IC. Objective Study effectiveness of combining B-IC and A-IC to prevent transmission of MERS-CoV to HCWs. Methods A retrospective observational study was undertaken. A-IC measures include administrative support with daily rounds; infection control risk assessment; timely screening, isolation, and specimen analysis; collaboration; epidemic planning; stockpiling; implementation of contingency plans; full personal protective equipment use for advanced airway management; use of a real-time electronic isolation flaggin...","Background Traditional infection control policies have focused on engineering controls, specific protocols, and personal protective equipment (PPE). In light of the variable success in protecting health care workers (HCWs) from Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2003, organizational and individual factors related to self-protective behavior in health care settings may also play an important role. Methods A critical review of the literature was conducted, directed at understanding what organizational and individual factors are important in protecting HCWs from infectious diseases at work. Results Organizational factors, such as a positive safety climate, have been associated with increased HCW adherence to universal precautions. There is some evidence that appropriate training of HCWs could be effective in changing HCW behavior if appropriate follow-up is applied. Very little research into these factors has been conducted with regard to preventing exposures to respiratory tract...","We developed a computational tool to assess the risk of novel coronavirus outbreaks outside China. We estimate the dependence of the risk of a major outbreak in a country from imported cases on key parameters such as: (i) the evolution of the cumulative number of cases in mainland China outside the closed areas; (ii) the connectivity of the destination country with China, including baseline travel frequencies, the effect of travel restrictions, and the efficacy of entry screening at destination; (iii) the efficacy of control measures in the destination country (expressed by the local reproduction number Rloc). We found that in countries with low connectivity to China but with relatively high Rloc, the most beneficial control measure to reduce the risk of outbreaks is a further reduction in their importation number either by entry screening or travel restrictions. Countries with high connectivity but low Rloc benefit the most from policies that further reduce Rloc. Countries in the midd...","For two months between May and July 2015, a nationwide outbreak of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) occurred in Korea. On June 3, 2015, the Korean Society for Laboratory Medicine (KSLM) launched a MERS-CoV Laboratory Response Task Force (LR-TF) to facilitate clinical laboratories to set up the diagnosis of MERS-CoV infection. Based on the WHO interim recommendations, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention of United States guidelines for MERS-CoV laboratory testing, and other available resources, the KSLM MERS-CoV LR-TF provided the first version of the laboratory practice guidelines for the molecular diagnosis of MERS-CoV to the clinical laboratories on June 12, 2015. The guidelines described here are an updated version that includes case definition, indications for testing, specimen type and protocols for specimen collection, specimen packing and transport, specimen handling and nucleic acid extraction, molecular detection of MERS-CoV, interpretation of ...","The focus of this protocol is mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), with occasional references to other coronaviruses. Many of these protocols can be easily adapted to other coronaviruses. Basic protocols for propagating MHV in DBT and 17CL-1 cells; the storage, and titration of viral stocks; purification of MHV on sucrose gradients; and the generation of recombinant viruses by a cDNA assembly method and by targeted recombination, will be presented. Support protocols for the propagation of DBT, 17CL-1, and L2 cells used for growing and titrating MHV, for the growth of BHK-R cells and FCWF cells. The latter two cell lines are used for regenerating infectious MHV by an in vitro cDNA assembly protocol and by a targeted recombination protocol, respectively, allowing reverse genetic manipulation of these viruses. An additional support protocol for the maintenance of the large plasmids used for generating recombinant MHVs will also be presented.","BACKGROUND: There is an ongoing debate regarding the type of respiratory protection that should be recommended for use for healthcare workers. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was conducted in three countries: China, Pakistan and Vietnam. RESULTS: In China and Pakistan, the infection control guidelines were developed to be in line with the recommendations from the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, while in the Vietnamese guidelines the recommendations correspond with the WHO suggestions only. The guidelines from all three countries document the need for training and fit testing; however there is no system to monitor the training and fit testing programs. Across the three countries, there was some inconsistency with regard to the types of products (i.e. masks vs. respirators) recommended for influenza, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and tuberculosis. CONCLUSIONS: Available evidence should be examined and a compre...","As the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak is ongoing, the number of individuals to be tested for COVID-19 is rapidly increasing. For safe and efficient screening for COVID-19, drive-through (DT) screening centers have been designed and implemented in Korea. Herein, we present the overall concept, advantages, and limitations of the COVID-19 DT screening centers. The steps of the DT centers include registration, examination, specimen collection, and instructions. The entire service takes about 10 minutes for one testee without leaving his or her cars. Increased testing capacity over 100 tests per day and prevention of cross-infection between testees in the waiting space are the major advantages, while protection of staff from the outdoor atmosphere is challenging. It could be implemented in other countries to cope with the global COVID-19 outbreak and transformed according to their own situations.","The World Health Organization currently recommends that governments scale up testing for COVID-19 infection. We performed health economic analyses projecting whether the additional costs from screening would be offset by the avoided costs with hospitalizations. We analysed Portuguese COVID-19 data up until the 22nd March 2020, and estimated the additional number of cases that would be detected if different testing rates and frequencies of positive results would have been observed. We projected that, in most scenarios, the costs with scaling up COVID-19 tests would be lower than savings with hospitalization costs, rendering large scale testing cost-saving.","A symptom-based mass screening and testing intervention (MSTI) can identify a large fraction of infected individuals during an infectious disease outbreak. China is currently using this strategy for the COVID-19 outbreak. However, MSTI might lead to increased transmission if not properly implemented. We investigate under which conditions MSTI is beneficial.","AbstractThe rigidity and flexibility of two recently reported crystal structures (PDB entries 6Y2E and 6LU7) of a protease from the SARS-CoV-2 virus, the infectious agent of the COVID-19 respiratory disease, has been investigated using pebble-game rigidity analysis, elastic network model normal mode analysis, and all-atom geometric simulations. This computational investigation of the viral protease follows protocols that have been effective in studying other homodimeric enzymes. The protease is predicted to display flexible motions in vivo which directly affect the geometry of a known inhibitor binding site and which open new potential binding sites elsewhere in the structure. A database of generated PDB files representing natural flexible variations on the crystal structures has been produced and made available for download from an institutional data archive. This information may inform structure-based drug design and fragment screening efforts aimed at identifying specific antiviral ...","A novel coronavirus was identified as the cause for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). The complete sequence of SARS genome has provided an opportunity for the development of molecular diagnostic assays. To restrain further outbreak of SARS, the World Health Organization has posted several pairs of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) primers for early diagnosis and urged more research to be done on PCR protocols. Here we report a strategy for the de novo synthesis of PCR templates complimentary to the SARS virus genome, which has the advantage of working on PCR templates without concern about viral infection and also has the advantage that it can be used by those who do not have access to the SARS virus. This highly efficient and safe strategy for obtaining SARS gene fragments is useful for the development of PCR assays, as well as for the preparation of reliable positive controls for PCR testing kits.","The recent coronavirus pandemic follows in its early stages an almost exponential expansion, with the number of cases N reasonably well fit by N e\u03b1t, in many countries. We analyze the rate \u03b1 in 25 different countries, choosing as a starting point in each country the first day with 30 cases and fitting for the following 12 days, capturing thus the early exponential growth in a rather homogeneous way. We look for a link between the rate \u03b1 and the average temperature T of each country, in the month of the epidemic growth. Fitting with a linear behavior \u03b1(T), we find evidence for a decreasing growth rate as a function of T. However, a decrease in the growth rate is visible also in the very low-T data. Going beyond a linear model, a peak at about (9.5\u00b12.6)\u00b0C seems to be present in the data. Our findings give hope that, for northern hemisphere countries, the growth rate should significantly decrease as a result of both warmer weather and lockdown policies. In general the propagation should b...","Abstract The severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2002, which had a high morbidity rate and caused worldwide alarm, remains untreated today even though SARS was eventually isolated and controlled. Development and high-throughput screening of efficacious drugs is therefore critical. However, currently there remains a lack of such a safe system. Here, the generation and characterization of the first selectable, SARS\u2013coronavirus (SARS\u2013CoV)-based replicon cell line which can be used for screening is described. Partial SARS\u2013CoV cDNAs and antibiotic resistance/reporter gene DNA were generated and assembled in vitro to produce the replicon transcription template, which was then transcribed in vitro to generate the replicon RNA. The latter was introduced into a mammalian cell line and the transfected cells were selected for by antibiotic application. For the antibiotic-resistant cell lines thus generated, the expression of reporter gene was ensured by continued monitoring using...","COVID-19 has spread to most countries in the world. Puzzlingly, the impact of the disease is different in different countries. These differences are attributed to differences in cultural norms, mitigation efforts, and health infrastructure. Here we propose that national differences in COVID-19 impact could be partially explained by the different national policies respect to Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) childhood vaccination. BCG vaccination has been reported to offer broad protection to respiratory infections. We compared large number of countries BCG vaccination policies with the morbidity and mortality for COVID-19. We found that countries without universal policies of BCG vaccination (Italy, Nederland, USA) have been more severely affected compared to countries with universal and long-standing BCG policies. Countries that have a late start of universal BCG policy (Iran, 1984) had high mortality, consistent with the idea that BCG protects the vaccinated elderly population. We also ...","Background: The overall objective of this rapid review was to identify infection protection and control recommendations from published clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) for adults aged 60 years and older in long-term care settings Methods: Comprehensive searches in MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, and relevant CPG publishers/repositories were carried out in early March 2020. Title/abstract and full-text screening, data abstraction, and quality appraisal (AGREE-II) were carried out by single reviewers. Results: A total of 17 relevant CPGs were identified, published in the USA (n=8), Canada (n=6), Australia (n=2), and the United Kingdom (n=1). All of the CPGs dealt with infection control in long-term care facilities (LTCF) and addressed various types of viral respiratory infections (e.g., influenza, COVID-19, severe acute respiratory syndrome). Ten or more CPGs recommended the following infection control measures in LTCF: hand hygiene (n=13), wearing personal protective equipment...","Traveller screening is being used to limit further spread of COVID-19 following its recent emergence, and symptom screening has become a ubiquitous tool in the global response. Previously, we developed a mathematical model to understand factors governing the effectiveness of traveller screening to prevent spread of emerging pathogens (Gostic et al., 2015). Here, we estimate the impact of different screening programs given current knowledge of key COVID-19 life history and epidemiological parameters. Even under best-case assumptions, we estimate that screening will miss more than half of infected people. Breaking down the factors leading to screening successes and failures, we find that most cases missed by screening are fundamentally undetectable, because they have not yet developed symptoms and are unaware they were exposed. Our work underscores the need for measures to limit transmission by individuals who become ill after being missed by a screening program. These findings can suppo...","Known human coronaviruses are believed to have originated in animals and made use of intermediate hosts for transmission to humans. The intermediate hosts of most of the human coronaviruses are known, but not for HCoV-NL63. This study aims to assess the possible role of some major domestic livestock species as intermediate hosts of HCoV-NL63. We developed a testing algorithm for high throughput screening of livestock sera with ELISA and confirmation with recombinant immunofluorescence assay testing for antibodies against HCoV-NL63 in livestock. Optimization of the ELISA showed a capability of the assay to significantly distinguish HCoV-NL63 from HCoV-229E (U = 27.50, p &lt; 0.001) and HCoV-OC43 (U = 55.50, p &lt; 0.001) in coronavirus-characterized sera. Evaluation of the assay with collected human samples showed no significant difference in mean optical density values of immunofluorescence-classified HCoV-NL63-positive and HCoV-NL63-negative samples (F (1, 215) = 0.437, p = 0.509). All the ...","As the Coronavirus (COVID-19) expands its impact from China, expanding its catchment into surrounding regions and other countries, increased national and international measures are being taken to contain the outbreak. The placing of entire cities in \u2018lockdown\u2019 directly affects urban economies on a multi-lateral level, including from social and economic standpoints. This is being emphasised as the outbreak gains ground in other countries, leading towards a global health emergency, and as global collaboration is sought in numerous quarters. However, while effective protocols in regard to the sharing of health data is emphasised, urban data, on the other hand, specifically relating to urban health and safe city concepts, is still viewed from a nationalist perspective as solely benefiting a nation\u2019s economy and its economic and political influence. This perspective paper, written one month after detection and during the outbreak, surveys the virus outbreak from an urban standpoint and adva...","Novel Corona virus (COVID-19 or 2019-nCoV) is an emerging global health concern that requires a rapid diagnostic test. Quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) is currently the standard for COVID-19 detection; however, Reverse Transcription Loop-Mediated Isothermal Amplification (RT-LAMP) may allow for faster and cheaper field based testing at point-of-risk. The objective of this study was to develop a rapid screening diagnostic test that could be completed in under 30 minutes. Simulated patient samples were generated by spiking serum, urine, saliva, oropharyngeal swabs, and nasopharyngeal swabs with a portion of the COVID-19 nucleic sequence. The samples were tested using RT-LAMP as well as by conventional qRT-PCR. Specificity of the RT-LAMP was evaluated by also testing against other related coronaviruses. RT-LAMP specifically detected COVID-19 in simulated patient samples. This test was performed in under 30 minutes. This approach could be used for monitoring of exposed indi...","Rapid diagnostics, vaccines and therapeutics are important interventions for the management of the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak. It is timely to systematically review the potential of these interventions, including those for Middle East respiratory syndrome-Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV, to guide policymakers globally on their prioritization of resources for research and development. A systematic search was carried out in three major electronic databases (PubMed, Embase and Cochrane Library) to identify published studies in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Supplementary strategies through Google Search and personal communications were used. A total of 27 studies fulfilled the criteria for review. Several laboratory protocols for confirmation of suspected 2019-nCoV cases using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) have been publ...","Background: Controlling the transmission of respiratory infections such as influenza and COVID-19 is a critical public health priority. Non-pharmaceutical intervention policies such as community quarantines, closures and travel bans are often implemented in emergencies but many of them are disruptive and difficult to maintain for extended periods of time. A promising alternative recommended by the CDC for influenza is requiring individuals showing fever symptoms to remain isolated at home until they are fever-free for at least one day, but there is limited evidence to support the effectiveness of such symptom-based isolation policies. Methods: Here we introduce a computational model of symptom-based isolation that accounts for the timing of symptoms, viral shedding and the population structure. It was validated on outbreaks of influenza in schools and modified to account for COVID-19. It was then used to estimate the outbreak curves and the attack rates (the proportion of the populatio...","Social distancing policies are critical but economically painful measures to flatten the curve against emergent infectious diseases. As the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19 spread throughout the United States in early 2020, the federal government issued social distancing recommendations but left to the states the most difficult and consequential decisions restricting behavior, such as canceling events, closing schools and businesses, and issuing stay-at-home orders. We present an original dataset of state-level social distancing policy responses to the epidemic and explore how political partisanship, COVID-19 caseload, and policy diffusion explain the timing of governors' decisions to mandate social distancing. An event history analysis of five social distancing policies across all fifty states reveals the most important predictors are political: all else equal, Republican governors and governors from states with more Trump supporters were slower to adopt social distancing polici...","Background: The 2019 Coronavirus (COVID-19) has turned into a global pandemic with unprecedented challenges for the global community. Understanding the state of the disease and planning for future trajectories relies heavily on data on the spread and mortality. Yet official data coming from various countries are highly unreliable: symptoms similar to common cold in majority of cases and limited screening resources and delayed testing procedures may contribute to under-estimation of the burden of disease. Anecdotal and more limited data are available, but few have systematically combined those with official statistics into a coherent view of the epidemic. This study is a modeling-in-real-time of the emerging outbreak for understanding the state of the disease. Our focus is on the case of the spread of disease in Iran, as one of the epicenters of the disease in the first months of 2020. Method: We develop a simple dynamic model of the epidemic to provide a more reliable picture of the st...","Traveller screening is being used to limit further global spread of 2019 novel coronavirus (nCoV) following its recent emergence. Here, we analyze the expected impact of different travel screening programs given remaining uncertainty around the values of key nCoV life history and epidemiological parameters. Even under best-case assumptions, we estimate that screening will miss around half of infected travellers. Breaking down the factors leading to screening successes and failures, we find that most cases missed by screening are fundamentally undetectable, because they have not yet developed symptoms and are unaware they were exposed. These findings emphasize the need for measures to track travellers who become ill after being missed by a travel screening program. We make our model available for interactive use so stakeholders can explore scenarios of interest using the most up-to-date information. We hope these findings contribute to evidence-based policy to combat the spread of nCoV,...","BACKGROUND: Infectious diseases emerge frequently in China, partly because of its large and highly mobile population. Therefore, a rapid and cost-effective pathogen screening method with broad coverage is required for prevention and control of infectious diseases. The availability of a large number of microbial genome sequences generated by conventional Sanger sequencing and next generation sequencing has enabled the development of a high-throughput high-density microarray platform for rapid large-scale screening of vertebrate pathogens. METHODS: An easy operating pathogen microarray (EOPM) was designed to detect almost all known pathogens and related species based on their genomic sequences. For effective identification of pathogens from EOPM data, a statistical enrichment algorithm has been proposed, and further implemented in a user-friendly web-based interface. RESULTS: Using multiple probes designed to specifically detect a microbial genus or species, EOPM can correctly identify k...","The COVID-19 virus has spread worldwide in a matter of a few months. Healthcare systems struggle to monitor and report current cases. Limited capabilities in testing result in difficult to guide policies and mitigate lack of preparation. Since severe cases, which more likely lead to fatal outcomes, are detected at a higher percentage than mild cases, the reported death rates are likely inflated in most countries. Such under-estimation can be attributed to the under-sampling of infection cases and results in systematic death rate estimation biases. The method proposed here utilizes a benchmark country (South Korea) and its reported death rates in combination with population demographics to correct the reported COVID-19 case numbers. By applying a correction, we predict that the number of cases is highly under-reported in most countries. In the case of China, it is estimated that more than 700.000 cases of COVID-19 actually occurred instead of the confirmed 80,932 cases as of 3/13/2020.","As the number of novel coronavirus cases grows both inside and outside of China, public health authorities require evidence on the effectiveness of control measures such as thermal screening of arrivals at airports. We evaluated the effectiveness of exit and entry screening for 2019-nCoV infection. In our baseline scenario, we estimated that 46.5% (95%CI: 35.9 to 57.7) of infected travellers would not be detected, depending on the incubation period, sensitivity of exit and entry screening, and the proportion of cases which are asymptomatic. Airport screening is unlikely to detect a sufficient proportion of 2019-nCoV infected travellers to avoid entry of infected travellers. We developed an online tool so that results can be updated as new information becomes available.","Respiratory viruses have emerged and re-emerged in humans for hundreds of years. In the recent past avian and animal influenza viruses have caused human disease ranging from conjunctivitis to respiratory illnesses, including the 2009\u201310 A(H1N1)pdm09 pandemic. Coronaviruses, human metapneumovirus (hMPV) and enteroviruses have also impacted humans globally. Since the likely public health impacts are common, plans and policies for intervention strategies can be developed, encompassing early detection through surveillance and diagnostics, as well as treatment and prevention through clinical and non-clinical interventions. The global comprehensiveness of these varies according to differing resources, competing health priorities and the causative agent, yet, irrespective of this, activities must be proportional to the threat. Pandemics and severe epidemics enable policies to be tested and gaps identified.","We present here several variants of a mathematical model to explore three main issues related to SARS-CoV-2 spread in scenarios similar to those present in Mexico and elsewhere in Latin America. We explore the consequences for travel inside a given region, in this case Mexico, particularly focusing on airplane transportation but attempting to give a gross approximation to terrestrial movement since this is the main form of population movement across geographical areas in the country; then we proceed to study the effect of behavioral changes required to lower transmission by lowering the contact rate and infection probability and lastly, we explore the consequences of disease spread in a population subject to social isolation.These models are not suitable for predictive purposes although some rough predictions can be extracted from them. They are presented as a tool that can serve to explore plausible scenarios of spread and impact, effectiveness and consequences of contention and mitig...","Background: We evaluated if interventions aimed at air travellers can delay establishment of a SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in a previously unaffected country. Methods: For countries with no sustained SARS-CoV-2 transmission and with no shared border with affected regions we simulated arriving infected air travellers. We assessed the effectiveness of syndromic screening at departure and/or arrival &amp; traveller sensitisation to the COVID-2019-like symptoms with the aim to trigger rapid self-isolation and reporting on symptom onset to enable contact tracing. We assumed that syndromic screening would reduce the number of infected arrivals and that traveller sensitisation reduce the average number of secondary cases. We report the minimal expected delay achievable in 50% (75% &amp; 97.5%) of simulations. In the simulations we account for uncertainty in the number of secondary cases in the absence of air traveller targeted interventions and the arrival times of infected cases and also present sensitivity...","With the increasing threat of pandemic influenza and catastrophic bioterrorism, it is important for intensive care providers to be prepared to meet the challenge of large-scale airborne epidemics causing mass casualty respiratory failure. The severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak exposed the vulnerability of health care workers and highlighted the importance of establishing stringent infection control and crisis management protocols. Patients who have acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome who require mechanical ventilation should receive a lung protective, low tidal volume strategy. Controversy remains regarding the use of high-frequency oscillatory ventilation and noninvasive positive pressure ventilation. Standard, contact, and airborne precautions should be instituted in intensive care units, with special care taken when aerosol-generating procedures are performed.","Abstract Objective MERS-CoV infection is uncommonly identified among patients visiting healthcare facilities &amp; we were vigilant in screening all patients entering our hospital to prevent cross infection among patients, visitors &amp; healthcare providers and aiming to prevent potential outbreaks with MERS-CoV infection. In spite of our efforts on practicing Failure Mode Effect Analysis for MERS-CoV infection management we ended up having an outbreak with MERS-CoV. Based on our experience, we actively implemented policies, procedures &amp; practices on early identification &amp; appropriate isolation practices along with supplemental infection prevention &amp; control measures for preventing future outbreaks at our healthcare facility. Methods Retrospectively we analyzed our failure in preventing the outbreak of MERS-CoV infection among our hospitalized patients by identifying the outbreak &amp; actively intervening as a team to control the outbreak with the support of Hospital Higher management, Administr...","We evaluated effectiveness of thermal passenger screening for 2019-nCoV infection at airport exit and entry to inform public health decision-making. In our baseline scenario, we estimated that 46% (95% confidence interval: 36 to 58) of infected travellers would not be detected, depending on incubation period, sensitivity of exit and entry screening, and proportion of asymptomatic cases. Airport screening is unlikely to detect a sufficient proportion of 2019-nCoV infected travellers to avoid entry of infected travellers.","Abstract Concept of \u201crisk analysis\u201d in food safety management needs to be understood to assess, manage, and communicate risks for proper implementation of food safety policies, food laws, and standards, in a country. Science-based approaches, which are an integral part of risk analysis to improve modern food safety systems, are intimately linked to processes such as good quality practices. Risk analysis strengthens the ability of traditional food safety systems to meet current challenges. Risk analysis is just one part of an effective food safety system. Other components of food safety system like food safety policies, food legislation, food inspection, laboratory analysis, epidemiological surveillance of food-borne diseases, monitoring systems for chemical and microbiological contamination in foods, and information, education and communication, also need to be improved continuously. \u201cFood safety controls\u201d are now being replaced by \u201crisk-based controls\u201d in all stages of food production...","As of March 8, 2020, the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) had caused 80,815 human infections and 3073 deaths in China, including more than 3000 infections among medical staff. Guangdong Second Provincial General Hospital (Guangzhou, Guangdong Province, China), a provincial emergency hospital, has treated more than 35 confirmed cases of COVID-19 and more than 260 suspected cases. Most of nurses\u2019 work involves direct contact with patients. As nurses have high vulnerability to COVID-19, it is necessary to establish hospital-specific protocols to reduce the risk of nurses\u2019 infection in interactions with COVID-19 patients. Our hospital has maintained a \u201czero nurse infection\u201d rate while battling SARS in 2003 and during the present COVID-19 epidemic. The following are the key measures implemented in our hospital.","Abstract Since its outbreak in December 2019, a series of clinical trials on Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) have been registered or carried out. However, the significant heterogeneity and less critical outcomes of such trials may be leading to a waste of research resources. This study aimed to develop a core outcome set (COS) for clinical trials on COVID-19 in order to tackle the outcome issues. The study was conducted according to the Core Outcome Measures in Effectiveness Trials (COMET) handbook (version 1.0), a guideline for COS development. A research group was set up that included experts in respiratory and critical medicine, traditional Chinese medicine, evidence-based medicine, clinical pharmacology, and statistics, in addition to medical journal editors. Clinical trial registry websites (chictr.org.cn and clinicaltrials.gov) were searched to retrieve clinical trial protocols and outcomes in order to form an outcome pool. A total of 78 clinical trial protocols on COVID-19 w...","","Abstract We report the dynamic change process of target genes by RT-PCR testing of SARS-Cov-2 during the course of a COVID-19 patient: from successive negative results to successive single positive nucleocapsid gene, to two positive target genes (orf1ab and nucleocapsid) by RT-PCR testing of SARS-Cov-2, and describe the diagnosis, clinical course, and management of the case. In this case, negative results of RT-PCR testing was not excluded to diagnose a suspected COVID-19 patient, clinical signs and symptoms, other laboratory findings, and chest CT images should be taken into account for the absence of enough positive evidence. This case highlights the importance of successive sampling and testing SARS-Cov-2 by RT-PCR as well as the increased value of single positive target gene from pending to positive in two specimens to diagnose laboratory-confirmed COVID-19.","Abstract This paper describes a proposed Strategic Vaccine Facility (SVF) to provide a capability to the UK to deal with new and emerging disease threats. It would underpin the vaccine manufacturing industry by developing expertise and technology to enable rapid manufacture of small batches of vaccines for emergency use against agents, such as bioterrorist agents and emerging diseases. It would have a rare ability to work with dangerous pathogens under containment, allowing the production of inactivated and live vaccines, which would be difficult in a conventional plant. The facility's output will include vaccine candidates and manufacturing protocols for transfer to industry, small vaccine batches for emergency use or clinical trials, and vaccine reference standards. It would also be available for manufacturing small batches of experimental and public health vaccines for the UK and the developing world, allowing clinical trials to be undertaken against key diseases.","As of March 22, 2020, the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in the U.S. has reached nearly 30,000. While rapid and accessible diagnosis is paramount to monitoring and reducing the spread of disease, COVID-19 testing capabilities across the U.S. remain constrained. For many individuals, urgent care centers (UCCs) may offer the most accessible avenue to be tested. Through a phone survey, we describe the COVID-19 testing capabilities at UCCs and provide a snapshot highlighting the limited COVID-19 testing capabilities at UCCs in states with the greatest disease burden.","Computational and experimental high-throughput screening are frequently used to discover new leads for drug design. Although novel ligands have been identified by these methods, it has become clear that screening hit lists are plagued by false positives. These nuisance compounds are ultimately found to be developmental dead-ends and are abandoned, often after considerable effort has been invested in them. Much work over the last decade has been devoted to exploring the origins of false-positive screening hits, and ligand promiscuity has emerged as one such cause. Well-known mechanisms of promiscuity include reactive species and privileged substructures. More recently, it has been found that some nonspecific screening hits form aggregates of 30\u20131000nm in diameter. It has been proposed that these aggregate particles are responsible for the promiscuous behavior of many false positives and that aggregate-forming compounds may be widespread among screening hits.
