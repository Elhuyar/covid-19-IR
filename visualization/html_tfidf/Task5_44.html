Specifically, IC.01.06.01 states: \"The hospital prepares to respond to an influx of potentially infectious patients.\" Based on the recent spread of COVID-19 and the increasing chance that we will see more cases in the United States, we recommend that hospitals review their plans, assess whether they can rapidly and reliably implement their plans as designed, and modify their plans if needed based on their assessment. We recently published a report on conversion of a conference room into a low-acuity inpatient medical unit to respond to an influenza outbreak, and this may be a model for some hospitals. 2 If there are severe outbreaks, some communities may even want to consider creating surge hospitals. 3 Surge hospitals, so-called because they are designed to treat a surge in the number of patients needing care, contain triage, treatment, and sometimes even surgical capabilities. These temporary facilities were originally established to deal with community-wide events (such as hurricanes) and meant to serve as a stopgap measure to provide medical care until the area's health care organizations could reopen. However, surge hospitals could have a role in pandemics if all hospitals in a community are overwhelmed despite activating their internal surge plans.","The final principle is support. Perianesthesia nursing leaders should ensure that their staff has the proper education and training to care for surge patients, adequate quantities of surge supplies, and sufficient staff reinforcements should a true influenza pandemic present itself. Because of the inherent infection control issues, staff should also receive training regarding which personal protective equipment (PPE) is necessary and how to properly don and doff the PPE. 14,15 Supply shortages will be routine in a pandemic, thereby making it impractical to rely on just-in-time supplies. Some supplies will be available to health care facilities from the federal Strategic National Stockpile; however, these ''push packages'' are delivered to the state level, and it may take time for the supplies to arrive at the local facility requesting the items. 16 As such, par levels should be increased for critical items, in anticipation of high use and broken supply chains.","Religious Networks, Local Temples, and Quasi-Illegal Organizations. In Taiwan, temples play an important role in local lives and communities. Because of their huge cash flows and unsupervised finances, temples are the foundation of Taiwan's underground economy. Temples also serve as a place for regular gathering and information sharing within the communities. Finally, temples usually function as local charities in Taiwan and may provide emergency support in natural disasters (though their roles in this regard are limited). Therefore, temples tend to have important political influence over local communities and a capacity for political mobilization. Because a large number of people on both sides of the Taiwan Strait share similar religions, the Chinese state apparatus has noticed the potential to use temples and religious exchanges to win local people's heart. Accordingly, the Chinese state apparatus has been actively seeking local agents' help to develop cross-Strait religious networks with temples in Taiwan.","The relatively large numbers of covid-19 patients with hypoxaemic respiratory failure requiring ICU admission for mechanical ventilation and their high mortality [1] (compared to seasonal influenza) is of particular concern in the current circumstances. In Northern Italy, an exponential increase in COVID-19 admissions rapidly overwhelmed normal ICU capacity [2] and surge capacity had to be created quickly. The exact reason for the sudden need for ICU surge capacity in Italy and whether this will generalise to other countries is unclear, but both demographic factors and healthcare system structure are likely to be important. Notably, UK availability of ICU beds per capita compares poorly with other highincome countries-including Italy [3] .","In conclusion, there are a number of urgent research priorities to inform the public health response to the global spread of 2019-nCoV infections. Establishing robust estimates of the clinical severity of infections is probably the most pressing, because flattening out the surge in hospital admissions would be essential if there is a danger of hospitals becoming overwhelmed with patients who require inpatient care, not only for those infected with 2019-nCoV but also for urgent acute care of patients with other conditions including those scheduled for procedures and operations. In addressing the research gaps identified here, there is a need for strong collaboration of a competent corps of epidemiological scientists and public health workers who have the flexibility to cope with the surge capacity required, as well as support from laboratories that can deliver on the ever rising demand for diagnostic tests for 2019-nCoV and related sequelae. The readiness survey by Reusken et al. in this issue of Eurosurveillance testifies to the rapid response and capabilities of laboratories across Europe should the outbreak originating in Wuhan reach this continent [23].","Working for long hours, disturbed daily routines including eating and sleeping schedules and fear of being infected are key factors that increase the risks of stress and anxiety for doctors and nurses, and may lead to their working less efficiently in terms of providing better treatment and care to patients. Under these pressures, some medical staff have experienced an emotional breakdown at the frontline [4] . The situation worsened for medical staff after the death of Dr Liang Wudong, who contracted 2019n-CoV. The increasing number of suspected individuals every day and the shortage of laboratory staff could increase the workload and may delay routine clinical tests for infected or suspected individuals. Furthermore, the shortage of protective coverings further increases the chances of getting the infection [5] . Staff have been asked to use substandard masks, putting them at greater risk [4] . The healthcare authorities have stepped up efforts to overcome the problems and have sent thousands of medical personnel including army medical staff to Wuhan. To cope with further shortages, the designated hospitals have transferred medical and clinical testing staff to frontline departments from other departments such as oncology, orthopaedics and medicines. In addition, healthcare workers from several undesignated healthcare units have been transferred to designated hospitals for coronavirus-infected patients. In order to increase the space and availability of sickbeds, regular hospital patients (not infected with 2019n-CoV) are being moved out of hospitals, and admissions for new regular patients are being delayed. Several hospitals are setting up online medical consultations for these patients to discuss their conditions and seek help. Furthermore, some companies are working to make diagnostic kits available on a large scale, but it may take some time. However, the increasing number of patients every day and the expected peak in the coming days [6] may cause a further shortage of medical staff and health and logistic issues for the frontline healthcare provider.","The emergence of a novel form of Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) in Wuhan has created a confused and rapidly evolving situation. Not surprisingly, the UK media are already reporting a substantial psychological impact of both the outbreak and the response. Residents have been comparing the situation to \"the end of the world,\" hospitals are \"overwhelmed\" and there are concerns about food shortages. \"Panic in Wuhan\" is a common refrain (Rubin and Wessely, 2020) . In this situational framework, patients and front-line healthcare workers are vulnerable to the emotional impact of oronavirus Maunder et al., 2003; Folkman and Greer, 2000) .","Responding quickly to an epidemic is important in order to facilitate disease control and to protect students, staff and the community from fear and disruption of work. In the case of the surge of cases in this epidemic, the College of Nursing quickly responded to the needs of students and staff by both by providing them with information and listening to their concerns. The College of Nursing also developed policies to protect the university and hospital communities during the time of the epidemic. The use of a small task force was imperative as large committees sometimes take a long time to form, meet and agree on a way forward.","The COVID-19 pandemic will lead to a surge in the number of critically ill patients. 4 Hospitals throughout the world will become overwhelmed, and care will be provided at a lower resource level than usual. Along with preventive measures and infection control, the clinical care of these patients will be a fundamental determinant of the pandemic's overall impact.","The demyelinating disease Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is the most important cause of neurological disability in young adults in Northern temperate regions. While the disease is probably multifactorial in aetiology, several lines of evidence indicate that there is a strong environmental element in its causation. A possible viral component to MS pathogenesis has been consid-ered a possibility for many years, and while there is a long list of viruses that have been reported to be present in MS brain tissues using various techniques, previous reports of virus isolation have generally not been confirmed. This whole subject has therefore remained highly controversial. More recently, many groups have used sophisticated molecular virological techniques in attempts to address this issue. It is also possible that a virus may only be involved in the initial stages of MS-the socalled 'hit and run' scenario-in which case evidence of active viral infection in MS brain tissue would not be expected. Also, if MS is truly a heterogeneous disease, then a virus or indeed any other aetiological component may be involved in some cases but not others. This talk will give a broad overview of past and current attempts to identify viruses, viral nucleic acids and viral antigens in MS tissue. It will also focus on recent work that has implicated a possible role of Human Herpes Virus-6 (HHV-6) in MS, primarily studies that have suggested that viral DNA and RNA is increased in MS lesions compared with normal tissues, although the data in that area too remains controversial as the possible role of human endogenous retroviruses (HERV) in MS which will also be mentioned. There has also been recent interest in abnormal immune responses to EBV in MS patients. The latter indicates that a viral infection and altered immunity in MS are not necessarily inconsistent. CTX-M extended-spectrum related b-lactamases were first detected in human clinical isolates nearly simultaneously in Germany and Argentina in 1989. Since then a dramatic increase in prevalence has been observed all over the world both in the nosocomial and community settings. Factors fuelling this situation include genetic aspects related to efficient blaCTX-M gene dissemination and enzymatic expression, bacterial host-specific features and frequent co-resistance to other antimicrobials. blaCTX-M genes are linked to apparently simple genetic structures including IS sequences (ISEcp1-like insertion sequences) and integrons (In60-like integrons) and to a lesser extent to phage-related constructions. These genetic supports are inserted in higher-order genetic complex structures such us transposable elements (Tn21-like transposons) and plasmids, which undoubtedly facilitate the mobility of blaCTX-M genes. The allodemic population structure, commonly associated to CTX-M producing isolates, illustrates this situation. Nevertheless, successful epidemic CTX-M producing clones have been also identified not only in the nosocomial setting but also in the community. blaCTX-M gene environments and surrounding structures might have also facilitated the acquisition of other resistance cassettes or their integration in structures previously harbouring these resistance cassettes. Co-resistance, including aminoglycosides, fluoroquinolones, trimethoprim and sulfonamides facilitates successful maintenance of CTX-M producing isolates and coselection within bacterial communities. Intestinal colonization with CTX-M producing E. coli isolates has been increasingly recognized suggesting a potential source for clinical isolation. Nevertheless, CTX-M producing isolates have been associated with phylogenetic group D, commonly associated with extra intestinal pathogenic isolates but also with fluoroquinolone resistant isolates. On the other hand, enzymatic expression of early CTX-M ESBL yields higher resistance to cefotaxime than ceftazidime. However, CTX-M producing isolates have compensated this partial resistance phenotype with amino acid substitutions that expand the hydrolytic properties of CTX-M enzymes to ceftazidime and/or with the acquisition of other ESBL, mainly from SHV or TEM families, which generally affect both expanded spectrum cephalosporins. Continuous evolution of CTX-M enzymes and successful persistence and mobilization of blaCTX-M genes allow maintenance and increasing isolation of CTX-M producing isolates in clinical setting.","Existing inpatient facilities in the camps are already operating close to full bed occupancy, and all scenarios show that they will be overwhelmed. Under current conditions, we expect this to occur within 2 to 4.5 months (58-139 days) of the first introduction of the virus, with cumulative hospitalizations reaching 84 to 18,931 in the first 3 months, depending upon the scenario; these numbers rise dramatically by 12 months. Current hospital bed surge capacity (630) as reported from the site may almost double the number of available beds, but even then, it only delays overwhelming the capacity by 3-10 days on average (Table S2) . Furthermore, while we have focused on the health needs of severe cases, health centers will be flooded with patients with mild to moderate symptoms also seeking care.","(2) Protecting the medical professionals. An immediate alert is issued to the medical staff who are in close contact with the suspect case so that they can take the necessary precautions. (3) The new cross-the-board IDC data warehouse would provide information for analysis of the sources and routes of infection, either in hospitals or communities. This valuable information could also be used for future epidemiology studies on contact histories, possible contact histories and possible transmission routes, and for control and tracking the spread of the disease. Take SARS, for instance. If a SARS suspect were identified, IDC would generate reports on the patient's medical and hospitalization history, as well as his/her personal data, such as information on family members, place of employment and address. CDC could use this information to trace the source of infection and perform control and quarantine measures. Also, this information could be released to all healthcare institutions as a reference to make early preparations for further outbreaks.","Following the publication of HMA/EMA guidelines, several European stakeholder associations have released position papers confirming their significant concerns on the shortages in the EU and proposing solutions to overcome criticalities still on the ground regardless of the HMA/EMA task force interventions. In May 2019 more than 30 organisations representing patients, consumers, healthcare professionals and public health advocates stimulated the European Commission to do more in identifying the factors leading to medicines shortages and providing clear and transparent information on the root causes (Various Associations, 2019a). In December 2019, the European associations representing manufacturers, parallel distributors, pharmaceutical full-line wholesalers and industrial pharmacists issued a position paper in which they stated their view on the root causes' classification and provided suggestions to improve the European cooperation in preventing shortage impact on public health (Various Associations, 2019b). In particular, it has been highlighted the need to find collaborative solutions for medicine shortages to coordinate EU and National policies and communication campaigns. The cooperation should start from the adoption of a harmonized shortage definition and the rational definition of a \"risk of shortage\" for essential products in the EU. Moreover, they also underlined the importance of improving the monitoring of shortages and cooperation in the EU by the establishment of a priority ranking of shortages to address \"high-risk\" medicinal products efficiently without introducing disproportionate initiatives that could have opposite effects to the ones intended."," The Beijing epidemic has many features in common with those experienced elsewhere, including the disproportionate impact on healthcare workers and amplification of disease in hospitals. The pattern of transmission is consistent with droplet or contact spread. The apparent success of infection control, isolation, contact tracing, and quarantine in bringing the outbreak under control is encouraging, particularly because these efforts were introduced later in the epidemic in Beijing than in some other settings. Whether features particular to Beijing had a major influence on the evolution or characteristics of the outbreak is not yet clear. Careful clinical assessments of patients cared for during the outbreak will be valuable, since in addition to steroids and antiviral drugs, traditional Chinese medicine was frequently used in caring for SARS patients. Whether treatment strategies might be responsible for the lower age-specific case-fatality ratios in Beijing compared with reports from other places is not yet known, and the lower case-fatality ratio may derive in part from the nonspecific case definition with resulting misclassification of some pneumonias of other causes as probable SARS. While population density might have made the outbreak more difficult to control in Beijing, the massive and efficient mobilization of communities and health workers to respond to the outbreak was likely an asset.","An outbreak of COVID-19 began in Wuhan, China in early December 2019 and is ongoing. There have been 80,955 confirmed COVID-19 cases, and 3,162 deaths in China as of March 11, 2020. 1 Early on during the COVID-19 outbreak, healthcare workers (HCW) were found to beat high risk of developing COVID-19, even when infection prevention measures were in place, including usage of personal protective equipment (PPE: eye protection/face shield, respiratory protection, isolation gowns, and gloves), hand hygiene, and patient placement in negative-pressure isolation rooms. Thus far, 1,688 HCWs have become infected with SARS-CoV-2 in China, including 1,080 HCW cases in Wuhan where the outbreak started. 2, 3 However, the World Health Organization (WHO) indicates that many of the newer cases of HCW infection have stemmed from household exposures. 4 The COVID-19 outbreak caused a sudden, significant increase in hospital visits from infected and suspected individuals over the course of two months. 5, 6 The large patient surge overwhelmed hospitals, despite continuous efforts to expand hospital capacity. Hospital waiting times were extended, which increased the time before infected individuals were identified and placed into isolation.","In less than four months, the outbreak has rapidly escalated from a World Health In the midst of this chaotic pandemic, the health care systems and its providers are endangered. In particular, front-line health care workers -emergency medicine physicians, intensivists, anesthesiologists, nurses, and many others -have continued to care for massive surges of COVID-19 patients in the setting of health systems illprepared for the level of disease severity with dangerous, worldwide shortages of personal protective equipment (PPE) and protocols that might attenuate health worker risk overwhelmed. Over 9,000 health care workers have developed infection internationally including 3,400 in China and over 6, 200 in Italy, as well as hundreds of infections in United States personnel. 4 During this time of a global health emergency, rapid communication, international collaboration, and transparency are critical to better inform and adapt the guidance of precautionary measures when new evidence becomes available. Countries around the world have responded in different ways in managing risk to ophthalmologists and patients in the absence of signs or symptoms of COVID-19. Preparedness through risk mitigation strategies for the public, patient and providers are warranted and should be informed by available evidence and our collective, global experience. The gaps in evidence that we face also need to be addressed during this pandemic to guide international consensus and inform preparedness measures for future outbreaks. Limiting ambulatory care services to time-sensitive or urgent conditions, particularly in high-volume specialties such as ophthalmology, have also been recommended to reduce the potential for transmission in the community and physician offices. However, measures within the clinic are also needed to mitigate risk for patients with urgent or emergent complaints, and routine evaluations as the outbreak abates.","The initial approach at UW Medicine involved discerning what areas in our hospitals would be most greatly be impacted early in the COVID-19 pandemic and focusing those areas most impacted by a surge of acutely and critically ill patients with COVID-19. A document was drafted that identified the areas where palliative care would likely be needed most, which led to a focus on the emergency department, intensive care units and key acute care medical services where most patients with COVID-19 would be seen. The next part of the plan detailed the form and function of the palliative care team in the context of the current capacity, a contingency capacity, and a crisis capacity. We identified the form of support as including coaching for the delivery of primary palliative care, brief and targeted palliative care consultations to address key issues, and full palliative care consultations. We focused on the primary areas of need identified as we began to see patients with COVID-19 in our healthcare system, including identifying and address goals of care, addressing code status to reduce the risk of unwanted or non-beneficial cardiopulmonary resuscitation in the context of COVID-19, identifying and addressing moderate or severe symptoms not adequately addressed through primary palliative care, and supporting family members in the difficult context of restricted visitation and possible self-quarantine.","Managing respiratory illness in long-term care facilities: Ten clinical practice guidelines recommended the use of antivirals for prophylaxis of staff and/or residents and one recommended early mobilization of residents ( Table 2 , Appendix 6).","The US classified the coronavirus disease pandemic (COVID-19) as a national emergency on March 14, 2020 . Cumulative US cases surged beyond 122,000 on March 29, 2020. [2, 3] Its rapid spread in China and Italy quickly overwhelmed available hospital beds. [4, 5] County-level forecasts of demand for hospital beds based on data commonly available to hospitals would help guide US hospital efforts to anticipate and mitigate similar bed shortages. [6, 7] In order to plan their response, hospital and public health officials need to understand how many people in their area are likely to require hospitalization for COVID-19; how these numbers compare to the number of available intensive care and acute care beds; and how to project the impact of socialdistancing measures on utilization. Since the majority of people with COVID-19 are asymptomatic and the rates of cases requiring hospitalization differ significantly across age groups, answering these questions requires understanding the epidemic and accounting for the specific vulnerabilities of the local population. [8, 9] The numbers of people in each age group differ significantly across US counties, as do the available hospital resources [10, 11] . Initial analyses of the potential impact of COVID-19 have spurred governmental action at the federal and state level; however, significant differences remain in the policies implemented across states and counties. [9, 12] In order to help facilitate adequate and appropriate local responses, we developed a simple model to project the number of people in each county in the United States who are likely to require hospitalization as a result of COVID-19 given the age distribution of the county per the US Census. The model compares the projected number of individuals needing hospitalization to the publicly known numbers of available intensive and acute care beds and allows users to model the impact of social-distancing or other measures to slow the spread of the virus. The uncertainty surrounding the numbers of people infected and the rates of spread make it difficult to evaluate the accuracy of projections generated by complex epidemiological models. The model presented errs on the side of simplicity and transparency to allow non-specialist policymakers to fully understand the logic and uncertainty associated with the estimates.","Measures to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic are a focus of communities in countries, but preparedness plans should consider refugees and migrants and their needs. Evidence shows that this vulnerable population has a low risk of transmitting communicable diseases to host populations in general. 4 However, refugees and migrants are potentially at increased risk of contracting diseases, including COVID-19, because they typically live in overcrowded conditions without access to basic sanitation. The ability to access health-care services in humanitarian settings is usually compromised and exacerbated by shortages of medicines and lack of health-care facilities. Moreover, refugees typically face administrative, financial, legal, and language barriers to access the health system. 4 Conditions in refugee camps are concerning. Many people who have been affected by humanitarian crises live in camps or camp-like settings in host countries. These camps usually provide inadequate and overcrowded living arrangements that present a severe health risk to inhabitants and host populations. The absence of basic amenities, such as clean running water and soap, insufficient medical personnel presence, and poor access to adequate health information are major problems in these settings.","Evaluations and planning has focused on mass casualty incidents isolated to specific communities. [13] [14] [15] There has been no published and distributed plan instituted for residents in such a population health scenario as presented by COVID-19. For example, residents' roles in the disaster response to the Boston Marathon bombing was unclear. There was no understanding if residents would be expected to provide surge staffing or if they would be stratified by experience. 13 Though most hospitals train nurses and attendings for mass-casualty events, fewer than half train residents. 14, 15 This is a gap in medical education that should be addressed as these incidences are unfortunately becoming more frequent. Most resident staffing during crises is managed ad hoc by chief residents or program directors. Communications should be in place, whether by group text, online meeting applications or other local mechanism, so that chief residents act as a liaison between institutional command, attending physicians and resident teams. It is likely that trainees could be asked to work beyond scheduled duty hours. Local graduate medical education leadership should be involved in preparations, and knowledge of ACGME program requirements is essential. It is possible residents will be asked to work beyond accepted duty hours, and these exceptions should be made known to the ACGME, but exemptions should be provided given the national emergency. Graduated autonomy and extension of attending physicians by senior residents as well as battlefield promotions of fellows and Chief Residents will be the most logical progression as the response to the crisis escalates and personnel are furloughed or quarantined.","In the event of overwhelming circumstances due to patient numbers, and staff, bed, and resource scarcity, we need to fall back to trauma training and the scenarios of mass casualty. Recovery rooms may be used for patient bedding, pre-operative areas can be used for staff berthing, and each OR, equipped with its own medical gas, suction, and ventilator, is a potential ICU bed. Many types of PPE, particularly N95 respirators and surgical masks, can and should be worn for the duration of your shift and reused after appropriate cleaning for multiple days, if not overtly soiled. (3) Critical to avoiding being overwhelmed is proper triage. Patients who can go home should never be admitted. Under dire circumstances, the most difficult decision may be labeling a living patient (likely critically ill or with major comorbidities) moribund, and moving on to the next patient with a greater chance of survival.","Unfortunately, at the end of each recent EBR crisis, network activity vanished and most European projects were not sustained because of a lack of funding. SOPs and actions must be worked out, tested, and revised during inter-crisis periods to prepare for future crises. A new COREB national mission was created in 2014 to share and reinforce the experience of the French SCE group; this new mission was supported and funded concomitantly by the French Ministry of Health and the SPILF. Its main objective was to allow maintenance activity and continuous professional multidisciplinary operational expertise. The COREB mission has been embedded in the National Plan dedicated to the management of Exceptional Health Situations published by the French Ministry of Health in 2014 (ORSAN plan) [20] . Here the main task is, during the inter-crisis time, to maintain the skillsstrongly based on training of health professionals -and to stimulate a permanent activity of the EBR clinical network of the 16 reference hospitals for preparation adjusted to the risk level. In parallel, preparing and publishing SOPs using a PMOR methodology is considered essential. A future supplementary strategy to be developed is the preparation and management of EBR-suspect patients by outpatient medical staff, which reflects the reality of a patient pathway. Such an in-depth response strategy would increase frontline practitioners' involvement, limit the activity overload of reference hospitals, and allow for a more operational, graduated, and adjusted mobilization of the healthcare system if an alert occurs.","The emergence of any novel virus, in particular one that can be transmitted via the respiratory route, has to be taken seriously. A rapid response, a united global front and mobilization of resources and expertise are our best tools in preventing or reducing the devastation that some of these viruses can cause. This is exemplified by the recent events that have led to the recognition and isolation of the novel coronavirus responsible for acute respiratory illness. Within weeks of the first report, a PCR-based diagnostic assay was made available [1], a preliminary case definition [39] and incubation period was issued [40], the virus was fully sequenced [4], the detection of new cases was rapidly communicated to the health authorities and more recently, guidelines for handling and working with this virus have been issued [24]. The novel coronavirus is the 6th member of the human coronaviruses and the third to be isolated in the last ten years. Based on current information, NCoV does not appear to transmit easily or sustainably between people, but it can lead to serious lower respiratory tract infection and renal failure. The mode of transmission has not been conclusively identified, although respiratory route looks most likely. A study which is in press, has shown that a number of different bat species resident in Ghana and parts of Europe are infected with coronaviruses very similar to NCoV, in some cases differing by less than 2% at the genetic level [41]. These findings suggest that NCoV is most likely to have arisen from bat viruses. However, a number of pertinent questions remain unanswered: Does NCoV represent an interspecies jump of a bat coronavirus? How did humans acquired the infection? Was it a direct infection from bats to humans or did it involve an intermediate host such as domestic animals? Are the virus isolates from all infected persons genetically identical? Do NCoV genetic variants exits in the human population, but cause mild or asymptomatic infections? Future studies will no doubt attempt to address these and other related questions. For the time being, surveillance and thorough investigations of cases with unexplained severe respiratory illness, particularly in those residing in or returning from Middle East, is being recommended [24].","Our aim is to ensure that the iSAVE can be reliably implemented and utilized across intensive care clinical settings in cases of ventilator shortages. To this end, further steps must be taken to address current limitations. 1) Due to differences in performance characteristics (mechanism of pressure/flow monitoring) of ICU ventilators, this approach must be tested across a range of ventilators in both volume and pressure control modes.","By reconstructing other Ae. aegypti vectored outbreaks, analyzing climatic conditions, investigating news reports, and modeling mosquito abundance, our study suggests that the establishment of Zika virus in Cuba may have been delayed by an Ae. aegypti control campaign ( Figure 5C ). This accomplishment highlights the value of mosquito control for limiting transmission , as Cuba may have been able to reduce the local burden of both dengue and Zika, despite otherwise conducive environmental conditions to support transmission of the viruses ( Figure 5B ). Publicly available reports indicate that the response to Zika by Cuban authorities intensified in early 2016 and included active and passive surveillance, training of health professionals, communication and mobilization, and the application of adulticides and larvicides for mosquito control (Castell-Florit Serrate and M\u00e1 s-Bermejo, Castro et al., 2017; Gorry, 2016; Reardon, 2016) . This strategy was built upon years of effective dengue control through capacity building and research (Guzm\u00e1 n, 2005; Guzm\u00e1 n and Kour\u00ed, 2009). Although our observation of the suppression of both dengue virus transmission and Zika virus establishment during periods that we found were otherwise suitable for Ae. aegypti-borne transmission ( Figure 5C ) suggests that the mosquito control campaign was successful, we were unable to obtain empirical data to confirm these findings. Competition between dengue and Zika viruses-as previous exposure to dengue virus may protect against Zika virus infections in humans (Gordon et al., 2019; Rodriguez-Barraquer et al., 2019 )-may also have played a role in delaying the establishment of Zika virus in Cuba. However, how cross-protection, or other epidemiological interactions (Vogels et al., 2019) , between these two flaviviruses may impact outbreaks is not currently clear, and such potential virus ''competition'' would likely not be unique to Cuba. For future studies, accurate data on Zika virus seroprevalence in Cuba and other Caribbean islands would be helpful to address these questions. In addition, the availability of empirical mosquito abundance data would allow for an assessment of yearto-year differences in transmission potential and to specifically test whether Ae. aegypti populations were reduced during the control campaign in Cuba, as we previously observed in Florida . Importantly, vector abundance studies, including making such data publicly available, should be prioritized and more fully supported for future mosquito-borne virus outbreaks (Rund and Martinez, 2018) .","Results: Currently, the information system covers 100% of TB patients under management and 100% high-risk populations which need to be rapidly diagnosed of drug-resistant TB. Automated data transfer reduces workload and prevents entry errors caused by first-line staff. We observed increase of timeliness and accuracy of data. Automated real-time analysis of indicators can enhance laboratory quality management and facilitate prompt response to occurrences. Moreover, centralized monitoring of effectiveness of the laboratory services and case management are conducted by TCDC periodically. The system improves mobilization of TB control activities and outbreak responses. Conclusion: Our findings indicate that effective, timely and comprehensive information sharing through the web-based \"MONITOR\" system can improve TB care and control.","Our study has some notable limitations. First, some cases had incomplete documentation of the exposure history, symptoms and laboratory testing given the variation in the structure of electronic database among different participating site and the urgent timeline for data extraction. Some cases were diagnosed in out-patient settings where medical information was briefly documented and incomplete laboratory testing was applied. There was a shortage of infrastructure and training of medical staff in non-specialty hospitals, which has been aggravated by the burn-out of local medical staff in milieu of a surge of cases. Second, because many patients still remained in the hospital, we did not compare the 28-day rate of the composite endpoint. To mitigate the potential bias, we have applied the competing-risk model for analysis. Third, we might have missed asymptomatic or mild cases managed at home, and hence our cohort might represent the more severe end of 2019-nCoV ARD. However, there were a minority of patients who had no apparent radiologic manifestations, suggesting that we had included patients at the early stage of disease. Last, we took reference on the existing international guideline to define the severity of 2019-nCoV because of its global recognition [15] .","The breakdown of health care in Syria under the present conflict has been highlighted in ProMED reports on the increasing risk of leishmaniasis [1] [2] [3] [4] and rabies. 5 However, these reports merely reflect the drastic deterioration in health care. A recent report from M\u00e9 decins Sans Fronti\u00e8 res 6 highlights not only the destruction of health care facilities and the difficulties in treating injured people, but also describes the absence of childhood immunizations in many areas, lack of pharmaceuticals including antibiotics, and the lack of access to clean water and surge in diarrhea cases. Furthermore, medical facilities and staff have been deliberately targeted; 7 the Independent International Commission of Inquiry on Syria wrote in a report this month, ''Medical personnel and hospitals have been deliberately targeted and are treated by parties to the conflict as military objectives.'' 8, 9 The conflict is expected to reverse the recent gains seen in the falling infant mortality rate and increased childhood immunization rate. 10 Under these circumstances a surge in infectious diseases in both Syria and neighboring countries can be expected.","Do not lose hope. As Wuhan has taught us with social distancing, strict quarantine and abundant testing, we can beat back this disease and mitigate its effect on our communities. In any rapidly evolving crisis, certain principles remain key to combating a constantly evolving and austere situation. Act with speed of the plan above perfection of the plan. Flexibility in the face of adversity is required, and those that are not able to deftly change strategies with new information will be battling the past and not preparing for the future. Even in this response plan, adaptation and integration of individual situations will be required. Communication with an assigned structure is vital to ensuring the entire team, service, facility, and system are working on the same page and criteria. Situation reports within each of these strata is vital to understand the situation on the ground as well as the plan for the institution. However, succinctness is required so that worried and overwhelmed providers can quickly process and implement new information and protocols. Most of all, a sense of community, purpose and legacy is paramount to keep us mission focused on the health of our patients and community; support and acknowledgement of our risk and sacrifice as physicians, providers\u2026as healers, are not in vain.","Another important research development is the adoption of methods that depend on community or multistakeholder participation in order to better address issues that span environmental health and sustainability concerns (Merrifield, 1993; O\u2019Fallon and Dearry, 2002; Witten et al., 2000; Parkes and Panelli, 2001; Bunch, 2003; Waltner-Toews, 2003; Brown et al., 2005). Infectious disease researchers are beginning to follow this lead, informed not only by the positive impact of participatory research on communities, but also by the increased attention to the rights of underrepresented and indigenous communities around the world that is changing the political landscape of donor participation in development, the environment (Chapin, 2004), and health (GFHR, 2004). Innovative research projects that bridge disciplines and engage with place-based knowledge sets of communities vulnerable to EID infection, as well as with nonacademic stakeholders who work with such communities, have great potential not only to increase our capacity to prevent and control emerging infections, but also to meet maturing demands of 21st century funders and donors.","One famous agent is the Chinese Unification Promotion Party, also known as the Unionist Party. The Unionist Party was founded in 2005 by the \"White Wolf\" Chang An-lo, formerly a key member of the Bamboo Union, a gang accused of engaging in organized crime. The Unionist Party is controversial not only because of its strong pro-unification stance, but also due to its aggressive tactics. For example, it provoked violence and attacked pro-independence demonstrators in the 2017 \"Sing! China\" event at National Taiwan University. In addition, its members were constantly seen holding Chinese flags outside the Taipei 101 skyscraper to confront Falun Gong ( , f\u01ce lun g\u014dng) members. 39 Moreover, in 2019, during a rally in Taiwan supporting pro-democracy movements in Hong Kong, the Unionist Party members threw red paint at the participants. 40 Furthermore, the Unionist Party held several conferences and activities in Taiwan to promote the idea of unification by any means, including brute force. The Unionist Party also uses its networks to help Chinese people more easily enter Taiwan to conduct political propaganda. For example, the Unionist Party invited Li Yi, a Chinese scholar, who once argued for the necessity of using force for unification, to deliver a political speech in a pro-unification conference although Li's visa was only for tourism. In addition, Chang Wei, son of Chang An-lo, runs the Huaxia Dadi Travel Service Co, a shadow travel agency for Chinese tourists. Huaxia Dadi and other shadow travel agencies have used \"fake exchange proposals\" to secretly and illegally help more than 5,000 Chinese people enter Taiwan, including Chinese civil servants. According to one report in CommonWealth Magazine, there are three pillars of the Unionist Party: gangs (or former gangs), temples, and overseas Taiwanese businesses. The Unionist Party and temples have a close cooperative relationship, and some have secured important positions in temple groups. A notable example is Lin Kuo-ching, a former gang member, who is now a member of the Unionist Party's central committee. Lin serves as the honorary chairman of several temples, and has excellent relations with the Taiwan Mazu Fellowship run by Yen Ching-piao. Moreover, because smaller temples usually find it hard to establish channels for interaction with temples in China, they turn to the Unionist Party for help. In exchange, they give party members lucrative contracts for the temple's processions and rituals. Now, several small and medium private temples around Taiwan are said to have links with the Unionist Party. 42 In sum, the Unionist Party, other pro-unification organizations, and Taiwanese local temples jointly have created a powerful network of local political mobilization. Such a network has become a major channel for the Chinese state apparatus to target the grass roots in Taiwan and cultivate local communities' affinity with China and the CCP.","Prompted by the rapid expansion of the epidemic from April 16 to April 19, the Beijing Municipal Government established a Joint SARS Leading Group to oversee crisis management through 10 task forces. The medical and public health task force set up an emergency command center on April 24 and organized fever clinics for triage, designated SARS areas within hospitals for isolation and specialized care, provided personal protective equipment and training for healthcare workers, and introduced community-based prevention and control through case detection, isolation, quarantine, and community mobilization. To reduce transmission within healthcare settings, Beijing authorities issued protocols for triage, isolation, case management, and administrative controls, which prohibited visitors to hospitals and separated patients who were under medical observation or suspected of having SARS from areas with other patients.","Several recent publications have addressed the issue of expansion of intensive care in an epidemic [31] [32] [33] . Rubinson and colleagues [32] have recommended modifying usual standards of care, termed ''emergency mass critical care practices,'' to maximize the number of patients treated. Others feel that over-stretching resources and deploying unfamiliar staff may backfire and result in staff infection, as well as a standard of care too poor to be of value. However, most investigators agree that there is a need to develop some surge capacity in response to an epidemic. Preparations include stockpiling positive pressure ventilators and medical supplies, adapting general hospital beds for critical care delivery, augmenting and training staff, enhancing infection control measures, and conducting preparedness exercises. To this end, many local, state, and national bodies have developed such stockpiles and disaster management plans. It is incumbent that all critical care practitioners be aware of these resources and plans . The Appendix lists resources for pandemic influenza planning and preparedness.","The fifth block comprises health workers. Many reports suggest that they are stretched to the point of exhaustion. This situation in part reflects existing staff shortages, again following years of austerity with resultant low salaries. Before the decree, patchy and insufficient measures were suggested such as cancelling holidays or bringing retired nurses and doctors back into the health service. The problems are being exacerbated by the quarantining of a growing number of health workers exposed to patients who are infected. 10 The new decree permits hiring graduates without specialisation, final year medical and nursing students, and extending contracts of medical residents.","A hospital-specific protocol for screening and management is necessary if an epidemic outbreak occurs. In the situation of an unanticipated surge of patients combined with a relative shortage of medical resources (beds, staff and PPE), the establishment of screening and diagnostic protocol for suspected patients can focus medical resources on patients who need them and may help reduce missed cases.","Existing surveillance databases, new study tools, and innovation methodologies may help to identify population health risks and support Health-EDRM policy development. Using a syndromic surveillance database in the Philippines, Salazar, Law, Winkler [7] showed how an existing clinical based database might be useful in assisting emergency health service planning decision making during outbreaks in armed conflict. Even with the database limitations to report injuries and death, this existing data system was nevertheless useful to support non-communicable diseases\u2019 service caseload planning. Using the computerized random digit dialling methods for rapid data collection after a major urban subway fire incident, Chan, Huang, Hung et al. [8] captured health risk perception, misconceptions, and community first-aid response knowledge in urban man-made emergency incidents. Using social media data from Twitter, Gruebner, Lowe, Sykora et al. [9] showed how the spatio-temporal distribution of negative emotions varied in New York City after a natural disaster. Their study showed that pre-disaster status could be used as a significant predictor of post-disaster emotional outcomes in communities. Using a disturbance management model to estimate logistics constraints in medical supplies during natural disasters, Shi and He [10] examined how medical supplies, which required cold-chain support (e.g., blood and vaccines), might be optimized after natural disasters when transport might be disturbed. Using a three-phase methodology and the online, global, and publicly available databases, Chan, Huang, Lam et al. [11] developed a health vulnerability index (HVI) that captures seven main health dimensions with nine indicators. This index allows the inclusion of non-communicable disease burden of countries/communities into the disaster risk assessment and may reflect underlying health needs and the capacity requirement to address Health-EDRM at the country level.","People might resist or be reluctant to be visited by CHWs, and they could opt out of home visits at any time, but experience with CHWs in Brazil in the past 30 years suggests this would happen rarely. 4 In Brazil, 250 000 CHWs provide a much needed and relied upon service. CHWs in Brazil have been established for many years, are well integrated into their communities, and provide a wide range of health and social care support activities to each of the 100-150 households that they are responsible for. Therefore, in Brazil, additional roles for preventing the spread of and supporting those infected with COVID-19 or in self-isolation could be integrated into the work of CHWs. Much can be learned from countries with successful experiences of radical, large-scale workforce interventions. 9 It could be argued that this is an unrealistic proposal and that adapting the existing system or training so many people is too challenging. However, current health and social care systems in the UK are under extreme pressure and could become overwhelmed. In a time of fear, isolation, and growing health inequalities, 10 use of CHWs for the COVID-19 response would boost social coherence and fill gaps that have begun to emerge between health and social care and in-person and virtual access to health care. Our proposal for CHWs would produce a large cadre of people with an understanding of basic epidemiological and public health concepts 11 who could challenge scientific misinformation and explain the rationale for specific health policies and interventions to the public. This approach would also help build a new generation of leaders who can help tackle the complex challenges of our age. ","This study included COVID-2019 patients from Zhongnan Hospital, one of the largest tertiary teaching hospitals in Wuhan, Hubei province. From late December, 2019 to early January, 2020, before large scale isolation measures were implemented, many departments in the hospital experienced cross-infection among patients and to the medical staff, due to unrecognized infectious patients and lack of proper protection. Many patients in incubation period came to the hospital for illnesses other than respiratory symptoms or fever [1] . After being designated as the specialized hospital, special isolation wards were built in each department [7] . The period from which we collected the clinical data was before the prevention was in full implementation. Indeed, the overall mortality and the rate of severe cases in the study are higher than the national figures. There may be several causes for the higher mortality in Wuhan compared to other cities. First, the rapid transmission of the virus and increase of patient volume quickly overwhelmed medical resources in Wuhan, leaving many patients to receive care later in the clinical course. Secondly, there were a large number of patients who had mild or transient symptoms who never received .

If the information is related to public health emergency event and meets any one of the following criteria, it can be incorporated into daily surveillance report: (a) Severity of disease: (i) high pathogen infectivity (e.g., measles, pertussis, diphtheria, poliomyelitis, etc.); (ii) high mortality (e.g., SARS, smallpox, avian H5N1/H7N9 influenza, plague, pulmonary anthrax, Ebola virus disease, Marburg fever, yellow fever, etc.); (iii) high proportion of hospitalization or serious cases; and (iv) diseases without effective treatment or prevention measures. (b) Unusual or unexpected disease mode or pattern: (i) the number of cases and deaths exceed historical level; (ii) abnormal distribution of affected areas, seasons and populations; and (iii) abnormal infectivity and pathogenicity (e.g., abnormal increase in influenza mortality, etc.). (c) Emerging or reemerging infectious diseases: (i) emerging infectious disease; or (ii) reemergence of infectious diseases which were assumed to have been eliminated or eradicated (e.g., smallpox, poliomyelitis, etc.). (d) Restriction of travel or trade: (i) the event resulted in warning of tourism in local area; and/or (ii) the event resulted in constraint upon commodity trade. (e) Special background of event: (i) the event took place in densely populated area; (ii) natural disaster, technical incident/disaster or other events affecting normal social functions took place immediately prior to this event; and (iii) the event took place during mass gatherings or activities. (f ) Media attentions: When any of the following conditions is met, it is deemed media attentions are paid to the event: (i) the event was first reported in internal report channel and there was no official release, but the media has begun to report the event; (ii) the event was released in publicly, while the mainstream media reported or reprinted the event in large number; or (iii) the event took place overseas, and there is already media report in Chinese. (g) Likelihood of further spread or exaggeration: primarily consider the possibility of further expansion of affected area of the event, or increase in the number of cases or deaths. (h) Progress of researches that bear significant implications for infectious disease prevention and control. 2. If the event coincides with natural disaster or technical incident/disaster, and meets any of the following conditions, it should be incorporated in daily report: (a) Number of people affected: the number of people requiring emergency care or immediate displacement as a result of the emergency event. While assessing this, agencies at different levels should define appropriate thresholds according to the volume of medical surge and displacement victims. Preliminarily recommended thresholds on medical surge: (1) at national level, medical surge &gt; capacities of two Class 3 hospitals (the highest level hospital in China, with &gt;500 beds); (2) at provincial level: medical surge &gt; capacities of one Class 3 hospital; (3) at municipal level, medical surge &gt; capacities of one Class 2 hospital; (4) at county level: medical surge &gt; capacities of one Class 1 hospital.","Ensuring adequate staffing is the last line of support. A recent qualitative study examining nurses' beliefs and concerns during public health emergencies revealed an overwhelming fear of abandonment. Nurses believed the clinical settings would be chaotic, with unmanageable numbers of patients and inadequate supplies of PPE. Loss of freedom to leave the hospital and fears that the hospital would not provide treatment to front-line nurses who became ill contributed to nurses' sense of abandonment. 17 Cross-training staff and exploring modified staffing patterns (such as a two-tiered nursing approach in caring for critically ill patients in surge areas with non-critical care nurses) are strongly encouraged so that adequate planning and buy-in can occur before a crisis mandates these actions. Depending on the extent of the pandemic, routine non-urgent activities may be suspended and rede-ployment of staff instituted to enhance surge capacity and reinforce existing staffing.","(2) This practice should include N-95 masks with face-shield or powered air-purifying respirator (PAPR) in a negative-pressure environment. Furthermore, staff not actively participating in patient care due to curtailed routine clinic and operating room activities should be at home. They are not quarantined, but they are on the proverbial \"bench\" to act as a potential ready reserve if needed. Quarantine periods for both staff and patients who have been exposed to any PUI have been set provisionally at 14 days; however, in a critical staffing shortage, it is reasonable to return staff to work after 8-9 days of quarantine provided they are symptom-free. In some situations, this requirement, including a negative COVID-19 test, might be waived altogether due to crisis-level shortages in staffing. In the extreme scenario in which staff with a COVID-19 positive test is asked to come back to work, they should at the very least be symptom-free for at least 72 hours and, upon return, should wear a mask and practice good hand hygiene.","Currently, there is no vaccine for the prevention or treatment of the illness caused by the virus; its origins and the ultimate extent of this epidemic remain unknown. There have been more than 50 research papers published within the last 20 days8 that have allowed for the rapid sharing of scientific information about the virus, but serious questions regarding the causes or mechanisms of transmission, incubation period, risk assessments, and options for effective treatment or intervention of the virus remain largely unanswered.9 There have been reports of significant shortages of medical staff, a lack of clinics that can handle and treat infected patients, and high demands for face masks for protection. The Chinese central government is working with extraordinary diligence to mobilize resources, including building new hospitals and developing new coronavirus vaccine, as well as sending medical experts and clinicians to the city of Wuhan10 to help contain the highly transmittable virus outbreak from spreading further.","In addition to epidemics, natural and man-made disasters have highlighted the need for an emergent increase in critical care capacity globally. In 2010, the Pediatric Emergency Mass Critical Care Task Force, composed of 36 experts in domains, including medicine, public health, and disaster response, recommended that equipment and supplies be available to triple the typical ICU capacity for at least 10 days during times of disaster or epidemic illness regardless of location (113). The 2014 CHEST consensus statement on critical care in resource-limited settings calls for development of feasibility plans to address a protracted event requiring long-term use of critical care resources and capacity to immediately expand hospital critical care resources by 20\u2013200% depending on the surge response required by the disaster/pandemic (114, 115).","What about obvious concerns for healthcare delivery -at least for the early years of the next decade? There are shortages even in developed, wealthier countries of the clinical staff needed both for acute medical care and for chronic disease management, including the needs of ageing populations -not least caring for dementia from vascular disease and Alzheimer's. Sourcing health professionals from less developed countries is a current pragmatic solution for developed countries but unsustainable -and unfair for less developed countries.","Catheterization Laboratory Time-Consideration should be given to lab downsizing case volumes (e.g. deferral of elective cases) and or shift-based allocation of staff/physicians needed to operate the lab in anticipation of likely disruptions to staffing. Despite measures to reduce exposure, staff shortages should be anticipated based on both the possibility of infected/exposed/quarantined staff as well as the derivative impact on staff due to school closings which will put a strain on home, dependent, and child-care resources. Specific consideration to subspecialty care teams may be required, with separation of individuals with overlapping skillsets (e.g. avoidance of two structural heart interventionalists being in the same care area simultaneously). Given the infectious risk of transporting patients from wards to the catheterization lab, some procedures routinely done in the catheterization laboratory should be considered for bedside performance. Examples include pulmonary artery catheter placement, pericardiocentesis, and intra-aortic balloon pump insertion. As mentioned above, the vast number of catheterization labs have either normal or positive ventilation systems and are not designed for infection isolation. Given the need for terminal cleaning following procedures on suspected or known COVID-19 patients, these cases should be done at the end of the working day if possible.","SARS taught the medical community several important lessons. It showed us how rapidly emerging infectious diseases in distant parts of the globe can reach our doorsteps in days, and highlighted the importance of global cooperation to contain infectious diseases. It demonstrated the vulnerability of health care facilities in an airborne epidemic, and the necessity of establishing stringent infection control measures and crisis management protocols. The high proportion of patients requiring mechanical ventilation alerted us to the ease at which an outbreak could overwhelm our critical care resources if we do not develop adequate surge capacity. Finally, SARS renewed our faith in the dedication of the medical professionals who care for patients, even at the risk of their own lives, while underlining the critical duty of health care administrators and senior physicians in instituting procedures to maximize the safety of frontline staff.","There are two questions I hope to address through a critical commentary on the events that unfolded and with social network analysis of the UK based research and policy network that emerged: i) How transformational was the UK policy response to Ebola in relation to changes in evidence use patterns and behaviours? ii) How does the form and function of the UK policy network relate to epistemic community theory? The first question will explore the degree to which social scientists and specifically anthropologists and medical anthropologists, were incorporated into the UK policy network. The second question seeks to locate the dynamics of this network in the literature on network theory and the role of epistemic communities in influencing policy during emergencies.","One of the greatest challenges in emerging epidemics is uncertainty amongst HCW about transmission risks, and fear of becoming a victim of the outbreak disease. ICU is a high-risk area where a larger number of ''high transmission risk'' procedures are performed. Clear concise communication and leadership are critical to tackle stress, fear, fake news and mistrust during the crisis [32] . Staff morale is vulnerable and emotional support should be proactively made available. Frontline staff must be made to feel safe by constant exposure to clear protocols and rigorous training. Expansion of critical care beds to cope with increased numbers of patients by opening more ICU beds, and converting wards and other monitored areas for ICU provision is often recommended in outbreak disaster plans. However, experience from SARS-CoV showed that rapid and excessive expansion may overwhelm staff, lead to excess infections in HCW, and compromise care [33] . Thus, expansion should be matched by safe staffing to guarantee an appropriate quality of care and staff safety, which necessarily limit expansion. It has been suggested by an expert consensus group with first-hand experience of outbreak expansion that this is realistically limited to a maximum of 50-100% of baseline capacity [34] . Alternatively, restricting normal critical care to provide only core and essential provisions, may allow greater expansion and more patients to have limited life sustaining interventions under conditions of limited resources [35] . Should these measures be overwhelmed, individual patient triage and appropriate rationing of ICU care will be required to provide greatest benefit for the Editorial / Anaesth Crit Care Pain Med xxx (2020) xxx-xxx greatest number of patients [36, 37] . A structured triage approach incorporating triage admission criteria that can adapt to the scale of crisis, are fluid and adaptable depending on the evolution of the outbreak and change in response to resource pressures is necessary. A process of development and implementation that provides transparency, an appeal mechanism, documentation of decisions and that is culturally and socially sensitive is recommended [34] .","Clinical evidence helps to progress in patient-level and population-level decision-making. We need to build on prior experience and identify similarities versus differences. In this sense, the pandemic influenza surge in 2009 can be of help. Our colleagues in Wuhan, who placed their lives at risk by treating patients with COVID-19, recently reported their experience in a scenario of crisis management with limited resources [1] . Interpretation of these findings in comparison with first reports of pandemic influenza in European ICUs would help to better confront the current challenge [2] . Some intensivists are extrapolating influenza A (H1N1)pdm2009 data and applying it to COVID-19, but there is a huge difference between the coronavirus and influenza, with respect to the impact of their viral shedding. In influenza A (H1N1)pdm2009, death was not as frequent in the medical and nursing staff than in patients. In SARS and MERS this was the case, and it appears that hospital staff are also particularly vulnerable in COVID-19 [3] . It is likely that some ''sick'' coronavirus patients shed very large amounts of virus, whereas in influenza that is not necessarily the case. If a healthcare worker is exposed to a large initial inoculum of coronavirus, ARDS can develop rapidly."],"title":["Preparing for a Surge of Coronavirus Cases","Pandemic Influenza: Impact on

In Brazil, the first case was reported on February 26. As the number of cases grows in the country, there is a concern that the health system may become overwhelmed, resulting in shortages of hospital beds, intensive care unit beds, and mechanical ventilators. The timing of shortage is likely to vary geographically depending on the observed onset and pace of transmission observed, on the availability of resources, and on the actions implemented. Here we consider the daily number of cases reported in municipalities in Brazil to simulate twelve alternative scenarios of the likely timing of shortage, based on parameters consistently reported for China and Italy, on rates of hospital occupancy for other health conditions observed in Brazil in 2019, and on assumptions of allocation of patients in public and private facilities. Results show that hospital services could start to experien...","The COVID-19 pandemic is overwhelming healthcare systems worldwide. A significant portion of COVID-19 patients develop pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), necessitating ventilator support. Some health systems do not have the capacity to accommodate this surge in ventilator demand, leading to shortages and inevitable mortality. Some clinicians have, of necessity, jerry-rigged ventilators to support multiple patients, but these devices lack protected air streams or individualized controls for each patient. Moreover, some have not been tested under conditions of ARDS. We have developed the Individualized System for Augmenting Ventilator Efficacy (iSAVE), a rapidly deployable platform to more safely use a single ventilator to simultaneously support multiple critically-ill patients. The iSAVE enables patient-specific volume and pressure control and incorporates safety features to mitigate cross-contamination between patients and flow changes due to patient interdepende...","Background: The overall objective of this rapid review was to identify infection protection and control recommendations from published clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) for adults aged 60 years and older in long-term care settings Methods: Comprehensive searches in MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, and relevant CPG publishers/repositories were carried out in early March 2020. Title/abstract and full-text screening, data abstraction, and quality appraisal (AGREE-II) were carried out by single reviewers. Results: A total of 17 relevant CPGs were identified, published in the USA (n=8), Canada (n=6), Australia (n=2), and the United Kingdom (n=1). All of the CPGs dealt with infection control in long-term care facilities (LTCF) and addressed various types of viral respiratory infections (e.g., influenza, COVID-19, severe acute respiratory syndrome). Ten or more CPGs recommended the following infection control measures in LTCF: hand hygiene (n=13), wearing personal protective equipment...","Abstract Since December 2019, more than 79,000 people have been diagnosed with infection of the Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). A large number of medical staff was sent to Wuhan city and Hubei province to aid COVID-19 control. Psychological stress, especially vicarious traumatization caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, should not be ignored. To address this concern, the study employed a total of 214 general public and 526 nurses (i.e., 234 front-line nurses and 292 non-front-line nurses) to evaluate vicarious traumatization scores via a mobile app-based questionnaire. Front-line nurses are engaged in the process of providing care for patients with COVID-19. The results showed that the vicarious traumatization scores for front-line nurses including scores for physiological and psychological responses, were significantly lower than those of non-front-line nurses (P &lt; 0.001). Interestingly, the vicarious traumatization scores of the general public were significantly higher than those o...","The largest outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) struck Beijing in spring 2003. Multiple importations of SARS to Beijing initiated transmission in several healthcare facilities. Beijing\u2019s outbreak began March 5; by late April, daily hospital admissions for SARS exceeded 100 for several days; 2,521 cases of probable SARS occurred. Attack rates were highest in those 20\u201339 years of age; 1% of cases occurred in children &lt;10 years. The case-fatality rate was highest among patients &gt;65 years (27.7% vs. 4.8% for those 20\u201364 years, p &lt; 0.001). Healthcare workers accounted for 16% of probable cases. The proportion of case-patients without known contact to a SARS patient increased significantly in May. Implementation of early detection, isolation, contact tracing, quarantine, triage of case-patients to designated SARS hospitals, and community mobilization ended the outbreak.","Since December 2019, more than 79,000 people have been diagnosed with infection of the Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). A large number of medical staff were dispersed for Wuhan city and Hubei province to aid COVID-19 control. Psychological stress, especially vicarious traumatization (VT) caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, should not be ignored. To address this concern, the study employed a total of 214 general public (GP) and 526 nurses to evaluate VT scores via a mobile app-based questionnaire. Results showed that the VT scores slightly increased across periods of aiding COVID-19 control, although no statistical difference was noted (P = 0.083). However, the study found lower scores for VT in nurses [median = 69; interquartile range (IQR) = 56-85] than those of the GP (median = 75.5; IQR = 62-88.3) (P = 0.017). In addition, the VT scores for front-line nurses (FLNs; median = 64; IQR = 52-75), including scores for physiological and psychological responses, were significantly lower t...","Abstract Medicine shortages have been spreading in European countries. In many cases, the unavailability of medicinal products has a substantial impact on the capability of National Healthcare Systems in ensuring the continuity of care. Shortages originate from multifactorial causes. In particular, they can be due to supply-related factors (e.g., manufacturing issues, regulatory issues, logistics, distribution) and demand-related ones (e.g., fluctuating drug demand, parallel market, tendering, price and reimbursement policies). However, some extraordinary geopolitical events (e.g., Brexit) may also affect medicines\u2019 availability. The capability of European Regulatory Authorities and other stakeholders, which are involved in the pharmaceutical distribution chain and the healthcare assistance services, to define suitable problem-solving strategies has been limited for years by the fragmentation of the European regulatory framework, starting from the lack of a univocal definition of a med...","BACKGROUND: Strategies are urgently needed to mitigate the risk of zoonotic disease emergence in southern China, where pathogens with zoonotic potential are known to circulate in wild animal populations. However, the risk factors leading to emergence are poorly understood, which presents a challenge in developing appropriate mitigation strategies for local communities. METHODS: Residents in rural communities of Yunnan, Guangxi and Guangdong provinces were recruited and enrolled in this study. Data were collected through ethnographic interviews and field observations, and thematically coded and analysed to identify both risk and protective factors for zoonotic disease emergence at the individual, community and policy levels. RESULTS: Eighty-eight ethnographic interviews and 55 field observations were conducted at nine selected sites. Frequent human\u2013animal interactions and low levels of environmental biosecurity in local communities were identified as risks for zoonotic disease emergence...","BACKGROUND: The Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus is a serious and emerging issue in Saudi Arabia and the world. A response was required to reduce possible disease transmission between the hospital and university. College of Nursing academic staff developed a programme in response to the educational and emotional needs of participants. METHODS: A MERS-CoV Task Force responded to the rapidly unfolding epidemic. The aim was to find out what nursing staff and nursing students in the college knew about MERS- CoV. While most gaps in knowledge were addressed after an intense information seminar, other learning needs were identified and responded to. The Task Force developed mandatory information sessions for all nursing faculty, students and staff. All staff were informed by email, letters and posters. There are 28 faculty staff, 84 support staff and 480 students in the College of Nursing. The information settings all took place within the College of Nursing, Princess Nourah Un...","","In the wake of COVID-19 disease, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, we designed and developed a predictive model based on Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning algorithms to determine the health risk and predict the mortality risk of patients with COVID-19. In this study, we used documented data of 117,000 patients world-wide with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19. This study proposes an AI model to help hospitals and medical facilities decide who needs to get attention first, who has higher priority to be hospitalized, triage patients when the system is overwhelmed by overcrowding, and eliminate delays in providing the necessary care. The results demonstrate 93% overall accuracy in predicting the mortality rate. We used several machine learning algorithms including Support Vector Machine (SVM), Artificial Neural Networks, Random Forest, Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, and K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) to predict the mortality rate in patients with COVID-19. In this study, the most...","Backgrounds Since December 2019, a novel coronavirus epidemic has emerged in Wuhan city, China and then rapidly spread to other areas. As of 20 Feb 2020, a total of 2,055 medical staff confirmed with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by SARS-Cov-2 in China had been reported. We sought to explore the epidemiological, clinical characteristics and prognosis of novel coronavirus-infected medical staff. Methods In this retrospective study, 64 confirmed cases of novel coronavirus-infected medical staff admitted to Union Hospital, Wuhan between 16 Jan, 2020 to 15 Feb, 2020 were included. Two groups concerned were extracted from the subjects based on duration of symptoms: group 1 (&lt;= 10 days) and group 2 (&gt;10 days). Epidemiological and clinical data were analyzed and compared across groups. The Kaplan-Meier plot was used to inspect the change in hospital discharge rate. The Cox regression model was utilized to identify factors associated with hospital discharge. Findings The median ag...","Publisher Summary Natural killer (NK) cells comprise a finite lymphocyte lineage with distinctive gene expression patterns. Natural killer (NK) cells develop in the bone marrow (BM) and are not static but populate secondary and primary lymphoid organs. A unique feature of NK cells is their expression of activating and inhibitory receptors, which allow them to respond either when ligands for activating receptors are upregulated or when ligands for inhibitory receptors are downregulated. The unique transcriptome of NK cells renders them capable of protecting the host from a vast array of disease states. Their undisputed importance in host protection is conferred by their ability to eliminate unhealthy cells. However, in order for NK cells to exert their effects, they need to be strategically located at the right places. This chapter provides an overview of the current understanding of the localization of NK cell populations and their ability to migrate in response to homeostatic and path...","Resumen El 31 de diciembre de 2019, la Comisi\u00f3n de Salud de la provincia China de Hubei, dio a conocer por primera vez un grupo de casos inexplicables de neumon\u00eda, que posteriormente la OMS defini\u00f3 como el nuevo coronavirus de 2019 (SARS-CoV-2).

However, those outcomes have yet to be established using epidemiological data. To explore the mental health status of medical and nursing staff and the efficacy, or lack thereof, of critically connecting psychological needs to receiving psychological care, we conducted a quantitative study. This is the first paper on the mental health of medical and nursing staff in Wuhan. Notably, among 994 medical and nursing staff working in Wuhan, 36.9% had subthreshold mental health disturbances (mean PHQ-9: 2.4), 34.4% had mild disturbances (mean PHQ-9: 5.4), 22.4% had moderate disturbances (mean PHQ-9: 9.0), and 6.2% had severe disturbance (mean PHQ-9: 15.1) in the immediate wake of the viral epidemic. The noted burden fell particularly heavily on young women. Of all particip...","","Background Recent surge of olfactory dysfunction in patients who were referred to ENT clinics and concurrent COVID-19epidemic in Iran motivated us to evaluate anosmic/hyposmic patients to find any relation between these two events. Methods This is a cross-sectional study with an online checklist on voluntary cases in all provinces of Iran between the 12th and 17th March, 2020. Cases was defined as self-reported anosmia/hyposmia in responders fewer than 4 weeks later (from start the of COVID-19 epidemic in Iran). Variables consist of clinical presentations, related past medical history, family history of recent respiratory tract infection and hospitalization. Results In this study 10069 participants aged 32.5 +/- 8.6 (7-78) years, 71.13% female and 81.68% non-smoker completed online checklist. They reported 10.55% a history of a trip out of home town and 1.1% hospitalization due to respiratory problems recently. From family members 12.17% had a history of severe respiratory disease in r...","Abstract On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the novel coronavirus COVID-19 a pandemic. There are patients in psychiatric hospitals in China who have been infected with COVID-19, however, the knowledge and attitudes of psychiatric hospital staff towards infectious diseases and their willingness to work during the COVID-19 outbreak has not yet been investigated. This study was performed to assess the knowledge and attitudes of medical staff in two Chinese mental health centers during the COVID-19 outbreak. We included 141 psychiatrists and 170 psychiatric nurses in the study. We found that during the COVID-19 epidemic, 89.51% of the medical staff of the psychiatric hospitals studied had extensive knowledge of COVID-19, and 64.63% of them received the relevant training in hospitals. Furthermore, about 77.17% of participants expressed a willingness to care for psychiatric patients suffering from COVID-19 virus infection. Independent predictors of willingness to...","Abstract The World Health Organisation has declared a pandemic caused by the newly discovered SARS-CoV-2. Due to growing demand for reagents used for SARS-CoV-2 RNA extraction for subsequent molecular diagnostics, there is a worldwide risk of kit- and/or reagent-shortages for extraction. With a detection sensitivity of 97.4% (95% CI=86.2-99.9%), we describe a simple, fast, alternative workflow for molecular detection of SARS-CoV-2, where samples are simply heat-processed for 5 minutes at 98\u00b0C prior to the RT-qPCR reaction.","The coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has infected more than 600,000 people and has overwhelmed hospital systems around the world. However, the factors mediating fatal SARS-CoV-2 infections are poorly understood. Here, we show that cigarette smoke causes a dose-dependent upregulation of Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2), the SARS-CoV-2 receptor, in rodent and human lungs. Using single-cell sequencing data, we demonstrate that ACE2 is expressed in a subset of epithelial cells that line the respiratory tract, including goblet cells, club cells, and alveolar type 2 cells. Chronic smoke exposure triggers a protective expansion of mucus-secreting goblet cells and a concomitant increase in ACE2 expression. In contrast, quitting smoking causes a decrease in lung ACE2 levels. Taken together, these results may partially explain why smokers are particularly likely to develop severe SARS-CoV-2 infections, and they suggest that quitting smoking could lessen coronavirus susceptibility.","BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), formerly known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), was first identified in December 2019 in Wuhan City, China. Structural equation modeling (SEM) is a multivariate analysis method to determine the structural relationship between measured variables. This observational study aimed to use SEM to determine the effects of social support on sleep quality and function of medical staff who treated patients with COVID-19 in January and February 2020 in Wuhan, China. MATERIAL/METHODS: A one-month cross-sectional observational study included 180 medical staff who treated patients with COVID-19 infection. Levels of anxiety, self-efficacy, stress, sleep quality, and social support were measured using the and the Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS), the General Self-Efficacy Scale (GSES), the Stanford Acute Stress Reaction (SASR) questionnaire, the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), a...","Abstract Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a newly emerging infectious disease caused by a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV), which has overwhelmed more than 30 countries claiming nearly 8400 cases with over 800 fatalities. Thanks to the unprecedented international collaboration, the whole-genomes of SARS-CoVs were successfully deciphered shortly after the identification of the causative pathogen for outbreak of SARS in southern China, in 2003. Hitherto, the SARS-CoV, as a viral paradigm of emerging infectious entities, has been extensively studied that has ranged from epidemiology, molecular virology/immunology to structural genomics. Also, several lines of breakthroughs have been record-brokenly obtained, that included the finding of ACE2, a functional receptor for the SARS-CoV, solution of the 3CLpro structure, a first crystal structure of SARS-related macromolecules, revealing of bats as natural reservoirs for SARS-like viruses and the possible involvement of civet cats in the...","European healthcare systems face rapidly increasing pressure from COVID-19. We calculated pressures on EU healthcare systems by relating both country-specific accumulated COVID-19 deaths (intensity-approach) and active COVID-19 cases (magnitude-approach) to various estimates of hospital beds. On March 14 2020 - relative to Italy on March 11- we found Spain, Luxembourg, Switzerland and France to experience the highest pressure using the intensity-approach, versus Iceland, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Spain, Switzerland and Slovenia using the magnitude approach.","Abstract Reprocessing of used N95 respirators may ameliorate supply chain constraints during the COVID-19 pandemic and provide a higher filtration crisis alternative. The FDA Medical Countermeasures Initiative previously funded a study of HP vapor decontamination of respirators using a Clarus C system (Bioquell, Horsham, PA) which normally is used to fumigate hospital rooms. The process preserved respirator function, but it is unknown if HP vapor would be virucidal since respirators have porous fabric that may harbor virus. We evaluated the virucidal activity of HP vapor using a BQ-50 system (Bioquell, Horsham, PA) after inoculating 3M 1870 N95 respirators (3M, St. Paul, MN) with 3 aerosolized bacteriophage that are a reasonable proxy for SARS-CoV-2. Inoculation resulted in contamination of the respirator with 9.87e4 plaque forming units (PFU) of phage phi-6, 4.17e7 PFU of phage T7 and 1.35e7 PFU of phage T1. Respirators were reprocessed with BQ-50 with a long aeration phase to reduce ...","The cumulative incidence of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) cases is showing similar trends in European Union/European Economic Area countries and the United Kingdom confirming that, while at a different stage depending on the country, the COVID-19 pandemic is progressing rapidly in all countries. Based on the experience from Italy, countries, hospitals and intensive care units should increase their preparedness for a surge of patients with COVID-19 who will require healthcare, and in particular intensive care.","Abstract Based on its forensic capacity and experience gained worldwide from the management of the dead in emergencies, including epidemics, the International Committee of the Red Cross have been asked by the authorities and other relevant stakeholders to advise on the management of the dead from COVID-19 infection, for which it has prepared the following guidance. This includes advice on the handling of COVID-19 fatalities and a set of considerations for managers faced with the need to plan for adequately responding to a possible surge in fatalities caused by COVID-19.","Abstract Background The novel coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19), which was first detected in Wuhan City, has now became a pandemic that affecting patients around the world.

Though diagnostic tests are fundamental to the ability to detect and respond, many health systems are already experiencing shortages of reagents associated with this test. Here, testing a pooling approach for the standard RT-qPCR test, we find that a single positive sample can be detected even in pools of up to 32 samples, with an estimated false negative rate of 10%. Detection of positive samples diluted in even up to 64 samples may also be attainable, though may require additional amplification cycles. As it uses the standard protocols, reagents and equipment, this pooling method can be applied immediately in current clinical testing laboratories. We hope that such implementation of a pool test for COVID-19 would allow expanding current screening capacities thereby enabling the expansion of detection in the community, as well as in close integral groups, such as hospital departments, army units, or...","Given the scale of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the need for reliable, scalable testing, and the likelihood of reagent shortages, especially in resource-poor settings, we have developed a RT-qPCR assay that relies on an alternative to conventional viral reverse transcriptases, a thermostable reverse transcriptase / DNA polymerase (RTX)1. Here we show that RTX performs comparably to the other assays sanctioned by the CDC and validated in kit format. We demonstrate two modes of RTX use - (i) dye-based RT-qPCR assays that require only RTX polymerase, and (ii) TaqMan RT-qPCR assays that use a combination of RTX and Taq DNA polymerases (as the RTX exonuclease does not degrade a TaqMan probe). We also provide straightforward recipes for the purification of this alternative reagent. We anticipate that in low resource or point-of-need settings researchers could obtain the available constructs from Addgene or our lab and begin to develop their own assays, within whatever regulatory framework ...","Abstract The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) was first diagnosed in Wuhan, China in December 2019 and has now spread throughout the world, being verified by the World Health Organization as a Pandemic on March 11th. This had led to the calling of a national emergency on March 13th in the United States. Many hospitals, healthcare networks, and specifically Departments of Surgery are asking the same questions of how to cope and plan for surge capacity, personnel attrition, novel infrastructure utilization, and resource exhaustion. Herein, we present a tiered plan for surgical department planning based on incident command levels. This includes Acute Care Surgeon deployment (given their critical care training and vertically integrated position in the hospital), recommended infrastructure and transfer utilization, triage principles, and faculty, resident and advanced care practitioner deployment.","Summary This is an informal review of some of the trends in the infection prevention and control literature since the last Healthcare Infection Society (HIS) conference in late 2012. Google Trends was used to investigate how the volume of interest in various infection control topics had changed over time. Ebola trumped all the others in Google searches, reflecting a surge of publications in the literature. Aside from Ebola, other trends in the infection prevention and control literature covered in this article include Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) coronavirus, universal versus targeted interventions, faecal microbiota transplantation, whole genome sequencing, carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae, and some aspects of environmental science. The review ends with an attempt to predict some of the trends in the infection prevention and control literature between now and the next HIS conference in 2016.","Background: During the first week of March, the surge of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases reached over 100 countries with more than 100,000 cases. Healthcare authorities have already initiated awareness and preparedness activities beyond borders. A poor understanding of the disease among healthcare workers (HCWs) may result in delayed treatment and the rapid spread of infection. This study aimed to investigate the knowledge and perceptions of HCWs about COVID-19. Methods: A cross-sectional, web-based study was conducted among HCWs about COVID-19 during the first week of March 2020. A 23-item survey instrument was developed and distributed randomly to HCWs using social media; it required 5 minutes to complete. A chi-square test was used to investigate the level of association among variables at the significance level of p&lt;0.05. Results: Of 529 participants, a total of 453 HCWs completed the survey (response rate: 85.6%); 51.6% were males, 32.1% were aged 25-34 years, and most w...","Background: Since the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) disease (COVID-19) outbreaks in Wuhan, China, healthcare systems capacities in highly endemic areas have been overwhelmed. Approaches to efficient management are urgently needed and key to a quicker control of the outbreaks and casualties. We aimed to characterize the clinical features of hospitalized patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19, and develop a mortality risk index for COVID-19 patients. Methods: In this retrospective one-centre cohort study, we included all the confirmed or suspected COVID-19 patients hospitalized in a COVID-19-designated hospital from January 21 to February 5, 2020. Demographic, clinical, laboratory, radiological and clinical outcome data were collected from the hospital information system, nursing records and laboratory reports. Results: Of 577 patients with at least one post-admission evaluation, the median age was 55 years (interquartile range [IQR], 39 - 66); 254 (...","The Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) was first described in 2012 and, subsequently, many cases were reported with a lower case fatality rate than initial cases. Humans can become infected within their communities and transmission can then be amplified in the healthcare setting. Contact investigation among cases shows a variable amount of spread among family members and healthcare workers. So far, circulating virus strains remain similar under continuous monitoring, with no genetic changes. Here, we discuss the transmission pattern, phylogenetic evolution, and pathogenesis of MERS-CoV infection.","The COVID-19 pandemic has led to unprecedented strain on intensive care unit (ICU) admission in parts of the world. Strategies to create surge ICU capacity requires complex local and national service reconfiguration and reduction or cancellation of elective activity. Theses measures require time to implement and have an inevitable lag before additional capacity comes on-line. An accurate short-range forecast would be helpful in guiding such difficult, costly and ethically challenging decisions. At the time this work began, cases in England were starting to increase. Here we present an attempt at an agile short-range forecast based on published real-time COVID-19 case data from the seven National Health Service commissioning regions in England (East of England, London, Midlands, North East and Yorkshire, North West, South East and South West). We use a Monte Carlo approach to model the likely impact of current diagnoses on regional ICU capacity over a 14 day horizon. Our model is design...","Abstract During the first few months of 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic has reached Europe. Health systems all over the world are trying to control the outbreak in the shortest possible time. Exotic disease outbreaks are not uncommon in animal health and randomised surveillance is frequently used as support for decision-making. This editorial discusses the possibilities of practicing One Health, by using methods from animal health to enhance surveillance for COVID-19 to provide an evidence base fort decision-making in communities and countries.","OBJECTIVES: To determine paediatric emergency department (ED) staff perceptions of the effectiveness and practice of infection control measures against a novel virulent pathogen. METHODS: All medical staff of the paediatric ED in a tertiary medical centre completed a written questionnaire near the onset of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak. Level of concern regarding SARS, and perceptions of effectiveness and use of infection control measures were assessed on a 5 point scale. Statistical analysis was performed using \u03c7(2) test and one way analysis of variance with significance at p&lt;0.05. RESULTS: Response rate was 97% (116/120). All scores were given out of 5 possible points. Using isolation rooms (mean score 4.6), wearing a mask when examining patients (4.5), and handwashing (4.5) were considered most effective. Staff physicians reported handwashing more than nurses and trainees (4.9 v 4.5 and 4.5, respectively; p&lt;0.05) while other measures were reported equally. Re...","Abstract Due to the pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 in China, almost all avoidable activities in China are prohibited since Wuhan announced lockdown on January 23, 2020. With reduced activities, severe air pollution events still occurred in the North China Plain, causing discussions regarding why severe air pollution was not avoided. The Community Multi-scale Air Quality model was applied during January 01 to February 12, 2020 to study PM2.5 changes under emission reduction scenarios. The estimated emission reduction case (Case 3) better reproduced PM2.5. Compared with the case without emission change (Case 1), Case 3 predicted that PM2.5 concentrations decreased by up to 20% with absolute decreases of 5.35, 6.37, 9.23, 10.25, 10.30, 12.14, 12.75, 14.41, 18.00 and 30.79 \u03bcg/m3 in Guangzhou, Shanghai, Beijing, Shijiazhuang, Tianjin, Jinan, Taiyuan, Xi'an, Zhengzhou, Wuhan, respectively. In high-pollution days with PM2.5 greater than 75 \u03bcg/m3, the reductions of PM2.5 in Case 3 were 7...","Background: We evaluated how non-pharmaceutical interventions could be used to control the COVID-19 pandemic and reduce the burden on the healthcare system. Methods: Using an age-structured compartmental model of COVID-19 transmission in the population of Ontario, Canada, we compared a base case with limited testing, isolation, and quarantine to scenarios with: enhanced case finding; restrictive social distancing measures; or a combination of enhanced case finding and less restrictive social distancing. Interventions were either implemented for fixed durations or dynamically cycled on and off, based on projected ICU bed occupancy. We present median and credible intervals (CrI) from 100 replicates per scenario using a two-year time horizon. Results: We estimated that 56% (95% CrI: 42-63%) of the Ontario population would be infected over the course of the epidemic in the base case. At the epidemic peak, we projected 107,000 (95% CrI: 60,760-149,000) cases in hospital and 55,500 (95% CrI:...","Summary The severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemics in 2002\u20132003 showed how quickly a novel infectious disease can spread both within communities and internationally. We have reviewed the epidemiological and genetic analyses that have been published both during and since these epidemics, and show how quickly data were collected and analyses undertaken. Key factors that determine the speed and scale of transmission of an infectious disease were estimated using statistical and mathematical modelling approaches, and phylogenetic analyses provided insights into the origin and evolution of the SARS-associated coronavirus. The SARS literature continues to grow, and it is hoped that international collaboration in the analysis of epidemiological and contact-network databases will provide further insights into the spread of this newly emergent infectious disease.","Since December 2019, 62 medical staff of Zhongnan Hospital in Wuhan, China have been hospitalised with coronavirus disease 2019. During the post-discharge surveillance after clinical recovery, swabs were positive in two asymptomatic cases (3.23%). Case 1 had presented typical clinical and radiological manifestations on admission, while manifestation in Case 2 was very mild. In conclusion, a small proportion of recovered patients may test positive after discharge, and post-discharge surveillance and isolation need to be strengthened.","Europe is now considered as the epicenter of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, France being among the most impacted country. In France, there is an increasing concern regarding the capacity of the healthcare system to sustain the outbreak, especially regarding intensive care units (ICU). The aim of this study was to estimate the dynamics of the epidemic in France, and to assess its impact on healthcare resources for each French metropolitan Region. We developed a deterministic, age-structured, Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Removed (SEIR) model based on catchment areas of each COVID-19 referral hospitals. We performed one month ahead predictions (up to April 14, 2020) for three different scenarios (R0=1.5, R0=2.25, R0=3), where we estimated the daily number of COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations and deaths, the needs in ICU beds per Region and the reaching date of ICU capacity limits. At the national level, the total number of infected cases is expected to range from 22,872 in the best case (R0=1....","Background: The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has placed unprecedented challenges on hospital environmental hygiene and medical staff protection. It is crucial to assess hospital environmental hygiene to understand the most important environmental issues for controlling the spread of COVID-19 in hospitals. Objective: To detect the presence of COVID-19 in the samples from the area at risk of contamination in the First Hospital of Jilin University. Methods: Viruses in the air were collected by natural sedimentation and air particle sampler methods. Predetermined environmental surfaces were sampled using swabs at seven o'clock in the morning before disinfection. The real-time reverse-transcription PCR method was used to detect the existence of COVID-19 pathogens. Results: Viruses could be detected on the surfaces of the nurse station in the isolation area with suspected patients and in the air of the isolation ward with an intensive care patient. Conclusion: Comprehensiv...","What has happened in China shows that quarantine, social distancing, and isolation of infected populations can contain the epidemic.1 This impact of the COVID-19 response in China is encouraging for the many countries where COVID-19 is beginning to spread. However, it is unclear whether other countries can implement the stringent measures China eventually adopted. Singapore and Hong Kong, both of which had severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemics in 2002\u201303, provide hope and many lessons to other countries. In both places, COVID-19 has been managed well to date, despite early cases, by early government action and through social distancing measures taken by individuals. The course of an epidemic is defined by a series of key factors, some of which are poorly understood at present for COVID-19. The basic reproduction number (R0), which defines the mean number of secondary cases generated by one primary case when the population is largely susceptible to infection, determines the...","","Summary Background The recent outbreak of the novel coronavirus in December 2019 (COVID-19) has activated top-level response nationwide. We developed a new treatment model based on the online-to-offline (O2O) model for the home isolated patients, because in the early stages the medical staff were insufficient to cope with so many patients. Methods In this single-centered, retrospective study, we enrolled 48 confirmed/suspected COVID-19 patients who underwent home isolation in Wuhan between January 6 and January 31, 2020. By WeChat and online document editing all patients were treated with medical observation scale. The clinical indications such as Fever, Muscle soreness, Dyspnea and Lack of strength were collected with this system led by medical staff in management, medicine, nursing, rehabilitation and psychology. Findings The mean(SD) age of 48 patients was 39.08(13.88) years, 35(72.9%) were women. Compared with non-hospitalized patients, inpatients were older(\u22658805;70years, 2.4% vs ...","Dromedary, or one-humped, camels Camelus dromedarius are an almost exclusively domesticated species that are common in arid areas as both beasts of burden and production animals for meat and milk. Currently, there are approximately 30 million dromedary camels, with highest numbers in Africa and the Middle East. The hardiness of camels in arid regions has made humans more dependent on them, especially as a stable protein source. Camels also carry and may transmit disease-causing agents to humans and other animals. The ability for camels to act as a point source or vector for disease is a concern due to increasing human demands for meat, lack of biosafety and biosecurity protocols in many regions, and a growth in the interface with wildlife as camel herds become sympatric with non-domestic species. We conducted a literature review of camel-borne zoonotic diseases and found that the majority of publications (65%) focused on Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), brucellosis, Echinococcu...","Abstract Background Since the first case of a novel coronavirus (COVID-19) infection pneumonia was detected in Wuhan, China, a series of confirmed cases of the COVID-19 were found in Beijing. We analyzed the data of 262 confirmed cases to determine the clinical and epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 in Beijing. Methods We collected patients who were transferred by Beijing Emergency Medical Service to the designated hospitals. The information on demographic, epidemiological, clinical, laboratory test for the COVID-19 virus, diagnostic classification, cluster case and outcome were obtained. Furthermore we compared the characteristics between severe and common confirmed cases which including mild cases, no-pneumonia cases and asymptomatic cases, and we also compared the features between COVID-19 and 2003 SARS. Findings By Feb 10, 2020, 262 patients were transferred from the hospitals across Beijing to the designated hospitals for special treatment of the COVID-19 infected by Beij...","Ten years have elapsed since the World Health Organization issued its first global alert for an unexplained illness named severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). The anniversary provides an opportunity to reflect on the international response to this new global microbial threat. While global surveillance and response capacity for public health threats have been strengthened, critical gaps remain. Of 194 World Health Organization member states that signed on to the International Health Regulations (2005), &lt;20% had achieved compliance with the core capacities required by the deadline in June 2012. Lessons learned from the global SARS outbreak highlight the need to avoid complacency, strengthen efforts to improve global capacity to address the next pandemic using all available 21st century tools, and support research to develop new treatment options, countermeasures, and insights while striving to address the global inequities that are the root cause of many of these challenges.","Abstract Health planning and policy seek to create a group of mutually interacting bodies to produce goods and services to meet the health needs of a population. Recent developments in the health status of the population are characterized by continuous improvement in life expectancy, chronic diseases which absorb 90% of total health care expenditure, differences in the causes of mortality (more than 70% mortality from cancer, heart and brain, and external causes). The new trends in health indicators define the current health policies and lead to the necessity of adapting the health system so as to meet the changing health needs of the population. Especially in the context of the changes in the epidemiological spectrum and the variability in the indices of morbidity and mortality, the focus is not only to further prolong life expectancy but also to improve life expectancy without chronic diseases and without disabilities and to reduce the avoidable mortality, the potential years of life..."],"title":["Demand for hospitalization services for COVID-19 patients in Brazil","Individualized System for Augmenting Ventilator Efficacy (iSAVE): A Rapidly deployable system to expand ventilator capacity","Guidelines for preventing respiratory illness in older adults aged 60 years and above living in long-term care: A rapid review of clinical practice guidelines","Vicarious traumatization in the general public, members, and non-members of medical teams aiding in COVID-19 control","Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, Beijing, 2003","Vicarious traumatization in the general public, members, and non-members of medical teams aiding in COVID-19 control","New regulatory strategies to manage medicines shortages in Europe","A qualitative study of zoonotic risk factors among rural communities in southern China","An educational programme for nursing college staff and students during a MERS- coronavirus outbreak in Saudi Arabia","The impending storm: COVID-19, pandemics and our overwhelmed emergency departments","Predicting Mortality Risk in Patients with COVID-19 Using Artificial Intelligence to Help Medical Decision-Making","Epidemiological, Clinical Characteristics and Outcome of Medical Staff Infected with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China: A Retrospective Case Series Analysis","Chapter Ten The localization and migration of natural killer cells in health and disease","Cuidados intensivos durante la epidemia de coronavirus 2019","Impact on Mental Health and Perceptions of Psychological Care among Medical and Nursing Staff in Wuhan during the 2019 Novel Coronavirus Disease Outbreak: a Cross-sectional Study","Preparing for a Surge of Coronavirus Cases","Coincidence of COVID-19 epidemic and olfactory dysfunction outbreak","Knowledge and attitudes of medical staff in Chinese psychiatric hospitals regarding COVID-19","An alternative workflow for molecular detection of SARS-CoV-2 - escape from the NA extraction kit-shortage","Cigarette smoke triggers the expansion of a subpopulation of respiratory epithelial cells that express the SARS-CoV-2 receptor ACE2","The Effects of Social Support on Sleep Quality of Medical Staff Treating Patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in January and February 2020 in China","Towards our understanding of SARS-CoV, an emerging and devastating but quickly conquered virus","Indications for healthcare surge capacity in European countries facing an exponential increase in COVID19 cases","Hydrogen Peroxide Vapor sterilization of N95 respirators for reuse","Rapidly increasing cumulative incidence of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in the European Union/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom, 1 January to 15 March 2020","International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC): General Guidance for the Management of the Dead Related to COVID-19","Recommendations and guidance for providing pharmaceutical care services during COVID-19 pandemic: A China perspective","Evaluation of COVID-19 RT-qPCR test in multi-sample pools","A one-enzyme RT-qPCR assay for SARS-CoV-2, and procedures for reagent production","Maximizing the Calm Before the Storm: Tiered Surgical Response Plan for Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19)","What's trending in the infection prevention and control literature?
