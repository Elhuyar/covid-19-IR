The demand for rapid and accurate diagnosis of this novel pathogen brought significant clinical and technological challenges. Currently, metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) and reverse-transcription PCR (RT-PCR) are the most widely used molecular diagnostics. Methods: 2019-nCoV infections were confirmed in 52 specimens by mNGS. Genomic information was analyzed and used for the design and development of an isothermal, CRISPR-based diagnostic for this novel virus. The diagnostic performance of CRISPR-nCoV was assessed and compared across three technology platforms (mNGS, RT-PCR and CRISPR). Results: 2019-nCoVs sequenced in our study were conserved with the Wuhan strain, and shared certain genetic similarity with SARS-CoV. A high degree of variation in the level of viral RNA was observed in clinical specimens. CRISPR-nCoV demonst...","Global gene expression analysis is beginning to move from the laboratories of basic investigators to large-scale clinical trials. The potential of this technology to improve diagnosis and tailored treatment of human disease may soon be realised, now that several comprehensive studies have demonstrated the utility of gene expression profiles for the classification of tumours into distinct, clinically relevant subtypes and the prediction of clinical outcomes. In addition, new data from the emerging proteomics platforms add another layer of molecular information to the study of human disease, as scientists attempt to catalogue a complete inventory of the proteins encoded by the genome and to establish a 'biosignature' profile of human health and disease. As a result, it is anticipated that, together, these technologies will facilitate the comprehensive study of genes, gene products and signalling pathways so that the objective of personalised molecular medicine can be achieved. This paper...","Abstract There are many diseases for which a microbial aetiology is suspected. The hypothesis that a disease has an infectious cause is supported by: clinical features (similar to those of known infectious diseases, e.g. fever, leucocytosis), epidemiology (case clustering in time or location), histology (inflammation of affected tissues, e.g. granulomata) or characteristic microbial structures, treatment (clinical response to antimicrobial treatment), and prevention of disease by vaccines targeting microbial antigens. Proof that a microbe causes a disease requires more rigorous evidence. Future attempts to identify novel microbes associated with human disease may use sequence-based approaches. High-throughput sequencing may allow identification of unique microbial nucleic acid sequences in a background of host DNA. The complete sequencing of the human genome and multiple microbial genomes make this approach more feasible. DNA microarrays are also likely to be used in the search for nov...","The novel coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19)epidemic has brought serious social psychological impact to the Chinese people, especially those quarantined and thus with limited access to face-to-face communication and traditional social psychological interventions. To better deal with the urgent psychological problems of people involved in the COVID-19 epidemic, we developed a new psychological crisis intervention model by utilizing internet technology. This new model, one of West China Hospital, integrates physicians, psychiatrists, psychologists and social workers into Internet platforms to carry out psychological intervention to patients, their families and medical staff. We hope this model will make a sound basis for developing a more comprehensive psychological crisis intervention response system that is applicable for urgent social and psychological problems.","Our understanding of human disease and potential therapeutics is improving rapidly. In order to take advantage of these developments it is important to be able to identify disease markers. Many new high-throughput genomics and proteomics technologies are being implemented to identify candidate disease markers. These technologies include protein microarrays, next-generation DNA sequencing and mass spectrometry platforms. Such methods are particularly important for elucidating the repertoire of molecular markers in the genome, transcriptome, proteome and metabolome of patients with diseases such as cancer, autoimmune diseases, and viral infections, resulting from the disruption of many biological pathways. These new technologies have identified many potential disease markers. These markers are expected to be valuable to achieve the promise of truly personalized medicine.","Abstract The goal of syndromic surveillance is the earlier detection of epidemics, allowing a timelier public health response than is possible using traditional surveillance methods. Syndromic surveillance application for public health purposes has changed over time and reflects a dynamic evolution from the collection, interpretation of data with dissemination of data to those who need to act, to a more holistic approach that incorporates response as a core component of the surveillance system. Recent infectious disease threats, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), avian influenza (H5N1) and pandemic influenza (H1N1), have all highlighted the need for countries to be rapidly aware of the spread of infectious diseases within a region and across the globe. The International Health Regulations (IHR) obligation to report public health emergencies of international concern has raised the importance of early outbreak detection and response. The emphasis in syndromic surveillance ...","A recent outbreak of novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of COVID-19, has spread rapidly all over the world. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is another deadly virus and causes acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Rapid and early detection of these viruses will facilitate early intervention and reduce disease transmission risk. Here, we present an All-In-One Dual CRISPR-Cas12a (termed \"AIOD-CRISPR\") assay method for simple, rapid, ultrasensitive, one-pot, and visual detection of coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 and HIV virus. In our AIOD CRISPR assay, a pair of crRNAs was introduced to initiate dual CRISPR-Cas12a detection and improve detection sensitivity. The AIOD-CRISPR assay system was successfully utilized to detect nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) of SARS-CoV-2 and HIV with a sensitivity of few copies. Also, it was evaluated by detecting HIV-1 RNA extracted from human plasma samples, achieving a comparable sensitivity with real-time RT-PCR method. Thus, our method has a ...","Summary Emerging infectious diseases arising from livestock and wildlife pose serious threats to global human health, as shown by a series of continuous outbreaks involving highly pathogenic influenza, SARS, Ebola and MERS. The risk of pandemics and bioterrorism threats is ever present and growing, but our ability to combat them is limited by the lack of available vaccines, therapeutics and rapid diagnostics. The use of high bio-containment facilities, such as the CSIRO Australian Animal Health Laboratory, plays a key role studying these dangerous pathogens and facilitates the development of countermeasures. To combat diseases like MERS, we must take a holistic approach that involves the development of early biomarkers of infection, a suite of treatment options (vaccines, anti-viral drugs and antibody therapeutics) and appropriate animal models to test the safety and efficacy of candidate treatments.","[Image: see text] Infectious diseases are a leading cause of mortality worldwide, with viruses and bacteria in particular having enormous impacts on global healthcare. One major challenge in combatting such diseases is a lack of effective drugs or specific treatments. In addition, drug resistance to currently available therapeutics and adverse effects caused by long-term overuse are both serious public health issues. A promising treatment strategy is to employ cell-membrane mimics as decoys to trap and to detain the pathogens. In this Perspective, we briefly review the infection mechanisms adopted by different pathogens at the cellular membrane interface and highlight the applications of cell-membrane-mimicking nanodecoys for systemic protection against infectious diseases. We also discuss the implication of nanodecoy\u2013pathogen complexes in the development of vaccines. We anticipate this Perspective will provide new insights on design and development of advanced materials against emergi...","The increasing burden of emerging infectious diseases worldwide confronts us with numerous challenges, including the imperative to design research and responses that are commensurate to understanding the complex social and ecological contexts in which infectious diseases occur. A diverse group of scientists met in Hawaii in March 2005 to discuss the linked social and ecological contexts in which infectious diseases emerge. A subset of the meeting was a group that focused on \u201ctransdisciplinary approaches\u201d to integrating knowledge across and beyond academic disciplines in order to improve prevention and control of emerging infections. This article is based on the discussions of that group. Here, we outline the epidemiological legacy that has dominated infectious disease research and control up until now, and introduce the role of new, transdisciplinary and systems-based approaches to emerging infectious diseases. We describe four cases of transboundary health issues and use them to discu...","The recent Ebola and Zika epidemics demonstrate the need for the continuous surveillance, rapid diagnosis and real-time tracking of emerging infectious diseases. Fast, affordable sequencing of pathogen genomes \u2014 now a staple of the public health microbiology laboratory in well-resourced settings \u2014 can affect each of these areas. Coupling genomic diagnostics and epidemiology to innovative digital disease detection platforms raises the possibility of an open, global, digital pathogen surveillance system. When informed by a One Health approach, in which human, animal and environmental health are considered together, such a genomics-based system has profound potential to improve public health in settings lacking robust laboratory capacity. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The online version of this article (doi:10.1038/nrg.2017.88) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.","COVID-19 has spread with unequal efficiency in various parts of the world. In several European countries including Italy, the increase in the number of COVID-19 cases has followed a consistent, exponential pattern of spread. However, some countries, notably Taiwan and Hong Kong, have achieved a different outcome and have managed to bring the COVID-19 outbreak in their countries rapidly under control, without entering the exponential pattern and with very few cases. They have used several different approaches to COVID-19 outbreak control, including the innovative use of smartphone technology and the widespread use of surgical face masks. We show through our models, that Canada has followed the same, consistent COVID-19 exponential growth pattern that is seen in Italy. Both nationally and in its most heavily affected provinces, there is exponential growth of COVID-19 cases, making it possible to make predictions for the future, if no further interventions are made in public health policy...","N4-hydroxycytidine (NHC) has been recently reported to have promising antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2. To join worldwide efforts in identifying potential drug targets against this pandemic, the target landscape of NHC was defined by extracting all known targets of its chemical neighborhood, including drugs, analogues, and metabolites, and by performing target predictions from two independent platforms, following the recent Public Health Assessment via Structural Evaluation (PHASE) protocol. The analysis provides a list of over 30 protein targets that could be useful in future design activities of new COVID-19 antivirals. The relevance for existing drugs within the same chemical space, such as remdesivir, is also discussed.","Abstract The Internet of Things (IoT) includes three core procedures: full spectrum perception, reliable transmission, and intelligent processing. It can be applied for the prevention and control of SARI (severe acute respiratory infection). By combining sensors, information technology, artificial intelligence, and available dynamic networking devices, IoT could realize long-distance communication between hospitals, patients, and medical devices, which could ultimately improve current medical conditions.","Abstract To overcome the limitations of the state-of-the-art influenza surveillance systems in Europe, we established in 2008 a European-wide consortium aimed at introducing an innovative information and communication technology approach for a web-based surveillance system across different European countries, called Influenzanet. The system, based on earlier efforts in The Netherlands and Portugal, works with the participation of the population in each country to collect real-time information on the distribution of influenza-like illness cases through web surveys administered to volunteers reporting their symptoms (or lack of symptoms) every week during the influenza season. Such a large European-wide web-based monitoring infrastructure is intended to rapidly identify public health emergencies, contribute to understanding global trends, inform data-driven forecast models to assess the impact on the population, optimize the allocation of resources, and help in devising mitigation and co...","Objectives: To examine heterogeneity of outcomes in protocols of clinical trials of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) and to identify outcomes for prioritization in developing a core outcome set (COS) in this field. Design: This study is a review. Data sources: Databases of ICMJE-accepted clinical trial registry platform were searched on February 14, 2020. Eligibility Criteria: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and non-RCTs of COVID-19 were considered.Conditions of patients include common type, severe type or critical type. Interventions include traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) and Western medicine. We excluded trials that for discharged patients, psychological intervention and complications of COVID-19. Data extraction and synthesis: The general information and outcomes, outcome measurement instruments and measurement times were extracted. The results were analysed by descriptive analysis. Results: 19 registry platforms were searched. A total of 97 protocols were included from 1...","Abstract On the Internet, there is a lot of open access information related to infectious diseases, e.g., official announcement, media news, bulletin boards, blogs, and other social media. If proper data retrieval and screening methods were applied on these Internet-based data, it would be very useful to improve the timeliness of early detection for infectious diseases. In China, we practice early warning using Internet-based data with routine intelligence screening assessment every day, and respond to any unusual event in a timely manner. Through this mechanism, the surveillance and early warning of Internet-based data for infectious disease and public health emergency plays an important supplemental role to the traditional surveillance systems.","Hospital-acquired infections (HAIs) are serious problems for healthcare systems, especially in developing countries where public health infrastructure and technology for infection preventions remain undeveloped. Here, we characterized how strategy and technology could be mobilized to improve the effectiveness of infection prevention and control in hospitals during the outbreaks of Ebola, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in Asia and West Africa. Published literature on the hospital-borne outbreaks of SARS, Ebola, and MERS in Asia and West Africa was comprehensively reviewed. The results showed that healthcare systems and hospital management in affected healthcare facilities had poor strategies and inadequate technologies and human resources for the prevention and control of HAIs, which led to increased morbidity, mortality, and unnecessary costs. We recommend that governments worldwide enforce disaster risk management, even when no ou...","The worldwide epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003 was caused by a novel coronavirus called SARS-CoV. Coronaviruses and their closest relatives possess extremely large plus-strand RNA genomes and employ unique mechanisms and enzymes in RNA synthesis that separate them from all other RNA viruses. The SARS epidemic prompted a variety of studies on multiple aspects of the coronavirus replication cycle, yielding both rapid identification of the entry mechanisms of SARS-CoV into host cells and valuable structural and functional information on SARS-CoV proteins. These recent advances in coronavirus research have important implications for the development of anti-SARS drugs and vaccines.","This year marks the 15th anniversary of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in Canada and the 100th anniversary of the 1918 Spanish influenza pandemic. These, and other recent public health events, provide an opportunity for us to review and reflect on the evolution of Canada\u2019s public health emergency response over the past 15 years\u2014from SARS, to the 2009 H1N1 pandemic influenza, to Ebola virus and Zika virus disease. Key lessons have been learned and milestones achieved that have shaped and sharpened our response approach and structures. While SARS was a wake-up-call to strengthen infection prevention and control capacity in health care settings and led to the formation of the Public Health Agency of Canada, it also strengthened our Federal/Provincial/Territorial (FPT) senior-level governance and led to agreements for pan-Canadian mutual aid and infectious disease information sharing. As well, our collective public health laboratory capacity has been strengthened through ongoing ...","From geographic mapping at different scales to location-based alerting services, geoinformatics plays an important role in the study and control of global outbreaks like severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). This paper reviews several geographic mapping efforts of SARS on the Internet that employ a variety of techniques like choropleth rendering, graduated circles, graduated pie charts, buffering, overlay analysis and animation. The aim of these mapping services is to educate the public (especially travellers to potentially at-risk areas) and assist public health authorities in analysing the spatial and temporal trends and patterns of SARS and in assessing/revising current control measures.","The COVID-19 pandemic demands assimilation of all available biomedical knowledge to decode its mechanisms of pathogenicity and transmission. Despite the recent renaissance in unsupervised neural networks for decoding unstructured natural languages, a platform for the real-time synthesis of the exponentially growing biomedical literature and its comprehensive triangulation with deep omic insights is not available. Here, we present the nferX platform for dynamic inference from over 45 quadrillion possible conceptual associations extracted from unstructured biomedical text, and their triangulation with Single Cell RNA-sequencing based insights from over 25 tissues (https://academia.nferx.com/). Using this platform, we identify intersections between the pathologic manifestations of COVID-19 and the comprehensive expression profile of the SARS-CoV-2 receptor ACE2. We find that tongue keratinocytes, airway club cells, and ciliated cells are likely under-appreciated targets of SARS-CoV-2 infe...","Public health professionals are considering how molecular medicine applications can impact on preventive medicine and health provision enabling interventions to start earlier. There is the potential for molecular medicine to improve the workplace although inappropriate use will lead to discrimination. The public health issue of communicable diseases is being addressed through molecular medicine in more effective and early detection and a better understanding of pathogenesis. A threat from emerging and re-emerging infections requires multiple approaches but early and definitive detection will need nucleic acid based approaches. The non-communicable diseases are now a global world problem, particularly obesity. While molecular medicine is still to make a significant impact on this disorder some interesting findings are emerging about the role of genes in obesity. Ultimately, global health issues must include more efficient and environmentally sustainable strategies. Molecular technologie...","SUMMARY The French public health institute is responsible for promoting and coordinating threats the detection and assessment of health risks, and for suggesting possible responses. Transmissible diseases affecting both human and animal health are the focus of surveillance networks. Early detection of potential infectious threats is based on the screening of \u201c alert signals \u201c identified through routine surveillance networks and other systems. The quality and accuracy of these signals is first verified, before assessing, through a multidisciplinary approach, the risk of introduction and dissemination. This article examines specific cases illustrating the process of detection, risk analysis and response, with respect to infectious threats that are endemic in tropical regions and have the potential to be imported into metropolitan France. For both novel pathogens and exotic diseases \u2014 which, not being endemic in France, are less well known \u2014 the analysis and response process must regularl...","SUMMARY: In global health, critical challenges have arisen from infectious diseases, including the emergence and reemergence of old and new infectious diseases. Emergence and reemergence are accelerated by rapid human development, including numerous changes in demographics, populations, and the environment. This has also led to zoonoses in the changing human-animal ecosystem, which are impacted by a growing globalized society where pathogens do not recognize geopolitical borders. Within this context, neglected tropical infectious diseases have historically lacked adequate attention in international public health efforts, leading to insufficient prevention and treatment options. This subset of 17 infectious tropical diseases disproportionately impacts the world's poorest, represents a significant and underappreciated global disease burden, and is a major barrier to development efforts to alleviate poverty and improve human health. Neglected tropical diseases that are also categorized as...","AbstractRNA knockdown in vivo carries significant potential for disease modelings and therapies. Despite the emerging approaches of CRISPR/Cas9-mediated permanent knock out of targeted genes, strategies targeting RNA for disruption are advantageous in the treatment of acquired metabolic disorders when permanent modification of the genome DNA is not appropriate, and RNA virus infection diseases when pathogenic DNA is not available (such as SARS-Cov-2 and MERS infections). Recently, Cas13d, a family of RNA-targeting CRISPR effectors, has been shown to accomplish robust down-regulation of cellular RNAs in mammalian cells in vitro. Among the various Cas13d subtypes, CasRx (RfxCas13d) showed the most potent RNA knockdown efficiency in HEK293T cells. However, the RNA-targeting activity of Cas13d still needs to be verified in vivo. In this study, the CasRx system was demonstrated to efficiently and functionally knock down genes related to metabolism functions, including Pten, Pcsk9 and lncLst...","The pace of pathogen discovery is increasing dramatically. This reflects not only factors that enable the appearance and globalization of new microbial infections but also improvements in methods for ascertainment. New molecular diagnostic platforms; investments in pathogen surveillance in wildlife, domestic animals and humans; and the advent of social media tools that mine the world wide web for clues to outbreaks of infectious disease are proving invaluable in early recognition of threats to public health. Additionally, models of microbial pathogenesis are becoming more complex, providing insights into the mechanisms by which microorganisms can contribute to chronic illnesses like cancer, peptic ulcer disease and mental illness. Here we review the contributions of each of these elements to infectious disease emergence and strategies for addressing the challenges of pathogen surveillance and discovery.","ABSTRACTThe outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has infected more than 100,000 people worldwide with over 3,000 deaths since December 2019. There is no cure for COVID-19 and the vaccine development is estimated to require 12-18 months. Here we demonstrate a CRISPR-Cas13-based strategy, PAC-MAN (Prophylactic Antiviral CRISPR in huMAN cells), for viral inhibition that can effectively degrade SARS-CoV-2 sequences and live influenza A virus (IAV) genome in human lung epithelial cells. We designed and screened a group of CRISPR RNAs (crRNAs) targeting conserved viral regions and identified functional crRNAs for cleaving SARS-CoV-2. The approach is effective in reducing respiratory cell viral replication for H1N1 IAV. Our bioinformatic analysis showed a group of only six crRNAs can target more than 90% of all coronaviruses. The PAC-MAN approach is potentially a rapidly implementable pan-coronavirus s...","Abstract A new system to recognize protein coding genes in the coronavirus genomes, specially suitable for the SARS-CoV genomes, has been proposed in this paper. Compared with some existing systems, the new program package has the merits of simplicity, high accuracy, reliability, and quickness. The system ZCURVE_CoV has been run for each of the 11 newly sequenced SARS-CoV genomes. Consequently, six genomes not annotated previously have been annotated, and some problems of previous annotations in the remaining five genomes have been pointed out and discussed. In addition to the polyprotein chain ORFs 1a and 1b and the four genes coding for the major structural proteins, spike (S), small envelop (E), membrane (M), and nuleocaspid (N), respectively, ZCURVE_CoV also predicts 5\u20136 putative proteins in length between 39 and 274 amino acids with unknown functions. Some single nucleotide mutations within these putative coding sequences have been detected and their biological implications are di...","An outbreak of novel betacoronavirus, SARS-CoV-2 (formerly named 2019-nCoV), began in Wuhan, China in December 2019 and the COVID-19 disease associated with infection has since spread rapidly to multiple countries. Here we report the development of SARS-CoV-2 DETECTR, a rapid (~30 min), low-cost, and accurate CRISPR-Cas12 based lateral flow assay for detection of SARS-CoV-2. We validated this method using contrived reference samples and clinical samples from infected US patients and demonstrated comparable performance to the US CDC SARS-CoV-2 real-time RT-PCR assay.","ABSTRACTA fully Integrated Micropillar Polydimethylsiloxane Accurate CRISPR Detection (IMPACT) system is developed for viral DNA detection. This powerful system is patterned with high-aspect ratio micropillars to enhance reporter probe binding. After surface modification and probe immobilization, CRISPR Cas12a/crRNA complex is injected into the fully enclosed system. With the presence of double-stranded DNA target, the CRISPR enzyme is activated and non-specifically cleaves the ssDNA reporters initially immobilized on the micropillars. This collateral cleavage releases fluorescence dyes into the assay, and the intensity is linearly proportional to the target DNA concentration ranging from 0.1 to 10 nM. Importantly, this system does not rely on traditional dye-quencher labeled probe thus eliminating the fluorescence background presented in the assay. Furthermore, our one-step detection protocol is performed at isothermal conditions (37\u00b0C) without using complicated and time-consuming off...","The number of confirmed COVID-19 cases admitted in hospitals is continuously increasing in the Philippines. Frontline health care workers are faced with imminent risks of getting infected. In this study, we formulate a theoretical model to calculate the risk of being infected in health care facilities considering the following factors: the average number of encounters with a suspected COVID-19 patient per hour; interaction time for each encounter; work shift duration or exposure time; crowd density, which may depend on the amount of space available in a given location; and availability and effectiveness of protective gears and facilities provided for the frontline health care workers. Based on the simulation results, we recommend the following: (i) decrease the rate of patient encounter per frontline health care worker, e.g., maximum of three encounters per hour in a 12-hour work shift duration; (ii) decrease the interaction time between the frontline health care worker and the patient...","Background: The COVID-19 pandemic caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is straining health systems around the world. Although the Chinese government implemented a number of severe restrictions on people's movement in an attempt to contain its local and international spread, the virus had already reached many areas of the world in part due to its potent transmissibility and the fact that a substantial fraction of infected individuals develop little or no symptoms at all. Following its emergence, the virus started to generate sustained transmission in neighboring countries in Asia, Western Europe, Australia, Canada and the United States, and finally in South America and Africa. As the virus continues its global spread, a clear and evidence-based understanding of properties and dynamics of the global transmission network of SARS-CoV-2 is essential to design and put in place efficient and globally coordinated interventions. Methods: We employ molecular...","A major focus of systems biology is to characterize interactions between cellular components, in order to develop an accurate picture of the intricate networks within biological systems. Over the past decade, protein microarrays have greatly contributed to advances in proteomics and are becoming an important platform for systems biology. Protein microarrays are highly flexible, ranging from large-scale proteome microarrays to smaller customizable microarrays, making the technology amenable for detection of a broad spectrum of biochemical properties of proteins. In this article, we will focus on the numerous studies that have utilized protein microarrays to reconstruct biological networks including protein\u2013DNA interactions, posttranslational protein modifications (PTMs), lectin\u2013glycan recognition, pathogen\u2013host interactions and hierarchical signaling cascades. The diversity in applications allows for integration of interaction data from numerous molecular classes and cellular states, pr...","Over the past several decades, we have witnessed the emergence of many new infectious agents, some of which are major public threats. New and emerging infectious diseases which are both transmissible from patient-to-patient and virulent with a high mortality include novel coronaviruses (SARS-CoV, MERS-CV), hemorrhagic fever viruses (Lassa, Ebola), and highly pathogenic avian influenza A viruses, A(H5N1) and A(H7N9). All healthcare facilities need to have policies and plans in place for early identification of patients with a highly communicable diseases which are highly virulent, ability to immediately isolate such patients, and provide proper management (e.g., training and availability of personal protective equipment) to prevent transmission to healthcare personnel, other patients and visitors to the healthcare facility.","Mass spectrometry (MS) has found numerous applications in life sciences. It has high accuracy, sensitivity and wide dynamic range in addition to medium- to high-throughput capabilities. These features make MS a superior platform for analysis of various biomolecules including proteins, lipids, nucleic acids and carbohydrates. Until recently, MS was applied for protein detection and characterization. During the last decade, however, MS has successfully been used for molecular diagnostics of microbial and viral infections with the most notable applications being identification of pathogens, genomic sequencing, mutation detection, DNA methylation analysis, tracking of transmissions, and characterization of genetic heterogeneity. These new developments vastly expand the MS application from experimental research to public health and clinical fields. Matching of molecular techniques with specific requirements of the major MS platforms has produced powerful technologies for molecular diagnosti...","Abstract Background Viral Infectious clone systems serve as robust platforms to study viral gene or replicative function by reverse genetics, formulate vaccines and adapt a wild type-virus to an animal host. Since the development of the first viral infectious clone system for the poliovirus, novel strategies of viral genome construction have allowed for the assembly of viral genomes across the identified viral families. However, the molecular profiles of some viruses make their genome more difficult to construct than others. Two factors that affect the difficulty of infectious clone construction are genome length and genome complexity. Results This work examines the available strategies for overcoming the obstacles of assembling the long and complex RNA genomes of coronaviruses and reports one-step construction of an infectious clone system for the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) by homologous recombination in S. cerevisiae. Conclusions Future use of this method...","AbstractThe emergence and outbreak of SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19, has rapidly become a global concern and has highlighted the need for fast, sensitive, and specific tools to surveil circulating viruses. Here we provide assay designs and experimental resources, for use with CRISPR-based nucleic acid detection, that could be valuable for ongoing surveillance. We provide assay designs for detection of 67 viral species and subspecies, including: SARS-CoV-2, phylogenetically-related viruses, and viruses with similar clinical presentation. The designs are outputs of algorithms that we are developing for rapidly designing nucleic acid detection assays that are comprehensive across genomic diversity and predicted to be highly sensitive and specific. Of our design set, we experimentally screened 4 SARS-CoV-2 designs with a CRISPR-Cas13 detection system and then extensively tested the highest-performing SARS-CoV-2 assay. We demonstrate the sensitivity and speed of this assay usi...","Abstract Only a month after the outbreak of pneumonia caused by 2019-nCoV, more than forty-thousand people were infected. This put enormous pressure on the Chinese government, medical healthcare provider, and the general public, but also made the international community deeply nervous. On the 25th day after the outbreak, the Chinese government implemented strict traffic restrictions on the area where the 2019-nCoV had originated\u2014Hubei province, whose capital city is Wuhan. Ten days later, the rate of increase of cases in Hubei showed a significant difference (p = 0.0001) compared with the total rate of increase in other provinces of China. These preliminary data suggest the effectiveness of a traffic restriction policy for this pandemic thus far. At the same time, solid financial support and improved research ability, along with network communication technology, also greatly facilitated the application of epidemic prevention measures. These measures were motivated by the need to provid...","Abstract Medicine shortages have been spreading in European countries. In many cases, the unavailability of medicinal products has a substantial impact on the capability of National Healthcare Systems in ensuring the continuity of care. Shortages originate from multifactorial causes. In particular, they can be due to supply-related factors (e.g., manufacturing issues, regulatory issues, logistics, distribution) and demand-related ones (e.g., fluctuating drug demand, parallel market, tendering, price and reimbursement policies). However, some extraordinary geopolitical events (e.g., Brexit) may also affect medicines\u2019 availability. The capability of European Regulatory Authorities and other stakeholders, which are involved in the pharmaceutical distribution chain and the healthcare assistance services, to define suitable problem-solving strategies has been limited for years by the fragmentation of the European regulatory framework, starting from the lack of a univocal definition of a med...","The emergence of new pathogens, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and Ebola virus, poses serious challenges to global public health and highlights the urgent need for novel antiviral approaches. Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) have been successfully used to treat various diseases, particularly cancer and immunological disorders. Antigen-specific mAbs have been isolated using several different approaches, including hybridoma, transgenic mice, phage display, yeast display, and single B-cell isolation. Consequently, an increasing number of mAbs, which exhibit high potency against emerging viruses in vitro and in animal models of infection, have been developed. In this paper, we summarize historical trends and recent developments in mAb discovery, compare the advantages and disadvantages of various approaches to mAb production, and discuss the potential use of such strategies for the development of antivi...","Abstract The aim is to diagnose COVID-19 earlier and to improve its treatment by applying medical technology, the \u201cCOVID-19 Intelligent Diagnosis and Treatment Assistant Program (nCapp)\u201d based on the Internet of Things. Terminal eight functions can be implemented in real-time online communication with the \u201ccloud\u201d through the page selection key. According to existing data, questionnaires, and check results, the diagnosis is automatically generated as confirmed, suspected, or suspicious of 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection. It classifies patients into mild, moderate, severe or critical pneumonia. nCapp can also establish an online COVID-19 real-time update database, and it updates the model of diagnosis in real time based on the latest real-world case data to improve diagnostic accuracy. Additionally, nCapp can guide treatment. Front-line physicians, experts, and managers are linked to perform consultation and prevention. nCapp also contributes to the long-term follow-up of pa...","Abstract We present here the proceedings of the 5th seminar on emerging infectious diseases, held in Paris on March 22nd, 2016, with seven priority proposals that can be outlined as follows: encourage research on the prediction, screening and early detection of new risks of infection; develop research and surveillance concerning transmission of pathogens between animals and humans, with their reinforcement in particular in intertropical areas (\u201chot-spots\u201d) via public support; pursue aid development and support in these areas of prevention and training for local health personnel, and foster risk awareness in the population; ensure adapted patient care in order to promote adherence to treatment and to epidemic propagation reduction measures; develop greater awareness and better education among politicians and healthcare providers, in order to ensure more adapted response to new types of crises; modify the logic of governance, drawing from all available modes of communication and incorpor...","In December 2019, a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) caused an outbreak in Wuhan, China, and soon spread to other parts of the world. It was believed that 2019-nCoV was transmitted through respiratory tract and then induced pneumonia, thus molecular diagnosis based on oral swabs was used for confirmation of this disease. Likewise, patient will be released upon two times of negative detection from oral swabs. However, many coronaviruses can also be transmitted through oral\u2013fecal route by infecting intestines. Whether 2019-nCoV infected patients also carry virus in other organs like intestine need to be tested. We conducted investigation on patients in a local hospital who were infected with this virus. We found the presence of 2019-nCoV in anal swabs and blood as well, and more anal swab positives than oral swab positives in a later stage of infection, suggesting shedding and thereby transmitted through oral\u2013fecal route. We also showed serology test can improve detection positive rate thus...","Abstract In December 2019, the outbreak of the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in China spread worldwide, becoming an emergency of major international concern. SARS-CoV-2 infection causes clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus. Human-to-human transmission has been described with incubation times between 2-14 days, facilitating its spread via droplets, contaminated hands or surfaces. Early diagnosis, quarantine, and supportive treatments are essential to cure patients. We therefore reviewed the literature on all available information about the epidemiology, diagnosis, isolation and treatments of COVID-19. Treatments, including antiviral agents, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, corticosteroids, antibodies, convalescent plasma transfusion and vaccines, will be discussed in this article. Additionally, registered trials about treatment were listed to develop approaches for the current urgent demand for therapy.","Outbreaks of infection can be devastating for individuals and societies. In this review, we examine the applications of new high-throughput sequencing approaches to the identification and characterization of outbreaks, focusing on the application of whole-genome sequencing (WGS) to outbreaks of bacterial infection. We describe traditional epidemiological analysis and show how WGS can be informative at multiple steps in outbreak investigation, as evidenced by many recent studies. We conclude that high-throughput sequencing approaches can make a significant contribution to the investigation of outbreaks of bacterial infection and that the integration of WGS with epidemiological investigation, diagnostic assays and antimicrobial susceptibility testing will precipitate radical changes in clinical microbiology and infectious disease epidemiology in the near future. However, several challenges remain before WGS can be routinely used in outbreak investigation and clinical practice.","Ever since the development of the first vaccine more than 200 years ago, vaccinations have greatly decreased the burden of infectious diseases worldwide, famously leading to the eradication of small pox and allowing the restriction of diseases such as polio, tetanus, diphtheria, and measles. A multitude of research efforts focuses on the improvement of established and the discovery of new vaccines such as the HPV (human papilloma virus) vaccine in 2006. However, radical changes in the density, age distribution and traveling habits of the population worldwide as well as the changing climate favor the emergence of old and new pathogens that bear the risk of becoming pandemic threats. In recent years, the rapid spread of severe infections such as HIV, SARS, Ebola, and Zika have highlighted the dire need for global preparedness for pandemics, which necessitates the extremely rapid development and comprehensive distribution of vaccines against potentially previously unknown pathogens. What ...","","Bats are responsible for the zoonotic transmission of several major viral diseases including the 2003 SARS outbreak and the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. While bat genomic sequencing studies have revealed characteristic adaptations of the innate immune system, functional genomic studies are urgently needed to provide a foundation for the molecular dissection of the tolerance of viral infections in bats. Here we report the establishment and screening of genome-wide RNAi library and CRISPR library for the model megabat, Pteropus Alecto. We used the complementary RNAi and CRISPR libraries to interrogate Pteropus Alecto cells for infection with two different viruses, mumps virus and Influenza A virus, respectively. Screening results converged on the endocytosis pathway and the protein secretory pathway as required for both viral infections. Additionally, we revealed a general dependence of the C-1-tetrahydrofolate synthase gene, MTHFD1, for viral replication in bat cells as well as in human c...","This paper identifies the \u201csafe ventilation rate\u201d for eliminating airborne viral infection and preventing cross-infection of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in a hospital-based setting. We used simulation approaches to reproduce three actual cases where groups of hospital occupants reported to be either infected or not infected when SARS patients were hospitalized in nearby rooms. Simulations using both computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and multi-zone models were carried out to understand the dilution level of SARS virus-laden aerosols during these scenarios. We also conducted a series of measurements to validate the simulations. The ventilation rates (dilution level) for infection and non-infection were determined based on these scenarios.

and (b) shed light on how transdisciplinary approaches may, or may not, have functioned in these cases;(iii)to examine the role of transdisciplinary approaches in EID control, including how and when such approaches can arise and/or are warranted; and(iv)to discuss critical factors that present opportunities and obstacles to designing and implementing more holistic approaches to controlling EIDs. ","While the two types of integration in Figure 1 function in complementary ways, they are fundamentally different, and should not be conflated. Integration \u201cacross\u201d disciplines is one starting point to facilitate a holistic, social\u2013ecological understanding of the metaphenomenon of increased disease emergence globally. However, vertical integration, by lending opportunities to incorporate what Brown et al. (2005) describe as individual, local, specialized, strategic, and holistic knowledge perspectives, provides a variety of new \u201chands\u201d that can be utilized on deck. Important practical, ethical, and political implications accompany the inclusion of these new \u201chands\u201d and nonacademic voices. This is highlighted by Lebel (2003) in his linking of \u201ctransdisciplinarity,\u201d \u201cparticipation,\u201d and \u201cequity\u201d through their roles as the three pillars of \u201cecosystem approaches to human health.\u201d Breilh (2003) argues that it is impossible to understand the dynamics and conditions of human infectious diseases without embedding them within the (often inequitable) social relations in which they reside. Approaches to EID control that successfully integrate considerations of participation and equity into their strategies are likely to raise questions about global and local forces driving social and ecological change, and about the needs of those most vulnerable to infectious diseases, in particular women and children (Gerberding, 2004; McDonald et al., 2004), thereby engaging explicitly with the political economy of health (Krieger, 2001).","Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method is the most commonly used technology for pathogen nucleic acid detection and has been considered as a \"gold standard\" for disease diagnostics due to high sensitivity and specificity. 4, 5, 6 However, it typically relies on expensive equipment and well-trained personnel, all of which is not suitable for point of care diagnostic application. In recent decades, several isothermal amplification methods, such as recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) 7 , loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) 8 , have been developed as attractive alternatives to conventional PCR method because of their simplicity, rapidity and low cost. However, there is still a challenge to apply it to develop a reliable POC diagnostics for clinical applications due to non-specific signals (e.g., false-positive). 9, 10 Recently, RNA-guided CRISPR/Cas nuclease-based nucleic acid detection has shown great promise for the development of next-generation molecular diagnostics technology due to its high sensitivity, specificity and reliability. 11, 12 For example, some Cas nucleases (e.g., Cas12a, Cas12b and Cas13a) perform strong collateral cleavage activities in which a crRNA-targetbinding activated Cas can indiscriminately cleave surrounding non-target single-stranded nucleic acids. 13, 14, 15, 16, 17 By combining with RPA preamplification, Cas13 and Cas12a have, respectively, been used to develop SHERLOCK (Specific High-sensitivity Enzymatic Reporter UnLOCKing) system 18 and DETECTR (DNA Endonuclease-Targeted CRISPR Trans Reporter) system 14 for highly sensitive nucleic acid detection. Apart from RPA method, some CRISPR-Cas-based nucleic acid sensors utilized the LAMP and PCR approaches, for instance, the CRISPR-Cas12b-assisted HOLMESv2 platform. 16 However, these CRISPR-Cas-based detection methods typically require separate nucleic acid pre-amplification and multiple manual operations, which undoubtedly complicates the procedures and brings about contaminations.","To improve responsiveness to epidemics, in 2015 the WHO published a list of nine diseases requiring urgent vaccine R&amp;D to prevent public health emergencies in the future. This list was revised in 2017, and key characteristics of the diseases prioritised by the WHO are summarised in Table 3. The process of prioritising diseases took into account properties of the causative pathogen e.g. transmissibility, host-based factors such as immunopathology, clinical aspects including ease of accurate diagnosis, availability of countermeasures and mortality, public health capacity and epidemiological factors.47 Research and development priorities for these diseases include development of suitable diagnostic tests, assessment of potential treatments, identification of key knowledge gaps, production platforms, behavioural interventions and acceleration of vaccine development. Preparation of sufficient quantities of safe and efficacious vaccines against potential outbreak pathogens is an extremely effective strategy. However, a lack of access to dedicated long-term funding has hampered vaccine development for outbreak pathogens in recent decades.48 As well as limiting the number of new vaccines being developed, the number of facilities with the capacity to biomanufacture vaccines is also limited, which is a significant issue for outbreak preparedness.49 In addition, WHO recognised that generally applicable platform technologies for rapid vaccine development are required and have set out to identify and prioritise the leading platforms.   ","TCM has own characteristics such as holistic concept, balance of Yin and Yang, syndrome differentiation and treatment, strengthening the body resistance to eliminate pathogenic factors. TCM has thousands of years of experience in regulating the body and enhancing the resistance to epidemic diseases, with unique insights and prevention and control experience. For mild and common patients, the early intervention of TCM can effectively prevent the disease from transforming into severe and critical disease. In the severe cases, TCM has won time for rescuing them by improving symptoms (http://www.scio.gov.cn/xwfbh/ xwbfbh/wqfbh/42311/42560/index.htm). Treatment practice of COVID-19 showed that early intervention of TCM is important way to improve cure rate, shorten the course of disease, delay disease progression and reduce mortality rate. Furthermore, the reason why TCM works is not only to inhibit the virus, but might block the infection, regulate the immune response, cut off the inflammatory storm, and promote the repair of the body. Moreover, the prevention and control measures of COVID-19 fully reflect the ideology of \"preventive treatment of disease\". Apart from the epidemic diseases recorded in the Han Dynasty should be isolated, the preventive measures of TCM also include psychology, sports, diet, medication, etc.","Perhaps one of the most important global health emergency incidents for 2020 would be the global response to COVID-2019 [21]. With their proposed influenza A simulation model that considered the three main routes of transmission\u2014long\u2013range airborne, fomites, and close contact\u2014Zhang and Li [22] found in a non-clinical office setting that mask wearing and regular cleaning of high-touch surfaces were more useful than hand-washing for viral-related disease transmission control. Through their retrospective public health response policy analysis of SARS and MERS in South Korea, Lee and Jung [23] showed that legislation and leadership influenced the overall emergency response process and the establishment of intergovernmental response systems and the success of risk communications during infectious-related events. Meanwhile, although new technology platforms (e.g., smartphones and internet) had generated interests and showed promises in efficiency and speed in mass communication in emergencies and crises, community receptivity of communication channels might differ with the nature of the emergency events [24]. For major infectious disease-based event such as the H7N9 outbreak in 2014 in Hong Kong, Tam, Huang and Chan [19] showed traditional risk communication channels (television and telephone) might still be the preferred channels of the general public.","Decisions must be made quickly during epidemics based on patchy and uncertain data, and models can be powerful tools to help guide them. Despite the challenges above, ongoing advances in computational power, methods, and new data streams offer genuine hope for better surveillance and useful forecasting systems. New data sources at our disposal include not only the passively observed big data streams from mobile phones but also detailed environmental data and local sensor information from distributed devices, internet search information, pathogen genomic data that can be generated rapidly during an outbreak to inform the response, 7 and crowd-sourced approaches to monitoring rapidly evolving emergencies. 8 Data sharing platforms and standardised aggregation approaches that protect the privacy of personal data are being developed, 9 and increasing internet connectivity allows for rapid data transfer and communication between geographically disparate teams of responders. Methodologically, powerful ensemble modelling approaches are being developed that combine multiple forecasts to minimise uncertainty. 5, 10 We have seen an unprecedented, collaborative approach unfolding in response to the COVID-19 outbreak between academic groups: for example, using Twitter and other platforms to share, analyse, and openly discuss the implications of new data as they come out. (Ironically, managing the disinformation that also proliferates on social media during emergencies will probably become one of the most important issues for epidemic containment moving forward.)","With the advance in molecular biology technology, nucleic acid detection methods have developed rapidly and become a revolutionary technology for virus detection. Especially, the method based on polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is characterized by rapid detection, high sensitivity and specificity, which has been regarded as the \"gold standard\" for virus detection. Novel PCR-based methods also have been reported to enhance both the specificity and sensitivity of the assay. Besides, several molecular tests which employ non-PCR-based methods, such as isothermal nucleic acid amplification (loop mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) and nucleic acid sequence-based amplification), were developed for the detection of coronavirus RNA. In this work, we reviewed various approaches currently available for detection of coronavirus. It is anticipated that this will assist researchers to develop rapid and accurate detection techniques.","Animal models are essential tools for the preclinical evaluation of anti-MERS-CoV countermeasures. Dromedary camels, alpacas, and non-human primates are susceptible to MERS-CoV infection [21,22,23]; however, the virus does not infect small animals such as mice, hamsters, and ferrets [24,25,26]. Several mouse models that express human DPP4 (hDPP4) have been established for MERS-CoV infection [27,28,29]. In this issue, Widagdo and colleagues examine rabbits as potential hosts for MERS-CoV, showing that MERS-CoV infects rabbits without causing symptoms; they also analyze the route of MERS-CoV transmission in rabbits [30]. Fan and colleagues report the development of an hDPP4-expressing mouse model through inserting hDPP4 gene into a constitutive and ubiquitous gene expression locus using CRISPR/Cas9 technology. This mouse model is susceptible to MERS-CoV infection [31]. These articles have established platforms for testing vaccines and therapeutic agents targeting MERS-CoV.","A deep profiling of ACE2 expression in the human body demands a platform that synthesizes biomedical insights encompassing multiple scales, modalities, and pathologies described across the scientific literature and various omics siloes. With the exponential growth of scientific (e.g. PubMed, preprints, grants), translational (e.g. clinicaltrials.gov), and other (e.g. patents) biomedical knowledge bases, a fundamental requirement is to recognize nuanced scientific phraseology and measure the strength of association between all possible pairs of such phrases. Such a holistic map of associations will provide insights into the knowledge harbored in the world's biomedical literature.","The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is Here, to address this question and the expanding clinical needs, we developed CRISPR-nCoV, 78 a rapid assay for 2019-nCoV detection, and compared the diagnostic performance among 79 three different technological platforms: metagenomic sequencing, RT-PCR and CRISPR. To the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.","If transdisciplinary approaches yield longer-lasting effects, make medical interventions more successful or less necessary, provide health-care access to more sectors of the community, and more effectively address economic and gender inequities than do standard biomedical interventions alone, these gains can help achieve a fundamental shift in devising and implementing disease-prevention strategies. The successes, and policy relevance, of these approaches will be key to their institutionalization (Lebel, 2004). Additionally, teams and communities of transdisciplinary researchers must communicate their successes and failures so that they are understood by a wide range of audiences and measured by appropriate indices, particularly because holistic systems-based research can take a long time to complete and tends not to make the same splash as large drug or vaccine trials. Substantial outreach and education efforts will be required to achieve these goals, which include communication with, and participation by, those whose health is being studied as well as by decision-makers at multiple levels, from emergency physicians and veterinarians to funding agencies and global policy makers.","The connection between dam construction and schistosomiasis, a debilitating infection caused by a trematode parasite and hosted by several snail species, is well-documented (Hunter et al., 1993; Jobin, 1999). Ertan\u2019s completion was threatened when a live snail of a species known to carry schistosomiasis was discovered in the reservoir area 4 years before it was to be flooded. Three years later, after expensive efforts to survey vulnerable upstream areas, spray molluscicides, engineer snail-resistant water channels, and improve management of human and animal waste, the area was recertified snail-free. No outbreak of schistosomiasis has occurred to date (Gu et al., 2001), but other infections (such as HIV and other infectious diseases resulting from high-risk behaviors and vulnerability of populations affected by the dams), and general health effects (endemic diseases of poverty, despair, inadequate water supplies, poor sanitation, and malnutrition) remain undocumented and unaddressed (Sleigh and Jackson, 2001). The Ertan case exemplifies the limitations of studying through a single lens complex issues that, by their nature, transcend single disciplines, sectors, and/or diseases. The case provides an excellent opportunity to consider how a more holistic, more integrated health assessment could have been conducted\u2014one that would have recognized the social and ecological impacts of dams as drivers of EIDs and related determinants of health.","Several promising approaches to microbial detection array design and analysis have been tested during the past decade. The array platforms vary widely in terms of fabrication cost, range of organisms targeted, sensitivity and specificity of detection. An essential component of any pathogen detection platform is an analysis algorithm that can make sense of the noisy data produced with current array technology and yield easily interpretable results. Analysis and visualization software will become especially important as microbial detection arrays move from the research environment to widespread medical, industrial and military use. Most of the analysis algorithms described in this review can be adapted to handle data from a variety of array types, and each algorithm has a unique set of strengths. An ideal analysis and visualization tool would combine the best features of the current approaches.","Alternatively, the emerging additive manufacturing technology can also be used to create such ultra-high aspect ratio microstructures as an efficient target capture platform. 27, 28 One of the main advantages of the IMPACT chip compared to traditional CRISPR assays is its ability to limit the background caused by dye-quencher probes, which is typically seen in CRISPR detection in the liquid state and needs to be designed around to lower the detection limit. 29, 30 Our device utilizing solid-phase CRISPR does not need to tether a quencher on the probe. The cleaved CRISPR products are sent to a separate reservoir for detection thus completely avoiding the fluorescence background caused by the tradition \"onepot\" detection. As shown in Fig. 5 , without the presence of ASFV target DNA, no fluorescence background signal was detected, demonstrating this powerful backgroundfree detection. This is an important improvement for molecular diagnostics, especially in low light settings in which the amount of background fluorescence present can significantly affect the detection limit . 31,32 Leveraging this advantage with increasing the aspect ratio either with PDMS or a silicon substrate will be able to further increase the accuracy and robustness of the device and improve the limit of detection.","In this study, we describe a new CRISPR-Cas12a reaction, AIOD-CRISPR in which all components are incubated in a single reaction system to rapidly, highly sensitively and specifically detect nucleic acids without separate preamplification steps. Upon the design of AIOD-CRISPR, dual crRNAs are introduced to improve the sensitivity and high-concentration . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license author/funder.

In addition to real-time detection, AIOD-CRISPR assay is also beneficial for point-of-care detection because its detection results can be visually judged based on the fluorescence and color change of reaction solutions. As proof-of-concept assays, AIOD-CRISPR has been successfully developed for SARS-CoV-2 and HIV-1 detection.","The potential benefits of school closures must be balanced with the costs. Smith et al., Lempel, Epstein, and Hammond, and Adda analyze the economic impacts of school closures. 1, 6, 7 Schooling is one of the most important investments we make in our children's futures, and we do not have good estimates of how prolonged school closures influence drop-out rates and future earnings. This uncertainty makes a holistic assessment of tradeoffs challenging.","This study specifically shows a holistic picture of the current research in response to the outbreak of COVID-19. We conducted a topic-based bibliometric study to address two questions \"What is the CoVs research interested in?\" and \"Where are we with our research about COVID-19?\". An LDA-based model was used to identify the hotspots and their difference between COVID-19 and other CoV infections in a quantitative way. Generally, eight main research areas are identified, i.e., clinical characterization, pathogenesis research, therapeutics research, epidemiological study, virus transmission, vaccines research, virus diagnostics, and viral genomics. The results also indicate that studies in diagnostics, therapeutics, vaccines, viral genomics, and pathogenesis are urgently needed to minimize the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak. As COVID-19 can be considered a recent emerged disease, we characterize a 'snapshot' of this field at an early stage in its development. Our findings can potentially aid governments and the research community in understanding recent development of the research field, optimizing research topic decision, and monitoring new scientific or technological activities.","China has an established hospital-based surveillance system for infectious diseases. All clinical and hospital reports of both suspected and confirmed cases of notifiable infectious disease must be sent to local Centers for Disease Control (CDC). The information is then sent to the China CDC headquarters in Beijing through the National Infectious Diseases Monitoring Information System Database, which was established in 2004. The hierarchical administrative organization of the surveillance system ensures a rapid and efficient upward flow of epidemic information [5]. Based on this system, development of effective diagnostic platforms can greatly enhance the prevention and control of infectious diseases in China. The predominant techniques for identification of microbial pathogens depend on conventional clinical microbiology monitoring approaches. Although well established, these approaches usually require culture of the pathogens, followed by susceptibility tests, which are time-consuming and laborious. In addition, many microbes are difficult to culture, and may be undetectable by culture-based approaches.","can detect variations directly from clinical samples. Whereas the detection throughput of NTS is not 274 high at present, the NTS method can be integrated into widely used automated or semi-automated 275 platforms to improve the detection throughput in the future 21-23 . In addition, because PCR is 276 included in NTS, processes involving opening the lid of the PCR tubes may cause mutual 277 contamination between samples 24, 25 . However, this situation also is inevitable in current nucleic 278 acid detection methods (e.g., qPCR) or other nucleic acid detection schemes (e.g., SHERLOCK 11, 12 279 or toehold switch biosensor 9, 10 ) that also involve PCR. The introduction of integration systems or 280 sealed devices such as microfluidics may avoid this situation 26, 27 . At present, our processes of 281 sequencing data analysis and interpretation of results are not mature; nevertheless, as the number of 282 test samples increases, additional test results will be collected and the process continuously 283 optimized to obtain more accurate results. 284","With the aim of improving prevention and control of viral outbreaks, the Chinese government has been investing continually in the advancement of science and technology since 2003, including the appropriation of more than 12 billion RMB for research and development related to combating SARS, influenza, and other major infectious diseases [27]. Meanwhile, China has built 11 national technology platforms, 11 national research centers, 6 national key laboratories, and 2 national engineering laboratories. In 2010, the Chinese National Influenza Centre was designated as a WHO Collaborating Centre for Reference and Research on Influenza. All these laboratories and funding contributed to application of advanced technologies in preventing and controlling infectious diseases.","The Chinese government has carried out a special project for the prevention and control of major infectious diseases, whose aims are to reduce the incidence and mortality of AIDS, viral hepatitis, and tuberculosis, and to improve the emergency response and capabilities of infectious disease prevention and control. The project has also focused on the detection of infectious diseases and laboratory monitoring with standardized technology, providing technical support for emergency decisions related to infectious diseases. 87 Based on thematic studies, the laboratory network, common technology platform, academic union, demonstration areas, and the effective integration of superior forces, a multi-linked network technology system has been developed, and the prevention and control technology support system for infectious diseases has been established. 87 The project has improved the ability to deal with the traditional infectious diseases and has also contributed to the significantly enhanced emergency response abilities against emerging zoonotic diseases. For example, in response to the pandemic caused by a novel swine-origin influenza A (H1N1) virus in 2009, an effective and safe vaccine for various age groups was first developed in China, which played an important role in controlling the influenza epidemic. 88 Another major breakthrough in the field of global etiological research since the discovery of the SARS coronavirus, is the discovery in 2009 that a novel bunyavirus had been responsible for a life-threatening illness associated with fever and thrombocytopenia in China since 2007. 9","The encouraging early results from the DNA microarray technology has inspired the development of a variety of array-based platforms [38-42] and contributed to the development of a system-wide study of proteins -- the field of modern pro-teomics. Traditionally, two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-D PAGE) with mass spectrometry has been the basis of proteomic technology [43]. Although this technique has provided rich information about individual proteins, its clinical usefulness for the study of the proteome is limited. The limitations of this technique for clinical diagnostics are primarily due to low sample throughput compared with other techniques. Additionally, there are technical challenges relating to the reproducibility of the 2-D gels, the relatively low numbers of proteins that can be resolved on each gel and the limited sensitivity (ie low abundant proteins are not easily identified). Modern proteomics technology, as discussed in several recent reviews, is developing quickly and is focused on mass spec-trometry-based serum pattern profiling and protein micro-arrays in continuing efforts to discover new molecular markers and therapeutic targets in human cancer [44-46]. The use of serum proteomic pattern analysis has created diagnostic signatures for ovarian [47,48], breast [49], prostate [50] and liver cancers [51]. In the Laboratory of Pathology at the National Cancer Institute (NCI), in collaboration with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), this proteome-based strategy is being used for early detection of ovarian cancer in high-risk women. Preliminary data is so encouraging that the technology is on track to enter clinical trials in the very near future [47]. For women living with the spectre of an aggressive disease, such as ovarian cancer, a reliable screening test would represent a major step forward in the diagnostic capabilities of the physicians who treat them.","Of course, ultimate confirmation of computational predictions requires experimental verification, which will also be very important for improving our method in the future. However, experimental approaches for deeply understanding the human transmission of viruses in terms of receptor-binding interactions and specificity is rather time consuming. Sometimes, it might be even impossible to employ experimental methods to thoroughly examine every evolved, mutant strain of a newly emerged virus, such as 2019-nCoV in our case. As an alternative, using a high-performance computer, our approach may assess the receptor-binding capability of a newly identified strain within a very short period of time. Thus, our method can be useful for the post-genome analysis for a newly identified CoV and its mutant strains, with the first-determined genome data. Note that, although viral genome data provide useful sequence information for comparison-based assessments with previously identified viruses, these data themselves do not offer hints about how the encoded viral proteins carry out their functions which may lead to serious human infections and diseases. Hence, post-genome analysis of viral protein functions is valuable not only for understanding the viruses themselves, but also for offering useful scientific supports for making effective, early decisions about viral prevention and control.","The second estimation method of the R value works with a simplified model of infection in 3 stages -Exposed, Infectious, and Isolated, which is a modified version of the SEIR structure. \"Exposed\" refers to the stage when a person becomes infected by a disease vector, but has not reached the stage where it can infect another person; \"Infectious\" refers to the stage when the person is a potential disease vector; \"Isolated\" refers to the stage where the person loses the ability to be a disease vector (i.e. the person either is isolated in quarantine, recovers, or passes away). This model was developed during the SARS epidemic by Lipsitch et al. 1 This model develops a statistical approach -it discounts individual variables, using holistic statistics of cases per day, as well as basic viral data 1 . This vastly simplifies the problem, allowing for quick, responsive calculation. Furthermore, it uses R as a descriptor of past trends, rather than a predictor of future ones. Therefore, it is a more fitting method for my purpose of creating a responsive indicator of the current infectious situation.","The mental health service system in China has been greatly improved after several major disasters, especially the Wenchuan earthquake. In the process of dealing with group crisis intervention, various forms of psychosocial intervention services have been developed, including the intervention model of expert-coach-teacher collaboration after the Wenchuan earthquake (Lin et al., 2018) and the equilibrium psychological intervention on people injured in the disaster incident after the Lushan earthquake (Huang et al., 2014) . With the aim of dealing better with the urgent psychological problems of people involved in the COVID-19 epidemic, a new psychological crisis intervention model was developed through internet technology use. This new model from the West China Hospital integrates physicians, psychiatrists, psychologists, and social workers into internet platforms to carry out psychological intervention to patients, their families, and medical staff. The central idea is to join internet technology and the whole intervention process, as well as to combine early intervention with later rehabilitation .","We employ well-established \"reduced-form\" econometric techniques 23, 24 commonly used to measure the effect of policies 25, 26 or other events (e.g., wars 27 or environmental changes 28 ) on economic growth rates. Similarly to early COVID-19 infections, economic output generally increases exponentially with a variable rate that can be affected by policy or other conditions. Unlike process-based epidemiological models, 7-9, 12, 22, 29, 30 the reduced-form statistical approach to inference that we apply does not require explicit prior information about fundamental epidemiological parameters or mechanisms, many of which remain unknown in the current pandemic. Rather, the collective influence of these factors is empirically recovered from the data without modeling their individual effects explicitly (see Methods). Prior work on influenza, 31 for example, has shown that such statistical approaches can provide important complementary information to process-based models.","Beyond laboratory-based applications, DNA microarrays have been tested successfully in epidemic outbreak surveillance (EOS). Project Silent Guardian was a 10-week trial launched by the Naval Research Laboratory during the 2005 US Presidential Inauguration [41] . The challenge was to take laboratory-based microarray technology to a production-scale system capable of operationally screening up to 300 samples per day. A custom DNA microarray was designed with the capability of detecting 20 natural (including avian flu) and biothreat agents with strain-level resolution. In total, 10 000 samples were collected and screened by civilian and military laboratory personnel within the stipulated period. The trial included blinded samples that were spiked with pathogens, which were all successfully detected. This exercise showcased the feasibility of implementing microarrays as a screening tool for EOS and demonstrated their use as a rapid and robust means of sample processing and pathogen identification. Recommendations from the study included the development of a more user-friendly system with greater automation of the steps involved. These features are being incorporated by several recently launched commercial platforms. Microarray-based platforms for biothreat screening from Akonni Biosystems (http://www.akonni. com) and Veredus Laboratories (http://www.vereduslabs. com) are now on the market for multiplexed threat detection. New advances include (i) greater integration of the sample preparation (which is considered to be one of the major bottlenecks), (ii) the use of mPCR and (iii) the development of small handheld microfluidic chips and portable readers to take microarray technology to the point-ofcare. Veredus has also recently launched an influenza test chip that enables the amplification and discrimination of influenza A and B subtypes, including avian flu (H5N1), within just two hours. This great improvement in detection time has been attributed to the mPCR step, which, through rapid thermocycling, significantly reduces the duration of PCR to under 30 min. Similar devices might be developed in the future for protein and other types of non-DNA microarrays for applications in serodiagnostics.","This study shows a holistic picture of the current research in response to the outbreak of COVID-19. During this early period, many studies have been published exploring the epidemiology, causes, clinical manifestation and diagnosis, and prevention and control of the novel coronavirus. Thus far, most studies have focused on the epidemiology and potential causes. However, studies exploring prevention and control measures have begun to gradually increase. Studies in this domain are urgently needed to minimize the impact of the outbreak. Government agencies have quickly incorporated recent scientific findings into public policies at the community, regional, and national levels to slow down and/or prevent the further spread of the COVID-19. We recommend that the scholarly community conduct further research to provide valid and reliable ways to manage this kind of public health emergency in both the short-term and long-term.","Pandemics such as HIV, Ebola, and Zika have raised the awareness of global threats to human health posed by known as well as newly emerging pathogens and can provide the impetus to prepare against future pandemics by promoting the development of vaccine platforms that can tackle the challenges of outbreak situations. New platforms, such as viral vector and nucleic acid based vaccines meet the prerequisites to provide solutions for some of these challenges by representing highly versatile technologies that allow fast vaccine manufacturing. Each vaccine technology has its own advantages and disadvantages related to its ability to induce certain immune responses, manufacturing capacity and safety for human use (Table 4). Viral vector based vaccines are able to induce potent immune responses against the encoded target antigen. Indeed, a number of clinical trials have demonstrated that viral vector based vaccines such as VSV-ZEBOV show great promise for inducing protective responses in humans. However, antigen delivery in the context of an unrelated virus renders this technology relatively complex in terms of manufacturing. Furthermore, the presence of immune targets other than the target antigen can lead to unfavorable effects such as pre-existing immunity hampering immune responses, as seen for Ad5 vectors, or the inability to use the same technology for repeated vaccinations. In addition, delivery of attenuated viral vectors raises safety concerns due to the risk of adverse events and residual viral replication upon delivery, as detected in a small number of subjects in a clinical trial testing VSV-ZEBOV. DNA based vaccines offer the advantage of allowing a relatively simple, fully synthetic production process. While the presence of non-functional sequences in original DNA vectors raised regulatory safety concerns, newer developments allow minimal constructs that exclusively encode for the target antigen. Several studies have demonstrated the safety of DNA vaccines for human use and clinical trials testing vaccines against influenza and Zika have furthermore highlighted the speed of vaccine development supported by this technology. However, the potential for long term persistence and genomic integration and the dependence on injection devices or electroporation represent some important disadvantages of this technology. Some, especially early, clinical studies testing DNA based vaccines have yielded somewhat discouraging results in terms of immunogenicity, while newer trials, such as studies testing DNA vaccines against Zika virus, have demonstrated that this technology is able to induce promising immune responses. Like DNA vaccines, RNA based vaccine technologies support a comparably simple, fully synthetic manufacturing process that allows production of different vaccines using the same established production process and facility. Their inability for genomic integration and lack of persistence in the cells of the vaccinee offers important advantages in terms of vaccine safety. However, since RNA vaccines represent the most recently developed technology described here, their use in humans is less well characterized than for viral vector or DNA based vaccines. Although further studies will be required to fully characterize this technology in humans, clinical studies conducted so far have yielded overall encouraging results in terms of safety and immunogenicity and provide support for further clinical exploration.","Our agent-based simulation framework, EnerPol, which accounts for 100% of the entire population of Switzerland, and that was applied to scenarios of influenza in Switzerland, 4 is used. EnerPol is a holistic agent-based model with choice models, where the agents adapt their behaviour through artificial intelligence as part of the solution. A schematic of EnerPol modules that are used for the agent-based simulation of epidemic spread is shown in Figure 1 . The mortality rate due to COVID-19 in multiple countries, including South Korea and Italy, has been shown to be strongly coupled to pre-existing conditions, specifically hypertension and heart disease, diabetics and lung disease. 8, 9 Given that the profile of chronic diseases in the Swiss population differs slightly from that in the South Korean population, 10,11 the mortality rates observed in the spread of COVID-19 in South Korea were linearly adjusted for the case of Switzerland.","Several computational, genome-based methods exist that allow to predict the host-range of a bacteriophage (a bacteriainfecting virus). A selection of composition-based and alignment-based approaches has been presented in an extensive review by Edwards et al. (2016) . Prediction of eukariotic host tropism (including humans) based on known protein sequences was shown for the influenza A virus (Eng et al., 2014) . Two recent studies employ k-mer based, k-NN classifiers and deep learning (Mock et al., 2019) to predict host range for a small set of three well-studied species directly from viral sequences. While those approaches are limited to those particular species and do not scale to viral host-range prediction in general, the Host Taxon Predictor (HTP) (Ga\u0142an et al., 2019) uses logistic regression and support vector machines to predict if a novel virus infects bacteria, plants, vertebrates or arthropods. Yet, the authors argue that it is not possible to use HTP in a read-based manner; it requires long sequences of at least 3,000 nucleotides. This is incompatible with modern metagenomic next-generation sequencing workflows, where the DNA reads obtained are at least 10-20 times shorter. Another study used gradient boosting machines to predict reservoir hosts and transmission via arthropod vectors for known human-infecting viruses (Babayan et al., 2018) . Zhang et al. (2019) designed several classifiers explicitly predicting whether a new virus can potentially infect humans. Their best model, a k-NN classifier, uses k-mer frequencies as features representing the query sequence and can yield predictions for sequences as short as 500 base pairs (bp). It worked also with 150bp-long reads from real DNA sequencing runs, although in this case the reads originated also from the viruses present in the training set (and were therefore not \"novel\").","We conclude that SWI is a well-balanced index that is derived from a simple sequence composition scoring method. To demonstrate the usefulness of SWI, we developed a web server called SoDoPE (Soluble Domain for Protein Expression; https://tisigner.com/sodope ). SoDoPE calculates the probability of solubility of a user-selected region based on SWI, which can either be a full-length or a partial sequence (see Methods and Supplementary  Table S8 ). This implementation is based on our observation that some protein domains tend to be more soluble than the others. To demonstrate this point, we have analysed three commercial monoclonal antibodies and the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus proteomes (SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2) (Wang et al. 2009; Marra et al. 2003; F. Wu et al. 2020) (Supplementary Fig S8 and S9 ). These soluble domains may enhance protein solubility as a whole. SoDoPE also provides options for solubility prediction at the presence of solubility fusion tags. Similarly, solubility tags may act as soluble 'protein domains' that can outweigh the aggregation propensity of insoluble proteins. However, some soluble fusion proteins may become insoluble after proteolytic cleavage of solubility tags (Lebendiker and Danieli 2014) . In addition, SoDoPE is integrated with TIsigner, a gene optimisation web service for protein expression. This pipeline provides a holistic approach to improve the outcome of recombinant protein expression.","Trends in Biotechnology Vol. 27 No.1 unwarranted response (and potentially panic) or a missed response (and a lost opportunity for intervention), which are unacceptable when dealing with deadly biological threats. For this reason, biodefence detection platforms strive to reach near perfect accuracies, which are comparable to, if not better than, the usual gold-standard assaystypically culture-based methods. With microarrays, redundancy can, however, be easily engineered into the system to improve accuracy and analytical power simply by over-representation.","Standard R 0 approach might provide more detailed scientific information, if the ''Susceptible-Infected-Removed (or SIR)\" model is tuned correctly. However, that would depend on many assumptions and much more detailed data, which might or might not be available. This present simple, direct, data driven transmission rate proposed here is intuitive, holistic and robust. Under uncertainty of different models, we prefer Ockham's Razor principle in model selection.","Both diseases had the advantage of occurring at a time when multiple platform technologies were existent.154 Many platforms could respond to a new pathogen after only minimal genetic modification. Experience has allowed more classical vaccines to also undergo rapid modification, although in some cases structural considerations (e.g., protein structure and antigen presentation) or unique adverse events (e.g., eosinophilc pulmonary inflammation induced by whole inactivated SARS virus vaccines at the time of viral challenge158) were required.","To address these issues, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) was launched in January 2017, bringing together funders including the Wellcome Trust, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, and the governments of Norway, Germany, Japan and others.50 The initial fund is $460 million, with the European Commission also pledging co-funding of \u20ac250 million and further funding due to be confirmed from the Government of India by the end of 2017. The fund will initially focus on the Nipah, Lassa and MERS viruses, aiming to bring two candidate vaccines through development against each disease. CEPI also aims to promote technical and institutional platforms to improve responsiveness to future epidemics. The approach undertaken by CEPI will advance vaccine development for diseases where research to date has been limited. This is in large part due to the lack of market potential for such vaccines in conjunction with the huge costs involved over a long period of time to provide a vaccine, from pre-clinical development through to licensure, estimated at upwards of $200 million to $500 million per vaccine.51 Therefore, the funding required to license a vaccine for each of the priority diseases highlighted by the WHO blueprint would run into many billions of dollars, and opportunities to assess the efficacy of these vaccines in humans would be rare.","Since RPA amplification reaction is initiated after adding MgOAc, 22 we are interested in knowing if the nucleic acid amplification was initiated at room temperature during sample preparation in our AIOD-CRISPR assay system. We prepared two AIOD-CRISPR solutions (one positive and one negative) and allowed them to remain at room temperature for 10 min. As shown in Figure S1 , no significant fluorescence change between positive and negative samples was observed in the AIOD-CRISPR solutions at room temperature. On the contrary, there was an obvious fluorescence increasing after just one-min incubation at 37\u00b0C ( Figure  S1 ). The fluorescence signal was eventually saturated at 15 min after incubated at 37\u00b0C. Therefore, our AIOD-CRISPR assay system is mainly triggered only after reaction temperature arrives at 37\u00b0C. Optimization of AIOD-CRISPR assay. Collateral cleavage of ssDNA-FQ reporter by the Cas12a is triggered by the binding of crRNA to target sites. 13, 14 Thus, we hypothesized that higher binding opportunities could increase the collateral cleavage activity and eventually improve the detection sensitivity for AIOD-CRISPR. To prove this, we introduced a pair of crRNAs to recognize the corresponding target sites. A pUCIDT-AMP plasmid containing 300 bp HIV-1 p24 gene cDNA (p24 plasmid) was used as the target and three different designs for primers and crRNAs were investigated (Figure 2A) . As shown in Figure 2B , AIOD-CRISPR with dual crRNAs (crRNA1+crRNA2) shows similar fluorescence curve as that with crRNA2, but was much better than using crRNA1 in real-time detection. Doubling the amount of crRNA1 or crRNA2 actually didn't benefit the detection efficiency. On detection sensitivity, Figure 2C shows that AIOD-CRISPR with dual crRNAs was able to detect as low as 1.2 copies of the p24 plasmid templates within 40 min, while AIOD-CRISPR with single crRNA2 doesn't detect it. Thus, introducing dual crRNAs is beneficial to improve the sensitivity of AIOD-CRISPR assay.","A large number of typing methods have been developed to assess strain relatedness for outbreak detection, surveillance, population structure and evolution studies. However, the unsatisfied need of combining high discriminatory power, accuracy, ease of use, low cost or speed drives a continuous search for new methodologies. Repetitive DNA motifs in bacterial genomes constitute important targets for microbial typing. In the first two talks of this session, characterization of the variability of the spacer content of the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) loci was presented as a valuable typing approach for two major human pathogens, S. enterica and group B Streptococcus (GBS). CRISPR loci, known to provide immunity against mobile genetic elements in some bacteria, consist of several noncontiguous direct repeats separated by stretches of variable sequences named spacers, and are often adjacent to cas (CRISPR-associated) genes, a set of conserved functional protein-coding genes [35] . Francois-Xavier Weill (Institut Pasteur, Paris, France) presented \"CRISPR markers for Salmonella epidemiology\" as a new method to perform real-time simultaneous typing and subtyping of all referred Salmonella isolates [10] . As already discussed, the current standard, serotyping, is laborious and has limitations in subtyping isolates from two highly prevalent serotypes, Typhimurium and Enteritidis. Spacer content was strongly correlated with both serotype and MLST. The study of 150 Typhimurium strains showed that spacer microevolution discriminated numerous subtypes within these prevalent serotypes. Further, a highthroughput assay for Typhimurium and its monophasic variant, the CRISPOL method, was developed based on spacer presence/absence using Luminex technology. CRISPOL is now routinely used and its database includes 450 types from 6000 isolates.","The advances of sequencing technology, nanotechnology, and bioinformatics have driven molecular tests including assays for emerging pathogens to be more comprehensive and precise. For example, the availability of various sequence databases permits quick identification of sequence identity and variations. For example, the HIV database http://www.hiv.lanl.gov/ contains data on HIV genetic sequences and drug resistance associated mutations. It is valuable for HIV epidemiological studies, research, development, and clinical validation studies of HIV clinical assays [38, 71] . It is well known that there are significant variations of clinical phenotypes in the presence of emerging infections ranging from asymptomatic carrier to lethal infection. Recently, assays to examine multiple pathogen panels have been developed [97\u00c0102], which should increase the diagnostic yield for many pathogens. A critical need for emerging pathogen analysis is quicker, easier, cost-effect assays that can be used in a point-of-care setting. New assays that are performed on platforms with a small footprint and detect pathogens quickly (in minutes instead of hours or days) have entered clinical use. For example, the FilmArray (BioFire Diagnostics, Inc.) and Simplexa (Focus Diagnostics, Inc.) molecular assays can generate results in approximately 60 min. The user-friendly Alere i (Alere Inc.) and Cobas Liat (Roche Molecular Systems) platforms are compact and portable, generate rapid molecular results in 15\u00c020 min, can use electricity or rechargeable battery, and therefore are completely mobile and suited for point-of-care testing. It is obvious that the current rapid development of new technologies will further enhance the utility of molecular diagnostics in various emerging infectious diseases.","Here we combined isothermal amplification with CRISPR-Cas12 DETECTR 121 technology to develop a rapid (~30 min) and low-cost test for detection of SARS-CoV-2 122","To elucidate the essential role of DHODH in the viral replication cycle, we generated a DHODH -/-A549 cell line by CRISPR-Cas9 gene knock-off (KO) technology (Fig. 4A) .","As highlighted by the Executive Director of the WHO Health Emergencies Programme, we are entering a new phase of high-impact epidemics where constant outbreaks are the new normal, and one should not expect their frequency to decrease. This increase \u2014 which is linked to rapid urbanization, population growth, global travel, deforestation, climate change and political instability \u2014 emphasizes the need to improve outbreak responses, and open sharing of information as early as possible is a vital part of this effort. Once the outbreak is contained, the sharing of information should extend to the approaches used and know-how gained in the response to empower other local communities, often in areas where public health and research infrastructure is lacking, to better prepare for future outbreaks.","Methods: Hodge test, DDS, SDS-PAGE, WGS along RNASeq were performed to get the holistic views on the changes of all alleles and their expression. We developed a K. pneumoniae network system (KlebsiellaNet) covering 88% of 5316 coding genes of Klebsiella pneumoniae HS11286 strain with 161,507 co-functional links. The putative candidate genes were shortlisted comparing the WGS, transcriptome analysis and the use of KlebsiellaNet. pUC-19 plasmid carrying zeocin marker was used for complementation of these genes into K2. Disk diffusion using meropenem and ertapenem was performed to check the diffusion pattern.","Utilizing publicly available data, a holistic bottom-up agent-based simulation of the current COVID-19 pandemic in Switzerland is presented as a reference case. The initiation, growth and containment of the COVID-19 spread in presented, and quantified in terms of the infected (symptomatic and asymptomatic), recovered and deaths. Using the same simulation tool, it is shown that without social adaptation and governmental intervention, an explosive spread of the COVID-19 virus would have resulted in an infection of 42.7% of the entire population by 25 April 2020; on the otherhand the government's timely intervention resulted in less than 1% of the population being infected for the examined time period. This shows that it is critical for goverments to step in, at an early stage to contain and manage pandemics and minimize mortality rates in the coming months. As restrictions become less prevelant, the infection rate and the associated mortality will undoubtedly increase.","Molecular approaches for microbial surveillance and discovery have emerged as a very promising alternative for early diagnosis of infectious diseases. Currently, molecular approaches include traditional Sanger DNA sequencing, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), oligonucleotide microarrays, and next generation sequencing (NGS). Among these four technologies, the former two can identify a few known pathogens that must then be confirmed individually, and thus cannot cover a wide range of pathogens. The latter two methods cover a broad range of pathogens, and are therefore suitable for identifying unknown or even novel pathogens in infectious outbreaks. Although NGS produces the most in-depth, unbiased information, and can reveal completely novel organisms, it is time-consuming and expensive, especially for the analysis of complex samples [6]. DeRisi and colleagues developed the first generation of microarray platform, called ViroChip, to detect a wide range of viruses [7]. In 2003, the ViroChip helped to characterize SARS as a novel Coronavirus[8]. Since then, ViroChip has also been used to detected a human metapneumovirus [9], a novel influenza virus [10], and a novel adenovirus [11]. More recently, GreeneChip and MDA microarrays have been developed, which are broader spectrum approaches that can detect several thousand pathogenic viruses, bacteria, fungi, and protozoa [12,13]. The aforementioned three platforms all used long oligonucleotide probes and random amplification of nucleic acids.","Both DNA based approaches for the development of an effective Zika vaccine appeared safe for human use and yielded promising results. Importantly, they were initiated within months after sequences became available, highlighting the versatility and speed provided by DNA vaccine platforms.","Our Series paper describes examples of recent and continuing challenges to control infectious diseases in the USA. We discuss vaccine-preventable diseases and the substantial successes and persistent challenges in their control; health-care-associated infections (HAIs), a leading preventable cause of death; emerging zoonotic and vector-borne diseases and their spread across a globalised world; foodborne infections, increasingly linked to new sources of contamination; and the intersecting epidemics of HIV, sexually transmitted infections (STIs), chronic viral hepatitis, and tuberculosis. Antimicrobial-resistant pathogens, several of which have become or are becoming resistant to all available drugs, are intensifying these threats. In addition to their eff ect \u2022 Despite major advances towards their control, infectious diseases continue to present substantial challenges to health and health-care resources in the USA \u2022 Priority actions to meet these challenges include addressing high-burden diseases such as HIV and chronic hepatitis, foodborne diseases, and health-care-associ ated infections; targeting outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases; and controlling endemic and emerging vector-borne and zoonotic infections \u2022 Antimicrobial resistance has become a global health crisis that demands new multidisciplinary approaches and collaborations across local, state, regional, national, and international levels \u2022 Rapidly evolving molecular technologies and increases in microbial understanding off er new opportunities for treatment, prevention, and control of infectious diseases \u2022 Ongoing enhancements in communication capacities, including social media, are bringing new techniques to monitor infectious diseases and rapidly share prevention information on human health, these diseases cause substantial health-care, workplace, and other societal costs. We discuss priority actions needed to meet these challenges including modernisation of existing surveillance systems to better inform public health action; enhancement of public health laboratories to incorporate the latest molecular technologies for improved disease detection and outbreak response; and strengthening of the clinical and public health interface to facilitate information exchange and leverage changes in health care to improve prevention and control of infectious diseases.","Given the rapid changes in technology as well as societal healthcare pressures due to the global pandemic, telemedicine should be the frontline triage for specialty surgery clinics. 18 The limitations for use, such as costs, training, or HIPPA related concerns, may limit the ability to rapidly upload and utilize these platforms for virtual visits, especially when faced with a rapidly progressing pandemic. 19 However, many of these can be circumvented or expedited in the current state of emergency. For example, during the H1N1 Pandemic, North et al. were able to use telephone screening triage to reduce unnecessary clinic visits yet preserve medical access. 20 In our specific ACS clinics pre-operative visits were stopped when the Pandemic was declared and the US was seeing increasing numbers. Post-operative patients still need to be evaluated and managed for many issues, such as drains, wounds, and suture removal.","Our work showcases the powerful role preprints can have during public health crises because of the timeliness with which they can disseminate new information. Furthermore, given that two of the preprints included in this analysis were later published in peer-reviewed outlets, the evidence shows that that even prestigious journals now permit the sharing of important findings before peer review and that the use of preprint platforms does not jeopardise future peerreviewed publication. 15, 16 Without question, primacy and peer-reviewed publications are key metrics in individual professional advancement (eg, academic promotion); nevertheless, the impact of preprints on discourse and decision making pertaining to the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak suggests that we must rethink how we reward and recognise community contributions during present and future public health crises."],"title":["All Hands on Deck: Transdisciplinary Approaches to Emerging
