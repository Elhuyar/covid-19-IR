It has been listed by the WHO and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) as an important target for vaccine development. While initially the majority of MERS cases were hospital acquired, continued emergence of MERS is attributed to community acquisition, with camels likely being the direct or indirect source. However, the majority of patients do not describe camel exposure, making the route of transmission unclear. Here, using sensitive immunological assays and a cohort of camel workers (CWs) with well-documented camel exposure, we show that approximately 50% of camel workers (CWs) in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) and 0% of controls were previously infected. We obtained blood samples from 30 camel herders, truck drivers, and handlers with well-documented camel exposure and from hea...","Abstract Medicine shortages have been spreading in European countries. In many cases, the unavailability of medicinal products has a substantial impact on the capability of National Healthcare Systems in ensuring the continuity of care. Shortages originate from multifactorial causes. In particular, they can be due to supply-related factors (e.g., manufacturing issues, regulatory issues, logistics, distribution) and demand-related ones (e.g., fluctuating drug demand, parallel market, tendering, price and reimbursement policies). However, some extraordinary geopolitical events (e.g., Brexit) may also affect medicines\u2019 availability. The capability of European Regulatory Authorities and other stakeholders, which are involved in the pharmaceutical distribution chain and the healthcare assistance services, to define suitable problem-solving strategies has been limited for years by the fragmentation of the European regulatory framework, starting from the lack of a univocal definition of a med...","Objective To provide an overview of supply and demand issues in the vaccine industry and the policy options that have been implemented to resolve these issues. Data sources Medline, Policy File, and International Pharmaceutical Abstracts were searched to locate academic journal articles. Other sources reviewed included texts on the topics of vaccine history and policy, government agency reports, and reports from independent think tanks. Keywords included vaccines, immunizations, supply, demand, and policy. Study selection Search criteria were limited to English language and human studies. Articles pertaining to vaccine demand, supply, and public policy were selected and reviewed for inclusion. Data extraction By the authors. Data synthesis Vaccines are biologic medications, therefore making their development and production more difficult and costly compared with \u201csmall-molecule\u201d drugs. Research and development costs for vaccines can exceed $800 million, and development may require 10 y...","Abstract Objective To provide a general description of the roles and contributions of three pharmacists from the Regulatory Affairs program (RA) at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) who are involved in emergency preparedness and response activities, including the 2009 pandemic influenza A (H1N1) public health emergency. Setting Atlanta, GA. Practice description RA consists of a staff of nine members, three of whom are pharmacists. The mission of RA is to support CDC's preparedness and emergency response activities and to ensure regulatory compliance for critical medical countermeasures against potential threats from natural, chemical, biological, radiological, or nuclear events. Conclusion RA was well involved in the response to the H1N1 outbreak through numerous activities, such as submitting multiple Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) requests to the Food and Drug Administration, including those for medical countermeasures to be deployed from the Strategic National ...","Abstract Individuals who visit community pharmacies are regarded as customers rather than patients. The public tends to view community pharmacists as businesspeople. Several factors influence individuals' willingness to patronize and to continue visiting such pharmacies. On the supply side, community pharmacists' responsibilities and duties center on the health and well-being of society. In this chapter, an assessment of community pharmacy practices in developing countries is particularly interesting in terms of medication dispensing and extended pharmacy services that promote public wellness. Community pharmacists in developing countries, who are supposedly strategically positioned in the community to provide public health, are not taking advantage on this opportunity. Although several studies have noted the services provided by community pharmacists, in general, the practice is far from meeting expectations due to several barriers. Pharmacists need to realize their opportunities and ...","Public health preparedness requires effective surveillance of and rapid response to infectious disease outbreaks. Inclusion of research activities within the outbreak setting provides important opportunities to maximize limited resources, to enhance gains in scientific knowledge, and ultimately to increase levels of preparedness. With rapid advances in laboratory technologies, banking and analysis of human genomic specimens can be conducted as part of public health investigations, enabling valuable research well into the future.","Abstract Using the complete genome sequences of 19 coronavirus genomes, we analyzed the codon usage bias, dinucleotide relative abundance and cytosine deamination in coronavirus genomes. Of the eight codons that contain CpG, six were markedly suppressed. The mean NNU/NNC ratio of the six amino acids using either NNC or NNU as codon is 3.262, suggesting cytosine deamination. Among the 16 dinucleotides, CpG was most markedly suppressed (mean relative abundance 0.509). No correlation was observed between CpG abundance and mean NNU/NNC ratio. Among the 19 coronaviruses, CoV-HKU1 showed the most extreme codon usage bias and extremely high NNU/NNC ratio of 8.835. Cytosine deamination and selection of CpG suppressed clones by the immune system are the two major independent biochemical and biological selective forces that shape codon usage bias in coronavirus genomes. The underlying mechanism for the extreme codon usage bias, cytosine deamination and G+C content in CoV-HKU1 warrants further st...","","Abstract There are many diseases for which a microbial aetiology is suspected. The hypothesis that a disease has an infectious cause is supported by: clinical features (similar to those of known infectious diseases, e.g. fever, leucocytosis), epidemiology (case clustering in time or location), histology (inflammation of affected tissues, e.g. granulomata) or characteristic microbial structures, treatment (clinical response to antimicrobial treatment), and prevention of disease by vaccines targeting microbial antigens. Proof that a microbe causes a disease requires more rigorous evidence. Future attempts to identify novel microbes associated with human disease may use sequence-based approaches. High-throughput sequencing may allow identification of unique microbial nucleic acid sequences in a background of host DNA. The complete sequencing of the human genome and multiple microbial genomes make this approach more feasible. DNA microarrays are also likely to be used in the search for nov...","The number of confirmed COVID-19 cases admitted in hospitals is continuously increasing in the Philippines. Frontline health care workers are faced with imminent risks of getting infected. In this study, we formulate a theoretical model to calculate the risk of being infected in health care facilities considering the following factors: the average number of encounters with a suspected COVID-19 patient per hour; interaction time for each encounter; work shift duration or exposure time; crowd density, which may depend on the amount of space available in a given location; and availability and effectiveness of protective gears and facilities provided for the frontline health care workers. Based on the simulation results, we recommend the following: (i) decrease the rate of patient encounter per frontline health care worker, e.g., maximum of three encounters per hour in a 12-hour work shift duration; (ii) decrease the interaction time between the frontline health care worker and the patient...","Abstract Arthroscopy, Arthroscopy Techniques, and Arthroscopy, Sports Medicine, and Rehabilitation will be in attendance in force at the 2020 Annual Meeting of the Arthroscopy Association of North America (AANA20). Program highlights and innovations include surgery simulcasts, \u201cGreat Debates,\u201d award-winning papers, Feature Lectures, and sessions glimpsing what is On the Horizon\u2014and perhaps over and beyond.","AbstractSince December 2019, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) emerged in Wuhan, Central China and rapidly spread throughout China. Up to March 3, 2020, SARS-CoV-2 has infected more than 89,000 people in China and other 66 countries across six continents. In this study, we used 10 new sequenced genomes of SARS-CoV-2 and combined 136 genomes from GISAID database to investigate the genetic variation and population demography through different analysis approaches (e.g. Network, EBSP, Mismatch, and neutrality tests). The results showed that 80 haplotypes had 183 substitution sites, including 27 parsimony-informative and 156 singletons. Sliding window analyses of genetic diversity suggested a certain mutations abundance in the genomes of SARS-CoV-2, which may be explaining the existing widespread and high adaptation of the deadly virus. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the view, pangolin acted as an intermediate host, may be controversial. The network indicated that, in the original hapl...","The main route of transmission of SARS CoV infection is presumed to be respiratory droplets. However the virus is also detectable in other body fluids and excreta. The stability of the virus at different temperatures and relative humidity on smooth surfaces were studied. The dried virus on smooth surfaces retained its viability for over 5 days at temperatures of 22\u201325\u00b0C and relative humidity of 40\u201350%, that is, typical air-conditioned environments. However, virus viability was rapidly lost (&gt;3 log(10)) at higher temperatures and higher relative humidity (e.g., 38\u00b0C, and relative humidity of &gt;95%). The better stability of SARS coronavirus at low temperature and low humidity environment may facilitate its transmission in community in subtropical area (such as Hong Kong) during the spring and in air-conditioned environments. It may also explain why some Asian countries in tropical area (such as Malaysia, Indonesia or Thailand) with high temperature and high relative humidity environment d...","Timely detection of novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection cases is crucial to interrupt the spread of this virus. We assessed the required expertise and capacity for molecular detection of 2019-nCoV in specialised laboratories in 30 European Union/European Economic Area (EU/EEA) countries. Thirty-eight laboratories in 24 EU/EEA countries had diagnostic tests available by 29 January 2020. A coverage of all EU/EEA countries was expected by mid-February. Availability of primers/probes, positive controls and personnel were main implementation barriers.","The past century witnessed a rapid development of respiratory medicine in China. The major burden of respiratory disease has shifted from infectious diseases to chronic noninfectious diseases. Great achievements have been made in improving the national standard of clinical management of various respiratory diseases and in smoking control. The specialty of respiratory medicine is expanding into pulmonary and critical care medicine. Nevertheless, respiratory diseases remain a major public health problem, with new challenges such as air pollution and nosocomial infections. This review describes the history, accomplishments, new challenges, and opportunities in respiratory medicine in China.","The World Health Organization currently recommends that governments scale up testing for COVID-19 infection. We performed health economic analyses projecting whether the additional costs from screening would be offset by the avoided costs with hospitalizations. We analysed Portuguese COVID-19 data up until the 22nd March 2020, and estimated the additional number of cases that would be detected if different testing rates and frequencies of positive results would have been observed. We projected that, in most scenarios, the costs with scaling up COVID-19 tests would be lower than savings with hospitalization costs, rendering large scale testing cost-saving.","","","Abstract It was widely believed in the late 1960s that infectious diseases had been conquered by vaccines and antibiotics and humans were no longer under threat by microbial pathogens. Yet, since that time more than 60 pathogens have been discovered that can cause serious emerging infectious diseases. Molecular methods have played critical roles in the discovery, monitoring, and clinical diagnostics of emerging pathogens. In this chapter, we present well-recognized emerging pathogens. We provide examples of the utility of molecular assays in research and clinical care of emerging infectious diseases. We also discuss some theoretical and practical limitations of molecular tests and the future prospects of expanding molecular diagnostics for emerging pathogens based on new advances of knowledge and technologies.","BACKGROUND: Strategies are urgently needed to mitigate the risk of zoonotic disease emergence in southern China, where pathogens with zoonotic potential are known to circulate in wild animal populations. However, the risk factors leading to emergence are poorly understood, which presents a challenge in developing appropriate mitigation strategies for local communities. METHODS: Residents in rural communities of Yunnan, Guangxi and Guangdong provinces were recruited and enrolled in this study. Data were collected through ethnographic interviews and field observations, and thematically coded and analysed to identify both risk and protective factors for zoonotic disease emergence at the individual, community and policy levels. RESULTS: Eighty-eight ethnographic interviews and 55 field observations were conducted at nine selected sites. Frequent human\u2013animal interactions and low levels of environmental biosecurity in local communities were identified as risks for zoonotic disease emergence...","BACKGROUND: Coronavirus can cross the species barrier and infect humans with a severe respiratory syndrome. SARS-CoV-2 with potential origin of bat is still circulating in China. In this study, a prediction model is proposed to evaluate the infection risk of non-human-origin coronavirus for early warning. METHODS: The spike protein sequences of 2666 coronaviruses were collected from 2019 Novel Coronavirus Resource (2019nCoVR) Database of China National Genomics Data Center on Jan 29, 2020. A total of 507 human-origin viruses were regarded as positive samples, whereas 2159 non-human-origin viruses were regarded as negative. To capture the key information of the spike protein, three feature encoding algorithms (amino acid composition, AAC; parallel correlation-based pseudo-amino-acid composition, PC-PseAAC and G-gap dipeptide composition, GGAP) were used to train 41 random forest models. The optimal feature with the best performance was identified by the multidimensional scaling method, ...","Viruses are evolving at an alarming rate, spreading and inconspicuously adapting to cutting-edge therapies. Therefore, the search for rapid, informative and reliable diagnostic methods is becoming urgent as ever. Conventional clinical tests (PCR, serology, etc.) are being continually optimized, yet provide very limited data. Could high throughput sequencing (HTS) become the future gold standard in molecular diagnostics of viral infections? Compared to conventional clinical tests, HTS is universal and more precise at profiling pathogens. Nevertheless, it has not yet been widely accepted as a diagnostic tool, owing primarily to its high cost and the complexity of sample preparation and data analysis. Those obstacles must be tackled to integrate HTS into daily clinical practice. For this, three objectives are to be achieved: (1) designing and assessing universal protocols for library preparation, (2) assembling purpose-specific pipelines, and (3) building computational infrastructure to s...","The ongoing Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak, originated in the end of 2019 in Wuhan, China, has claimed more than 2200 lives and posed a huge threat to global public health. The Chinese government has implemented control measures including setting up special hospitals and travel restriction to mitigate the spread. We propose conceptual models for the outbreak in Wuhan with the consideration of individual behavioural reaction and governmental actions, e.g., holiday extension, travel restriction, hospitalisation and quarantine. We employed the estimates of these two key components from the 1918 influenza pandemic in London, United Kingdom, incorporated zoonotic introductions and the emigration, then computed future trends and the reporting ratio. The model is concise in structure, and it successfully captures the course of the COVID-19 outbreak, and thus sheds light on understanding the trends of the outbreak.","Abstract The development of rapid, accurate, and sensitive diagnostic methods for detecting pathogens is the basis for treating, controlling, and eradicating infectious diseases of veterinary importance. Scientific and technological advancements have revolutionized the field of veterinary diagnostics. Genome sequencing has allowed efficient, sensitive, and specific diagnostic assays to be developed based on the detection of nucleic acids. The integration of advances in biochemistry, proteomics, engineering, and medicine offers enormous potential for the rapid and accurate diagnosis of viral, microbial, genetic, and metabolic disease. In the future, polymerase chain reaction assays, microarray testing, genomic analysis, and metabolic profiling will be accomplished in a rapid, portable, sensitive, and cost-efficient manner.","Extrapolation from recent disease history suggests that changes in the global environment, including virus, vector and human behavior, will continue to influence the spectrum of viruses to which humans are exposed. In this article, these environmental changes will be enumerated, and their potential impact on target-focused, nucleic acid-based diagnostic tests will be considered, followed by a presentation of some emerging technological responses.","","Summary Globalisation and its effect on human development has rendered an environment that is conducive for the rapid international spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), and other new infectious diseases yet to emerge. After the unprecedented multi-country outbreak of avian influenza with human cases in the winter of 2003\u20132004, an influenza pandemic is a current threat. A critical review of problems and solutions encountered during the 2003\u20132004 SARS epidemics will serve as the basis for considering national preparedness steps that can be taken to facilitate the early detection of avian influenza, and a rapid response to an influenza pandemic should it occur.","Social distancing is an effective way to contain the spread of a contagious disease, particularly when pharmacological interventions are not available. Conventional wisdom suggests that social distancing measures should be introduced as soon as possible after the beginning of an outbreak. Using a simple epidemiological model we show, however, that there is in fact an optimal time to initiate a temporal social distancing intervention if the goal is to reduce the final epidemic size or flatten the epidemic curve. The optimal timing depends strongly on the effective reproduction number (R0) of the disease, such that as the R0 increases, the optimal time decreases non-linearly. Additionally, if pharmacological interventions (e.g., a vaccine) become available at some point during the epidemic, the sooner these interventions become available the sooner social distancing should be initiated to maximize its effectiveness. Although based on a simple model, we hope that these insights inspire fu...","Exotic and emerging viral pathogens associated with high morbidity and mortality in humans are being identified annually with recent examples including Lujo virus in southern Africa, Severe Fever with Thrombocytopenia Syndrome virus in China and a SARS-like coronavirus in the Middle East. The sporadic nature of these infections hampers our understanding of these diseases and limits the opportunities to design appropriate medical countermeasures against them. Because of this, animal models are utilized to gain insight into the pathogenesis of disease with the overall goal of identifying potential targets for intervention and evaluating specific therapeutics and vaccines. For these reasons it is imperative that animal models of disease recapitulate the human condition as closely as possible in order to provide the best predictive data with respect to the potential efficacy in humans. In this article we review the current status of disease models for highly pathogenic and emerging viral p...","Many coronaviruses are capable of interspecies transmission. Some of them have caused worldwide panic as emerging human pathogens in recent years, e.g., severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). In order to assess their threat to humans, we explored to infer the potential hosts of coronaviruses using a dual-model approach based on nineteen parameters computed from spike genes of coronaviruses. Both the support vector machine (SVM) model and the Mahalanobis distance (MD) discriminant model achieved high accuracies in leave-one-out cross-validation of training data consisting of 730 representative coronaviruses (99.86% and 98.08% respectively). Predictions on 47 additional coronaviruses precisely conformed to conclusions or speculations by other researchers. Our approach is implemented as a web server that can be accessed at http://bioinfo.ihb.ac.cn/seq2hosts.","Abstract On the Internet, there is a lot of open access information related to infectious diseases, e.g., official announcement, media news, bulletin boards, blogs, and other social media. If proper data retrieval and screening methods were applied on these Internet-based data, it would be very useful to improve the timeliness of early detection for infectious diseases. In China, we practice early warning using Internet-based data with routine intelligence screening assessment every day, and respond to any unusual event in a timely manner. Through this mechanism, the surveillance and early warning of Internet-based data for infectious disease and public health emergency plays an important supplemental role to the traditional surveillance systems.","Abstract This review is concerned with what has been learned about feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) diagnostics and therapeutics since the publication of an extensive overview of literature covering the period 1963\u20132009. Although progress has been made in both areas, obtaining a definitive diagnosis of FIP remains a problem for those veterinarians and/or cat owners who require absolute certainty. This review will cover both indirect and direct diagnostic tests for the disease and will emphasize their limitations, as well as their specificity and sensitivity. There is still no effective treatment for FIP, although there are both claims that such therapies exist and glimmers of hope coming from new therapies that are under research. FIP has also been identified in wild felids and FIP-like disease is now a growing problem among pet ferrets.","","Abstract A recombinant transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus (rTGEV) in which E gene was deleted (rTGEV-\u0394E) has been engineered. This deletion mutant only grows in cells expressing E protein (E+ cells) indicating that E was an essential gene for TGEV replication. Electron microscopy studies of rTGEV-\u0394E infected BHK-pAPN-E\u2212 cells showed that only immature intracellular virions were assembled. These virions were non-infectious and not secreted to the extracellular medium in BHK-pAPN-E\u2212 cells. RNA and protein composition analysis by RNase-gold and immunoelectron microscopy showed that rTGEV-\u0394E virions contained RNA and also all the structural TGEV proteins, except the deleted E protein. Nevertheless, full virion maturation was blocked. Studies of the rTGEV-\u0394E subcellular localization by confocal and immunoelectron microscopy in infected E\u2212 cells showed that in the absence of E protein virus trafficking was arrested in the intermediate compartment. Therefore, the absence of E protein i...","Over the past several decades, we have witnessed the emergence of many new infectious agents, some of which are major public threats. New and emerging infectious diseases which are both transmissible from patient-to-patient and virulent with a high mortality include novel coronaviruses (SARS-CoV, MERS-CV), hemorrhagic fever viruses (Lassa, Ebola), and highly pathogenic avian influenza A viruses, A(H5N1) and A(H7N9). All healthcare facilities need to have policies and plans in place for early identification of patients with a highly communicable diseases which are highly virulent, ability to immediately isolate such patients, and provide proper management (e.g., training and availability of personal protective equipment) to prevent transmission to healthcare personnel, other patients and visitors to the healthcare facility.","The recent outbreak of COVID-19 in Mainland China is characterized by a distinctive algebraic, sub-exponential increase of confirmed cases with time during the early phase of the epidemic, contrasting an initial exponential growth expected for an unconstrained outbreak with sufficiently large reproduction rate. Although case counts vary significantly between affected provinces in Mainland China, the scaling law t^\u03bc is surprisingly universal, with a range of exponents \u03bc = 2.1 \u00b1 0.3. The universality of this behavior indicates that, in spite of social, regional, demographical, geographical, and socio-economical heterogeneities of affected Chinese provinces, this outbreak is dominated by fundamental mechanisms that are not captured by standard epidemiological models. We show that the observed scaling law is a direct consequence of containment policies that effectively deplete the susceptible population. To this end we introduce a parsimonious model that captures both, quarantine of sympto...","Abstract Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) is caused by a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV). Coronaviruses including SARS-CoV encode an envelope (E) protein, a small, hydrophobic membrane protein. We report that, in planar lipid bilayers, synthetic peptides corresponding to the SARS-CoV E protein forms ion channels that are more permeable to monovalent cations than to monovalent anions. Affinity-purified polyclonal antibodies recognizing the N-terminal 19 residues of SARS-CoV E protein were used to establish the specificity of channel formation by inhibiting the ion currents generated in the presence of the E protein peptides.","AbstractThe present outbreak of lower respiratory tract infections, including respiratory distress syndrome, is the third spillover, in only two decades, of an animal coronavirus to humans resulting in a major epidemic. Here, the Coronavirus Study Group (CSG) of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses, which is responsible for developing the official classification of viruses and taxa naming (taxonomy) of the Coronaviridae family, assessed the novelty of the human pathogen tentatively named 2019-nCoV. Based on phylogeny, taxonomy and established practice, the CSG formally recognizes this virus as a sister to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronaviruses (SARS-CoVs) of the species Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus and designates it as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). To facilitate communication, the CSG further proposes to use the following naming convention for individual isolates: SARS-CoV-2/Isolate/Host/Date/Location. The ...","Summary Objectives To assess associations between the functional polymorphisms G-2518A at the chemokine (C\u2013C motif) ligand 2 gene (CCL2) and mannose binding lectin (MBL) codon 54 variant (A/B) and susceptibility to SARS. Methods We genotyped the CCL2 G-2518A and MBL codon 54 variant (A/B) in 4 case\u2013control populations of Chinese descent, totally consisting of 932 patients with SARS and 982 control subjects. Results Both the high-CCL2-producing GG genotype and the low-MBL-producing B allele were consistently associated with increased risks of SARS-CoV infection in all 4 case\u2013control populations (joint P = 1.6 \u00d7 10\u22124 and 4.9 \u00d7 10\u22128, for CCL2 and MBL respectively), with no interaction between polymorphisms could be detected. Furthermore, all the 4 case\u2013control studies demonstrated a cumulative effect on risk of SARS-CoV infection for the combination of polymorphisms (joint P = 1.3 \u00d7 10\u221210). However, tests using the area under the curve (AUC) indicated that at this stage, the polymorphisms...","Summary The novel severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus caused severe disease and heavy economic losses before apparently coming under complete control. Our understanding of the forces driving seasonal disappearance and recurrence of infectious diseases remains fragmentary, thus limiting any predictions about whether, or when, SARS will recur. It is true that most established respiratory pathogens of human beings recur in wintertime, but a new appreciation for the high burden of disease in tropical areas reinforces questions about explanations resting solely on cold air or low humidity. Seasonal variation in host physiology may also contribute. Newly emergent zoonotic diseases such as ebola or pandemic strains of influenza have recurred in unpredictable patterns. Most established coronaviruses exhibit winter seasonality, with a unique ability to establish persistent infections in a minority of infected animals. Because SARS coronavirus RNA can be detected in the stool of...","As the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is rapidly progressing, the need for the development of an effective vaccine is critical. A promising approach for vaccine development is to generate, through codon pair deoptimization, an attenuated virus. This approach carries the advantage that it only requires limited knowledge specific to the virus in question, other than its genome sequence. Therefore, it is well suited for emerging viruses for which we may not have extensive data. We performed comprehensive in silico analyses of several features of SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequence (e.g., codon usage, codon pair usage, dinucleotide/junction dinucleotide usage, RNA structure around the frameshift region) in comparison with other members of the coronaviridae family of viruses, the overall human genome, and the transcriptome of specific human tissues such as lung, which are primarily targeted by the virus. Our analysis identified the spike (S) and nucleocapsid (N) proteins as promising targets for deoptimizatio...","Abstract Previous studies with calves and other species have provided evidence that blood serum-derived proteins and fructooligosaccharides (FOS) may benefit intestinal health. We assessed the effects of supplementing products containing serum proteins as a component of arrival fluid support or serum proteins plus FOS (in addition to additional solids, minerals, and vitamins) in an early life dietary supplement on performance, morbidity, and mortality of stressed (transport, cold) male calves. Male Holstein calves (n=93) &lt;1 wk old were stratified by arrival body weight (BW) and plasma protein concentration, and then randomly assigned to 1 of 4 treatment groups in a 2\u00d72 factorial arrangement of one-time administration of fluid support [either control electrolyte solution (E) or the serum protein-containing arrival formula (AF)] and 14d of either no supplementation (NG) or supplementation with Gammulin (G; APC Inc., Ankeny, IA), which contains serum proteins and FOS in addition to other ...","Fifteen years ago, United Nations world leaders defined millenium development goal 4 (MDG 4): to reduce under-5-year mortality rates by two-thirds by the year 2015. Unfortunately, only 27 of 138 developing countries are expected to achieve MDG 4. The majority of childhood deaths in these settings result from reversible causes, and developing effective pediatric emergency and critical care services could substantially reduce this mortality. The Ebola outbreak highlighted the fragility of health care systems in resource-limited settings and emphasized the urgent need for a paradigm shift in the global approach to healthcare delivery related to critical illness. This review provides an overview of pediatric critical care in resource-limited settings and outlines strategies to address challenges specific to these areas. Implementation of these tools has the potential to move us toward delivery of an adequate standard of critical care for all children globally, and ultimately decrease globa...","The present outbreak of a coronavirus-associated acute respiratory disease called coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) is the third documented spillover of an animal coronavirus to humans in only two decades that has resulted in a major epidemic. The Coronaviridae Study Group (CSG) of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses, which is responsible for developing the classification of viruses and taxon nomenclature of the family Coronaviridae, has assessed the placement of the human pathogen, tentatively named 2019-nCoV, within the Coronaviridae. Based on phylogeny, taxonomy and established practice, the CSG recognizes this virus as forming a sister clade to the prototype human and bat severe acute respiratory syndrome coronaviruses (SARS-CoVs) of the species Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus, and designates it as SARS-CoV-2. In order to facilitate communication, the CSG proposes to use the following naming convention for individual isolates: SARS-CoV-2/host/lo...","Abstract The Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is a newly identified pathogen able of human transmission that causes a mortality of almost 40%. As in the case of SARS-CoV, MERS virus lacking E protein represents a potential vaccine. In both cases, abolishment of channel activity may be a contributor to the attenuation observed in E-deleted viruses. Herein, we report that purified MERS-CoV E protein, like SARS-CoV E protein, is almost fully \u03b1-helical, has a single \u03b1-helical transmembrane domain, and forms pentameric ion channels in lipid bilayers. Based on these similarities, and the proposed involvement of channel activity as virulence factor in SARS-CoV E protein, MERS-CoV E protein may constitute a potential drug target.","While coronaviruses were first identified nearly 60 years ago, they received notoriety in 2003 when one of their members was identified as the etiological agent of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV) 1. Previously these viruses were known to be important agents of respiratory and enteric infections of domestic and companion animals and to cause approximately 15% of all cases of the common cold. This Review focuses on recent advances in our understanding of the mechanisms of coronavirus replication, interactions with the host immune response and disease pathogenesis and highlights the recent identification of numerous novel coronaviruses and the propensity of this virus family to cross species barriers.","","","Abstract Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is caused by a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV). Future research on the molecular virology of SARS-CoV will be important in the understanding of the epidemiology and the natural history of SARS. This will also facilitate the development of sensitive and accurate diagnostic tests, as well as vaccination and other therapeutics to combat SARS.","Ginkgolic acids (GA) are alkylphenol constituents of the leaves and fruits of Ginkgo biloba. GA has shown pleiotropic effects in vitro, including: antitumor effects through inhibition of lipogenesis; decreased expression of invasion associated proteins through AMPK activation; and potential rescue of amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) induced synaptic impairment. GA was also reported to have activity against Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus. Several mechanisms for this activity have been suggested including: SUMOylation inhibition; blocking formation of the E1-SUMO intermediate; inhibition of fatty acid synthase; non-specific SIRT inhibition; and activation of protein phosphatase type-2C. Here we report that GA inhibits Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) by inhibition of both fusion and viral protein synthesis. Additionally, we report that GA inhibits human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) genome replication and Zika virus (ZIKV) infection of normal human astrocytes (NHA).

The fund will initially focus on the Nipah, Lassa and MERS viruses, aiming to bring two candidate vaccines through development against each disease. CEPI also aims to promote technical and institutional platforms to improve responsiveness to future epidemics. The approach undertaken by CEPI will advance vaccine development for diseases where research to date has been limited. This is in large part due to the lack of market potential for such vaccines in conjunction with the huge costs involved over a long period of time to provide a vaccine, from pre-clinical development through to licensure, estimated at upwards of $200 million to $500 million per vaccine.51 Therefore, the funding required to license a vaccine for each of the priority diseases highlighted by the WHO blueprint would run into many billions of dollars, and opportunities to assess the efficacy of these vaccines in humans would be rare.","Scientists of Rocky Mountain Laboratories are collaborating with Oxford University to develop a chimpanzee adenovirus-vectored COVID-19 vaccine candidate.35 The Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) recently announced the initiation of three programs aimed to develop COVID-19 vaccines by utilizing established vaccine platforms.36 Among the three programs, two are continuations of previously initiated partnerships. CEPI collaborated with Inovio in 2018 to developing DNA vaccine candidates for MERS ($56 M funding). The vaccine in development utilizes DNA Medicines\u2019 platform for delivering synthetic genes into cells for translation into antigenic proteins, which elicit T-cell and antibody responses. CEPI has collaborated with The University of Queensland in 2019 to develop the molecular clamp vaccine platform against multiple viral pathogens including MERS-CoV ($10 M funding). The vaccine platform functions by synthesizing viral surface proteins that get attached to the host cells and clamp them into shape. This facilitates easier recognition of antigens by the immune system.36 Other than these ongoing programs, CEPI has announced funding to Moderna for comparing mRNA therapeutics and vaccines. They will design and manufacture an mRNA vaccine in collaboration with the Vaccine Research Center (VRC) of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), a part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH).37 NIAID-VRC scientists are developing a vaccine candidate expressing SARS-CoV-2 S protein in the mRNA vaccine platform technology. This vaccine is expected to undergo clinical testing in the coming months.35","Work on vaccines is also well underway, although it is unlikely that a vaccine will be available for at least 18 months. The Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness and Innovations (CEPI) is currently funding four vaccine initiatives in collaboration with the WHO. One of these is at The University of Queensland where Prof Paul Young, and Drs Keith Chappell and Dan Watterson are using their novel and exciting \u2018molecular clamp\u2019 technology to develop a vaccine. This work is being carried out in collaboration with CSIRO\u2019s vaccine manufacturing plant in Clayton, and also partly funded by CSL Ltd. This Australian collaboration is hoping to have the vaccine ready for use before the end of 2021.","In this study, we examine the economic feasibility of developing and supporting a portfolio of vaccines for the world's most threatening emerging infectious diseases (EIDs) as determined by scientific experts, drawing from the list of targets made by the recently launched global initiative, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) (1) (2) (3) . Our portfolio is composed of the 141 preclinical assets identified by Gouglas et al. to be targeting the priority diseases.","Accordingly, on 13 January 2020, the Vaccine Research Center of the US National Institutes of Health communicated the 2019-nCoV viral sequence to collaborators at Moderna, which has initiated good-manufacturing-practice production of an mRNA vaccine targeting the viral spike glycoprotein. The hope is to launch a phase 1 clinical trial in healthy people within three months. Initial phylogenetic analysis of 2019-nCoV sequences suggests there is little diversity\u2014indicative of limited evolution\u2014among viral isolates, which would be a potential boon to broad dissemination of a protective vaccine (http://virological.org/t/preliminary-phylogenetic-analysis-of-11-ncov2019-genomes-2020-01-19/329). On 23 January 2020, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations announced funding for Inovio Pharmaceuticals and the University of Queensland to leverage their existing platforms from MERS vaccine efforts, and separately to Moderna for its mRNA platform, to help accelerate clinical testing of a vaccine against 2019-nCoV.","One of the critical lessons from the SARS experience was the absolute necessity to be able to coordinate the international resources that are available in an outbreak and to get them focussed on identifying priorities and solving problems. The WHO established the means to do this for SARS and it has since been further developed and integrated into global preparedness, especially after the West Africa Ebola epidemic. Organisations such as the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN), the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), the Global Research Collaboration For Infectious Disease Preparedness (GloPID-R) and the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID) have been supported by the WHO Research Blueprint and its Global Coordinating Mechanism to provide a forum where those with the expertise and capacity to contribute to managing new threats can come together both between and during outbreaks to develop innovative solutions to emerging problems. This global coordination has been active in the novel coronavirus outbreak. WHO's response system includes three virtual groups based on those developed for SARS to collate real time information to inform real time guidelines, and a first candidate vaccine is ready for laboratory testing within 4 weeks of the virus being identified.","Efforts to meet these challenges are made by monitoring viruses with high pandemic potential and programs, most notably Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), that finances and develops vaccines against likely pandemic threats.","Research on MERS-CoV vaccine candidates is ongoing, and at least one candidate vaccine has now progressed to a Phase I human clinical trial (Modjarrad 2016, CEPI 2017). In a promising development, the recently launched Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) has listed MERS vaccine as one of its initial targets.","Different approaches are adopted by various research teams and companies for fighting against COVID-19. Vaccination, as a tremendously successful strategy in medical history, is certainly among the fields of research. The first batch of mRNA-1273, an mRNA (messenger RNA) vaccine developed by Moderna Therapeutics with funds from the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), is produced very recently and sent to the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) for human testing planned to start in April. Novavax Company has started a preclinical study in animal models testing several vaccine candidates for COVID-19. These vaccines contain antigens from the coronavirus spike (S) protein based on the company\u2019s recombinant protein nanoparticle technology platform.","The current response to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic involves aggressive implementation of suppression strategies, such as case identification, quarantine and isolation, contact tracing, and social distancing. However, models developed by the Imperial College COVID-19 Response Team suggest that \"transmission will quickly rebound if interventions are relaxed\". 1 WHO warns of multiple simultaneous outbreaks of COVID-19 worldwide. 2 The development of COVID-19 vaccines that can be used globally is therefore a priority for ending the pandemic. This vaccine effort should be guided by three imperatives: speed, manufacture and deployment at scale, and global access. In February, 2020, the World Bank and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), which funds development of epidemic vaccines, co-hosted a global consultation on these goals. 3 This consultation led to the launch of a COVID-19 Vaccine Development Taskforce that is now working on how to finance and manufacture vaccines for global access.","Vaccines against the 2019-nCoV are currently in development and none are in testing (at the time of writing). On 23 January 2020, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) announced that they will fund vaccine development programmes with Inovio, The University of Queensland and Moderna, Inc respectively, with the aim to test the experimental vaccines clinically in 16 weeks (By June 2020). The vaccine candidates will be developed by the DNA, recombinant and mRNA vaccine platforms from these organizations [109] .","With the emergence of 2019-nCoV, there are about 15 potential vaccine candidates in the pipeline globally (Table 3 ), in which a wide range of technology (such as messenger RNA, DNA-based, nanoparticle, synthetic and modified virus-like particle) was applied. It will likely take about a year for most candidates to start phase 1 clinical trials except for those funded by Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI). However, the kit developed by the BGI have passed emergency approval procedure of the National Medical Products Administration, and are currently used in clinical and surveillance centers of China [40] .","The potential advantages of an mRNA approach to prophylactic vaccines include the ability to mimic natural infection to stimulate a more potent immune response as well as the ability to combine multiple mRNAs into a single vaccine. Patent application WO2017070626 by Moderna discloses mRNA vaccines composed of mRNAs encoding antigenic viral full-length S, S1, or S2 proteins from SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV virus, formulated in cationic lipid nanoparticles. They show that mice vaccinated with mRNA encoding coronavirus full-length S protein generated much higher neutralizing antibody titers compared to mRNA encoding the S protein S2 subunit. New Zealand white rabbits immunized with MERS-CoV mRNA vaccine encoding the full-length S protein reduced more than 90% of the viral load in the lungs of the rabbits and induced a significant amount of neutralizing antibody against MERS-CoV. Moderna announced on February 24, 202055 that it has released the first batch of mRNA-1273 against SARS-CoV-2 for use in humans, prepared using methods and strategies outlined in their previous patents. Vials of mRNA-1273 have been shipped to the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), a division of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), to be used in the planned Phase 1 study in the United States. Moderna reports that mRNA-1273 is an mRNA vaccine targeting a prefusion-stabilized form of the S protein associated with SARS-CoV-2, which was selected by Moderna in collaboration with investigators at the NIAID Vaccine Research Center. Manufacture of this batch was funded by the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations.","A vaccine is being developed by the National Institutes for Health in the USA and by other companies. A MERS CoV vaccine has been developed(2) and is a high priority for the WHO and Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Initiatives. Whether the MERS vaccine has cross protection against 2019nCoV is unknown.","Data used in this study were obtained from CORD-19, which was prepared by the White House and a coalition of leading research groups in response to the COVID-19 pandemic [19] . contains all research about COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, and other CoVs (e.g. SARS, MERS, etc.) up to March 20, 2020, including over 44,000 scholarly articles, from the following sources: 1)","While single-discipline projects still dominate infectious disease research, this paradigm is changing due to increased perception by funding agencies that multi-, inter-, and transdisciplinary research will lead to bigger breakthroughs (Colwell, 1998; Zerhouni, 2003). Scientific and technical innovations in low-cost diagnostics, GIS, multivariate statistical analysis, mathematical modeling, and database management are creating opportunities to integrate previously disparate types of data. The emerging \u201cOne Health\u201d perspective\u2014linking human, wildlife, and ecosystem health\u2014provides a platform for collaborative approaches to infectious disease research, particularly in the case of zoonoses (Daszak et al., 2000; Aguirre et al., 2002; Wilcox and Aguirre, 2004).","Compared to the earlier epidemics by CoVs, COVID-19 is highly contagious and has been reported with more than 400,000 confirmed cases as on March 25, 2020 [7] . Given the spread of the new CoV and its impacts on human health, governments are facing increasing pressure to stop the COVID-19 pandemic. The White House and a coalition of leading research groups have prepared a COVID-19 Open Research Dataset (CORD-19) and issued a call to action to the world's artificial intelligence experts to support the ongoing fight against this infectious disease.","The first challenge is that incentives across the analytical pipeline are misaligned. 2 Academics are largely incentivised to write scientific articles and to fund their work through individually led grants. These activities are not conducive to the rapid response to a crisis (although many academics do respond), or to sustained engagement and training of corporate and government teams. Companies are incentivised by profit, and are rightly beholden to national regulatory frameworks and the public with respect to the data they collect. Ministries of health have complex relationships with both the companies that have access to personal data and with the public. They face many competing health priorities and complex political choices when it comes to open sharing of epidemiological data. Disease control programmes are often hampered by limited capacity and high turnover of personnel, and health workers on the ground during an epidemic have their hands full responding to the immediate crisis and might not be trained or incentivised to report epidemiological data accurately. Taken together, these incentive structures create multiple barriers to rapid data generation and the development of streamlined epidemic forecasting systems that use these new data types.","In fact, the cost COVID-19 tests is expected to vary, as companies are quickly bringing to the market new technologies that promise automated processing and faster response rates. Of note, we are only considering molecular tests, and not serological ones, which, being cheaper, are not currently considered adequate for diagnostic purposes. Value of diagnostics usually encompasses turnover time, and both regulators and industry promoters are addressing this topic as well [7] . Therefore, test prices will likely be pressured downwards, mirroring more offer coming into the market and the regulatory pathways that support this rapid market","We briefly described only selected examples of low-incidence, high-consequence pathogens. Many other similar infectious diseases with relatively low incidence but high-rates of death occur in many parts of the world. Besides those mentioned above, other low-incidence, high-consequence pathogens described in this issue of Emerging Infectious Diseases include Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever and Rift Valley fever. Ongoing surveillance and public health research of high-consequence pathogens are critical for identifying their natural reservoirs, developing diagnostic tests, and devising appropriate control and prevention measures. Studying the molecular characteristics of these pathogens is critical to understanding their pathogenesis and ultimately to developing vaccines and antimicrobial drugs. Despite low incidence of these diseases, maintaining a preparedness posture to tackle the challenges posed by the emergence or reemergence of some of these pathogens should remain a priority. Public health resources are wisely spent by adequately preparing for the inevitable emergence or reemergence of infectious diseases that might currently be of low incidence but have the potential to spread to immunologically naive populations. The application of the age-old tools of pathology bolstered with a wide array of bioassays, developed by using modern advances in molecular diagnostics, has helped CDC tackle old infectious disease challenges and newly emerging and reemerging diseases. Advanced molecular detection approaches in concert with infectious disease pathology can play a prominent role in emergency preparedness and in addressing the public health challenges of the future.","Real-time molecular techniques are now the reference methods for the direct diagnosis of pathogens. Increasingly, automation has developed in order to reduce the number of steps prone to human errors, and now the tendency is towards random access tests where all steps are automated until biological validation. However, this approach, developed by diagnostics companies such as Hologic, Roche, Abbott, Cepheid, BioMerieux among others, focus on marketable tests meaning that a certain amount of assays has to be expected in the business plan before such assays are developed. Commercially developed assays need to be registered by regulation agencies before they are available on the market; in many cases, this leads to delays that are not compatible with preparedness and response activities, as witnessed by the current situation with the novel coronavirus. Moreover, often the development and licensing of a novel assay is conditioned by the size and volume of anticipated future market which is not necessarily considered as profitable. Lastly, the price for such assay is almost always not compatible with daily use in laboratories of developing countries.","By the following month, the UK's Coalition Government was embracing its role as the leading bilateral donor in Sierra Leone and wanted to raise awareness and funds from other governments and foundations. A high level conference: Defeating Ebola in Sierra Leone, had been quickly organised, in partnership with the Sierra Leone Government, at which an international call for assistance was issued (DFID, 2014) . It was shortly after this that the CMO, at the behest of the Government's Cabinet Office Briefing Room (COBRA), formed the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies on Ebola (SAGE). By its first meeting on the October 16, 2014, British troops were on the ground along with volunteers from the UK National Health Service (NHS) (STC, 2016). Leach was pulled into this group along with most of the members of ESARG that had met the previous month. It was decided in this initial meeting to set up a social science sub-group including Whitty, Leach and the entire steering group of the newly established ERAP (SAGE, 2014a). This included not just British-based anthropologists but also Paul Richards and Esther Mokuwa from Njala University, Sierra Leone. From this point anthropologists appeared plugged into the Government's architecture for guiding their response.","17 years later, we can draw upon the lessons learnt from SARS. The global community is much better prepared now, with many capacitybuilding initiatives including those under the WHO's International Health Regulations (2005). Indeed, the time interval from the first case description to the virus sequencing and the availability of diagnostic assays was much faster for COVID19 than for SARS, and diagnostic tests were available globally within 2 weeks of reports of cases from China. Organisations such as the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, and the Global Research Collaboration For Infectious Disease Preparedness, supported by the WHO Research Blueprint and its Global Coordinating Mechanism, were able to accelerate the outbreak response and rapidly initiate technical platforms for the development of vaccines and therapeutics. 29 Standardised data collection tools were distributed and used within a matter of weeks, and the first clinical trials for therapeutic interventions was initiated in January. 30 China has higher medical standards, a better educated healthcare workforce, and more technical and scientific expertise now than in 2003. China's current response contains much more transparency and decisive action, which was initiated much earlier in the current outbreak than in the 2003 outbreak. 31 So why have the case numbers of COVID19 already surpassed those of SARS by Jan 30, 2020? There are several explanations. First, the situation is different. Wuhan, the epicentre of COVID19, combines multiple elements that make containment challenging. As the largest city (&gt;11 million) in central China, Wuhan is a major transport hub and centre for industry and commerce, home to the largest train station, biggest airport, and largest deepwater port in central China. 32 China's outward travel has more than doubled in the past decade, and its urban population densities possibly even tripled. The proximity of people in residential housing, during commute, and in work environments in a megacity such as Wuhan amplifies persontoperson transmission. The sheer population size is the single biggest challenge. Hospitals were initially overwhelmed by the number of patients, and many patients were not hospitalised because of a shortage of hospital beds, thereby contributing to seeding in the community. A new hospital was built within 10 days. A massive banquet with 40 000 guests took place just before the lockdown, further exacerbating community spread. Worse, in the days just before Wuhan was put under lockdown, more than 5 million people (many of whom might have been incubating the virus) had travelled out because of the Personal View upcoming Spring Festival, thus spreading COVID19 to other provinces in China. The high connectivity of Wuhan to international airports further facilitated rapid spread to cities and countries with high air passenger volumes from China, such as Singapore, Japan, and Thailand. 33, 34 A second explanation might be that the infectious period is different. Isolation was effective for SARS because peak viral shedding occurred after patients were already quite ill with respiratory symptoms and could be easily identified. Although asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic patients have been reported for SARS, 35 no known transmission occurred from these patients. By contrast, preliminary evidence from exported COVID19 cases suggest that transmission during the early phase of illness also seems to contribute to overall transmission; 36, 37 therefore, isolation of more severely ill patients at the time of presentation to healthcare facilities will be too late. The effectiveness of isolation and contact tracing methods depends on the proportion of transmission that occurs before symptom onset. Presymptomatic transmission will also make temperature screening less effective. 38 A third explanation could be that the trans missibility might be higher for COVID19 than for SARS. R\u2080 is a central concept in infectious disease epidemiology, indicating the risk of an infectious agent with respect to its epidemic potential. A recent review (published in February, 2020) found the average R\u2080 of COVID19 to be 3\u00b728 and median R\u2080 to be 2\u00b779, higher than that of SARS, although more accurate estimates can only be ascertained when the epidemic stablises. 39 The speed of spread of COVID19from the first documented case in early December, 2019, to 80 000 cases by the end of February, 2020, despite massive con tainment efforts-is certainly much faster than that reported for SARS between November, 2002, and March, 2003, before any forms of containment were even instituted. The high attack rates on the cruise ship Diamond Princess in Japan, with more than 700 on board infected out of approximately 3700 cruise ship passengers and crew members by Feb 28, 2020, despite public health measures, suggest a very high transmissibility. 40 A fourth explanation is that the clinical spectrum is different. China's initial case definition was focused on pneumonia, and initial case fatality rates (CFR) were reported at about 10% on the basis of this narrow case definition. 6 However, as the epidemic unfolds, it has become apparent that mild cases are common in COVID19. Patients with mild disease manifestations will be missed even if a more sensitive surveillance system were in place, and these patients might spread the disease silently, similar to influenza. On Feb 18, 2020, the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention published their data of the first 72 314 patients including 44 672 patients with confirmed COVID19. 41 As many as 81% of the patients with confirmed COVID19 were reported to have a mild disease or less severe forms of pneumonia, whereas 13\u00b78% had a severe condition and 4\u00b77% were critically ill. The study also noted that nearly half (49%) of the critically ill patients have died. Of the patients from the Diamond Princess cruise ship, which provides a captive cohort to study the virus, more than 10% were asymptomatic upon diagnosis. Estimating CFRs remains elusive, as many patients are still in the early stages of disease, and more fatalities could occur given that death seems to occur 2-4 weeks after onset of symptoms. 6, 7 The current estimate by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention is a CFR of 2\u00b73%, with increasing CFRs for patients with advanced age or comorbidities. However, the report also shows that CFRs vary greatly between Wuhan and other provinces in China; therefore some uncertainty remains around CFRs. With already more than 3600 cases imported into or acquired in other countries (or on cruise ships), more information on the full spectrum of disease and a better estimate of the CFR should be available in the next few weeks. Of note is that even if the CFR of COVID19 (possibly &lt;2%) is far lower than that of SARS (10%), this is not reassuring, as a highly transmissible disease with low CFR will result in many more cases, and therefore also ultimately more deaths than SARS.","As described above, at least two important positive externalities (i.e., benefits accruing to individuals other than the original supplier and patient) 52 can be attributed to vaccines: (1) vaccination helps protect even those individuals not receiving the vaccine by reducing the transmission of a given disease and (2) reductions in the burden of infectious disease in the 20th century have been linked to considerable economic expansion during that period. However, vaccine manufacturers cannot capture these third-party benefits. This problem, together with other supply-side (e.g., barriers to entry) and demand-side (e.g., vaccine financing) issues have resulted in market failure (i.e., a quantity and variety of vaccine products supplied that is below the social optimum) in the vaccine market. Thus, both government policy makers and various health philanthropies have implemented a number of proposals aimed at overcoming these issues. These policies can be described as either \"push\" or \"pull\" strategies. 2 Push strategies seek to address supply-side issues in the vaccine market by providing direct assistance to ease the burden of research, development, and production costs, whereas pull strategies are designed to manipulate demand for vaccines, thereby improving the likelihood of a return on investment by increasing the number of immunizations administered. Thus, push mechanisms can be thought of as funding inputs, while pull mechanisms can be thought of as paying for outputs.","In 2014, the ACT Government launched the Canberra Innovation Network (CBRIN) to further consolidate collaborations between local government, innovators and education and research institutions. InnovationACT has built strong ties to CBRIN, the Griffin Accelerator which supports local high-growth firms, and the federal intellectual property agency-IP Australia-linking social, research and practice stakeholders (Potocnjak-Oxman, 2018). ANU's College of Business and Economics has now also piloted a Venture Lab for further integration of entrepreneurial ventures created by students, including the promotion of joint innovation efforts. Student-centred activities linked to design thinking are central to this initiative. The start-up entrepreneurial portfolio is managed and developed by one of the co-authors who is currently undertaking research into entrepreneurial opportunities and design.","The second challenge for implementing real-time epidemic forecasting is the gap between technological or methodological innovation, which often occurs in academic settings in high-income countries, and implementation in field settings, frequently done by NGOs or governments in low-income and middleincome countries. Many funders have adopted a financing model intended to spur innovation through short-term pilot projects that place greater emphasis on the novelty of a technology or method than on the validation of its impact, but this approach exacerbates this separation. Pilot funding also fails to acknowledge the long timelines required to engage with health systems effectively and to measure health impact rigorously, instead promoting one-off bilateral collaborative projects that do not scale up and are not sustained after the lifetime of the project. Much more investment is needed in the validation, implementation, and scaling up of innovations in close intellectual partnership with stakeholders who are responsible for delivering them, 3 rather than continuing to fund the proliferation of solutions divorced from the problems themselves. In a recent editorial, Seye Abimbola noted that \"while the gulf between discovery and delivery exists in other fields, what makes global health peculiar is that discoveries and the decisions on whether or how to deliver them are typically made at a distance, removed from the realities of their targets or intended beneficiaries.\" 4 The third challenge is methodological: epidemic forecasting is inherently uncertain. There is sometimes an underlying assumption in the big data and artificial intelligence (AI) narrative that complex simulation models and mobile phone data or statistical covariates can bypass the need for the collection of basic epidemiological information. However, for emerging outbreaks-with COVID-19 highlighting this pointwe often lack accurate data about case counts and biological processes driving an epidemic, let alone the behavioural responses of people affected, making it challenging to swiftly adapt or interpret very complex models on the spatiotemporal scales relevant for decision making. Arguably, the most useful frameworks will tend to be simple, 5,6 both because of the need for flexible models that yield rapid answers given the large uncertainty surrounding epidemiological data during an emergency, and because simple models are more easily interpreted and communicated. 2 Clear communication of both the value and limitations of model outputs is a prerequisite to their useful deployment, but is often absent. Since policy makers generally do not have indepth modelling expertise, lack of clear communication risks two negative outcomes: believe models without scepticism and decisions will be misinformed, or dismiss modelling out of hand and fail to use the evidence we have to contain outbreaks as effectively as possible.","The use of ionizing radiation as a means of controlling microorganisms has been extensively researched for many years. Two technologies are used. In one, a radioactive substance, e.g. Cobalt 60, gives off the radiation. It gives off high-energy photons, called c-rays, which can penetrate foods to a depth of more than 50 cm. The second technology uses beams of high-energy electrons, often produced by an electron accelerator. The electrons can only penetrate food to a depth of 3 cm, so the thickness of material, which can be treated effectively, is limited. These technologies have been used commercially for a long time (c-rays for more than thirty years), e.g. to sterilize disposable medical equipment.","\u2610Purpose and intent of the external review (e.g., to improve quality, gather feedback on draft recommendations, assess applicability and feasibility, disseminate evidence) \u2610Methods taken to undertake the external review (e.g., rating scale, open-ended questions) \u2610Description of the external reviewers (e.g., number, type of reviewers, affiliations) \u2610Outcomes/information gathered from the external review (e.g., summary of key findings) \u2610How the information gathered was used to inform the guideline development process and/or formation of the recommendations (e.g., guideline panel considered results of \u2610Types of facilitators and barriers that were considered \u2610Methods by which information regarding the facilitators and barriers to implementing recommendations were sought (e.g., feedback from key stakeholders, pilot testing of guidelines before widespread implementation) \u2610Information/description of the types of facilitators and barriers that emerged from the inquiry (e.g., practitioners have the skills to deliver the recommended care, sufficient equipment is not available to ensure all eligible members of the population receive mammography) \u2610How the information influenced the guideline development process and/or formation of the recommendations NR 19. IMPLEMENTATION ADVICE/TOOLS Provide advice and/or tools on how the recommendations can be applied in practice.","Among the expected technological improvements, two stand out as likely to benefit the field of viral metagenomics in the near future. First, long-read sequencing technologies are progressively amenable to the sequencing of environmental viral communities. Pragmatically, this means that instead of having to assemble virus genomes from short reads, a process which can yield potentially erroneous and/or incomplete genome sequences, a complete viral genome could be sequenced as a single read. Once broadly available, these long-reads metagenomes will not only bypass assembly issues but also provide valuable information about virus genome evolution by enabling whole-genome phasing of polymorphisms. Meanwhile, in an epidemiological context, long-read sequencing technologies associated with miniaturized devices, streamlined sample preparation, and live scanning of the sequencing results offers unique possibility for real-time surveillance or diagnostics. This is especially the case for the MinION sequencer based on Nanopore sequencing technology, allowing the identification of viral pathogens from a patient sample in less than 6 h, compared to more than 20 h for other sequencing technologies. The computational framework to analyze and share these types of data in a timely, safe, and meaningful way remains to be built, however it is likely that metagenomics through portable genome sequencers will become a major component of the epidemiological toolkit in the near future.","The mission of RA is to support the critical task of ensuring availability and use of medical countermeasures that are essential to CDC's preparedness and emergency response programs. RA executes this mission by ensuring regulatory compliance regarding critical medical countermeasures against potential threats from natural, chemical, biological, radiological, or nuclear (CBRN) events. To enable rapid and effective response during emergency events that require appropriate use of medical countermeasures, many of which are only available through CDC, RA is responsible for ensuring that appropriate regulatory mechanisms such as Investigational New Drug (IND) applications, Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) requests, and Investigational Device Exemptions (IDEs) required for deployment and use of medical countermeasures are in place. RA also provides regulatory expertise to CDC subject matter experts and principal investigators regarding use of medical products (e.g., drugs, biologics, devices) for both nonresearch and research purposes.","Diagnostics through viral metagenomics has also been applied to non-human animals as well as plants, and similarly revealed new potential viral pathogens in organisms showing unexplained symptoms. Multiple new virus types including novel parvoviruses, polyomaviruses, sapoviruses, and picornaviruses were for example identified in livestock samples (porcine and bovine), while a large diversity of persistent RNA viruses were newly identified across several groups of plants. However, it is important to note that the detection of a (novel) virus in a sample from a patient with an illness of unknown etiology does not prove causation, even in cases of a demonstrated significant association between the presence of the virus sequence and the observed symptoms. Hence, metagenomics will often be the first step of a longer process involving attempts to propagate the virus in culture, or monitoring healthy individuals exposed to the suspected pathogen (see below \"Future of viral metagenomics: major challenges and upcoming innovations\").","To improve responsiveness to epidemics, in 2015 the WHO published a list of nine diseases requiring urgent vaccine R&amp;D to prevent public health emergencies in the future. This list was revised in 2017, and key characteristics of the diseases prioritised by the WHO are summarised in Table 3. The process of prioritising diseases took into account properties of the causative pathogen e.g. transmissibility, host-based factors such as immunopathology, clinical aspects including ease of accurate diagnosis, availability of countermeasures and mortality, public health capacity and epidemiological factors.47 Research and development priorities for these diseases include development of suitable diagnostic tests, assessment of potential treatments, identification of key knowledge gaps, production platforms, behavioural interventions and acceleration of vaccine development. Preparation of sufficient quantities of safe and efficacious vaccines against potential outbreak pathogens is an extremely effective strategy. However, a lack of access to dedicated long-term funding has hampered vaccine development for outbreak pathogens in recent decades.48 As well as limiting the number of new vaccines being developed, the number of facilities with the capacity to biomanufacture vaccines is also limited, which is a significant issue for outbreak preparedness.49 In addition, WHO recognised that generally applicable platform technologies for rapid vaccine development are required and have set out to identify and prioritise the leading platforms.   ","An ideal diagnostic test for RTIs should be rapid (a result within 1 h of consultation), cheap, easy to use, sensitive, and specifi c, and should screen for many microorganisms and their antibiotic resistance. Furthermore, the diagnostics platform should be transportable, robust, and ideally run on solar power for use in the remote health-care settings in developing countries. Whether or not an ideal diagnostic platform for RTIs can be delivered, advances in biotechnology give hope. Such a device would improve the health and lives of patients with RTIs worldwide, and would also contribute to global health surveillance and security. To achieve this ideal, physicians, scientists, biotechnology companies, funding agencies, and governments need to work together to drive the development of improved diagnostic tests for both developed and developing countries. The clinical eff ect was larger in children with more severe asthma exacerbation (p=0\u00b703) and those with symptoms present for less than 6 h (p=0\u00b7049)\". In table 1, the age range for both MgSO 4 and placebo groups should have been 2-15. And in table 3, the footnote p=0\u00b7143 for interaction between attack duration and MgSO 4 should have been added to the legend. This correction has been made to the online version as of May 30, 2013, and the printed Article is correct.","Regarding further future directions, we point to the new digital technologies that have a potential to improve the ripple effect control in cases of epidemic outbreaks. Making innovations and data work for the SC resilience in crisis times is a promising future research avenue with a particular focus on data analytics, artificial intelligence, and machine learning. The understanding and progressing the research of how all these technologies can be used to operate the SCs in a resilient way in cases of epidemic outbreaks is an important future research area (Choi et al., 2017 (Choi et al., , 2019 Choi and Lambert, 2017b , Dubey et al., 2019a , Ganasegeran and Abdulrahman, 2020 , Queiroz and Wamba, 2019 , Yoon et al., 2019 . In particular, digital SC twins ) -i.e., the computerized SC models that represent the network state for any given moment in real time -can be used to support the decision-making during the epidemic outbreaks. In the pre-disruption mode, digital twins allow for a visualization of SC risks, assessment of supplier disruption risks, prediction of possible supply interruptions, and computation of alternative supply network topologies and back-up routes with assessment of estimated times of arrival. In the dynamic, reactive mode, i.e., in the case of a real epidemic outbreak the digital twins can be applied using real-time data to simulate disruption impacts on the SC and alternative SC designs that contain non-disrupted network nodes and arcs depending on real-time inventory, demand, and capacity data.","\u2610Types of facilitators and barriers that were considered \u2610Methods by which information regarding the facilitators and barriers to implementing recommendations were sought (e.g., feedback from key stakeholders, pilot testing of guidelines before widespread implementation) NR \u2610Information/description of the types of facilitators and barriers that emerged from the inquiry (e.g., practitioners have the skills to deliver the recommended care, sufficient equipment is not available to ensure all eligible members of the population receive mammography) \u2610Types of cost information that were considered (e.g., economic evaluations, drug acquisition costs)","The unpredictable nature of airborne pandemic diseases and their impact on our economy and society present a big challenge at the national and global level. Only a prompt and coordinated response among different sectors of society can maintain security from this threat, which can be implemented through the help of technological innovations and comprehensive planning. Unfortunately, despite being recognized as a key technical element in pandemic/epidemic preparedness, innovation in the design of respiratory protection devices has been sparse. In alignment with the strategic plan for pandemic/epidemic preparedness, we anticipate that incorporation of efficient pathogen-neutralization mechanisms can overcome the existing technical (contact transmission, source control, waste) and non-technical (supply shortage, policies, cost) challenges in respiratory protection. Thus, we expect this engaging field to expand further, with the promise to offer enhanced protection to the global population.","Regulatory, NIH, and Other Implications These represent general recommendations and are intended, in part, to stimulate thinking and conversation about the conduct of HF clinical trials during the COVID-19 pandemic and during future public health emergencies that may disrupt the conduct of clinical research. While it is acknowledged that \"one-size may not fit all\" for modifications contemplated for each HF drug or device trial, many trials will likely be modified in similar ways. HF clinical trial leadership (e.g., principal investigators, executive and steering committee members, and committees with oversight of patient safety) should be in regular contact with sponsors to expeditiously make suggestions for reasonable study modifications. Study sponsors should initiate discussions with regulatory officials and/or NIH, as there may be regulatory and/or funding implications to be considered. FDA and NIH should continue to uphold principles of flexibility, while emphasizing patient safety, in the conduct of HF clinical trials during the pandemic.","Medicine shortages have risen worldwide, straining the capability of National Healthcare Systems in ensuring patients' access to pharmacological therapies (Beck et al., 2019; Jia and Zhao, 2017, Schwartzberg et al., 2017) . The resilience of the pharmaceutical distribution chain and other stakeholders varies based on different factors, such as product characteristics and the involved countries (Birhli, 2013) . The unavailability of medicinal products to patients can be due to supply-related factors (e.g., manufacturing issues, regulatory issues, logistics, distribution) and demand-related ones (e.g., fluctuating drug demand, parallel market, tendering, price and reimbursement policies). Moreover, extraordinary geopolitical events [e.g., Brexit, Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak in China] can also have a strong influence on the resilience of the pharmaceutical chain and the patients' access to therapies. Even if globalized players control the research and production of medicinal products by now, the activities of Regulatory Authorities are still based on national or supranational [i.e. European Union (EU)] frameworks. In Europe, the capability of the Regulatory Authorities and other subjects involved in the pharmaceutical distribution chain and the healthcare assistance services in defining suitable problem-solving strategies has been limited by the fragmentation of the regulatory framework (Bochenek et al., 2018; De Weerdt et al., 2015a) . Only in 2019, the EMA and HMA released the first harmonized \"shortage\" definition in the European Economic Area (EEA) (EMA and HMA, 2019b) . Although the proposed definition was relevant only for Marketing Authorization Holders (MAHs) and Regulatory Authorities, it is the first step to promote the communication and the coordination among European pharmaceutical stakeholders, regulators and professionals working in the different National Healthcare Systems for improving their resilience to shortages. However, the kaleidoscopic regulatory framework on shortage is not the only critical factor, but the heterogenicity of the National legislation, reimbursement and price policies, and medicines' market around Europe limited the establishment of a solid European emergency plan to solve the shortage problem.","Published data on pediatric critical care research from resource-limited countries remains sparse, yet is much needed (18, 73). Reasons for this gap in evidence likely include lack of funding, local critical care providers and researchers, academic mentorship and infrastructure to perform research, and/or barriers to turn available data into publishable research. The limited existing evidence hinders effective and efficient care and advocacy for resource-limited settings.","WHO and the Foundation for Innovative New Diagnostics (FIND) have established a formal collaboration on universal access to essential diagnostics. Announced on 10 February, the aim of the collaboration is to close diagnostic gaps at country level and bolster disease surveillance that will inform public health initiatives and enhance outbreak preparedness and response.","By saving millions of lives and millions of dollars, vaccines have been responsible for some of the greatest successes in public health. However, the struggle against infectious disease is a continual process requiring new vaccines for the challenges that may confront human health in the future. The vaccine market is fragile and requires both supply-and demandside interventions. Vaccine availability has been limited by the number of suppliers, high R&amp;D and production costs, and safety problems leading to increased regulatory requirements. Demand has been constrained by rapidly increasing vaccine costs, financing issues that have constrained efforts to achieve targets set for population immunization rates, and parental attitudes regarding the safety and efficacy of vaccine products. To date, the U.S. government, in concert with private philanthro-VACCINE POLICY Reviews pies, has implemented a patchwork of policies to make the vaccine market more attractive for private firms and to increase access to these products for individuals. We would argue that what is needed is an integrated policy approach that preserves incentives for market entry and innovation in the vaccine industry while simultaneously addressing parental vaccine concerns and increasing immunization funding and reimbursement for both providers and patients.","Another type of COVID-19, like SARS disease (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome), is analyzed without breaking the current situation and predicting the future perspective [8] . VAR model (Vector Auto Average) model is used to predict the spatial extinct while using remote sensing data and for the purpose of creation of GIS map of worldwide on three different variables [9] . These three variables in the GIS environment create a map of cumulative confirmed cases country-wise as well as recovered and death map [10] . The use of another statistical analysis is a generalized logistic growth model (GLM), which generally depicted as a scaling parameter of integrating an additional result-oriented value put method [11] . Some epidemic models used in disease epidemic conditions measure oscillates some multiple peak parameters inferred in sub-epidemic and pandemic conditions to determine the projected","Depending on features of the virus structure, transmission dynamics, entry requirements, tropism, and replication strategy, a vaccine approach should be proposed, designed, and evaluated in small animals for immunogenicity and protection against challenge. Manufacturing a candidate vaccine for which there is no immediate market poses a significant dilemma because most stages of advanced vaccine development are carried out by large pharmaceutical companies that need to make profit to stay in business. While emerging infectious diseases pose a public health threat, they rarely present a compelling commercial opportunity. Vaccines require a large investment and historically have a relatively low probability of being successful without an extensive iterative process of evaluation and redesign. Therefore, in addition to new biological tools, there needs to be political will to prioritize public funding of advanced vaccine development and new business models for managing this process. 3 In this review, we describe the vaccine development efforts for three distinct viruses that collectively capture many of the challenges faced when developing vaccines for emerging viral threats. Ebola, a member of the Filoviridae family, is spread by body fluids and secretions with a relatively low attack rate but causes a systemic disease with high mortality. Chikungunya, an alphavirus in FIGURE 28.1 Time from identification of a viral pathogen to vaccine availability. Vaccine development is a lengthy process often measured in decades. Many steps are required even for a traditional empirical approach including identification of target antigen; assay development; defining seroprevalence and incidence in relevant populations; understanding transmission dynamics and whether there is an intermediate animal host; developing animal models; exploring pathogenesis and defining immune mechanisms of protection; designing vaccine antigens; determining formulation, delivery route and method; preclinical evaluation for safety and immunogenicity; manufacturing; and several years of clinical evaluation and clearing regulatory hurdles. Vaccines can fail at any of these steps, and it is rare for the first attempted concept to become the final product.","\u2610A statement that the guideline will be updated \u2610Explicit time interval or explicit criteria to guide decisions about when an update will occur \u2610Methodology for the updating procedure \u2610Types of facilitators and barriers that were considered \u2610Methods by which information regarding the facilitators and barriers to implementing recommendations were sought (e.g., feedback from key stakeholders, pilot testing of guidelines before widespread implementation) \u2610Information/description of the types of facilitators and barriers that emerged from the inquiry (e.g., practitioners have the skills to deliver the recommended care, sufficient equipment is not available to ensure all eligible members of the population receive mammography) \u2610Types of cost information that were considered (e.g., economic evaluations, drug acquisition costs)","Moreover, as innovations in testing (rapid tests, serologic tests of immunity) and treatment or vaccines allow for better risk stratification, one may be able to consider restarting non-time sensitive procedures.","1. Poorest countries with limited resources should work on establishing national medicines information centers to cover the needs of the whole country. 2. Different institutions within the same country can work on establishing an information sharing system to facilitate information exchange and building up huge medicines information databases. 3. Collaboration among countries from the same region provides great opportunities to save resources and strengthening the capacities for attaining sustainable high-quality services. This can be achieved via sharing available experiences and resources and can be maximized by building collaborative regional MICs. 4. Institutions from developing countries with no or limited access to high-quality medicines information resources should seek assistance from supportive organizations such as the WHO, which can offer free access to the Hinari database. Other freely available resources should be also sought. 5. Medicines information education should be promoted among colleges of pharmacy at various levels including didactic courses during undergraduate studies, during APPE training of PharmD students and as postgraduate studies and training (i.e., residencies, fellowships, and masters programs). 6. Training for developing and strengthening the medicines information skills should be provided regularly to all practicing pharmacists as part of the continuing professional development (CPD) programs 7. Advanced training can be scheduled for pharmacists working on the provision of medicines information services as part of CPD activities to build their capacities and to raise their competencies. 8. Countries with limited experiences in the area of medicines information should work on to learn from countries having well-established systems of medicines information and try to copy successful innovations. 9. There is a need to monitor and evaluate various resources of medicines information available in the developing countries as well as evaluating the services provided by the medicines information centers. This is very useful for improvement and for the expansion and the sustainability of the services. Evaluations are done by conducting scientific research studies. Such researches should be published to allow others make use of the established evidence.","These innovations will remain dislocated and impractical until the challenges above are addressed. Encouragingly, all three issues could be improved by moving much of the focus of funding and expertise to the populations most vulnerable to epidemics. The unpredictable nature of epidemics and the increasingly technical components of these approaches means that flexible, distributed teams of people who span the analytical and operational aspects of the outbreak response will be needed if we are to use new big data approaches to complement and clarify the small data-epidemiological, geographical, and socialthat are essential for the development of meaningful forecasts. Regional or local teams with analytical training and ongoing relationships with government and industry partners should lead to flexible modelling approaches that leverage large curated datasets and international analytical expertise, building on collaborations developed when there are no emerging or ongoing outbreaks. 5 This approach could also help to alleviate some of the political issues associated with data sharing, even when crucial information cannot be shared publicly. For this concept to work, substantial long-term investment is needed to train and support individuals, particularly in low-income and middle-income countries, to fill what is currently a major gap in the analytical pipeline.
