It is crucial to assess hospital environmental hygiene to understand the most important environmental issues for controlling the spread of COVID-19 in hospitals. Objective: To detect the presence of COVID-19 in the samples from the area at risk of contamination in the First Hospital of Jilin University. Methods: Viruses in the air were collected by natural sedimentation and air particle sampler methods. Predetermined environmental surfaces were sampled using swabs at seven o'clock in the morning before disinfection. The real-time reverse-transcription PCR method was used to detect the existence of COVID-19 pathogens. Results: Viruses could be detected on the surfaces of the nurse station in the isolation area with suspected patients and in the air of the isolation ward with an intensive care patient. Conclusion: Comprehensiv...","Summary Background On Dec 31, 2019, China reported a cluster of cases of pneumonia in people at Wuhan, Hubei Province. The responsible pathogen is a novel coronavirus, named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). We report the relevant features of the first cases in Europe of confirmed infection, named coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), with the first patient diagnosed with the disease on Jan 24, 2020. Methods In this case series, we followed five patients admitted to Bichat-Claude Bernard University Hospital (Paris, France) and Pellegrin University Hospital (Bordeaux, France) and diagnosed with COVID-19 by semi-quantitative RT-PCR on nasopharyngeal swabs. We assessed patterns of clinical disease and viral load from different samples (nasopharyngeal and blood, urine, and stool samples), which were obtained once daily for 3 days from hospital admission, and once every 2 or 3 days until patient discharge. All samples were refrigerated and shipped to laboratories ...","Environmental DNA (eDNA) and its subdiscipline, invertebrate-derived DNA (iDNA) have been used to survey biodiversity non-invasively [1,2]. Water is ubiquitous in most ecosystems, and, among invertebrates, terrestrial haematophagous leeches are abundant and can be easily collected in many tropical rainforests [3,4]. Such non-invasive nucleic acid sources can mitigate difficulties of obtaining wildlife samples, particularly in remote areas or for rare species. Recently, eDNA/iDNA sources have been applied to monitoring specific wildlife pathogens [5,6]. However, previous studies have focused on known pathogens, whereas most wildlife pathogens are uncharacterized and unknown. Non-invasive approaches to monitoring known and novel pathogens may be of particular benefit in ecosystems prone to viral emergence, many of which occur in areas where invasive sampling is challenging, such as tropical rainforests. Here, we show that both eDNA from natural waterholes, and iDNA from terrestrial haema...","Abstract Background and Aims Multiple issues in management of COVID have emerged, but confusion persists regarding rational interpretation. Aim of this brief review is to review these issues based on current literature. Methods This is a narrative review with Pubmed and Google Scholar search till 23 March 2020. Search terms were, COVID-19, treatment of coronavirus, COVID 19 and following terms; chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, ibuprofen, ACE-inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers, cardiovascular disease, diarrhoea, liver, testis and gastrointestinal disease. Results We discuss evidence regarding role of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine in treatment and prophylaxis, use of inhibitors of the renin angiotensin system, safety of ibuprofen, unusual clinical features like gastrointestinal symptoms and interpretation of tests for cardiac enzymes and biomarkers. Conclusions While our conclusions on management of COVID-19 patients with co-morbidities are based on current evidence, howeve...","In this work we construct a mathematical model for the transmission and spread of coronavirus disease 2019 or COVID-19. Our model features delay terms to account for (a) the time lapse or latency period between contracting the disease and displaying symptoms, and (b) the time lag in testing patients for the virus due to the limited numbers of testing facilities currently available. We find that the delay introduces a significant disparity between the actual and reported time-trajectories of cases in a particular region. Specifically, the reported case histories lag the actual histories by a few days. Hence, to minimize the spread of the disease, lockdowns and similarly drastic social isolation measures need to be imposed some time before the reported figures are approaching their peak values. We then account for the social reality that lockdowns can only be of a limited duration in view of practical considerations. We find that the most effective interval for imposing such a limited-ti...","Abstract Background An ongoing epidemic of respiratory diseases caused by a novel coronavirus (COVID 2019, SARS-CoV2) started in Wuhan, Hubei, in China at the end of December 2019. The French government decided to repatriate the 337 French nationals living in Wuhan and place them in quarantine in their home country. We decided to test them all for SARS-Cov2 twice in order to reduce anxiety among the population and decision-makers. Methods We investigated the presence of SARS-CoV-19 in asymptomatic carriers by testing all repatriated patients within the first 24 h of their arrival in France and at day 5. Viral RNA was extracted from pooled nasal and oropharyngeal swab fluids or sputum in the absence of nasal/oropharyngeal swabs. Detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA was then carried out using several real-time reverse transcription (RT)-PCR assays. Results We tested 337 passengers at day 0 and day 5. All the tests for SARS-CoV2 were negative. By optimising the sampling process, sending samples se...","DNA microarrays have emerged as a viable platform for detection of pathogenic organisms in clinical and environmental samples. These microbial detection arrays occupy a middle ground between low cost, narrowly focused assays such as multiplex PCR and more expensive, broad-spectrum technologies like high-throughput sequencing. While pathogen detection arrays have been used primarily in a research context, several groups are aggressively working to develop arrays for clinical diagnostics, food safety testing, environmental monitoring and biodefense. Statistical algorithms that can analyze data from microbial detection arrays and provide easily interpretable results are absolutely required in order for these efforts to succeed. In this article, we will review the most promising array designs and analysis algorithms that have been developed to date, comparing their strengths and weaknesses for pathogen detection and discovery.","","","Abstract The outbreak of COVID-19, a respiratory disease from a novel coronavirus that was first detected in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China is now a public health emergency and fast approaching a pandemic. Singapore, as a major international transportation hub in Asia, is one of the worst hit countries of COVID-19. With the advent of local transmission of cases, we share our preparation and response planning for the operating room from the National Heart Centre Singapore, the largest cardiothoracic tertiary center in Singapore. Protection of staff and patients, environmental concerns as well as other logistic and equipment issues must be considered.","As of February 2020, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) outbreak started in China in December 2019 has been spreading in many countries in the world. With the numbers of confirmed cases are increasing, information on the epidemiologic investigation and clinical manifestation have been accumulated. However, data on viral load kinetics in confirmed cases are lacking. Here, we present the viral load kinetics of the first two confirmed patients with mild to moderate illnesses in Korea in whom distinct viral load kinetics are shown. This report suggests that viral load kinetics of SARS-CoV-2 may be different from that of previously reported other coronavirus infections such as SARS-CoV.","Summary The past decade has seen the emergence of several novel viruses that cause respiratory tract infections in human beings, including Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in Saudi Arabia, an H7N9 influenza A virus in eastern China, a swine-like influenza H3N2 variant virus in the USA, and a human adenovirus 14p1 also in the USA. MERS-CoV and H7N9 viruses are still a major worldwide public health concern. The pathogenesis and mode of transmission of MERS-CoV and H7N9 influenza A virus are poorly understood, making it more difficult to implement intervention and preventive measures. A united and coordinated global response is needed to tackle emerging viruses that can cause fatal respiratory tract infections and to fill major gaps in the understanding of the epidemiology and transmission dynamics of these viruses.","The pandemic potential of the novel coronavirus (nCoV) that emerged in Wuhan, China, during December 2019 is strongly tied to the number and contagiousness of undocumented human infections. Here we present findings from a proactive longitudinal sampling study of acute viral respiratory infections that documents rates of asymptomatic infection and clinical care seeking for seasonal coronavirus. We find that the majority of infections are asymptomatic by most symptom definitions and that only 4% of individuals experiencing a seasonal coronavirus infection episode sought medical care for their symptoms. These numbers indicate that a very high percentage of seasonal coronavirus infections are undocumented and provide a reference for understanding the spread of the emergent nCoV.","We evaluated effectiveness of thermal passenger screening for 2019-nCoV infection at airport exit and entry to inform public health decision-making. In our baseline scenario, we estimated that 46% (95% confidence interval: 36 to 58) of infected travellers would not be detected, depending on incubation period, sensitivity of exit and entry screening, and proportion of asymptomatic cases. Airport screening is unlikely to detect a sufficient proportion of 2019-nCoV infected travellers to avoid entry of infected travellers.","Pneumonia patients of 2019-ncov in latent period are not easy to be effectively quarantined, but there is evidence that they have strong infectious ability. Here, the infectious ability of patients during the latent period is slightly less than that of the infected patients was assumed. We established a new SEIR propagation dynamics model, that considered the weak transmission ability of the incubation period, the variation of the incubation period length, and the government intervention measures to track and isolate comprehensively. Based on the raw epidemic data of China from January 23, 2020 to February 10, 2020, the dynamic parameters of the new present SEIR model are fitted. Through the Euler integration algorithm to solve the model, the effect of infectious ability of incubation patients on the theoretical estimation of the present SEIR model was analyzed, and the occurrence time of peak number in China was predicted.","Emerging and re-emerging viruses continue to surface all over the world. Some of these viruses have the potential for rapid and global spread with high morbidity and mortality, such as the SARS coronavirus outbreak. It is extremely urgent and important to identify a novel virus near-instantaneously to develop an active preventive and/or control strategy. As a culture-independent approach, viral metagenomics has been widely used to investigate highly divergent and completely new viruses in humans, animals, and even environmental samples in the past decade. A new model of Koch\u2019s postulates, named the metagenomic Koch\u2019s postulates, has provided guidance for the study of the pathogenicity of novel viruses. This review explains the viral metagenomics strategy for virus discovery and describes viruses discovered in human feces in the past 10 years using this approach. This review also addresses issues related to the metagenomic Koch\u2019s postulates and the challenges for virus discovery in the ...","The influence of the outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) on mental health was poorly understood. The present study aimed to exam sleep problems and posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) in Chinese immediately after the massive outbreak of COVID-19. A total of 2027 Chinese participated in the present study. Wuhan-expose history, sleep quality and PTSS were measured with self-rating scales. Results showed that there were significant differences of PCL-5 and of sleep quality scores in different data-collection dates (ps&lt;0.05). There were significant differences of PCL-5 scores (p&lt;0.05) and latency onset of sleep (p&lt;0.05) between participants with and without Wuhan-expose history. The interaction effect of Wuhan exposure history \u00d7 sleep quality significantly influenced PCL-5 (ps&lt;0.05). These results indicate that keeping good sleep quality in individuals with high infectious risk is a way to prevent PTSS.","The recent Ebola and Zika epidemics demonstrate the need for the continuous surveillance, rapid diagnosis and real-time tracking of emerging infectious diseases. Fast, affordable sequencing of pathogen genomes \u2014 now a staple of the public health microbiology laboratory in well-resourced settings \u2014 can affect each of these areas. Coupling genomic diagnostics and epidemiology to innovative digital disease detection platforms raises the possibility of an open, global, digital pathogen surveillance system. When informed by a One Health approach, in which human, animal and environmental health are considered together, such a genomics-based system has profound potential to improve public health in settings lacking robust laboratory capacity. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The online version of this article (doi:10.1038/nrg.2017.88) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.","Background: The outbreak of COVID-19 caused by a novel Coronavirus (termed SARS-CoV-2) has spread to over 120 countries around the world. Currently, real-time qPCR (RT-qPCR) is used as the gold standard for diagnostics of SARS-CoV-2. However, the positive rate of RT-qPCR assay of pharyngeal swab samples is reported to be 30~60%. More accurate and sensitive methods are urgently needed. Method\uff1aWe established a digital PCR (dPCR) protocol to detect SARS-CoV-2 on 194 clinical pharyngeal swab samples, including 103 suspected patients, 75 close contacts and 16 supposed convalescents. Results: The limit of blanks (LoBs) of the dPCR assays are about 1.6, 1.6 and 0.8 copies/reaction for ORF 1ab, N and E gene. The limit of detection (LoD) is 2 copies/reaction. The overall accuracy of ddPCR is 95.5 %. For the fever suspected patients, the accuracy of SARS-CoV-2 detection was significantly improved from 28.2% to 87.4% by dPCR. For close contacts, the suspect rate was greatly decreased from 21% dow...","The sudden outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2002 prompted the establishment of a global scientific network subsuming most of the traditional rivalries in the competitive field of virology. Within months of the SARS outbreak, collaborative work revealed the identity of the disastrous pathogen as SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV). However, although the rapid identification of the agent represented an important breakthrough, our understanding of the deadly virus remains limited. Detailed biological knowledge is crucial for the development of effective countermeasures, diagnostic tests, vaccines and antiviral drugs against the SARS-CoV. This article reviews the present state of molecular knowledge about SARS-CoV, from the aspects of comparative genomics, molecular biology of viral genes, evolution, and epidemiology, and describes the diagnostic tests and the anti-viral drugs derived so far based on the available molecular information.","Abstract Housing preweaned dairy calves in pairs rather than individually has been found to positively affect behavioral responses in novel social and environmental situations, but concerns have been raised that close contact among very young animals may impair their health. In previous studies, the level of social contact permitted in individual housing has been auditory, visual, or physical contact. It is unclear how these various levels of social contact compare with each other and to pair housing, when their effects on behavior and health are considered, and whether the timing of pair housing has an effect. To investigate this, 110 Holstein calves (50 males, 60 females) in 11 blocks were paired according to birth date. Within 60h of birth, each pair of calves was allocated to 1 of 5 treatments: individual housing with auditory contact (I), individual housing with auditory and visual contact (V), individual housing with auditory, visual, and tactile contact (T), pair housing (P), or...","Abstract The term biological warfare typically conjures images of medieval warriors tossing dead cattle over city walls or clandestine government agents secretly releasing mysterious microbes into enemy territory. Of course, biological warfare does encompass such activity, but the vast majority of what constitutes biological warfare is far more mundane. Ever since life evolved on earth about 3.8 billion years ago, organisms have constantly devised new ways to kill each other. Any organism that makes use of toxins\u2014from bacteria to snakes\u2014is engaging in a form of biological warfare. Humans who engage in biological warfare do so by taking advantage of these toxin-producing organisms.","Abstract The causative agent of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) was identified as a coronavirus (CoV) following the outbreak of 2002\u20132003. There are currently no licensed vaccines or treatments for SARS-CoV infections. Potential prevention and control strategies that show promise in vitro must be evaluated in animal models. The aged BALB/c mouse model for SARS supports a high level of viral replication in association with clinical illness and disease that mimics SARS in the elderly. We tested two preventive strategies, vaccination and passive transfer of serum antibody, to determine the extent of protection achieved against SARS-CoV challenge in this model. These approaches were able to achieve or induce antibody titers sufficient to reduce viral load, protect from weight loss and reduce or eliminate histopathologic changes in the lungs of aged mice. This study validates the utility of the aged BALB/c mouse model for evaluation of the efficacy of vaccines and immunoprophylaxis...","","Abstract Certification programs have been developed to provide plant material that meets a predetermined level of plant health. The primary objectives of these programs are to limit pathogen incidence in plant material in order to minimize losses by growers and prevent movement of harmful pests and pathogens that may harm the environment. For many fruit and nut crops, orchards are expected to remain productive for years or decades; thus, starting with plants of high health status is essential. The components of certification programs in terms of plant health will be outlined, along with the benefits of harmonizing these programs where possible to facilitate plant movement without increasing trade in plant pathogens.","The rapid emergence of clinical trials on COVID-19 stimulated a wave of discussion in scientific community. We reviewed the characteristics of interventional trials from Chinese Clinical Trial Registration (ChiCTR) and ClinicalTrials.gov. A total of 171 COVID-19-related interventional trials were identified on Feb 22nd, 2020. These trials are classified into 4 categories based on treatment modalities, including chemical drugs, biological therapies, traditional Chinese medicine treatments and other therapies. Our analysis focused on the issues of stage, design, randomization, blinding, primary endpoints definition and sample size of these trials. We found some studies with potential defects including unreasonable design, inappropriate primary endpoint definition, insufficient sample size and ethical issue. Clinical trials on COVID-19 should be designed based on scientific rules, ethics and benefits for patients.","With relatively short latency and rapid propagation, viral diseases could be transmitted through the air to medical personnel or the public during the incubation period. To reduce the possibilities of spread, this research creates an infection probability model based on the settling velocity and concentration distribution of infectious droplets. Then, radio frequency identification (RFID) technology is employed to track the travel history (time, date and place) of the infected patients. A tree structure algorithm and an infection probability model are applied to trace the transmission routes, discover the correlations between carriers and suspected cases, and finally calculate the infection probability on the basis of time interval. In case of an epidemic outbreak or once an infected case is confirmed, the disease tracking and control system could be initiated by accessing RFID logs to plot the carriers\u2019 time of onset and to trace possible routes of transmission via tree diagrams. The ...","Infectious respiratory disease in dogs is a constant challenge because of the involvement of several pathogens and environmental factors. Canine respiratory coronavirus (CRCoV) is a new coronavirus of dogs, which is widespread in North America, Japan, and several European countries. CRCoV has been associated with respiratory disease, particularly in kenneled dog populations. The virus is genetically and antigenically distinct from enteric canine coronavirus; therefore, specific tests are required for diagnosis.","As the number of novel coronavirus cases grows both inside and outside of China, public health authorities require evidence on the effectiveness of control measures such as thermal screening of arrivals at airports. We evaluated the effectiveness of exit and entry screening for 2019-nCoV infection. In our baseline scenario, we estimated that 46.5% (95%CI: 35.9 to 57.7) of infected travellers would not be detected, depending on the incubation period, sensitivity of exit and entry screening, and the proportion of cases which are asymptomatic. Airport screening is unlikely to detect a sufficient proportion of 2019-nCoV infected travellers to avoid entry of infected travellers. We developed an online tool so that results can be updated as new information becomes available.","AbstractMany detection methods have been used or reported for the diagnosis and/or surveillance of SARS-CoV-2. Among them, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is the most sensitive, claiming detection of about 5 copies of viruses. However, it has been reported that only 47-59% of the positive cases were identified by RT-PCR, probably due to loss or degradation of virus RNA in the sampling process, or even mutation of the virus genome. Therefore, developing highly sensitive methods is imperative to ensure robust detection capabilities. With the goal of improving sensitivity and accommodate various application settings, we developed a multiplex-PCR-based method comprised of 172 pairs of specific primers, and demonstrated its efficiency to detect SARS-CoV-2 at low copy numbers. The assay produced clean characteristic target peaks of defined sizes, which allowed for direct identification of positives by electrophoresis. In addition, optional sequencing can provide furt...","Immunity to respiratory virus infection is governed by complex biological networks that influence disease progression and pathogenesis. Systems biology provides an opportunity to explore and understand these multifaceted interactions based on integration and modeling of multiple biological parameters. In this review, we describe new and refined systems-based approaches used to model, identify, and validate novel targets within complex networks following influenza and coronavirus infection. In addition, we propose avenues for extension and expansion that can revolutionize our understanding of infectious disease processes. Together, we hope to provide a window into the unique and expansive opportunity presented by systems biology to understand complex disease processes within the context of infectious diseases.","Publisher Summary This chapter discusses the terms: \u201cvocabulary,\u201d \u201ctaxonomy,\u201d and \u201contology.\u201d Terms and facts are semantic constructs. They are meant to have meaning that is shared by anyone who uses them. These terms are chosen from a much larger palette of possible terms for that industry and context. These terms have to be defined and used consistently by all the people and all the programs that access data referred to by the \u201cterms.\u201d The chapter examines where that chaos comes from and the role that taxonomies and ontologies play to help make definitions more precise and more commonly understood. The chapter examines business vocabularies and various ways they are organized. Vocabulary is the set of symbols (words) to which a given language has ascribed shared meaning. Taxonomy is a form of organized vocabulary. Classically the organization is hierarchic, based on some attributes of the things being classified. Ontology is a specification of a conceptualization. The chapter conclud...","Abstract The application of optical biosensors, specifically those that use optical fibers and planar waveguides, has escalated throughout the years in many fields, including environmental analysis, food safety and clinical diagnosis. Fluorescence is, without doubt, the most popular transducer signal used in these devices because of its higher selectivity and sensitivity, but most of all due to its wide versatility. This paper focuses on the working principles and configurations of fluorescence-based fiber optic and planar waveguide biosensors and will review biological recognition elements, sensing schemes, as well as some major and recent applications, published in the last ten years. The main goal is to provide the reader a general overview of a field that requires the joint collaboration of researchers of many different areas, including chemistry, physics, biology, engineering, and material science.","","","","","Summary Respiratory viruses that emerge in the human population may cause high morbidity and mortality, as well as concern about pandemic spread. Examples are severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and novel variants of influenza A virus, such as H5N1 and pandemic H1N1. Different animal models are used to develop therapeutic and preventive measures against such viruses, but it is not clear which are most suitable. Therefore, this review compares animal models of SARS and influenza, with an emphasis on non-human primates, ferrets and cats. Firstly, the pathology and pathogenesis of SARS and influenza are compared. Both diseases are similar in that they affect mainly the respiratory tract and cause inflammation and necrosis centred on the pulmonary alveoli and bronchioles. Important differences are the presence of multinucleated giant cells and intra-alveolar fibrosis in SARS and more fulminant necrotizing and haemorrhagic pneumonia in H5N1 influenza. Secondly, the path...","Abstract An emerging infectious disease (EID) is defined as a disease caused by a pathogen that has not been observed previously within a population or geographic location. Viruses are a major cause of EIDs, particularly \u2212ssRNA viruses. Many variables are involved in the emergence or reemergence of viruses. These can be classified into human factors, environmental/ecological factors, and viral factors and include urbanization, globalization, weather and climate change, and the genetic composition of the virus. The great majority of emerging viral diseases are zoonoses, notably transmitted by arthropods and nonhuman mammals. Flaviviruses include several notable vector-transmitted viruses, while rodents and bats are thought to be the natural reservoirs of arenaviruses and filoviruses, respectively. This chapter discusses several notable outbreaks of emerging and reemerging viruses, including the 2014\u201315 outbreak of Ebolavirus in West Africa.","Summary Background Public health measures to prevent, detect, and respond to events are essential to control public health risks, including infectious disease outbreaks, as highlighted in the International Health Regulations (IHR). In light of the outbreak of 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), we aimed to review existing health security capacities against public health risks and events. Methods We used 18 indicators from the IHR State Party Annual Reporting (SPAR) tool and associated data from national SPAR reports to develop five indices: (1) prevent, (2) detect, (3) respond, (4) enabling function, and (5) operational readiness. We used SPAR 2018 data for all of the indicators and categorised countries into five levels across the indices, in which level 1 indicated the lowest level of national capacity and level 5 the highest. We also analysed data at the regional level (using the six geographical WHO regions). Findings Of 182 countries, 52 (28%) had prevent capacities at leve...","","The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak, which was identified in late 2019, requires special attention because of its future epidemics and possible global threats. Beside clinical procedures and treatments, since Artificial Intelligence (AI) promises a new paradigm for healthcare, several different AI tools that are built upon Machine Learning (ML) algorithms are employed for analyzing data and decision-making processes. This means that AI-driven tools help identify COVID-19 outbreaks as well as forecast their nature of spread across the globe. However, unlike other healthcare issues, for COVID-19, to detect COVID-19, AI-driven tools are expected to have active learning-based cross-population train/test models that employs multitudinal and multimodal data, which is the primary purpose of the paper.","Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a new human disease caused by an animal coronavirus that adapted to efficient human-to-human transmission. The disease first emerged in November 2002 in Guangdong Province, China and spread globally within months. The SARS coronavirus (SARS CoV) affects multiple organ systems with severe viral pneumonia as its main clinical manifestation but with diarrhea, lymphopenia, and mild liver dysfunction being common extra-pulmonary manifestations. Increasing age and the presence of underlying respiratory diseases worsens the prognosis. Unlike other respiratory viral infections, transmission of SARS was less frequent in the first 5days of illness and correlated with low viral load in the upper respiratory tract at this stage of the illness. This fortuitous feature of the disease allowed the public health measures of case detection and patient isolation to interrupt virus transmission in the community and abort the SARS outbreak. Bats are a reservoir o...","A major focus of systems biology is to characterize interactions between cellular components, in order to develop an accurate picture of the intricate networks within biological systems. Over the past decade, protein microarrays have greatly contributed to advances in proteomics and are becoming an important platform for systems biology. Protein microarrays are highly flexible, ranging from large-scale proteome microarrays to smaller customizable microarrays, making the technology amenable for detection of a broad spectrum of biochemical properties of proteins. In this article, we will focus on the numerous studies that have utilized protein microarrays to reconstruct biological networks including protein\u2013DNA interactions, posttranslational protein modifications (PTMs), lectin\u2013glycan recognition, pathogen\u2013host interactions and hierarchical signaling cascades. The diversity in applications allows for integration of interaction data from numerous molecular classes and cellular states, pr...","Abstract In 2009, a novel H1N1 Influenza virus has emerged and on June 11 the World Health Organization declared it as pandemic. It may cause acute respiratory failure ranging from severe Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome to exacerbations of airflow limitation. Non-invasive ventilation is now considered first-line intervention for different causes of acute respiratory failure and may be considered in the context of H1N1 pandemic. Although infection control issues have been arisen, non-invasive ventilation was effective and safe during the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome in Asia. It is reasonable to recommend non-invasive ventilation in H1N1-related exacerbations of chronic respiratory diseases, especially in negative-pressure wards. Treatment of early Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome associated with H1N1 using non-invasive ventilation could be tried rapidly identifying those who fail without delaying endotracheal intubation. Considering the high demand for critical care beds dur...","Abstract In 2009, a novel H1N1 Influenza virus has emerged and on June 11 the World Health Organization declared it as pandemic.

Therefore, a rapid and cost-effective pathogen screening method with broad coverage is required for prevention and control of infectious diseases. The availability of a large number of microbial genome sequences generated by conventional Sanger sequencing and next generation sequencing has enabled the development of a high-throughput high-density microarray platform for rapid large-scale screening of vertebrate pathogens. METHODS: An easy operating pathogen microarray (EOPM) was designed to detect almost all known pathogens and related species based on their genomic sequences. For effective identification of pathogens from EOPM data, a statistical enrichment algorithm has been proposed, and further implemented in a user-friendly web-based interface. RESULTS: Using multiple probes designed to specifically detect a microbial genus or species, EOPM can correctly identify k...","Abstract We report a familial cluster of 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) to evidence that a potential transmission of the COVID-19 during the incubation period. The first patient in this familial cluster was identified in presymptomatic period, as a close contact of a confirmed patient. Five family members had close contact with the first patient during his incubation period, four of them were confirmed to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in the subsequent sampling test.","","AbstractIn numerous instances, tracking the biological significance of a nucleic acid sequence can be augmented through the identification of environmental niches in which the sequence of interest is present. Many metagenomic datasets are now available, with deep sequencing of samples from diverse biological niches. While any individual metagenomic dataset can be readily queried using web-based tools, meta-searches through all such datasets are less accessible.

These issues and considerations include cross-hybridizations, orthogonal probe binding to target DNA from the specific organism(s) of interest and vice versa, uniformity of annealing temperatures (or GC content) and probe length. The occurrence of false positives and false negatives is highly problematic because they might cause an (a) As discussed in this article, DNA microarrays can be applied to test for DNA from pathogenic organisms or for the resequencing of pathogen genomes. (b) Antibody microarrays can be used to detect pathogen proteins or antigens that might be present in environmental samples as an indication of contamination or for diagnostic purposes to determine pathogen infection in human tissues. (c) Small-molecule microarrays offer novel approaches for differentiating between pathogens, for example by clustering the binding signatures obtained for each pathogen. They can also be used to identify therapeutics that could potentially disrupt the infection cycle.","As mentioned above, the HCoV-NL63 load in the singly infected group (n = 20) was on average high, although there were a few samples with a load below 10,000 copies/ml (n = 6). The HCoV-NL63 load may be related to the date of sampling relative to the onset of disease. We therefore compared the viral load of these patients with the number of days after the onset of disease that the sample was taken. For the group with a high viral load (&gt;10,000 copies/ml), the median time of sampling after onset of disease was 2 d, whereas the median interval was 6 d for the group with the lower viral load. However, the variation in number of days from onset of disease to sampling was high, and the difference between the high and low viral load group was not statistically significant (p = 0.11).","In The Lancet Infectious Diseases, Francois-Xavier Lescure and colleagues 1 describe the first cases of coronavirus disease 2019 in Europe, which were reported in France. The detailed clinical features of five patients with COVID-19 are aligned with the quantitative severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) viral RNA load from nasopharyngeal and other selected sampling sites. Previous studies in patients with SARS, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), and COVID-19 generally provide insufficient detail to allow examination of the relationship between individual patient clinical course and viral RNA load. [2] [3] [4] Although patient numbers are small, the authors provide the first COVID-19 time series correlating viral RNA load and detailed clinical manifestations. 1 Importantly, the dataset is provided in sufficient detail so it could be readily combined with future similar studies for deeper analysis.","For the case N = 3, we may write the equations in the same compact form as above. The equation below (representing all 73 = 343 states of the process) includes terms featuring \u03b3 for individuals progressing from latency, terms featuring \u03c1 for removal of the infective, terms featuring \u03bb(X 1, X 2, X 3) for disease transmission within the cluster, terms featuring \u03c9 for postexposure preventive measures, and terms featuring \u03b4 ij for disclosure of contacts.","The information provided by To and colleagues is solid scientific evidence on COVID-19 for clinicians and scientists. Nonetheless, many questions are still outstanding on the viral characteristics and host response during infection. SARS-CoV-2 has been detected in faeces, blood, and urine samples, 9, 10 and it is important to ascertain viral load dynamics in such samples, for prevention and control of the pandemic. Furthermore, the relation between viral load and disease severity needs to be further clarified. Studies with a larger sample size are needed to understand how different factors can affect viral load or antibody response. For example, immunocompromised patients might have higher viral load, prolonged viral shedding, and impaired antibody response. Future studies in the paediatric population are vital, because children seem to have much milder disease than in adults. Finally, a more detailed understanding of the innate and adaptive immune response against SARS-CoV-2 is important for understanding the pathogenesis and for designing vaccines.","Environmental DNA and in particular its subdiscipline invertebrate-derived DNA viral hybridization capture may be a useful and economical tool for identifying and characterizing major viral pathogens particularly in difficult to access sampling environments prior to viral emergence. Sampling in environments where direct access to animals is difficult or highly restricted, eDNA and iDNA may be the only option to detect viral pathogens in the wild. The current study suggests this approach will be successful in either complementing or replacing invasive approaches.","Christina Como (University of Colorado School of Medicine, Aurora, CO, USA) presented her progress in developing and in vitro model of varicella zoster virus latency. Varicella zoster virus (VZV) is an alphaherpesvirus that causes varicella (chicken pox) and establishes latency in sensory neurons along the entire human neuraxis. Virus reactivation is commonly observed in the elderly and immunosuppressed individuals and results typically in shingles, but can also cause postherpetic neuralgia, vasculopathy, and ocular diseases. Although there is a vaccine to mitigate varicella, the vaccine is a live attenuated virus that can still enter latency and reactivate to cause disease. Currently, there is no animal model available to study VZV, making it important to design a cell model for latency and reactivation. It is hypothesized that a persistent release of cytokines suppresses virus and contributes to latency in human neurons. We hypothesize that VZV-infected neurons treated with cytokines will establish latency in vitro. Our results suggest interleukin 6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1, interferon alpha (IFN\u03b1), and IFN\u03b2 individually aid in limiting VZV growth and spread. This provides a better understanding of the relationship between the immune system, human neurons, and VZV latency. Using this model and understanding these interactions may lead to treatment options for patients experiencing VZV pathology.","Scientific research is of vital importance for tackling emerging infectious diseases and developing effective intervention methods. The spread of infectious diseases is affected not only by the biological characteristics of the pathogen but also by various other factors such as politics, culture, economy, and the environment. Multidisciplinary research in biomedical, social, and environmental sciences is required to achieve a deeper understanding of disease transmission and develop more effective systems for emergency response.","Indeed, epidemiologic evidence should be linked with the seasonal time during the year for different zoonoses, and/or with any symptoms related to zoonotic infections that occur on the mainland a few years earlier. Up to date ecological factors on evolutionary issues, social movements, economic, and epidemiological mechanisms affecting zoonotic pathogens\u2019 or their persistence and emergence, are not yet well understood. However, studies on the ecological, socioeconomic, and health issues are needed to assess the sustainability and acceptability of measures by breeders, as well as information that ensures appropriate slaughtering or consumption practices, which will decrease the risk of infection to humans [200]. Due to these facts about the ecological cascade and evolutionary perspectives, authorities can provide valuable insights into pathogen ecology and can inform zoonotic disease control programs; and thus evaluate their global effect in terms of actual disease and its socioeconomic correlations.","Public health efforts to control and prevent infectious diseases are based on epidemiologic and laboratory surveillance systems that detect and monitor disease incidence, define pathogen characteristics, and track cases 'by person, place and time' [25]. Molecular epidemiology has long been a mainstay of public health surveillance; now, increasingly powerful molecular methods, including sequencing of whole pathogen genomes, help investigators to identify epidemiologically related cases, describe patterns of transmission, pinpoint sources of infection, and explain antimicrobial resistance [26-33]. Combining the methods of molecular pathogenomics with population genetics and epidemiology can provide new insights into the episodic behavior of epidemics of familiar pathogens, such as group A streptococcus [7]. Archived biological samples can also provide new insights into the emergence and evolution of infectious threats, from HIV [34] to influenza [35]. Building the capacity for human biological sample collection into existing surveillance networks has the potential to facilitate a more comprehensive, population-based evaluation of genomic and environmental determinants of health outcomes. For example, a meta-analysis of surveillance cohorts from Arizona, Colorado, California, and Illinois demonstrated that human homozygosity for CCR5delta32 (a non-functional variant of chemokine receptor CCR5) is consistently associated with symptomatic West Nile virus infection [36]. When disease surveillance is conducted independently in multiple jurisdictions, the capacity to share biological samples and epidemiologic and clinical data provides important infrastructure for research.","There is now evidence that such health crises are to resurge periodically: what about preparedness plans? Plans would address public health issues but also anthropological, sociological, ethical and philosophical questions (and perhaps legal ones). Plans would prepare the question of the collection, process and application of substances of human origin, of which blood and blood components. The \"next one\" may associate stringent viremia at the onset of the contamination and ahead the patient becomes symptomatic, if he/she becomes symptomatic. Pathogen inactivation/reduction technologies have been designed largely on this hypothesis, but run late in terms of clinical trials (for whole blood and red blood cell concentrate) to verify the absence of unacceptable complications, and public decision making to allow budgets and afford expenses. Would expenses be mitigated by the maintenance of blood transfusion as a service to populations in need, provided that the inventory is maintained thanks to sufficient blood donors capable of running to blood establishments?","Several factors contribute to a relatively high false-negative incidence in the nucleic acid test: (1) the sensitivity of the detection kits; (2) inappropriate clinical sampling from patients; (3) the original viral load. The first factor is a concern for the manufacturers while the second can be remedied through staff training. The last factor, however, links to the progression of COVID-19, which is patient-specific. In other words, the viral load has demonstrated individual heterogeneity, and has gone beyond doctors' subjective evaluation. Hence, it is essential to 5 conduct the test when viral load is high. Consequently, the right timing for the test will avoid repeated sampling, reduce exposure risk for outpatients and healthcare providers, and improve the efficiency of medical efforts to contain the epidemic.","Since 2011, the classification of coronaviruses and other nidoviruses has been assisted by the DEmARC (DivErsity pArtitioning by hieRarchical Clustering) software which defines taxa and ranks 22 . Importantly, the involvement of all coronavirus genome sequences available at the time of analysis allows family-wide designations of demarcation criteria for all ranks, including species, regardless of the taxa sampling size, be it a single or hundreds of virus(es). DEmARC delineates monophyletic clusters (taxa) of viruses, using weighted linkage clustering in the pairwise patristic distance (PPD) space and according to the classification ranks defined through clustering cost (CC) minima presented as PPD thresholds. The persistence of thresholds in the face of increasing virus sampling is interpreted in the DEmARC framework as a reflection of biological forces and environmental factors 41 .","Human coronaviruses can remain infectious on inanimate surfaces at room temperature for up to 9 days. At a temperature of 30 C or more the duration of persistence is shorter. Veterinary coronaviruses have been shown to persist even longer for 28 d. Contamination of frequent touch surfaces in healthcare settings are therefore a potential source of viral transmission. Data on the transmissibility of coronaviruses from contaminated surfaces to hands were not found. However, it could be shown with influenza A virus that a contact of 5 s can transfer 31.6% of the viral load to the hands [9] . The transfer efficiency was lower (1.5%) with parainfluenza virus 3 and a 5 s contact between the surface and the hands [10] . In an observational study, it was described that students touch their face with their own hands on average 23 times per h, with contact mostly to the skin (56%), followed by mouth (36%), nose (31%) and eyes (31%) [11] . Although the viral load of coronaviruses on inanimate surfaces is not known during an outbreak situation it seem plausible to reduce the viral load on surfaces by disinfection, especially of frequently touched surfaces in the immediate patient surrounding where the highest viral load can be expected. The WHO recommends \"to ensure that environmental cleaning and disinfection procedures are followed consistently and correctly. Thoroughly cleaning environmental surfaces with water and detergent and applying commonly used hospital-level disinfectants (such as sodium hypochlorite) are effective and sufficient procedures.\" [12] The typical use of bleach is at a dilution of 1:100 of 5% sodium hypochlorite resulting in a final concentration of 0.05% [13] . Our summarized data with coronaviruses suggest that a concentration of 0.1% is effective in 1 min (Table III) . That is why it seems appropriate to recommend a dilution 1:50 of standard bleach in the coronavirus setting. For the disinfection of small surfaces ethanol (62e71%; carrier tests) revealed a similar efficacy against coronavirus. A concentration of 70% ethanol is also recommended by the WHO for disinfecting small surfaces [13] .","The outbreak of COVID-19 in Wuhan in December 2019 has led to a serious public 69 health event [1] [2] [3] . Meanwhile, the outbreak of this novel virus has placed 70 unprecedented challenges on hospital environmental hygiene. The occurrence of 71 medical staff-associated infections is closely related to long-lived pathogens in the 72 hospital environment [4, 5] . Thus, it is crucial to assess hospital environmental hygiene 73 to understand the most important environmental issues for controlling the spread of 74 COVID-19 in hospitals. The Chinese government quickly adopted quarantine 75 measures for confirmed and suspected patients to restrain the spread of the 76 pandemic [6] . Comprehensive monitoring of hospital environmental hygiene during the 77 outbreak of the pandemic is conducive to the refinement of hospital infection control 78 [5, 7] . It also increases understanding of the environmental challenges corresponding to 79 the reemergence of COVID-19 or similar viruses. Therefore, it is of great significance 80 to ensure the safety of medical treatment and the quality of hospital infection control 81 through the monitoring of environmental hygiene. According to a report from the The environmental monitoring methods referenced the hospital sanitation standards 106 (GB15982-2012).

There are also cultural and practical issues associated with changing how we farm and stopping the wildlife trade, which are equally hard to implement.","Contamination of frequent touch surfaces in healthcare settings are a potential source of viral transmission.

DeSantis and colleagues [23] generated a high-density tiling microarray with 62 358 oligonucleotide probes of ssu rRNA with sufficient coverage to detect 18 different orders of microbes from environmental samples, as well as novel variants that exhibited mutations in their ssu rRNA. The array fluorescence intensities correlated well with the spiked pathogen concentrations, providing a means of quantifying the pathogen Box 1. Bioterror agent classification Biohazardous agents that pose a significant threat require special attention, especially in the implementation of regulatory measures and controls to limit their access and distribution and to prevent them from falling into the wrong hands. In addition, such measures also aim to raise awareness within national healthcare systems and amongst healthcare providers, especially in cases where these bioterror threats are only rarely seen. The US Centers of Disease Control (CDC) have compiled a list of 36 biohazardous agents, which are divided into the categories A, B and C according to the level of threat they impose, and their characteristics are described here. Examples of pathogens from these three categories are provided in Table 1 .","\u2022 Ensure there is sufficient capacity in terms of infrastructure, human resources, materials and self-protective equipment to respond to the increase number of deaths.

However, both conventional and real-time PCR are currently accepted as the most sensitive diagnostic methods. Positive results by PCR should be interpreted with caution, given the propensity of adenoviruses to cause latency. Quantitative real-time PCR can also be used to monitor viral load in transplant recipients or immunosuppressed patients, allowing for appropriate interventions to be initiated, such as immunosuppressive regimen adjustment.","The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10. 1101 /2020 In addition to methylation at the 5' cap structure and 3' polyadenylation needed for efficient Table 2 ).

More specifically, these studies have reported the most common symp toms, incubation periods, biological abnormalities, radio graphic abnormalities, CT abnormalities, and treatment data. In addition, they have described varying degrees of illness and their severity: mild, severe, or critical. They have reported proportion of complications, including acute respiratory distress syndrome, or case fatality rates, and variables associated with these complications and death. 1, [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] In this Article, through a detailed and comprehensive sampling strategy, we report the clinical and biological features of the first five cases of confirmed COVID-19 in Europe, which occurred in France, and their dynamics in parallel with changes in their viral load, based on severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA detection.","The assessment of tissue tropism and viral load are vital for a better understanding of the pathogenesis of CRCoV, and has important implications in disease management and outcome. With this in mind the ability of the real-time qPCR to detect and quantify CRCoV viral loads was assessed using a range of post-mortem tissues collected from dogs that were infected naturally with the virus.","Our experiments showed that UVC light, heat, formalin, glutaraldehyde, and extremes of pH, were able to inactivate SARS-CoV. However, gamma irradiation at the doses tested, was not sufficient to inactivate the virus. As expected, neither viral RNA alone nor virions disrupted by SDS/NP-40 were infectious. These conditions were appropriate for our viral stocks as described, however, we caution that researchers need to test viral stocks for complete inactivation before handling the virus at lower safety levels. These data analyze virus samples in tissue culture medium and we are currently testing the inactivation properties required of SARS-CoV in biological (body) fluids. Understanding the ways in which SARS-CoV can be inactivated, will allow the transfer of the virus from BSL3 to BSL2 conditions, and will promote the study of inactivated viral vaccines.","Coronavirus disease 2019 , caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), was first reported from China in December, 2019. 1 Although Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) 2 and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) 3 infections have a higher mortality rate than does COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2 spreads much more rapidly than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV. Reliable data for profiles of serial viral load and serum antibody responses are needed urgently to guide antiviral treatment, infection control, epidemiological measures, and vaccination. The peak viral load of patients with MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV infections occurs at around 7-10 days after symptom onset, which could be associa ted with nosocomial outbreaks involving healthcare workers. 2, 4 Clinical studies of antiviral agents for SARS showed that the viral load decreased significantly with treatment success. 5 No systematic study of these two important variables with statistical analysis has been done for SARS-CoV-2, although preliminary descriptive studies have been reported. [6] [7] [8] In most studies of respiratory virus infections, serial sampling of nasopharyngeal or throat swabs is used for viral load monitoring. However, collection of nasopharyngeal or throat swab specimens can induce coughing and sneezing, which generates aerosol and is a potential health hazard for health-care workers. Collection of throat swabs also requires direct inspection of the patient's posterior pharynx and tonsils. Furthermore, collection of nasopharyngeal specimens is a relatively invasive procedure, which is uncomfortable and can even induce bleeding. A patient's reluctance to provide a sample can account for the paucity of timepoints in viral load studies of respiratory virus infections. Findings of previous studies have shown high concordance between saliva and nasopharyngeal aspirate as specimens for laboratory diagnosis of respi ratory viruses. 9 We have reported use of posterior oro pharyngeal (deep throat) saliva for diagnosis and viral load monitoring in a cohort of 12 patients with COVID-19. 6 Here, we report use of self-collected posterior oro pharyn geal saliva samples from patients with COVID-19, which avoids close contact between healthcare workers and patients, for viral load monitoring. We also monitored serial serum antibody levels of patients.","Latency is noted for a lack of viral replication and an extremely limited pattern of viral transcription. Periodic reactivation from latency results in the production of progeny virions which transport back down the axon to mucosal epithelial cells, where they replicate and the infectious virus is released from the mucosal epithelium. For BV, most episodes of recurrent viral shedding are asymptomatic Weigler et al., 1993; Zwartouw and Boulter, 1984) , and represent a constant risk of zoonoses. Clinical signs of either primary or recurrent infection (oral herpetic lesions such as gingivostomatitis, oral and lingual ulcers, and conjunctivitis) are the exception (Carlson et al., 1997; Keeble et al., 1958; Weigler, 1992) , and usually require immediate euthanasia of the animal. Virus isolation and molecular detection of BV DNA indicate that the frequency of shedding in a population is low (1-5%), although more studies are needed to establish a true rate. There is evidence to suggest that shedding frequency may go up during breeding season Weigler et al., 1993) .","These qualitative data provide a sampling of the recommendations that are directed at surgical teams that arise from accreditation surveys. In this sample, process issues are addressed with a very high frequency relative to outcome issues. This would imply that surgeons in the accredited organisations need to become more proactive in the functioning of the surgical team and to participate more effectively in management issues related to surgical care. Attention to these details will position surgical programmes to effectively deal with the rapid pace of change that is inherent in a modern surgical practice.","In Italy, the tests were carried out mainly on the symptomatic subjects for Covid-19. Tests have not been carried out initially in healthcare professionals (who could, therefore, have contributed to the spread of the disease), in patients' sick in-home quarantine. Finally, Italy, like the majority of nations, was not prepared for the rapid spread of the pandemic and many protection systems such as masks, produced almost exclusively abroad, were not sufficient even for health personnel and simply there were no enough ventilators for all patients who needed them, raising important ethical issues.","The OECD (1986) report, which set benchmarks for international harmonization of the regulatory framework, reviews national positions on safety of recombinant (r-DNA) organisms for industrial, agricultural and environmental use, and existing or proposed regulations for r-DNA organisms. It also identifies criteria for authorization of the use of r-DNA organisms and explores ways of monitoring production and use in these sectors, in the belief that 'a common understanding of these safety issues will provide the basis for taking initial steps toward international accord, the protection of health and of the environment, the promotion of international commerce, and the reduction of national barriers to trade in the field of biotechnology'.","Assessments of IHR (2005) capacities reveal that advances have been made since 2010 in many countries to better detect potential outbreaks of infectious diseases early and test suspect cases rapidly-eg, the early detection and verification of the novel coronavirus cases by China and other countries. 38 All countries are at risk of COVID-19 and other outbreaks of infectious diseases, and countries vary widely in terms of their capacity to prevent, detect, and control outbreaks COVID-19 is not fully understood, which can further aggravate the situation. Therefore these findings should be combined with the latest risk assessments that are available for COVID-19 and other assessments to understand the existing capacities. The WHO Secretariat is developing the preparedness dashboard (a data visualisation platform that will include a query system) to provide real-time information that is based on various capacity assessments. Despite the gains made in understanding the pathogen, many countries are underprepared to manage cases within their borders. Investments in preparedness urgently need to be scaled up to ensure that vulnerable countries are operationally ready and capable to respond to public health events such as the COVID-19 outbreak.","Evidence before this study We searched PubMed on Feb 24, 2020, with no limitations by starting date, with the terms \"COVID-19\", \"coronavirus\", \"antibody\", and \"viral load\"; we restricted our search to articles published in English. Our search did not retrieve any reports on clinical progression of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID- 19) with respect to temporal viral load and concomitant serum antibody profiles. We identified one correspondence piece on viral load with no statistical analysis, and another article with a few cases of antibody response.","Varicella-zoster (VZV) causes chickenpox and the virus establishes latency in cranial nerve and dorsal root ganglia. VZV DNA was detected in 4% of neurons from human trigeminal ganglia at autopsy with a median of 7 viral genomes per positive neuron. Latent VZV DNA was rarely, if ever, detected in nonneuronal cells. The virus can reactivate from latently infected ganglia to cause shingles. The varicella vaccine virus may also reactivate and cause shingles, especially in immunocompromised patients. We have used PCR to detect VZV DNA in the blood of immunocompromised patients who present with abdominal pain in the absence of a rash, to allow early therapy prior to development of the rash of shingles. At least six VZV genes (genes 4, 21, 29, 62, 63, and 66) are expressed in latently infected ganglia in humans. We have constructed VZV mutants lacking five of these genes and found that three of the genes are essential for replication in cell culture, one is important for efficient replication, and one is dispensable for replication. Mutations in the coding region of one of the latency genes (gene 63) resulted in impairment in replication in vitro and a marked reduction in latency in rodents. Replacement of the native promoter for one of the latency genes (gene 29), with the major immediate-early cytomegalovirus promoter, resulted in a virus that replicated to levels comparable to wild-type virus, but the virus was impaired for latency in rodents. These studies suggest that changes in the coding or promoter region of latency genes in VZV might serve as useful vaccine candidates. Such vaccines might be less likely to establish latency and reactivate in humans, and may be especially useful in immunocompromised patients.","Overall, the most common, and sensitive, diagnostic tool is reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Using real time methods, RT-PCR can be used to generate quantitative results to assess viral load as well as detect the virus. As discussed previously, high viral load is associated with increased disease severity, so assessing viral load may be beneficial to judge likelihood of severe disease developing.","Evidence before this study We searched PubMed Central for all studies or reports presenting clinical characteristics of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), using the terms \"COVID-19\" and \"clinical\" or \"2019-nCoV\" and \"clinical\" from database inception to Feb 24, 2020 . No language restrictions were applied. Our search returned 134 publications. These papers described demographic, clinical, and biological characteristics of patients with COVID-19, and radiological or pathological findings associated with, COVID-19. In particular, they reported most common symptoms, incubation periods, biological abnormalities, radiographic abnormalities, CT abnormalities, and treatment data. They also described varying degrees of illness and their severity: mild, severe, or critical. They reported proportion of complications, including acute respiratory distress syndrome, or case fatality rates and variables associated with these complications and death. In addition, these studies reported data on virus shedding. They studied in particular dynamics of the viral load in sputum, urine, throat swab, and stool samples in symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals. They also evaluated virus shedding in patients who had recovered.","Pneumonia acquired outside the hospital or identified within 48 hours of admission (with presumed acquisition prior to hospitalisation) is defined as community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). Pneumonia acquired in the hospital or up to 1 week after discharge (with presumed acquisition during hospitalisation) is defined as hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). Healthcare-associated pneumonia (HCAP) is acquired by patients in frequent contact with the healthcare system (eg, haemodialysis patients, nursing home patients). HCAP deserves separate recognition, as treatment issues are more similar to HAP than CAP. Scoring systems may aid the decision of where (eg, outpatient setting or in hospital) and how aggressively to treat pneumonia patients. Appropriate sampling with sufficient sputum for culture can be obtained in only half of pneumonia patients, so antibiotic therapy is often based on suspected infection and knowledge of probable pathogens. Most prevalent in CAP is Streptococcus pneumoniae followed by Haemophilus influenzae, while Gram-negative bacilli and Staphylococcus aureus are most common in HAP, with risk of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and S. aureus highest in pneumonia that develops from 2 days to a week after hospitalisation.","Assessing and managing the threat of an emerging infectious disease requires an understanding of the biology of the pathogen, its epidemiology, the clinical manifestations of infection, the methods of diagnosis, and therapies (if available). In addition, there are a number of issues more specific to infection control ( Table 2) . Key information on the infectious diseases discussed in detail in this article is provided in Table 3 .","With advanced molecular diagnostic techniques (see below), it is now possible to rapidly and simultaneously detect multiple pathogens within biological samples. In recent years, multiplex reverse-transcription PCR has changed our understanding of the viral causes of respiratory illness, and doubtless newer technologies such as 16S rRNA gene sequencing will have a similar effect on how we view bacterial causes over the coming years.","Of more than 500 arboviruses known, at least 100 are pathogenic for humans and at least 20 would meet the criteria for emergent viruses. Attempts to control these diseases rely on twin approaches involving both the control of insect vectors responsible for transmission of the virus to humans and the development of vaccines to protect human populations. However, both of these approaches present considerable difficulties, the former in terms of avoiding environmental damage and the latter in terms of understanding virus pathogenesis and developing appropriate vaccines (see earlier discussion of dengue virus pathogenesis this disease. RVFV continues to extend its range in Africa and the Middle East and is a significant health and economic burden in many areas of Africa, remaining a serious threat to other parts of the world.","The report notes: \"In reality, in many crises, security officers \u2026 are the first responders.\" The action items from the summit will require support if they are to make a difference. perhaps further summits will be needed. But domestic and global crime, terrorism, and environmental emergencies are too great for the public sector to handle alone. Liking it or not, private security is being drawn into a new uncharted phase that demands greater professionalism and reliability. In turn, private security deserves something back, for example, better and faster intelligence on issues that affect them from law enforcement at all levels.",", i\u03b5 1/lnip n = and 2) latency rate for the infectious period -latency rate infectious epsilon ( i\u03b5 ):","Response latency describes the delay in pupil constriction following the onset of a light stimulus, with the latency shortening as light intensity increases, to a minimum of 180\u2013230 ms [7,8]. The latency period is due to the delay in iris smooth muscle contraction and to a lesser extent the temporal dynamics of retinal output and innervation pathways [7,8]. ","The pathogen behind the current pandemic COVID-19 derives its uniqueness from its molecular structure, discussed above. Even casual contact such as handshakes is sufficient to spread this deadly virus, and its epidemiology makes it hard to detect this infection at an early stage. Scientists have found that the pathogen remains on surfaces for a long time ranging from 3 hours in aerosols, 24 hours on cardboard and up to 3 days on plastic and stainless steel. Worse still, a large number of affected patients don't show symptoms for five or more days after exposure.","ABH Alpha-ketoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase (ABH1, DNA lyase ABH1, EC 4.2.99.18, alkylated DNA repair protein alkB homologue 1, EC 1.14.11.-, 389aa), a dioxygenase that repairs alkylated single-stranded DNA and RNA containing 3-methylcytosine by oxidative demethylation.

Unlike SARSr-CoV, 2019-nCoV is contagious during the latency period [15].","Ertan was China\u2019s first dam built with international bids, and accounts for its largest World Bank loan (nearly $1 billion). Ertan is also China\u2019s first attempt to reach an \u201cinternational standard\u201d for managing resettlement of the 46,000 people displaced by its construction, and for mitigating adverse ecological impacts. Two panels of experts\u2014one to manage environmental issues and one to manage resettlement issues\u2014met frequently during the years of dam construction (1991\u20131999).

However, the sole international health specialist, who served on both panels, was permitted to focus on only one problem\u2014schistosome infection.","Emerging infectious viruses increasingly threaten human, domestic animal and wildlife health [12] . Sixty percent of emerging infectious diseases in humans are of zoonotic origin [13] . Wildlife trade and consumption of bushmeat, especially in Africa and Asia, have increasingly played a role in pathogen spillovers into human populations [14, 15] . Wildlife markets have recently facilitated the spillover of SARS-CoV-2 to humans [16] resulting in a pandemic [17] . The 2002-2003 SARS-CoV outbreak [18] , the Ebola outbreak in West Africa [19] and the global emergence of HIV [20] have all been linked to wildlife trade and bushmeat consumption. Early detection of novel infectious agents in wildlife represent a key factor to prevent their emergence. However, identification, surveillance and monitoring of emerging viruses using currently broadly applied approaches based on direct sampling of wildlife requires enormous investment in sampling, particularly for viruses that have low prevalence [21] . For example, 25,000 wild birds were sampled in Germany to detect avian influenza prevalence below 1% [22] . Similarly, sampling of over 8,157 animals in Poland was required to determine an 0.12% prevalence of African swine fever virus (ASF) [23] .
