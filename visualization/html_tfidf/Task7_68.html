The system, based on earlier efforts in The Netherlands and Portugal, works with the participation of the population in each country to collect real-time information on the distribution of influenza-like illness cases through web surveys administered to volunteers reporting their symptoms (or lack of symptoms) every week during the influenza season. Such a large European-wide web-based monitoring infrastructure is intended to rapidly identify public health emergencies, contribute to understanding global trends, inform data-driven forecast models to assess the impact on the population, optimize the allocation of resources, and help in devising mitigation and co...","N4-hydroxycytidine (NHC) has been recently reported to have promising antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2. To join worldwide efforts in identifying potential drug targets against this pandemic, the target landscape of NHC was defined by extracting all known targets of its chemical neighborhood, including drugs, analogues, and metabolites, and by performing target predictions from two independent platforms, following the recent Public Health Assessment via Structural Evaluation (PHASE) protocol. The analysis provides a list of over 30 protein targets that could be useful in future design activities of new COVID-19 antivirals. The relevance for existing drugs within the same chemical space, such as remdesivir, is also discussed.","The recent Ebola and Zika epidemics demonstrate the need for the continuous surveillance, rapid diagnosis and real-time tracking of emerging infectious diseases. Fast, affordable sequencing of pathogen genomes \u2014 now a staple of the public health microbiology laboratory in well-resourced settings \u2014 can affect each of these areas. Coupling genomic diagnostics and epidemiology to innovative digital disease detection platforms raises the possibility of an open, global, digital pathogen surveillance system. When informed by a One Health approach, in which human, animal and environmental health are considered together, such a genomics-based system has profound potential to improve public health in settings lacking robust laboratory capacity. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The online version of this article (doi:10.1038/nrg.2017.88) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.","The pace of pathogen discovery is increasing dramatically. This reflects not only factors that enable the appearance and globalization of new microbial infections but also improvements in methods for ascertainment. New molecular diagnostic platforms; investments in pathogen surveillance in wildlife, domestic animals and humans; and the advent of social media tools that mine the world wide web for clues to outbreaks of infectious disease are proving invaluable in early recognition of threats to public health. Additionally, models of microbial pathogenesis are becoming more complex, providing insights into the mechanisms by which microorganisms can contribute to chronic illnesses like cancer, peptic ulcer disease and mental illness. Here we review the contributions of each of these elements to infectious disease emergence and strategies for addressing the challenges of pathogen surveillance and discovery.","Abstract A new system to recognize protein coding genes in the coronavirus genomes, specially suitable for the SARS-CoV genomes, has been proposed in this paper. Compared with some existing systems, the new program package has the merits of simplicity, high accuracy, reliability, and quickness. The system ZCURVE_CoV has been run for each of the 11 newly sequenced SARS-CoV genomes. Consequently, six genomes not annotated previously have been annotated, and some problems of previous annotations in the remaining five genomes have been pointed out and discussed. In addition to the polyprotein chain ORFs 1a and 1b and the four genes coding for the major structural proteins, spike (S), small envelop (E), membrane (M), and nuleocaspid (N), respectively, ZCURVE_CoV also predicts 5\u20136 putative proteins in length between 39 and 274 amino acids with unknown functions. Some single nucleotide mutations within these putative coding sequences have been detected and their biological implications are di...","Background: The recent outbreak of infections by the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), the third zoonotic CoV has raised great public health concern. The demand for rapid and accurate diagnosis of this novel pathogen brought significant clinical and technological challenges. Currently, metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) and reverse-transcription PCR (RT-PCR) are the most widely used molecular diagnostics. Methods: 2019-nCoV infections were confirmed in 52 specimens by mNGS. Genomic information was analyzed and used for the design and development of an isothermal, CRISPR-based diagnostic for this novel virus. The diagnostic performance of CRISPR-nCoV was assessed and compared across three technology platforms (mNGS, RT-PCR and CRISPR). Results: 2019-nCoVs sequenced in our study were conserved with the Wuhan strain, and shared certain genetic similarity with SARS-CoV. A high degree of variation in the level of viral RNA was observed in clinical specimens. CRISPR-nCoV demonst...","Abstract Data on the burden of disease and circulation patterns of influenza B lineages for Brazil are limited. This review aims to describe the pattern of influenza B occurrence in Brazil to have a better understanding of its epidemiology and its relevance when considering seasonal influenza vaccine composition. A review of the data including analysis of international and local surveillance data as well as information from online search of databases using Medical Subject Headings terms in conjunction with screening of abstracts from scientific events was performed. Based on international epidemiologic surveillance data, moderate levels of influenza B disease (19%; 2006\u20132014) were observed. Of these nine years, it was possible to compare data from three years (2007, 2008 and 2013) which have information on the circulating influenza B lineage. Co-circulation of influenza B lineages was observed in all these three influenza seasons, of which, during one season, a high degree of mismatch ...","Abstract Background Viral Infectious clone systems serve as robust platforms to study viral gene or replicative function by reverse genetics, formulate vaccines and adapt a wild type-virus to an animal host. Since the development of the first viral infectious clone system for the poliovirus, novel strategies of viral genome construction have allowed for the assembly of viral genomes across the identified viral families. However, the molecular profiles of some viruses make their genome more difficult to construct than others. Two factors that affect the difficulty of infectious clone construction are genome length and genome complexity. Results This work examines the available strategies for overcoming the obstacles of assembling the long and complex RNA genomes of coronaviruses and reports one-step construction of an infectious clone system for the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) by homologous recombination in S. cerevisiae. Conclusions Future use of this method...","Our understanding of human disease and potential therapeutics is improving rapidly. In order to take advantage of these developments it is important to be able to identify disease markers. Many new high-throughput genomics and proteomics technologies are being implemented to identify candidate disease markers. These technologies include protein microarrays, next-generation DNA sequencing and mass spectrometry platforms. Such methods are particularly important for elucidating the repertoire of molecular markers in the genome, transcriptome, proteome and metabolome of patients with diseases such as cancer, autoimmune diseases, and viral infections, resulting from the disruption of many biological pathways. These new technologies have identified many potential disease markers. These markers are expected to be valuable to achieve the promise of truly personalized medicine.","Summary We tested the effect of alcohol hand rub in eradicating Escherichia coli, and compared it with hand wash using ozonized tap water or soap and water. Alcohol eradicated all bacteria in 10 of 35 participants, but with an average (SD) of 2330 (4227) CFU/mL left after disinfection, while ozonized water removed all bacteria in 10 of 55 participants, with an average of only 538 (801) CFU/mL left (p=0.045). Soap washing was the most effective with total removal of bacteria in 6 of 20 participants, with an average of 98 (139) CFU/ml (p=0.048 and 0.018 versus ozonized water and alcohol, respectively).","The novel coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19)epidemic has brought serious social psychological impact to the Chinese people, especially those quarantined and thus with limited access to face-to-face communication and traditional social psychological interventions. To better deal with the urgent psychological problems of people involved in the COVID-19 epidemic, we developed a new psychological crisis intervention model by utilizing internet technology. This new model, one of West China Hospital, integrates physicians, psychiatrists, psychologists and social workers into Internet platforms to carry out psychological intervention to patients, their families and medical staff. We hope this model will make a sound basis for developing a more comprehensive psychological crisis intervention response system that is applicable for urgent social and psychological problems.","Abstract Purpose Syndromic surveillance is aimed at early detection of disease outbreaks. An important data source for syndromic surveillance is free-text chief complaints (CCs), which may be recorded in different languages. For automated syndromic surveillance, CCs must be classified into predefined syndromic categories to facilitate subsequent data aggregation and analysis. Despite the fact that syndromic surveillance is largely an international effort, existing CC classification systems do not provide adequate support for processing CCs recorded in non-English languages. This paper reports a multilingual CC classification effort, focusing on CCs recorded in Chinese. Methods We propose a novel Chinese CC classification system leveraging a Chinese-English translation module and an existing English CC classification approach. A set of 470 Chinese key phrases was extracted from about one million Chinese CC records using statistical methods. Based on the extracted key phrases, the system...","Mass spectrometry (MS) has found numerous applications in life sciences. It has high accuracy, sensitivity and wide dynamic range in addition to medium- to high-throughput capabilities. These features make MS a superior platform for analysis of various biomolecules including proteins, lipids, nucleic acids and carbohydrates. Until recently, MS was applied for protein detection and characterization. During the last decade, however, MS has successfully been used for molecular diagnostics of microbial and viral infections with the most notable applications being identification of pathogens, genomic sequencing, mutation detection, DNA methylation analysis, tracking of transmissions, and characterization of genetic heterogeneity. These new developments vastly expand the MS application from experimental research to public health and clinical fields. Matching of molecular techniques with specific requirements of the major MS platforms has produced powerful technologies for molecular diagnosti...","Global gene expression analysis is beginning to move from the laboratories of basic investigators to large-scale clinical trials. The potential of this technology to improve diagnosis and tailored treatment of human disease may soon be realised, now that several comprehensive studies have demonstrated the utility of gene expression profiles for the classification of tumours into distinct, clinically relevant subtypes and the prediction of clinical outcomes. In addition, new data from the emerging proteomics platforms add another layer of molecular information to the study of human disease, as scientists attempt to catalogue a complete inventory of the proteins encoded by the genome and to establish a 'biosignature' profile of human health and disease. As a result, it is anticipated that, together, these technologies will facilitate the comprehensive study of genes, gene products and signalling pathways so that the objective of personalised molecular medicine can be achieved. This paper...","Problem: Due to the spread of SARS CoV-2 virus infection and COVID-2019 disease, there is an urgent need to analyze COVID-2019 epidemic perception in Poland. This would enable authorities for preparation of specific actions minimizing public health and economic risks. Methods: We study the perception of COVID-2019 epidemic in Polish society using quantitative analysis of its digital footprints on the Internet (on Twitter, Google, YouTube, Wikipedia and electronic media represented by Event Registry) from January 2020 to 12.03.2020 (before and after official introduction to Poland on 04.03.2020). To this end we utilize data mining, social network analysis, natural language processing techniques. Each examined internet platform was analyzed for representativeness and composition of the target group. Results: We identified three major cluster of the interest before disease introduction on the topic COVID-2019: China- and Italy-related peaks on all platforms, as well as a peak on social me...","Abstract Introduction Influenza is an important cause of morbimortality worldwide. Although people at the extremes of age have a greater risk of complications, influenza has been more frequently investigated in the elderly than in children, and inpatients than outpatients. Yearly vaccination with trivalent or quadrivalent vaccines is the main strategy to control influenza. Objectives Determine the clinical and molecular characteristics of influenza A and B infections in children and adolescents with influenza-like illness (ILI). Methods A cohort of outpatient children and adolescents with ILI was followed for 20 months. Influenza was diagnosed with commercial multiplex PCR platforms. Results 179 patients had 277 episodes of ILI, being 79 episodes of influenza A and 20 episodes of influenza B. Influenza A and B cases were mild and had similar presentation. Phylogenetic tree of influenza B viruses showed that 91.6% belonged to the B/Yamagata lineage, which is not included in trivalent va...","Background: Initial cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) reported in Hong Kong were mostly imported cases from Mainland China. However, most cases reported in February 2020 were local infections with unknown source, indicating local community transmissions. This study aimed to report the clinical, epidemiological and phylogenomic characteristics of the local cases of COVID-19 in our community. Methods: We extracted the demographic, clinical and epidemiological data from 50 COVID-19 patients, who accounted for 53.8% of the cases in Hong Kong by the end of February 2020. We used both Nanopore and Illumina platforms to perform whole-genome sequencing (WGS) of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) from these patients. Phylogenetic relatedness among these local cases and their placement in the global phylogeny were examined. The evolutionary rate and divergence time of transmission were also determined. Findings: Of these 50 patients, only three (6.0%) had...","Objectives: To examine heterogeneity of outcomes in protocols of clinical trials of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) and to identify outcomes for prioritization in developing a core outcome set (COS) in this field. Design: This study is a review. Data sources: Databases of ICMJE-accepted clinical trial registry platform were searched on February 14, 2020. Eligibility Criteria: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and non-RCTs of COVID-19 were considered.Conditions of patients include common type, severe type or critical type. Interventions include traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) and Western medicine. We excluded trials that for discharged patients, psychological intervention and complications of COVID-19. Data extraction and synthesis: The general information and outcomes, outcome measurement instruments and measurement times were extracted. The results were analysed by descriptive analysis. Results: 19 registry platforms were searched. A total of 97 protocols were included from 1...","Background: China has experienced an outbreak of a novel human coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) since December 2019, and it was announced a worldwide pandemic in March 2020. There is limited evidence on the mortality risk effect of pre-existing comorbidity for clinical disease (coronavirus disease 2019 [COVID-19]), which has important implications for early treatment. Objective: To evaluate the risk of the common preexisting comorbidities, including hypertension, coronary heart diseases (CHD), respiratory diseases and diabetes on COVID-19 mortality, and provide clinical suggestions accordingly. Method: This study used a nested case-control design to assess the impact of pre-existing comorbidities on the hazard of COVID-19 in mainland China. A total of 321 publicly reported confirmed cases (146 cases and 175 controls) with trackable time-to-death information and history of comorbidities were collected between December 18th, 2019 and March 8th, 20...","The COVID-19 pandemic is overwhelming healthcare systems worldwide. A significant portion of COVID-19 patients develop pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), necessitating ventilator support. Some health systems do not have the capacity to accommodate this surge in ventilator demand, leading to shortages and inevitable mortality. Some clinicians have, of necessity, jerry-rigged ventilators to support multiple patients, but these devices lack protected air streams or individualized controls for each patient. Moreover, some have not been tested under conditions of ARDS. We have developed the Individualized System for Augmenting Ventilator Efficacy (iSAVE), a rapidly deployable platform to more safely use a single ventilator to simultaneously support multiple critically-ill patients. The iSAVE enables patient-specific volume and pressure control and incorporates safety features to mitigate cross-contamination between patients and flow changes due to patient interdepende...","Ten years have elapsed since the World Health Organization issued its first global alert for an unexplained illness named severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). The anniversary provides an opportunity to reflect on the international response to this new global microbial threat. While global surveillance and response capacity for public health threats have been strengthened, critical gaps remain. Of 194 World Health Organization member states that signed on to the International Health Regulations (2005), &lt;20% had achieved compliance with the core capacities required by the deadline in June 2012. Lessons learned from the global SARS outbreak highlight the need to avoid complacency, strengthen efforts to improve global capacity to address the next pandemic using all available 21st century tools, and support research to develop new treatment options, countermeasures, and insights while striving to address the global inequities that are the root cause of many of these challenges.","The current state of much of the Wuhan pneumonia virus (COVID-19) research shows a regrettable lack of data sharing and considerable analytical obfuscation. This impedes global research cooperation, which is essential for tackling public health emergencies, and requires unimpeded access to data, analysis tools, and computational infrastructure. Here we show that community efforts in developing open analytical software tools over the past ten years, combined with national investments into scientific computational infrastructure, can overcome these deficiencies and provide an accessible platform for tackling global health emergencies in an open and transparent manner. Specifically, we use all COVID-19 genomic data available in the public domain so far to (1) underscore the importance of access to raw data and to (2) demonstrate that existing community efforts in curation and deployment of biomedical software can reliably support rapid, reproducible research during global health crises. A...","The transmission potential of a novel infection depends on both the inherent transmissibility of a pathogen, and the level of susceptibility in the host population. However, distinguishing between these pathogen- and population-specific properties typically requires detailed serological studies, which are rarely available in the early stages of an outbreak. Using a simple transmission model that incorporates age-stratified social mixing patterns, we present a novel method for characterizing the transmission potential of subcritical infections, which have effective reproduction number R&lt;1, from readily available data on the size of outbreaks. We show that the model can identify the extent to which outbreaks are driven by inherent pathogen transmissibility and pre-existing population immunity, and can generate unbiased estimates of the effective reproduction number. Applying the method to real-life infections, we obtained accurate estimates for the degree of age-specific immunity against...","To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate the facemask shortage during the novel coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19) outbreak in China. We have summarized in detail the management strategies implemented by the Chinese governments during the outbreaks. By considering three scenarios for the outbreak development, we simulated the facemasks availability from late-December 2019 to late-April 2020 and estimated the duration of sufficient facemask supplies. Our findings showed that if the COVID-19 outbreak occurred only in Wuhan city or Hubei province, facemask shortage would not appear with the existing public health measures. However, if the outbreak occurred in the whole of China, a shortage of facemask could be substantial assuming no alternative public health measures. Supplies of facemasks in the whole of China would have been sufficient for both healthcare workers and the general population if the COVID-19 outbreak only occurred in Wuhan city or Hubei province....","Surveillance is essential for communicable disease prevention and control. Traditional notification of demographic and clinical information, about individuals with selected (notifiable) infectious diseases, allows appropriate public health action and is protected by public health and privacy legislation, but is slow and insensitive. Big data\u2013based electronic surveillance, by commercial bodies and government agencies (for profit or population control), which draws on a plethora of internet- and mobile device\u2013based sources, has been widely accepted, if not universally welcomed. Similar anonymous digital sources also contain syndromic information, which can be analysed, using customised algorithms, to rapidly predict infectious disease outbreaks, but the data are nonspecific and predictions sometimes misleading. However, public health authorities could use these online sources, in combination with de-identified personal health data, to provide more accurate and earlier warning of infectio...","Abstract Timeliness is a critical issue in preventing the spread of emerging/notifiable infectious diseases, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) or avian influenza (bird flu). Current computerized surveillance systems in many countries have demonstrated their usefulness in detecting specified communicable-diseases. However, the off-line, daily or weekly data reporting mode induces a time lag in data collection, transmission, processing, and responses. This paper proposes an on-line real-time mechanism, named EDICTS, for emerging/notifiable infectious diseases control, tracking and surveillance. It is based on the on-line health IC card system and works at the registration process of primary care practices and emergency departments. Hence, should a disease defined by CDC (Center for disease control) be detected at the registration station, EDICTS responds in real time. Note that EDICTS is a mechanism; it is CDC that determines the policy and activates it. A prototype is des...","As of March 5, 2020, there has been sustained local transmission of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Hong Kong, Singapore, and Japan.1 Containment strategies seem to have prevented smaller transmission chains from amplifying into widespread community transmission. The health systems in these locations have generally been able to adapt,2 , 3 but their resilience could be affected if the COVID-19 epidemic continues for many more months and increasing numbers of people require services. We outline some of the core dimensions of these resilient health systems4 and their responses to the COVID-19 epidemic. First, after variable periods of adaptation, the three locations took actions to manage the outbreak of a new pathogen. Surveillance systems were readjusted to identify potential cases while public health staff identified their contacts. National laboratory networks developed diagnostic tests once the COVID-19 genetic sequences were published5 and laboratory testing capacity was inc...","The ongoing pandemic of 2019-nCov (COVID-19) coronavirus has made reliable epidemiological modeling an urgent necessity. Unfortunately, most of the existing models are either too fine-grained to be efficient or too coarse-grained to be reliable. Here we propose a computationally efficient hybrid approach that uses SIR model for individual cities which are in turn coupled via empirical transportation networks that facilitate migration among them. The treatment presented here differs from existing models in two crucial ways: first, self-consistent determination of coupling parameters so as to maintain the populations of individual cities, and second, the incorporation of distance dependent temporal delays in migration. We apply our model to Indian aviation as well as railway networks taking into account populations of more than 300 cities. Our results project that through the domestic transportation, the significant population is poised to be exposed within 90 days of the onset of epidem...","BACKGROUND: Rapid triaging, as in the current COVID-19 pandemic, focuses on age and pre-existing medical conditions. In contrast, preoperative assessments use cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) to categorise patients to higher and lower risk independent of diagnostic labels. Since CPET is not feasible in population-based settings, our aims included evaluation of a triage/screening tool for cardiorespiratory risk. METHODS: CPET-derived anaerobic thresholds were evaluated retrospectively in 26 patients with pulmonary arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) who represent a challenging group to risk-categorise. Pulmonary AVM-induced hypoxaemia secondary to intrapulmonary right-to-left shunts, anaemia from underlying hereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasia and metabolic equivalents derived from the 13-point Veterans Specific Activity Questionnaire (VSAQ) were evaluated as part of routine clinical care. Pre-planned analyses evaluated associations and modelling of the anaerobic threshold and p...","To learn how outbreaks of infectious disease are detected and to describe the entities and information systems that together function to identify outbreaks in the U.S., the authors drew on multiple sources of information to create a description of existing surveillance systems and how they interact to detect outbreaks. The results of this analysis were summarized in a system diagram. The authors reviewed a sample of recent outbreaks to determine how they were detected, with reference to the system diagram. The de facto U.S. system for detection of outbreaks consists of five components: the clinical health care system, local/state health agencies, federal agencies, academic/professional organizations, and collaborating governmental organizations. Primary data collection occurs at the level of clinical health care systems and local health agencies. The review of a convenience sample of outbreaks showed that all five components of the system participated in aggregating, analyzing, and sha...","Abstract The global spread of COVID-19 is placing unprecedented demands on healthcare services. In this time of crisis, innovative and adaptive methods of practising will be required across all health professions. In order to maximise the use of current available resources, it is vital that existing services are comprehensively reviewed and full use is made of any unrealised potential among healthcare providers. Community pharmacy is one of a number of health professions that has a key role to play in responding to the current pandemic. As the scope of community pharmacy practice varies considerably across countries, it is important to examine ways in which the profession can assist with the public health response to COVID-19 and maintaining the continuity of healthcare services. This article seeks to highlight roles and activities that community pharmacists can undertake to help in relieving pressure on other areas of the health service, such as general practice. This information coul...","Because of the constant threat posed by emerging infectious diseases and the limitations of existing approaches used to identify new pathogens, there is a great demand for new technological methods for viral discovery. We describe herein a DNA microarray-based platform for novel virus identification and characterization. Central to this approach was a DNA microarray designed to detect a wide range of known viruses as well as novel members of existing viral families; this microarray contained the most highly conserved 70mer sequences from every fully sequenced reference viral genome in GenBank. During an outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in March 2003, hybridization to this microarray revealed the presence of a previously uncharacterized coronavirus in a viral isolate cultivated from a SARS patient. To further characterize this new virus, approximately 1 kb of the unknown virus genome was cloned by physically recovering viral sequences hybridized to individual array e...","The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), first reported in China, in December, 2019, now affects the whole world. As of March 8, 2020, more than 105 000 laboratory-confirmed cases and more than 3500 deaths in over 100 countries had been reported. Since SARS-CoV-2 RNA was first detected in a stool specimen of the first reported COVID-19 case in the USA,1 much attention has been paid to the study and reporting of gastrointestinal tract infection of SARS-CoV-2. According to a study2 including 1099 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 from 552 hospitals in China as of Jan 29, 2020, nausea or vomiting, or both, and diarrhoea were reported in 55 (5\u00b76%) and 42 (3\u00b78%) patients. Autopsy studies are crucial to help understand the involvement of COVID-19 in the digestive system; however, to date, there has been only one autopsy report3 for a man aged 85 years with COVID-19, which showed segmental dilatation...","Risk of COVID-19 infection in Wuhan has been estimated using imported case counts of international travelers, often under the assumption that all cases in travelers are ascertained. Recent work indicates variation among countries in detection capacity for imported cases. Singapore has historically had very strong epidemiological surveillance and contact-tracing capacity and has shown in the COVID-19 epidemic evidence of a high sensitivity of case detection. We therefore used a Bayesian modeling approach to estimate the relative imported case detection capacity for other countries compared to that of Singapore. We estimate that the global ability to detect imported cases is 38% (95% HPDI 22% - 64%) of Singapore\u2032s capacity. Equivalently, an estimate of 2.8 (95% HPDI 1.5 - 4.4) times the current number of imported cases, could have been detected, if all countries had had the same detection capacity as Singapore. Using the second component of the Global Health Security index to stratify li...","Summary Background The incidence of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Wuhan, China, has been estimated using imported case counts of international travellers, generally under the assumptions that all cases of the disease in travellers have been ascertained and that infection prevalence in travellers and residents is the same. However, findings indicate variation among locations in the capacity for detection of imported cases. Singapore has had very strong epidemiological surveillance and contact tracing capacity during previous infectious disease outbreaks and has consistently shown high sensitivity of case-detection during the COVID-19 outbreak. Methods We used a Bayesian modelling approach to estimate the relative capacity for detection of imported cases of COVID-19 for 194 locations (excluding China) compared with that for Singapore. We also built a simple mathematical model of the point prevalence of infection in visitors to an epicentre relative to that in residents. Findings...","Abstract Enveloped viruses exploit the existing routes of membrane traffic to enter and leave the host cell. The similarity between viral envelopes and cellular membranes has allowed the use of animal viruses as probes to examine aspects of intracellular traffic.","The COVID-19 pandemic has led to unprecedented strain on intensive care unit (ICU) admission in parts of the world. Strategies to create surge ICU capacity requires complex local and national service reconfiguration and reduction or cancellation of elective activity. Theses measures require time to implement and have an inevitable lag before additional capacity comes on-line. An accurate short-range forecast would be helpful in guiding such difficult, costly and ethically challenging decisions. At the time this work began, cases in England were starting to increase. Here we present an attempt at an agile short-range forecast based on published real-time COVID-19 case data from the seven National Health Service commissioning regions in England (East of England, London, Midlands, North East and Yorkshire, North West, South East and South West). We use a Monte Carlo approach to model the likely impact of current diagnoses on regional ICU capacity over a 14 day horizon. Our model is design...","As a first step toward the development of diagnostic and therapeutic tools to fight the Coronavirus disease (COVID-19), it is important to characterize CD8+ T cell epitopes in the SARS-CoV-2 peptidome that can trigger adaptive immune responses. Here, we use RosettaMHC, a comparative modeling approach which leverages existing high-resolution X-ray structures from peptide/MHC complexes available in the Protein Data Bank, to derive physically realistic 3D models for high-affinity SARS-CoV-2 epitopes. We outline an application of our method to model 439 9mer and 279 10mer predicted epitopes displayed by the common allele HLA-A*02:01, and we make our models publicly available through an online database (https://rosettamhc.chemistry.ucsc.edu). As more detailed studies on antigen-specific T cell recognition become available, RosettaMHC models of antigens from different strains and HLA alleles can be used as a basis to understand the link between peptide/HLA complex structure and surface chemi...","Background: COVID-19 could have even more dire consequences among refugees living in camps than in general populations. Bangladesh has confirmed COVID-19 cases and hosts almost 1 million Rohingya refugees from Myanmar with 600,000 concentrated in Kutupalong-Balukhali Expansion Site. Projections of the potential COVID-19 infection burden, epidemic speed, and healthcare needs in such settings are critical to inform preparedness planning. Methods: To explore the potential impact of the introduction of SARS-CoV-2 in Kutupalong-Balukhali Expansion Site, we used a stochastic disease transmission model with parameters derived from emerging literature. We considered three scenarios with different assumptions about the transmission potential of SARS-CoV-2. We estimated the number and daily rate of infections, hospitalizations, deaths, and healthcare needs expected under each scenario. Findings: A large-scale outbreak is highly likely after a single introduction of the virus into the camp across...","Respiratory protection against airborne pathogens is crucial for pandemic/epidemic preparedness in the context of personal protection, healthcare systems, and governance. We expect that the development of technologies that overcome the existing challenges in current respiratory protective devices will lead to a timely and effective response to the next outbreak.","In an era of global health threats caused by epidemics of infectious diseases and rising multidrug resistance, microbiology laboratories provide essential scientific evidence for risk assessment, prevention, and control. Microbiology has been at the core of European infectious disease surveillance networks for decades. Since 2010, these networks have been coordinated by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC). Activities delivered in these networks include harmonization of laboratory diagnostic, antimicrobial susceptibility and molecular typing methods, multicentre method validation, technical capacity mapping, training of laboratory staff, and continuing quality assessment of laboratory testing. Cooperation among the European laboratory networks in the past 7 years has proved successful in strengthening epidemic preparedness by enabling adaptive capabilities for rapid detection of emerging pathogens across Europe. In partnership with food safety authorities, inte...","Abstract Objectives As a global pandemic is inevitable, real-time monitoring of transmission is vital for containing the spread of COVID-19. The main objective was to report real-time effective reproduction numbers (R(t)) case fatality rate (CFR). Methods Data were mainly obtained from WHO website, up to 9 March 2020. R(t) was estimated by exponential growth rate (EG) and time dependent (TD) methods. \u201cR0\u201d package in R was employed to estimate R(t) by fitting the existing epidemic curve. Both na\u00efve CFR (nCFR) and adjust CFR (aCFR) were estimated. Results In EG method, R(t) was 3.27 [3.17-3.38] for Italy, 6.32 [5.72-6.99] for France, 6.07 [5.51-6.69] for Germany, 5.08 [4.51-5.74] for Spain. With TD method, the R value for March 9 was 3.10 [2.21-4.11] for Italy, 6.56 [2.04-12.26] for France, 4.43 [1.83-7.92] for Germany, and 3.95 [0-10.19] for Spain. Conclusions This study provides important findings on an early outbreak of COVID-19 in Europe. Due to the recent rapid increase in new cases...","AbstractThe beginning of 2020 has seen the emergence of COVID-19 outbreak caused by a novel coronavirus, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). There is an imminent need to better understand this new virus and to develop ways to control its spread. In this study, we sought to gain insights for vaccine design against SARS-CoV-2 by considering the high genetic similarity between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, which caused the outbreak in 2003, and leveraging existing immunological studies of SARS-CoV. By screening the experimentally-determined SARS-CoV-derived B cell and T cell epitopes in the immunogenic structural proteins of SARS-CoV, we identified a set of B cell and T cell epitopes derived from the spike (S) and nucleocapsid (N) proteins that map identically to SARS-CoV-2 proteins. As no mutation has been observed in these identified epitopes among the available SARS-CoV-2 sequences (as of 9 February 2020), immune targeting of these epitopes may potentially offer pr...","The beginning of 2020 has seen the emergence of COVID-19 outbreak caused by a novel coronavirus, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).

Using global line-list data on COVID-19 cases reported until 29th February 2020 and global gridded temperature data, and after adjusting for surveillance capacity and time since first imported case, higher average temperature was strongly associated with lower COVID-19 incidence for temperatures of 1\u00b0C and higher. However, temperature explained a relatively modest amount of the total variation in COVID-19 incidence. These preliminary findings support stringent containment efforts in Europe and elsewhere.","The 2009 influenza A (H1N1) pandemic highlighted the importance of quality hospital care of the severely ill, yet there is evidence that the impact of the 2009 pandemic was highest in low\u2010 and middle\u2010income countries with fewer resources. Recent data indicate that death and suffering from seasonal influenza and severe illness in general are increased in resource\u2010limited settings. However, there are limited clinical data and guidelines for the management of influenza and other severe illness in these settings. Life\u2010saving supportive care through syndromic case management is used successfully in high\u2010resource intensive care units and in global programs such as the Integrated Management of Childhood Illness (IMCI). While there are a variety of challenges to the management of the severely ill in resource\u2010limited settings, several new international initiatives have begun to develop syndromic management strategies for these environments, including the World Health Organization's Integrated M...","Summary Background Public health measures to prevent, detect, and respond to events are essential to control public health risks, including infectious disease outbreaks, as highlighted in the International Health Regulations (IHR). In light of the outbreak of 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), we aimed to review existing health security capacities against public health risks and events. Methods We used 18 indicators from the IHR State Party Annual Reporting (SPAR) tool and associated data from national SPAR reports to develop five indices: (1) prevent, (2) detect, (3) respond, (4) enabling function, and (5) operational readiness. We used SPAR 2018 data for all of the indicators and categorised countries into five levels across the indices, in which level 1 indicated the lowest level of national capacity and level 5 the highest.

Findings Of 182 countries, 52 (28%) had prevent capacities at leve...","The ability to detect an infectious agent in a widespread epidemic is crucial to the success of quarantine efforts in addition to sensitive and accurate screening of potential cases of infection from patients in a clinical setting. Enabling testing outside of sophisticated laboratories broadens the scope of control and surveillance efforts, but also requires robust and simple methods that can be used without expensive instrumentation. Here we report a method to identify SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) virus RNA from purified RNA or cell lysis using loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) using a visual, colorimetric detection. This test was additionally verified using RNA samples purified from respiratory swabs collected from COVID-19 patients in Wuhan, China with equivalent performance to a commercial RT-qPCR test while requiring only heating and visual inspection. This simple and sensitive method provides an opportunity to facilitate virus detection in the field without a requirement for...","We explore here how variation in the SARS-CoV-2 virus tropism could influence epidemic spread. We use a compartmental model fit to the existing data. The model indicates that Wuhan quarantine measures were effective but that alternative virus forms (gut tropism) and a second propagation route (through environment) was present. For Singapore and Shenzhen region the secondary route does not seem to be active yet. Adequate prevention measures taking into account both routes should be implemented.","SARS-CoV-2 emerged by the end of 2019 to rapidly spread in 2020. At present, it is of utmost importance to understand the virus biology and to rapidly assess the potential of existing drugs and develop new active compounds. While some animal models for such studies are under development, most of the research is carried out in the Vero E6 cells. Here, we propose fully differentiated human airway epithelium cultures as a model for studies on the SARS-CoV-2. Further, we also provide basic characteristics of the system."],"title":["Web-based participatory surveillance of infectious diseases: the Influenzanet participatory surveillance experience","The

We know very little about the vast spectrum of viruses in nature. Although we should continue to pursue studies on known human pathogens, we need to broaden our efforts in virus isolation, viral genomics, and bioinformatics. A comprehensive database of viral sequences is critical for rapid identification of emerging viral pathogens and new diagnostic platforms, such as oligonucleotide 55 arrays. In addition to viral genomics, global proteomic analysis of viral disease processes may uncover molecular signatures that can be used to implicate a particular etiologic agent or class of agents, even in the absence of viral nucleic acid or serology. The global eradication of smallpox ranks as one of humankind' s greatest accomplishments. In the wake of this triumph, many viral challenges remain. HIV, hepatitis B and C, influenza, dengue, rotavirus, and many other viral diseases continue to affect tens of millions. It is distressing that in the face of these undeniable challenges we are back to discussing the deliberate use of existing or modified viruses for harm, not good.","Accordingly, on 13 January 2020, the Vaccine Research Center of the US National Institutes of Health communicated the 2019-nCoV viral sequence to collaborators at Moderna, which has initiated good-manufacturing-practice production of an mRNA vaccine targeting the viral spike glycoprotein. The hope is to launch a phase 1 clinical trial in healthy people within three months. Initial phylogenetic analysis of 2019-nCoV sequences suggests there is little diversity\u2014indicative of limited evolution\u2014among viral isolates, which would be a potential boon to broad dissemination of a protective vaccine (http://virological.org/t/preliminary-phylogenetic-analysis-of-11-ncov2019-genomes-2020-01-19/329). On 23 January 2020, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations announced funding for Inovio Pharmaceuticals and the University of Queensland to leverage their existing platforms from MERS vaccine efforts, and separately to Moderna for its mRNA platform, to help accelerate clinical testing of a vaccine against 2019-nCoV.","Pandemics such as HIV, Ebola, and Zika have raised the awareness of global threats to human health posed by known as well as newly emerging pathogens and can provide the impetus to prepare against future pandemics by promoting the development of vaccine platforms that can tackle the challenges of outbreak situations. New platforms, such as viral vector and nucleic acid based vaccines meet the prerequisites to provide solutions for some of these challenges by representing highly versatile technologies that allow fast vaccine manufacturing. Each vaccine technology has its own advantages and disadvantages related to its ability to induce certain immune responses, manufacturing capacity and safety for human use (Table 4). Viral vector based vaccines are able to induce potent immune responses against the encoded target antigen. Indeed, a number of clinical trials have demonstrated that viral vector based vaccines such as VSV-ZEBOV show great promise for inducing protective responses in humans. However, antigen delivery in the context of an unrelated virus renders this technology relatively complex in terms of manufacturing. Furthermore, the presence of immune targets other than the target antigen can lead to unfavorable effects such as pre-existing immunity hampering immune responses, as seen for Ad5 vectors, or the inability to use the same technology for repeated vaccinations. In addition, delivery of attenuated viral vectors raises safety concerns due to the risk of adverse events and residual viral replication upon delivery, as detected in a small number of subjects in a clinical trial testing VSV-ZEBOV. DNA based vaccines offer the advantage of allowing a relatively simple, fully synthetic production process. While the presence of non-functional sequences in original DNA vectors raised regulatory safety concerns, newer developments allow minimal constructs that exclusively encode for the target antigen. Several studies have demonstrated the safety of DNA vaccines for human use and clinical trials testing vaccines against influenza and Zika have furthermore highlighted the speed of vaccine development supported by this technology. However, the potential for long term persistence and genomic integration and the dependence on injection devices or electroporation represent some important disadvantages of this technology. Some, especially early, clinical studies testing DNA based vaccines have yielded somewhat discouraging results in terms of immunogenicity, while newer trials, such as studies testing DNA vaccines against Zika virus, have demonstrated that this technology is able to induce promising immune responses. Like DNA vaccines, RNA based vaccine technologies support a comparably simple, fully synthetic manufacturing process that allows production of different vaccines using the same established production process and facility. Their inability for genomic integration and lack of persistence in the cells of the vaccinee offers important advantages in terms of vaccine safety. However, since RNA vaccines represent the most recently developed technology described here, their use in humans is less well characterized than for viral vector or DNA based vaccines. Although further studies will be required to fully characterize this technology in humans, clinical studies conducted so far have yielded overall encouraging results in terms of safety and immunogenicity and provide support for further clinical exploration.","It is evident that with the rise of techniques such as random PCR, unbiased new-generation sequencing and pathogen detection microarrays, virus diagnosis and virus discovery methods will continue to develop synergistically. Discovery of a new hybridization pattern on a microarray can be translated very quickly into a diagnostic test for a novel virus. Metagenomics has transformed our ability to discover viruses, but is not yet widely used in clinical diagnostic laboratories. However, it has alerted us to the potentially staggering viral diversity that exists and will increasingly inform the design of assays immediately suitable for use in the clinic (e.g., multiplex real-time PCR or microsphere-based virus diagnostic panels). The combination of random amplification PCR with arrays (either broad-spectrum, conventionally designed arrays [71] or simple but powerful arrays, designed using innovative bioinformatics [70]) with new hardware platforms will increase diagnostic capacity and the ability of laboratories to detect unexpected viruses.","1. Use existing systems and platforms (patient portals) to encourage patients to initiate telemedicine when available.","To improve responsiveness to epidemics, in 2015 the WHO published a list of nine diseases requiring urgent vaccine R&amp;D to prevent public health emergencies in the future. This list was revised in 2017, and key characteristics of the diseases prioritised by the WHO are summarised in Table 3. The process of prioritising diseases took into account properties of the causative pathogen e.g. transmissibility, host-based factors such as immunopathology, clinical aspects including ease of accurate diagnosis, availability of countermeasures and mortality, public health capacity and epidemiological factors.47 Research and development priorities for these diseases include development of suitable diagnostic tests, assessment of potential treatments, identification of key knowledge gaps, production platforms, behavioural interventions and acceleration of vaccine development. Preparation of sufficient quantities of safe and efficacious vaccines against potential outbreak pathogens is an extremely effective strategy. However, a lack of access to dedicated long-term funding has hampered vaccine development for outbreak pathogens in recent decades.48 As well as limiting the number of new vaccines being developed, the number of facilities with the capacity to biomanufacture vaccines is also limited, which is a significant issue for outbreak preparedness.49 In addition, WHO recognised that generally applicable platform technologies for rapid vaccine development are required and have set out to identify and prioritise the leading platforms.   ","And the utility of economic statecraft has been systematically underestimated. 7 Today, it is all too common for great powers to resort to economic statecraft and social penetration to further their national interests. nuclear program. 8 The Russian Federation launched cyber warfare to destabilize Ukraine's democratic order. Moreover, Russia misinformed and polarized U.S. voters by extensive propaganda and penetration of social media platforms. 9 As a rising power, aiming at building its own order and sphere of influence, China has been engaging extensively in economic and social penetration of other countries. For instance, China banned rare earth metals exports to Japan and curtailed the import of Japanese autos due to the territory disputes regarding the Senkaku/Diaoyu Island in the East China Sea. China, as noted, also banned banana imports from the Philippines to coerce the Philippines to concede in the South China Sea dispute. 10 More important, economic globalization, the development of supply chains, and breakthroughs of network technology have jointly transformed and updated China's coercive capabilities. Some liberal scholars argue that global networks create mutual dependence that decrease states' incentives to engage in conflict or coercion. However, as political scientists Henry Farrell at George Washington University and Abraham L. Newman at Georgetown University show, global connectivity actually creates new opportunities for great powers to coerce, manipulate, and penetrate. Like Hirschman's emphasis on power asymmetry in economic interdependence, Farrell and Newman also find that modern globalization results in asymmetrical networks, in which some states are far more connected than others. Those states become the \"hubs\" of the global networks and have the capabilities to exploit \"weaponized interdependence.\" Specifically, those great powers can utilize their hub positions to gather information or cut off financial and information flows, discover and exploit vulnerabilities, compel policy change, and deter unwanted actions. 11 Sharp Power and Social Penetration. Financial power, hub positions in the global exchange networks, and information supply chains also enable authoritarian regimes to engage in comprehensive social penetration and manipulation of other societies. Christopher Walker and Jessica Ludwig of the National Endowment for Democracy analyze such phenomena through a lens of \"sharp power,\" defined as authoritarian influence efforts to \"pierce, penetrate, or perforate the information environments and societies in the targeted countries.\" To delegitimize democracies and other universal human-rights regimes, authoritarian regimes seek to incite and amplify existing divisions in democratic societies by manipulating or faking the information that reaches them. They also use financial incentives to induce media or civil societies in democracies to censor opinions that may be critical of those authoritarian regimes.","Miller and colleagues [25] applied microarrays in clinical diagnostics and were able to identify pathogens in a panel of 36 patient specimens with a 94% accuracy score, calculated from 76% sensitivity and 100% specificity. The microarray was designed to detect up to 35 RNA viruses, including the SARS coronavirus and dengue viruses, using 40-mer probes. A total of 53 555 such probes in replicates of seven were printed on Nimblegen tiling microarrays. The authors studied ways to minimize PCR bias to ensure uniform amplification and developed a unique statistical approach to infer pathogen identity from the resulting microarray fingerprints. Apart from the highdensity microarrays described here, more focused biodefence platforms have been developed for selected panels of environmental [26] or blood-borne pathogens [27] , using inhouse microarrays that comprise only several hundred relevant probes. Such panels are designed to selectively identify targets of interest with enough redundancy to reduce the occurrence of false positives, which is infrequently controlled in other diagnostic platforms that often use either one or a handful of primer sets specific to each pathogen of interest (as is the case in the GeneXpert, Rapid and Cepheid real time PCR platforms).","An important indicator that leadership, and the drive to spearhead new approaches, are growing within the research community is the fact that attention is shifting from asking why it is necessary to build collaborative networks across different types of knowledge, to figuring out how this work can be initiated, maintained, and evaluated (Funtowicz, 1994; Gross Stein, 2001; Klein et al., 2001; Horlick-Jones, 2004). It is no longer enough for scientists to hone their own corners of research to perfection, and assume someone else (who?) will put it all together. Increased sophistication in efforts to incorporate systems-based concepts regarding ecology, health, and sustainability into professional curricula (Howard, 2004; Howard and Rapport, 2004) is a step in the right direction for a new generation of researchers. We must also find ways to cultivate leadership in the current generation of researchers because it is they who will be required to build the collegial and collaborative platforms from which to bridge disciplines and policy, and make useful contributions in the multistakeholder arena of EID investigation and control. Critical skills will be required to identify how, when, and where disciplinary, interdisciplinary, and transdisciplinary approaches will be required in building responses to disease emergence. This is not a small task or an \u201cacademic exercise,\u201d but a necessary step in building our capacity to better respond to the emerging infections of the 21st century.","The advances of sequencing technology, nanotechnology, and bioinformatics have driven molecular tests including assays for emerging pathogens to be more comprehensive and precise. For example, the availability of various sequence databases permits quick identification of sequence identity and variations. For example, the HIV database http://www.hiv.lanl.gov/ contains data on HIV genetic sequences and drug resistance associated mutations. It is valuable for HIV epidemiological studies, research, development, and clinical validation studies of HIV clinical assays [38, 71] . It is well known that there are significant variations of clinical phenotypes in the presence of emerging infections ranging from asymptomatic carrier to lethal infection. Recently, assays to examine multiple pathogen panels have been developed [97\u00c0102], which should increase the diagnostic yield for many pathogens. A critical need for emerging pathogen analysis is quicker, easier, cost-effect assays that can be used in a point-of-care setting. New assays that are performed on platforms with a small footprint and detect pathogens quickly (in minutes instead of hours or days) have entered clinical use. For example, the FilmArray (BioFire Diagnostics, Inc.) and Simplexa (Focus Diagnostics, Inc.) molecular assays can generate results in approximately 60 min. The user-friendly Alere i (Alere Inc.) and Cobas Liat (Roche Molecular Systems) platforms are compact and portable, generate rapid molecular results in 15\u00c020 min, can use electricity or rechargeable battery, and therefore are completely mobile and suited for point-of-care testing. It is obvious that the current rapid development of new technologies will further enhance the utility of molecular diagnostics in various emerging infectious diseases.","China has an established hospital-based surveillance system for infectious diseases. All clinical and hospital reports of both suspected and confirmed cases of notifiable infectious disease must be sent to local Centers for Disease Control (CDC). The information is then sent to the China CDC headquarters in Beijing through the National Infectious Diseases Monitoring Information System Database, which was established in 2004. The hierarchical administrative organization of the surveillance system ensures a rapid and efficient upward flow of epidemic information [5]. Based on this system, development of effective diagnostic platforms can greatly enhance the prevention and control of infectious diseases in China. The predominant techniques for identification of microbial pathogens depend on conventional clinical microbiology monitoring approaches. Although well established, these approaches usually require culture of the pathogens, followed by susceptibility tests, which are time-consuming and laborious. In addition, many microbes are difficult to culture, and may be undetectable by culture-based approaches.","Public health efforts to control and prevent infectious diseases are based on epidemiologic and laboratory surveillance systems that detect and monitor disease incidence, define pathogen characteristics, and track cases 'by person, place and time' [25]. Molecular epidemiology has long been a mainstay of public health surveillance; now, increasingly powerful molecular methods, including sequencing of whole pathogen genomes, help investigators to identify epidemiologically related cases, describe patterns of transmission, pinpoint sources of infection, and explain antimicrobial resistance [26-33]. Combining the methods of molecular pathogenomics with population genetics and epidemiology can provide new insights into the episodic behavior of epidemics of familiar pathogens, such as group A streptococcus [7]. Archived biological samples can also provide new insights into the emergence and evolution of infectious threats, from HIV [34] to influenza [35]. Building the capacity for human biological sample collection into existing surveillance networks has the potential to facilitate a more comprehensive, population-based evaluation of genomic and environmental determinants of health outcomes. For example, a meta-analysis of surveillance cohorts from Arizona, Colorado, California, and Illinois demonstrated that human homozygosity for CCR5delta32 (a non-functional variant of chemokine receptor CCR5) is consistently associated with symptomatic West Nile virus infection [36]. When disease surveillance is conducted independently in multiple jurisdictions, the capacity to share biological samples and epidemiologic and clinical data provides important infrastructure for research.","The encouraging early results from the DNA microarray technology has inspired the development of a variety of array-based platforms [38-42] and contributed to the development of a system-wide study of proteins -- the field of modern pro-teomics. Traditionally, two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-D PAGE) with mass spectrometry has been the basis of proteomic technology [43]. Although this technique has provided rich information about individual proteins, its clinical usefulness for the study of the proteome is limited. The limitations of this technique for clinical diagnostics are primarily due to low sample throughput compared with other techniques. Additionally, there are technical challenges relating to the reproducibility of the 2-D gels, the relatively low numbers of proteins that can be resolved on each gel and the limited sensitivity (ie low abundant proteins are not easily identified). Modern proteomics technology, as discussed in several recent reviews, is developing quickly and is focused on mass spec-trometry-based serum pattern profiling and protein micro-arrays in continuing efforts to discover new molecular markers and therapeutic targets in human cancer [44-46]. The use of serum proteomic pattern analysis has created diagnostic signatures for ovarian [47,48], breast [49], prostate [50] and liver cancers [51]. In the Laboratory of Pathology at the National Cancer Institute (NCI), in collaboration with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), this proteome-based strategy is being used for early detection of ovarian cancer in high-risk women. Preliminary data is so encouraging that the technology is on track to enter clinical trials in the very near future [47]. For women living with the spectre of an aggressive disease, such as ovarian cancer, a reliable screening test would represent a major step forward in the diagnostic capabilities of the physicians who treat them.","The Influenzanet network of web-based platforms presented here highlights the benefit of using the Internet to carry out large-scale real-time surveillance for common diseases such as influenza. Influenzanet relies on a flexible and readily deployable web tool that is capable of coping with the requirements of different countries regarding the data collection method, either during a public health emergency or during an ordinary influenza season. Internet surveillance of healthcare usage can be used to complement traditional surveillance. ","The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03. 29.20046789 doi: medRxiv preprint the disease drives a lot of interest (e.g, outbreak in Germany). We see that traditional news agencies (well represented in Event Registries) as well as Google search could anticipate and form more distinct interest peaks than social media platforms. We detected the lags between different platforms for given topics (e.g news from event registry are ahead of comentatory media in fake news on possible introduction). The stronger lag is observed between EventRegitry (the most ahead of) and Twitter (the most delay). Moreover, Twitter (15% penetration rate among Polish Internet users) has significantly different time pattern than other analyzed platforms. In particular, it does not have China-related phase at all and it has at least 3-fold faster growth rate than other media in epidemic and mitigation phase.","In contrast, long read sequencing (LRS) technologies do not require significant DNA fragmentation or additional template amplification. For these reasons, they are frequently referred to as the \u201cthird-generation\u201d sequencing technologies, although this distinction sometimes may not be accurate. Platforms such as PacBio (Pacific Biosciences), PromethION, GridION and MinION (ONT, Oxford Nanopore Technologies) are capable of reading exceptionally long fragments, including whole viral genomes. Secondly, these platforms potentially allow ultra-high coverage to be easily reached and even quantify the sample, because the viral load would be directly proportional to the number of detectable viral genomes in the sample. Thus, samples with high viral titer can provide high-quality sequences without prior amplification. Another feature of the ONT platforms is the sample turn-around time, which is often critical in the clinical environment; point-of-care testing makes it possible to identify the infectious agent virtually at the patient\u2019s bed. In this setting, the correct therapy can be started within hours or days of disease manifestation, prospectively improving the patient care outcome.","In the ten countries, epidemiological data are collected with the participation of a self-selected cohort followed over the influenza season. The success of the data collection strongly depends on the extent of participation of the volunteers involved in the projects. The determinants of participation and the representativeness of the self-selected cohorts of participants in the various countries have been explored elsewhere [9] . In order to assess how the web-based systems for ILI surveillance can be a useful addition to the GP-based system, we present the cross-year and cross-country incidence data, which can be readily compared and easily collected, once the platforms are in place. The national platforms collect data about the health status of the active cohort volunteers during the whole duration of the influenza season. Participants are considered to be active if they have completed, on average, at least one symptoms questionnaire every 3 weeks since the registration. To define ILI, the following ILI case definition is used, which resembles the WHO guidelines [10] : a sudden onset of fever, namely, a measured body temperature of \u226538\u00b0C, accompanied by headache or muscle pain, and accompanied by cough or a sore throat. The date of fever onset is used as the date of ILI onset.","The plant-produced M protein yields were not sufficient to perform the test with human sera. Thus, for plant-derived M protein characterization, efforts should be made in order to enhance expression yields. This includes the use of second-generation viral vectors (Gleba et al., 2007) or other implemented platforms that have been developed in the last years (Moustafa et al., 2015; Paul et al., 2015; Sack et al., 2015).","Decisions must be made quickly during epidemics based on patchy and uncertain data, and models can be powerful tools to help guide them. Despite the challenges above, ongoing advances in computational power, methods, and new data streams offer genuine hope for better surveillance and useful forecasting systems. New data sources at our disposal include not only the passively observed big data streams from mobile phones but also detailed environmental data and local sensor information from distributed devices, internet search information, pathogen genomic data that can be generated rapidly during an outbreak to inform the response, 7 and crowd-sourced approaches to monitoring rapidly evolving emergencies. 8 Data sharing platforms and standardised aggregation approaches that protect the privacy of personal data are being developed, 9 and increasing internet connectivity allows for rapid data transfer and communication between geographically disparate teams of responders. Methodologically, powerful ensemble modelling approaches are being developed that combine multiple forecasts to minimise uncertainty. 5, 10 We have seen an unprecedented, collaborative approach unfolding in response to the COVID-19 outbreak between academic groups: for example, using Twitter and other platforms to share, analyse, and openly discuss the implications of new data as they come out. (Ironically, managing the disinformation that also proliferates on social media during emergencies will probably become one of the most important issues for epidemic containment moving forward.)","The chief objective of global health efforts against 2019-nCoV remains to effectively quarantine patients and screen individuals who may be infected to limit spread. That objective should continue going forward. What is proposed here is an option to at least give infected patients a medication quickly to help alleviate symptoms and prevent death, while vaccine efforts for 2019-nCoV continue. This could be enabled through ACE2-Fc providing a triple mechanism of action: (1) Treatment of ACE2 deficiency and lung injury, (2) virus neutralization, and (3) immune effector recruitment. Beyond infected patients, ACE2-Fc could provide passive immunity to healthcare works at risk as another benefit. Going forward, it is recommended that physicians, scientists, and biotech industry in China and elsewhere pursue manufacturing an ACE2-Fc biologic agent right now, which can immediately advance into trials. A variety of different protein expression platforms (CHO, insect, yeast) could be utilized, depending on the particular contract manufacturer\u2019s expertise. Gene therapy could even be considered to make ACE2-Fc from a DNA or mRNA platform, but would have additional risk of uncertain delivery strategies and ultimately may slow down progress toward treating patients.","Lastly, vector biology may also significantly impact vaccine manufacture and delivery. For emergency preparedness stockpiling, each vaccine might need to be produced at a scale of 500,000 \u2013 2 million doses, with the option to quickly increasing manufacture to perhaps 4\u20136 million doses or more in case of an outbreak, depending on the specific pathogen. Of the two most clinically advanced platforms, VSV and adenoviruses, the latter can likely meet this requirement more easily: GMP-compliant large-scale adenoviral vector production facilities exist in many countries, related to the regular use of adenoviral vectors not only in prophylactic vaccines but also in some cancer and gene-therapy trials. One potential drawback of ChAd-based viral vectors compared to human Ad vectors is the need for vector optimisation or cell line engineering to ensure high viral yields during virus production. For example, ChAd vectors may need to contain certain E4 genes from HAd5 in order to grow to high titers in current HAd5-E1-transcomplementing cell lines, as was demonstrated with the ChAdOx1 vector.23 Alternatively, producer cell lines can be engineered to increase viral yield.37 However, this need for optimisation has not been a hurdle to large-scale manufacturing so far. GMP-compliant VSV-vector production has also been developed in recent years, and scalable manufacture of rVSV is now possible.38 Once a stockpile has been produced, vector stability during storage and deployment is critical. Most viral vectored vaccines are stable for &gt;5 years at \u221270\u00b0C, and a 2\u20138\u00b0C cold chain is required for distribution and storage of adenoviral vectors. One study assessing the recently deployed rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine observed a significant loss of viral titres at a temperature of 4\u00b0C after 2 weeks,39 whereas adenoviral vectors were shown to be stable for 20 days at room temperature in a sucrose buffer.40 In addition, sensitivity of any VSV-based vaccine to pH changes is presumably dependent on the specific envelope glycoprotein (i.e. the vaccine antigen). Overall, vaccine stability in terms of temperature and pH range would therefore likely be variable across a panel of putative VSV-based outbreak vaccines, since the glycoprotein will differ from vaccine to vaccine. In the case of an adenoviral vectored vaccine, on the other hand, variation in stability is expected to be minimal, since the vaccine antigen is not present in the viral capsid, and the composition of the virus particles would be very similar across different vaccines. Of note, new approaches for thermostabilisation have recently been developed for adenoviral vectors, such as immobilization of viral particles in a sugar glass on a filter41 or the use of biocompatible additives to slow down the degradation of virus particles.40 These improvements are expected to have a significant impact on the deployment of vectored vaccines in challenging climates such as sub-Saharan Africa. In human populations, pre-existing immunity to simian-derived adenoviral vectors is, unsurprisingly, less prevalent than immunity to human adenoviruses, and antibodies to some simian vectors, such as ChAdOx1, appear to be particularly rare.23 Anti-vector immunity to the backbone of simian viruses increased after vaccination but is relatively short-lived. As a result, reuse of the same vectors has been successful for boosting after 6 or more months in clinical trials.42","Finally, we compared the performance of the different ELISAs for the detection of antibodies among PCR-confirmed COVID-19 patients to that of PRNT, as the gold standard for CoV serology ( Table 3) . PRNT50 correlated strongly with the different ELISAs, with the commercial IgA showing the strongest correlation followed by the S and N ELISAs indicating their capacity to detect SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies. However, a larger patient cohort is needed to assess the sensitivity of these platforms.","Diagnostic testing is achieved with the use of real-time PCR on blood. Viral RNA is usually detectable by PCR between 3 and 10 days after the onset of symptoms. Therefore, early in the course of illness, diagnostic tests may be falsely negative. There are currently no approved therapies for Ebola; however, there are investigational therapies, including immunoglobulins from recovered patients, humanized monoclonal antibodies produced transgenically by using the Nicotiana benthamiana plant, and a number of antiviral agents, including adenosine analogues, viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase inhibitors, and short interfering RNA. 63, 64 Additionally, multiple vaccine platforms have been developed with some in clinical trials.","Closed, self-contained and fully integrated automated platforms that combine on-board sample preparation with real-time PCR and fluorescence detection are now available, with a range of target-focused, real-time PCR-based diagnostic tests. One assay developed for this type of fully integrated platform is an influenza diagnostic tool that detects and distinguishes (with excellent sensitivity and specificity [96]) between seasonal influenza, influenza B and the novel 2009 H1N1 influenza. However, independent of the efficient hardware used to execute the test, assay design remains the key issue with this type of target-focused assay. Next season, the prevalent strain of influenza A virus may change, necessitating redesign of the assay and renegotiation of the regulatory process.","The high quality associated with its compatibility with the major extraction and real time PCR platforms allows an immediate integration of Chla/Myco pneumo r-gene\u2122 in most routine diagnostic laboratories.","Target prediction. Following on the framework defined recently by the PHASE initiative from CDER [11, 12] , targets for NHC were predicted using two platforms, namely, CLARITY [13] and SEA [17] . Both platforms use the two-dimensional structure of molecules to predict potential binding targets and their predictive performance was previously assessed by their respective developers [18, 19] . SEA uses descriptor-based similarity to compare the structure of a molecule to the chemical structures with known in vitro binding affinity in ChEMBL [17] . Approximately 2,300 protein targets are covered. For each predicted target, a p-value and the similarity of the closest molecule are provided.","The number of people suffering from mental health impacts after a major event is often greater than the number of people who are physically injured, and mental health effects may last longer. Nonetheless, mental health attracts far fewer personnel for There is a need to better recognize mental health needs as an important component of mobilizing a large-scale therapeutic response to sudden city-scale crisis scenarios. A large rapid response team in crisis situations should include mental healthcare workers. Local medical and nursing staff at the epicenter of a crisis are pivotal to the overall response, and care for these caregivers -whether through face-to-face counseling or comparable support through digital platforms such as cell phone interfaces -is essential in efforts to extend their immediate efficiency and to better protect their mental health in the long term.","Recently, there have been signs of regained interest in the field of resistant Gram-negative infections from a few companies. These companies and also academic research sites are exploiting unconventional highrisk approaches and pursuing new targets. It is difficult to assess the potential of such new approaches and it remains to be seen if they will yield useful antibiotics for ICUs in the future. In any case, it will take at least 10 years before we can see the fruits of current research efforts in the Gram-negative field. Therefore, prudent use of existing antibiotics, improved dosage regimes, surveillance efforts, and stringent adherence to infection control guidelines are essential to preserve the power of existing antibiotics.","Recent advances in scRNA-seq are empowering us to study tissue and cellular transcriptomes at previously unprecedented resolutions. Several single-cell RNA sequencing based efforts such as the Human Cell Atlas are underway to catalog gene expression across tissues and cell types, and the raw data from many of these studies are available on public platforms such as the Broad Institute Single Cell Portal 45 and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). Analyses of these datasets are of interest to a wide range of researchers but currently prove challenging for all but a few due to the need for specialized workflows and computing infrastructures. Consequently, the widespread use of this data for biomedical research is hampered, an issue which is particularly evident in the face of public health crises like the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.

Project Silent Guardian was a 10-week trial launched by the Naval Research Laboratory during the 2005 US Presidential Inauguration [41] . The challenge was to take laboratory-based microarray technology to a production-scale system capable of operationally screening up to 300 samples per day. A custom DNA microarray was designed with the capability of detecting 20 natural (including avian flu) and biothreat agents with strain-level resolution. In total, 10 000 samples were collected and screened by civilian and military laboratory personnel within the stipulated period. The trial included blinded samples that were spiked with pathogens, which were all successfully detected. This exercise showcased the feasibility of implementing microarrays as a screening tool for EOS and demonstrated their use as a rapid and robust means of sample processing and pathogen identification. Recommendations from the study included the development of a more user-friendly system with greater automation of the steps involved. These features are being incorporated by several recently launched commercial platforms. Microarray-based platforms for biothreat screening from Akonni Biosystems (http://www.akonni. com) and Veredus Laboratories (http://www.vereduslabs. com) are now on the market for multiplexed threat detection. New advances include (i) greater integration of the sample preparation (which is considered to be one of the major bottlenecks), (ii) the use of mPCR and (iii) the development of small handheld microfluidic chips and portable readers to take microarray technology to the point-ofcare. Veredus has also recently launched an influenza test chip that enables the amplification and discrimination of influenza A and B subtypes, including avian flu (H5N1), within just two hours. This great improvement in detection time has been attributed to the mPCR step, which, through rapid thermocycling, significantly reduces the duration of PCR to under 30 min. Similar devices might be developed in the future for protein and other types of non-DNA microarrays for applications in serodiagnostics.","The possibility of collecting such detailed data about influenza cases from such a wide audience attracted the interest of the Gulbenkian Institute of Science Epidemiology group in Portugal, who implemented their own platform in Portuguese, and deployed the system at the beginning of the 2005 influenza season (http://www.gripenet.pt). In Portugal, during the first 2 years of the project, approximately 5000 volunteers were attracted [3] . On the basis of this success, the computational epidemiology group of the ISI Foundation in Turin, Italy decided to deploy a similar platform during the winter of 2007, to carry out influenza surveillance with the aim of informing computational models for studying the spread of ILI on a large scale. Data collected by these four platforms have been evaluated [3, 4] (Paolotti et al., 3rd International ICST Conference on Electronic Healthcare for the 21st Century, 2010, Abstract no. 30), and the estimated seasonal influenza incidence curves have been found to be in good agreement with those from the former European Influenza Surveillance Scheme.","One of the most popular ONT sequencers\u2014the MinION\u2014has been praised for possessing multiple boons: relatively low cost, when compared to platforms by Illumina and Thermo Fisher Scientific, and mobility, owing to compact dimensions of the sequencer, simplicity of protocols, and rapid sample processing. Another great advantage that ONT platforms hold over second-generation sequencing is the length of analyzed fragments. Because fragments over 2 Mb can be read in a single run with maintained quality, in metagenomic experiments, genes of interest, like those of drug resistance [176], can be easily attributed to relevant microorganisms, as opposed to reading shorter fragments, when identifying the resistant strains can, in theory, pose a significant challenge. Furthermore, available protocols include not only those for metagenomics, but also for studying select organisms, e.g., viruses. Both parallel and consecutive sequencing of samples can be performed, owing to a multitude of pores in a cell.","Hospitals and health systems must develop agile ways to transmit timely and critical information in times of crises. A designated communication team that is integrated into the work so they have a strong understanding of the clinical care being provided and the communication needs of the workforce, patients, and public is recommended. Crisis communications should ideally occur via several media, such as a telephone hotline, the hospital Web page, social media platforms, or text-based messages. Important metrics, including the number of cases being triaged, investigated, or managed; bed capacity and availability; and new or emerging data on treatments or care strategies, should be provided. Similarly, timely communication of national updates on travel restrictions, policies for self-monitoring and quarantine, and trends in infection rates must occur. To this end, health care leaders must remember that patients and their families are as much in need of actionable information as hospital personnel. Comprehensive communication strategies for both internal and external stakeholders are key.","In the next 5 years, new devices will enter the market, facilitating diagnostic testing at point-of-care, and PCR in the field [101,205]. Pathogen detection arrays will be developed, combining nucleic acid extraction and capture of nucleic acids onto an array with on-board, new-generation sequencing. The integration of these new platforms with appropriate oligonucleotide and primer design (sufficiently flexible to detect emergent and/or variant viruses) will change the face of diagnostics, taking a discovery tool to the clinic and providing more detailed information about the better known pathogens.","There is a disproportionate number of individuals with mental and somatic illnesses among persons in detention (Bhugra, 2020; Ginn, 2012) . It is also known that infections which are transmitted human to human via droplet or close contact spread particularly well in confined spaces. Since transfer options for further treatment are more difficult (especially in detention facilities) preventive measures are strongly emphasized, particularly in the case of viral droplet infections. For example, in the context of influenza, vaccination of detainees and staff is recommended (NHS 2019) . If such options are not available, prisons and other closed facilities, like asylum centers, shelters, and closed psychiatric hospitals, pose a risk for the rapid spread of such diseases. In the past, Australia for example has described the rapid spread of influenza among prison inmates (Awofeso et al., 2001) . The Spanish flu is also reported to have affected about a quarter of all inmates; a prevalence much higher when compared to data from the general population (Finnie, Copley, Hall, &amp; Leach, 2014) . We are also currently receiving news from China, which reports a rapid spread of Covid-19 infections among prisoners from the Hubei Province. Regarding Covid-19, the spread seems to have been caused by infected security personnel importing it into detention facilities. According to the media, the Chinese government reacted to the outbreak among inmates by locking down affected prisons, suspending the transportation of goods, testing inmates who were in contact with the diagnosed wardens, and also by dismissing the prison directors and setting up a commission to analyse the spread of the virus among detained individuals (Caixing Global 2019). Correctly, there has recently been talk of a \"blind spot\" in the media regarding the spread of Covid-19 among prison inmates. (Global Times 2020) We argue that the blind spot extends further to particularly marginalized groups such as individuals using and abusing drugs and people without legal residence status, especially since these groups often overlap with individuals in detention (Liem, Wang, Wariyanti, Latkin, &amp; Hall, 2020) . Under normal circumstances, the psychological and psychiatric care of individuals in prison is already a major challenge for many health care systems; a problem that is even more evident in times of crisis, as is currently observed. The difficulties arise on different levels and affect detained individuals, security personnel, as well as medical staff alike (Chen et al., 2020) . Fears, worries, and uncertainties, especially for isolated or quarantined patients, can cause an increase in stress-related illnesses but also the exacerbation of pre-existing mental disorders (Duan &amp; Zhu, 2020) . This leads to a dilemma: the higher level of care and support that is required is contravened by recommendations that, especially under conditions of isolation, advise against the routine consultation of clinical psychologists, psychiatrists, and social workers in order to prevent the spread of infections. In this situation, medical staff, who are primarily focused on treating the infection (or complications thereof), must then additionally provide psychological care and be ready to intervene during a mental health crisis. Against this backdrop, some authors advocate for the use of online counselling tools and web platforms to support individuals in isolation and those affected (Liu et al., 2020) . Although these recommendations are directed at the general population and not at a prison population, it does not seem reasonable that such channels of care should not be used for individuals under detention as well. Other models could be envisaged, such as the provision of telephone counselling for prisoners and staff. However, for the current outbreak of Covid-19, such elements may not be implemented quickly enough. This raises the question of how to provide rational, basic psychiatric care under the current challenging conditions. We urge that governments take into account special needs of people in confined closed spaces. They must try: -Preserving continuity in provision of psychiatric and psychological care to individuals in detention is imperative and should remain so during the Covid-19 outbreak. -Early coordination between regional prison authorities, prison psychiatry, and general medical and general psychiatric care providers (e.g. in cases of referrals). This must also include close liaison with court diversion schemes, probation officers and others. Some clear guidance needs to be developed urgently regarding visitors to prisons and jails. -Given the potential shortage of time and human resources, the more severe psychiatric and psychological cases must be carefully triaged. Here, factors such as pre-existing mental illness, self-and extraneous endangerment, violence and aggressive behavior, refusal to eat, and also assessments and recommendations of experienced security staff should be taken into account. -Given the flood of perceivable unsettling information on Covid-19, staff providing psychological or psychiatric treatment should be informed regularly and urgently about symptomatology and presentation and on the realistic clinical course, also in comparison to other infectious diseases or in comparison to other daily risks. Sharing of accurate information without bias and panic is critical. -Ensuring the provision of masks, disinfectants and protective measures in sufficient quantity for psychological and psychiatric staff visiting individuals in detention. -Particular attention should also be paid to certify that staff deployed to provide psychological-psychiatric care in institutions are informed and/or sensitized of known potential risk factors for a more severe course of a Covid-19 infection of their own (advanced age, somatic comorbidities, chronic respiratory diseases, hypertension, cancer, known immune deficiencies etc.). Due to the currently limited understanding of Covid-19, it may be advisable to prohibit employees with such conditions from providing psychological or psychiatric care to individuals in detention and prisons. -If there is a sudden shortage of staff providing psychological and psychiatric care to detained individuals with a mental illness, staff from general psychiatry may have to fill consequential gaps. This needs careful planning on an urgent basis so that the potential of extremely long working hours of medical staff during the current outbreak can be managed successfully.","Given the limited understanding of the prognostic factors for COVID-19, more research is needed to investigate the mechanism by which pre-existing CHD may increase mortality risk among patients with COVID-19. From the clinical point of view, early evaluation of patient medical history is necessary to possibly decrease the mortality risk. we suggest monitoring the dynamic heart rate for patient with pre-existing CHD. For those severe-symptomatic patients who had pre-existing heart ischemia and abnormal heart function, early medical intervention maybe needed [45] . controlling the patient number beneath the capacity limit.

Part of the outpatient department (five single rooms) can be isolated from the rest of the department and kept under negative pressure. If needed, this can be extended to the entire consultation ward. This Institute also includes five large NSB3 laboratories with a total area of 1,200 m 2 , on four floors with diagnostic laboratories, research laboratories, and technological platforms [6] .","A microarray is a miniaturized device containing short (25- to 70-mer) single-stranded DNA oligonucleotide probes (or \u2018oligos\u2019) attached to a solid substrate, as shown in Figure 1. The probes are designed to have sequences complementary to segments of one or more target organism genomes. Oligos may be spotted onto the array by mechanical deposition [2], sprayed on with a modified inkjet printer head [6] or synthesized in situ through a series of photocatalyzed reactions [7]. Probes are placed on the array in a rectangular grid of \u2018features\u2019, each containing many copies of the same oligo. The density of features on the array varies between platforms, from 20 000 spots per slide for a typical spotted array, to several million for platforms such as NimbleGen and Affymetrix that use in situ synthesized oligos. Arrays may be subdivided with a gasket into subarrays, allowing multiple samples to be tested on one slide. Replicate features, scattered randomly across the array, may be used to allow correction for scratches and spatial effects. On some arrays, negative control probes with random sequences are included, to provide a threshold level for background noise correction. ","While HRV can be grown in cell culture, molecular diagnostics are more sensitive and are currently widely available. 141, 153 Typical cytopathic effects can be seen when HRV are grown on human embryonic kidney and human fibroblast cell lines, including WI-38, human foreskin fibroblasts (HFF), MRC-5 and HeLa (see Figure 173 -3). HRV are acid labile which allows differentiation from other enteroviruses; they preferentially grow at pH 7.0 and not at 3.0. 148 Most molecular assays target the 5'UTR, a region highly conserved among all HRVs and enteroviruses; as a result, most molecular assays detect but do not differentiate between HRV and enteroviruses, although newer diagnostic platforms are circumventing this problem. 141, 153 ","There is a disproportionate number of individuals with mental and somatic illnesses among persons in detention (Bhugra, 2020; Ginn, 2012) .

Among the 16 diagnostics studies selected, one study discussed the use of RT-PCR in diagnosing patients with 2019-nCoV [11] ( Table 1 ). The period and type of specimen collected for RT-PCR play an important role in the diagnosis of 2019-nCoV. It was found that the respiratory specimens were positive for the virus while serum was negative in the early period. It has also suggested that in the early days of illness, patients have high levels of virus despite the mild symptoms.","Nucleic acid sequences allow pathogen identification by homology search and phylogenetic positioning, and can achieve species- or strain-level precision. One strategy relies on the amplification and sequencing of conserved target genes, such as bacterial 16S rRNA genes or viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase genes. Even though broad range primers are used with success in many diagnostic and discovery applications, these approaches are limited in their phylogenetic span, fail to identify species with incompatible sequence variation in priming sites, and do not detect genetic reassortants. High throughput sequencing platforms offer a novel and powerful approach for identifying known or yet unknown pathogenic organisms [3], but the current time to results may still represent a limitation in the event of a public health emergency.","A large number of wild animals, including wild boar, geese, gazelles, red deer, wild birds, and captive wild zoo animals (canines, felines, and monkeys) are imported into China from Africa, South America, Oceania, Asia, and other countries every year. 89, 90 To prevent certain exotic diseases that are emerging abroad but are not found in China, such as bovine spongiform encephalopathy, Ebola hemorrhagic fever, West Nile fever, and monkeypox, from entering China, the Chinese government has strengthened surveillance and control of cross-border transmission of these exotic diseases and has established the Joint Control Mechanism of Transboundary Animal Diseases in China and neighboring countries. This includes the establishment of direct dialogue mechanisms at the national level, provincial veterinary departments, and animal disease information sharing platforms, and transboundary animal disease prevention and control stations. 91,92","Existing surveillance databases, new study tools, and innovation methodologies may help to identify population health risks and support Health-EDRM policy development. Using a syndromic surveillance database in the Philippines, Salazar, Law, Winkler [7] showed how an existing clinical based database might be useful in assisting emergency health service planning decision making during outbreaks in armed conflict. Even with the database limitations to report injuries and death, this existing data system was nevertheless useful to support non-communicable diseases\u2019 service caseload planning. Using the computerized random digit dialling methods for rapid data collection after a major urban subway fire incident, Chan, Huang, Hung et al. [8] captured health risk perception, misconceptions, and community first-aid response knowledge in urban man-made emergency incidents. Using social media data from Twitter, Gruebner, Lowe, Sykora et al. [9] showed how the spatio-temporal distribution of negative emotions varied in New York City after a natural disaster. Their study showed that pre-disaster status could be used as a significant predictor of post-disaster emotional outcomes in communities. Using a disturbance management model to estimate logistics constraints in medical supplies during natural disasters, Shi and He [10] examined how medical supplies, which required cold-chain support (e.g., blood and vaccines), might be optimized after natural disasters when transport might be disturbed. Using a three-phase methodology and the online, global, and publicly available databases, Chan, Huang, Lam et al. [11] developed a health vulnerability index (HVI) that captures seven main health dimensions with nine indicators. This index allows the inclusion of non-communicable disease burden of countries/communities into the disaster risk assessment and may reflect underlying health needs and the capacity requirement to address Health-EDRM at the country level.","Community acquired viral infections include both seasonal and pandemic pathogens (31). Seasonal viruses most commonly include RSV, non-pandemic influenza, rhinoviruses, parainfluenza, adenovirus, coronaviruses, and human metapneumovirus (hMPV). Seasonal viruses remain the most frequent cause of childhood community acquired pneumonia (32). The most common etiology of pediatric ARDS is primary pneumonia, with or without systemic infection (15). It can then be assumed that viral infections may play an important role in development of pediatric ARDS. However, determining an accurate estimate of the disease burden of viral-induced pediatric ARDS will be difficult, as many simple viral infections can progress to coinfection with the second virus or a bacterial pathogen. As will be detailed below, with the development of multiplex PCR diagnostic platforms that identify multiple viral agents, further insight into coinfections will develop.","Our study will allow better estimates to be produced of the global burden of COVID-19, in view of the large underdetection of cases. Our findings will support rapid deployment of outbreak surveillance and control capacities in regions at high risk of case importation paired with low surveillance capacity. Our research implies that existing estimates, which assume perfect detection of cases outside of China, should increase values for infection prevalence in the epicentre of the epidemic and reduce estimates of case-fatality based on our prevalence estimates.","mRNA vaccines, like DNA vaccines, are able to induce both humoral and cellular immune responses, encode any antigen of choice and allow a high degree of adaptability. In terms of manufacturing, both platforms allow production of different vaccines using the same established production process and facility. However, since the production process of mRNA is based on in vitro systems and does not require amplification in bacteria or cell cultures, manufacturing of mRNA vaccines is a comparably short and simple to monitor process. As mRNA vaccines do not interact with the host-cell DNA, they avoid the potential risk of genomic integration posed by DNA-based vaccines. Since mRNA vaccines represent a minimal vector containing the ORF encoding the antigen of choice flanked by specific regulatory elements, they do not induce anti-vector immunity as observed for certain viral vector-based platforms (171, 172) and therefore can be administered multiple times. Furthermore, mRNA vaccines can be administered by different routes using conventional needle-based injections and, unlike DNA vaccines, they do not require any additional administration device such as gene gun or electroporation. Therefore, mRNA vaccines offer a flexible one-for-all large-scale, rapid and cost-effective manufacturing process with fast turnaround time. This is vital when facing a pandemic threat requiring a rapid response platform capable of producing protective vaccines in the short time-frame necessary to protect at-risk populations and have an early impact on the progression of an outbreak.","Since 2009, the four Internet-based monitoring systems have formed the foundation of a European-wide network of platforms that became the key instrument for providing real-time disease incidence for the epidemic forecast infrastructure developed by the EU-funded research project EPIWORK (http://www.epiwork.eu). The proposed network of web platforms, called Influenzanet (http://www.influenzanet. eu), saw, for the first time, the collaboration of epidemiologists, public health practitioners and modellers with the aim of collecting epidemiological data in real time through the contributions of Internet volunteers self-selected from among the general population. The epidemiology teams devised reference standard questionnaires for different diseases to collect unified data across European countries (presented in the supporting information). ILI has been the focus in the early deployment of the system, but the final goal is to considerably enlarge the portfolio of diseases and health conditions monitored. In June 2009, the plans to export the platform to other European countries were accelerated by the unfolding of the H1N1 pandemic in the northern hemisphere. A web system very similar to the Italian platform was rapidly deployed in the UK (https://flusurvey.org.uk/) to capture the whole progress of the H1N1 pandemic, with the involvement of the mathematical modelling group at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. This work allowed researchers to detect the differences in healthcare-seeking behaviour between different population groups and changes over time, with significant implications for estimates of total case numbers and the case-fatality rate [5, 6] .","Presently, RT-PCR detection of MERS-CoV RNA remains the most reliable method for laboratory confirmation of infection. However, an actual \"gold standard\" is yet to be classified, with most assays relying on the 2 gene UpE/Orf1a signatures for screening and confirmation of MERS-CoV RNA. This comparative analysis of MERS-CoV rRT-PCR assays evaluates their clinical sensitivity and presents their C T values to enable a robust comparison of diagnostic assay performances on NPOP specimens under our testing conditions. Although C T values from different assays can be affected by various assay components and platforms used, our analyses of 34 URT specimens showed the TIB MolBiol\u00ae LightMix assays to be the most sensitive (94.12%), followed by the Anyplex\u2122 Seegene and GeneSig\u00ae protocols. Discordant results between the assays were seen with those specimens containing low virus concentrations (high C T values), reflecting differences in the limits of detection (LOD) . Evaluating the LOD is critical to preventing underdiagnoses of MERS-CoV infections, and should be a consideration when selecting a commercial assay for routine diagnostics. For these purposes, the European Virus Archive has produced quantitative standards for UpE and Orf1a. However, we were unable to obtain these standards during this investigation. Nevertheless, the TIB MolBiol\u00ae LightMix and GeneSig\u00ae protocols (Assays 2-3) produced some single gene-positive (indeterminate) results, which in a clinical diagnostic setting would require further confirmation by screening a secondary specimen (ideally from the LRT where a higher viral load is expected) before overall interpretation as \"MERS-CoV negative\". Additionally, the GeneSig\u00ae and Anyplex\u2122 Seegene assays also produced several negative classifications for our sequence-confirmed specimens. No such indeterminate or negative results were observed with the RealStar\u00ae assay."],"title":["CHAPTER 4 Keeping Track of Viruses","Communication, collaboration and cooperation can stop the 2019
