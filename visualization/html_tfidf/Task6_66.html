While culturally difficult and requiring socialization, isolating people over 60 years of age and those designated medically vulnerable together in certain designated areas of the camp may need to be considered. One possibility could be sub-sector-level isolation, where 50-100 high risk people could be grouped together in existing areas of the camp where they are already located. 20 Consistent monitoring of fever and other symptoms combined with appropriate testing, if sufficient tests become available, will be an integral part of this strategy. Such an isolation approach would require sufficient resources to provide comprehensive care (e.g., food and supportive services) for isolated community members. Since physical distancing will be extremely difficult, the use of facemasks among those most at risk, and possibly the whole population could be considered if there are eventually sufficient global supplies. Rapid and creative solutions for improving hand hygiene, such as the installation of a multitude of handwashing stations and distribution of hand sanitizer combined with communication campaigns, will be needed. Access to accurate and consistent health information will be critical, as already rumors and misinformation have spread among Rohingya refugees about COVID-19, partly due to camp-wide restrictions on the internet and telecommunications. 21 In the future, the use of people who have recovered from COVID-19 infections will need to be considered after more data become available as to their ability to become re-infected and transmit to others, as was done with Ebola survivors. 22 The three scenarios show varying degrees of increased mortality. Mortality due to COVID-19 is dependent upon various factors, particularly access to hospitals with ICUs and ventilators. Currently, there is only one facility with few mechanical ventilators in the camps and one facility with less than 10 ICU beds and no ventilators. Therefore, it is likely that mortality rates due to COVID-19 will be significantly higher here than in settings where nationals or refugees have such access. Reportedly, the ICUs and ventilators are not functioning in the district hospital in Cox's Bazar, and thus access to health care facilities to treat severe cases of COVID-19 may be equally challenging for nationals.

Intergovernmental organizations serve as valuable resources in a pandemic. The WHO has a variety of tools to assist governments in their response to COVID-19. These include technical guidance such as \u201cCritical preparedness, readiness and response actions\u201d and \u201cResponding to community spread of COVID-19\u201d [1]. It is up to the host nation, however, to educate its population on best practices for infection control: consistent hand hygiene, social distancing, respiratory hygiene, testing, and the use of quarantine.","Telemedicine is a proven modality for delivering palliative care value to the most vulnerable people. Care of people with serious illness and their families now requires impeccable social distancing for their protection and for all healthcare professionals so critically needed in response to COVID-19. Preparation, patience, and practice will help ensure effective implementation of telemedicine. The quick tips offered above are an excellent starting point, but additional support and innovation can help eliminate barriers and stimulate rapid mastery. First, we must find creative ways to ensure that all patients have equitable access to this valuable resource. We must reach individuals with poor social networks, poor technological literacy, and who lack access to technology. Soliciting the help of volunteers, philanthropy, and tech companies who can create plug-and-play telemedicine devices at low-cost can help shore up potential gaps in access. Second, reimbursement for telephone visits, particularly to those in whom video visits are not possible, will incentivize the use of this important modality when it is needed. Third, we must capitalize on this unprecedented time in which telemedicine will become a critical part of healthcare delivery to study processes and outcomes through programmatic evaluation and research to guide best practices in the future.","In addition to epidemics, natural and man-made disasters have highlighted the need for an emergent increase in critical care capacity globally. In 2010, the Pediatric Emergency Mass Critical Care Task Force, composed of 36 experts in domains, including medicine, public health, and disaster response, recommended that equipment and supplies be available to triple the typical ICU capacity for at least 10 days during times of disaster or epidemic illness regardless of location (113). The 2014 CHEST consensus statement on critical care in resource-limited settings calls for development of feasibility plans to address a protracted event requiring long-term use of critical care resources and capacity to immediately expand hospital critical care resources by 20\u2013200% depending on the surge response required by the disaster/pandemic (114, 115).","The immediate and long-term consequences of COVID-19 upon children is vast in terms of their health, safety and well-being. Although children have a low risk of serious illness, the unprecedented disruption of daily life for all families can affect them greatly. The isolation and restrictive measures that have been imposed upon children cause significant disruptions that are not well understood, confusing and even frightening. Not only do parents need to continuously monitor their children's health exposure and illness potential in the short-term but they now must deal with a host of uncertainties that surround their families. These uncertainties are pervasive and of paramount concern such as obtaining sufficient food and supplies, having to stay home from work with or without pay, home-schooling their children and meeting household expenses. These are vulnerable times for all families and their children, especially for families living paycheck to paycheck. Many of the long-term impacts of COVID-19 will go well beyond the initial phase of pandemic containment. COVID-19 has no specific viral affinity for the poor but those from lower socio-economic backgrounds will assume the greatest social burden.","The three locations introduced appropriate containment measures and governance structures; took steps to support health-care delivery and financing; and developed and implemented plans and management structures. However, their response is vulnerable to shortcomings in the coordination of services; access to adequate medical supplies and equipment; adequacy of risk communication; and public trust in government. Moreover, it is uncertain whether these systems will continue to function if the requirement for services surges.","In China, most psychiatrists do not receive adequate training in the prevention and treatment of infectious diseases. Furthermore, in the past decade, internship period in internal medicine has been reduced for medical students whose major is psychiatry in many medical schools in order to extend their training in mental health. All these factors could limit their clinical competence to control the potential transmission of COVID-19 in psychiatric hospitals. In addition, the lack of community-based mental health services has led to an over-reliance on psychiatric services provided by large psychiatric hospitals 10, 11. For the vast majority of patients with serious mental illness, they can only access appropriate mental health care in hospital settings, which are mostly located in city areas. Therefore, they are more prone to exposure to infectious diseases such as the COVID-19, unless the psychiatric hospitals themselves implement stringent measures of infection control similar to general hospitals. Clearly, preventive measures such as the provision of adequate medical supplies and protective equipment, public education on the risks of COVID-19 for hospital staff and patients, and restricting family visits to hospitals, are essential to reduce the likelihood of disease transmission in major psychiatric hospitals. Moreover, all people including patients' families and health care workers need to be advised to wash hands regularly and maintain good personal hygiene. Measurement of body temperature should be performed at least once a day to closely monitor any suspected infectious symptoms. Activities involving group interaction in communal areas should be avoided. Moreover, in order to minimize the potential risk of nosocomial infection, isolation units should be established and hospital access should be restricted for inpatients 9.","In several countries with high-performing healthcare systems where SARS-CoV-2 transmission has been established earlier, both supplies of personal protective equipment in hospitals and the availability of services has been problematic for COVID-19 care, and in all locations, ICU bed capacity is limited. 18 Plans are urgently needed to mitigate the effect of COVID-19 outbreaks on the local healthcare system.","The facility design needs to meet a number of varied requirements to satisfy the range of activities it could be called upon to house. These include: The necessary services to support GMP, such as purified water supplies and systems to monitor the environment and equipment. 4. The ability to accommodate different production methods, such as cell culture and egg culture for viruses, and fermentation processes for vaccines based on bacterial and expressed protein products. 5. An effluent treatment plant and suitable autoclaves for dealing with contaminated waste. 6. Equipment and space for downstream processes such as purification and fill and finish if these are to be completed in-house. 7. Access to quality control laboratories, media preparation laboratories, equipment preparation services, goods ordering and stores services and engineering support. 8. The ability to support more than one manufacturing process at once, so that a wide skill base can be sustained, and maintenance of the facility can be scheduled so as to allow operations to continue in other parts whilst it is undertaken.","The agenda for critical care research in resource-limited settings should include more evidence on epidemiology and outcomes. A more accurate estimate of the potential lives saved through pediatric critical care interventions would justify its role in healthcare systems globally (19). Data on critical care capacity, and access to both critical care resources and health care professionals, are essential for health system planning, but generally lacking. Efforts should be made to adjust critical care guidelines from high-income countries to resource-limited settings. Cost-effectiveness analyses of current and proposed critical care practices need to be emphasized (73). Efficacy must be measured and validated for critical care interventions, with limited resources targeted to those practices that save lives, time, and resources. Currently, available critical care mortality prediction tools and triage scoring systems require revalidation in region-specific contexts (131, 132) and low-cost critical care technology is much needed to support critical care in resource-limited settings.","\uf0b7 Inquire about symptoms of a respiratory infection, history of travel to areas experiencing transmission of COVID-19, or contact with patients with possible COVID-19 before patient triage or registration (for example, at the time of patient check-in). \uf0b7 Attempt to minimize the chance of exposure by trying to screen patients before arrival to a clinical area (for example, asking patients calling for appointments about travel history) and identifying them as early as possible upon arrival (such as by posting signs advising patients to put on a mask if they have respiratory symptoms). \uf0b7 If screening at triage is positive and the patient becomes a person under investigation (PUI), this should be communicated directly to the clinicians who will care for the patient, prevention and control services, and other health care facility staff according to a standard protocol. \uf0b7 Adhere to standard contact and airborne precautions, including eye protection. \uf0b7 Monitor stock and the supply chain to ensure adequate supplies of personal protective equipment. \uf0b7 Manage visitor access and movement within the facility. \uf0b7 Implement mechanisms and policies to promptly alert key facility staff, including infection control, health care epidemiology, facility leadership, occupational health, clinical laboratory, and frontline staff about known or suspected COVID-19 patients. \uf0b7 Identify specific staff to communicate and collaborate with state or local public health authorities. \uf0b7 Hand hygiene, hand hygiene, hand hygiene.","Many sociological factors may also contribute to the emergence/reemergence and spread of viral diseases. Some of these factors include inadequate public health infrastructures, a lack of access to vaccinations or reduced immunization policies (see In-Depth Look), and political conflict or wars that displace millions of people, creating overcrowded refugee populations without access to basic health care or clean water supplies.","The existence of therapeutic alternatives may not be enough to mitigate the negative effect of a medicine shortage. Indeed, if the therapeutic alternative has low market shares, the MAHs supply cannot be enough to fulfil the patients' needs during the crisis. The risks of shortage for the low-market-share alternatives is also increased for a ripple effect. The more monopolistic is the market of a medicinal product, the higher the probability that competitors are not able to sustain the patient demands during a shortage. Indeed, Parsons and colleagues suggested the existence of an inverse correlation between the number of suppliers for antineoplastic drugs in the US and shortages' occurrence (Parsons et al., 2016) . Regardless of the presence of therapeutic alternatives on the market, the lower the supplier number, the greater the number of drug shortages. Therefore, for algorithm level III, the higher the market shares of a medicine (expressed as annual volumes) in comparison to the existing therapeutic alternatives, the higher the potential risks for the public health in case of shortage.","The UK parliament formalized Brexit -divorce from the EUat the end of January 2020. The type of manpower mobility arrangements for health workers due to be negotiated by the end of 2020 between the UK and EU will have a specific and important bearing on the already hard-pressed medical services in the UK [6] . There remains additional uncertainty following Brexit about arrangements for continuity of supplies of medicines, regulation of medicinal products and transnational access to new medicines across the region [7] . Trade and tariff barriers arising from evolving isolationist policies of the USA are also likely to restrict progress on implementation and the health impact of achieving the UN's Sustainable Development Goals, not least through increased international costs of diagnostics, devices and medicines.","Fifth, in all locations, critical care treatment and medicines have been available for patients with COVID-19, but adequate supplies of personal protective equipment in hospitals and face masks in the community are a key concern. In Japan and Hong Kong, hospital supplies are running low but have not yet impacted clinical management. In all locations, pressure on critical care treatment is likely if there is a sustained increase in cases of COVID-19.","The final principle is support. Perianesthesia nursing leaders should ensure that their staff has the proper education and training to care for surge patients, adequate quantities of surge supplies, and sufficient staff reinforcements should a true influenza pandemic present itself. Because of the inherent infection control issues, staff should also receive training regarding which personal protective equipment (PPE) is necessary and how to properly don and doff the PPE. 14,15 Supply shortages will be routine in a pandemic, thereby making it impractical to rely on just-in-time supplies. Some supplies will be available to health care facilities from the federal Strategic National Stockpile; however, these ''push packages'' are delivered to the state level, and it may take time for the supplies to arrive at the local facility requesting the items. 16 As such, par levels should be increased for critical items, in anticipation of high use and broken supply chains.","\u2022 UNICEF published its annual assessment of developing and strengthening supply chains, which improves access to life\u2013saving supplies for children and their families. Optimising UNICEF\u2019s supply chains supports the realisation of children\u2019s rights to health, education, nutrition and protection, and ensures that UNICEF\u2019s programmes have a higher impact. The recent implementation of changes to its supply planning and accountancy systems have led to savings of 4% in supplies procured. UNICEF reported that the new systems also have clear advantages in terms of efficiency, visibility and oversight. These gains will become more evident as the new systems and techniques stabilise and mature. (UNICEF, 30 Jun 2013)","The economic loss caused by the spread of COVID-19 in Iran coincides with the ever-highest politically induced sanctions against the country. Although various sanctions have been in place for the past four decades, since May, 2019, the unilateral sanctions imposed by the USA against Iran have increased dramatically to an almost total economic lockdown, which includes severe penalties for non-US companies conducting business with Iran. The Iranian health sector, although among the most resilient in the region, 3 has been affected as a consequence. 4 All aspects of prevention, diagnosis, and treatment are directly and indirectly hampered, and the country is falling short in combating the crisis. 5 Lack of medical, pharmaceutical, and laboratory equipment such as protective gowns and necessary medication has been scaling up the burden of the epidemic and the number of casualties. Despite WHO and other international humanitarian organisations dispatching supplies and medical necessities, 6 the speed of the outbreak and the detrimental effects of sanctions have resulted reduced access to life-saving medicines and equipment, adding to the health sector's pre-existing requirements for other difficult health conditions. 7 It is shameful that besides the lives lost to this deadly virus, extreme sanctions limit access to necessary materials and therefore kill even more Iranian people.","Using COVID-19 epidemic data from China, the initial epicenter of the outbreak, we will derive parameters for the social network model. First, based on a population study of social mixing patterns in China 15 , the mean number of contacts with unique individuals, over the generation time of COVID-19, is 36, population degree of separation 5.88. Then strict social distancing limits contacts to the household setting and shopping for essential supplies, i.e., 6.3 unique individuals (3.3 in household and 3 in nonhousehold settings), degree of separation 11.5. (See supplementary materials.) Confirmed COVID-19 patients were hospitalized or admitted to isolation centers. Then using open-access daily case reports 16 , we calculate the daily mean reproductive number of the COVID-19 epidemic (Figure 1 ).","Although COVID-19 is a pandemic as opposed to a natural disaster, it too is creating challenges for patients in terms of its impact on normal day-to-day routines (e.g. through social distancing and self-isolation requirements), employment and access to healthcare services which will ultimately create new barriers to medication adherence. Community pharmacists have an important role to play in promoting medication adherence through the provision of evidence-based interventions. 40, 41 However, income losses in particular may affect patients' abilities to continue to pay for their medications. Current medication reimbursement policies should be re-examined in light of the acute income losses faced by many individuals whose jobs have either been lost or are now under threat. For example, access to medication on public health schemes may need to be increased and prescription copayments for patients who obtain their medications on such schemes may need to be reconsidered as these can also negatively impact on medication adherence. 42","Another issue is social isolation. In many countries, including Japan, living alone and social isolation have been growing concerns. Cancelling social gatherings and scaling down elderly care services can put community-dwelling adults, especially older adults, at an increased risk and severity of social isolation. In March 2020, an older woman in the local Tokyo community said, 'Lunch is not tasty; I feel a loss of appetite from eating alone owing to the loss of a gathering place during the lunch break'. Thus, the isolating effects of social distancing should not be ignored, and efforts are needed to mitigate the negative psychological impact. 3 Although recent technological advances may help detect and provide care for groups at high risk of social isolation, community-dwelling older adults may not have access to smartphones or internet services [5] . Therefore, multiple plans and measures to maintain social ties should be prepared at the individual level (family, friends, neighbourhood, etc.), organizational or community levels, and societal levels to prevent or mitigate the negative impact of social isolation and its related problems (from the preparedness phase) on the already vulnerable among the population during an epidemic such as COVID-19.","Concerns about the economic risks of disease spread were not limited to European empires, and neither were the xenophobic practices associated with those concerns. The USA has a history of anti-Chinese sentiment in response to epidemics. Historian James Mohr has described how in Honolulu, doctors, colonial administrators, and the general US colonial population lamented the outbreak of bubonic plague in 1900 because it prompted fears that the city would become associated with Asia, where plague was then present. As plague spread in Honolulu and countries around the world closed their borders or quarantined all vessels arriving from its port, the Honolulu city administrators embarked on a full quarantine of the city's Chinatown, allowing no one to leave. These quarantines imposed considerable hardships on those within, limiting employment, movement, and access to supplies. The area of quarantine encompassed Chinese and non-US properties immediately near the harbour, but avoided buildings and businesses that were owned by white Americans and immediately connected to sites of quarantine. Ultimately, the public health authorities burned contaminated buildings, but fires spread beyond their control and consumed most of Chinatown in flames. Similar anti-Chinese responses occurred in San Francisco during the plague epidemic of 1900-04, when Chinese-specific quarantines were enacted.","\u2022 Litigation: negligent hiring/supervision. under the doctrine of respondeat superior, the employer may be held responsible for negligence by an employee. Training that informs workers on what they can and cannot do can mitigate claims. risk analysis further lowers workplace vulnerability to lawsuits. 19 \u2022 Substance abuse (drugs/alcohol in the workplace). employee drug testing is widely used in industry. policies, procedures, consent forms, checklists, and training materials are needed for such programs. 20 \u2022 Business espionage/theft of trade secrets. For many organizations, the loss of crucial information is of greater importance than the fraudulent disappearance of products or supplies. These transgressions include espionage or theft of trade secrets, including developmental procedures and know-how. \u2022 Environmental/social robberies. robberies are categorized as the third most significant crime in the hierarchy of the FBI's Uniform Crime Reports. robbery is the taking or attempting to take anything of value from the care, custody, or control of someone. Force or threat of force of violence and putting the victim in fear is a characteristic of this crime. robbery mitigation is likely to succeed when risk mitigation is put into place. \u2022 Intellectual property/brand protection/product counterfeiting. The brand, product, and information of an organization are precious assets. Intellectual property can walk out the door or be accessed through a few keystrokes. Security practitioners are interested in preventing this loss and also investigating possible incursions early on to lessen the damage. 21 \u2022 Global supply chain security. The stealing of goods that are being transported or stored is an ongoing concern for product manufacturers and distributors. 22 Outright theft requires prompt investigation and response. Broad transportation issues include container tracking and transit point security. \u2022 Executive protection (including travel security). The protection of senior officials from risk has become a highly evolved skill that draws upon management planning and analysis. 23 protection choreography, advance security preparations, domestic and international travel assessment, and physical training are all involved in the process. \u2022 Insurance/workers' compensation fraud. Organizations that provide workers' compensation insurance sometimes encounter abuse, which requires investigation and response. A security program is generally tasked with investigating other incidents concerning insurance claims. \u2022 Crisis management and response: international terrorism. The bombings of the World Trade Center, the Boston Marathon, the Oklahoma City federal building, and public and private assets in various locales domestically and globally suggest the importance of measures to deter such attacks. 24 As a global activity, security planners look at risks from unstable parts of the world, and political risks from groups such as ISIS (or ISIL) that could destabilize the world and affect conventional operations. \u2022 Bombings/bomb threats. Bombings in the workplace are rare. Bomb threats are frequent. Security practitioners devise strategies to analyze and deal with threats as they are received.","There is little modern health care experience with respiratory mass casualties of this scale. However, it is apparent that the mortality, morbidity, and public confidence in the time of an airborne pandemic are likely to be highly dependent on the critical care response. It is therefore imperative for critical care providers to take the lead in planning and preparing for largescale airborne epidemics and pandemics. Issues to be considered include developing triage protocols, augmenting ICU surge staffing, implementing rational infection control measures, stockpiling medical equipment and supplies, and information sharing among many units.","As there are severe limitations in the medical supplies available in the Iranian public health system to deal with the current SARS-CoV-2 outbreak, international support, additionally to be provided from the World Health Organization, is needed in the country to mitigate the impacts of this epidemic, and to avoid additional spreading. For the moment of the proofs correction of this article, Iran reached 14,991 cases, of them 3,774 in Tehran, 1,301 in Esfahan, and 1,023 in Qom (March 16, 2020). ","WHO gives high priority to food safety, quality and consumer protection programs and food safety is an essential public health function. WHO aims to develop sustainable, integrated food-safety systems for reduction of health risks from the entire food chain. Food safety, in fact, is an essential activity and an integral part of any public health programme (WHO, 2000) . Food-borne diseases (FBD) result in substantial burden on healthcare systems, trade and tourism, market access; and reduce economic productivity and threaten livelihood. But FBDs generally go undetected, mostly due to lack of communication among the human, veterinary, agriculture, and food sectors.","Many participants indicated that the recent enforcement of wildlife protection laws, as well as gun control policies, has significantly reduced the wildlife hunting, trading or consumption activities. Free or low-priced vaccines for domestic animals were provided by the government, but a lack of access to vaccines in rural areas was reported as one of the main risks associated with raising animals in the household. Participants discussed community healthcare facilities and health insurance, including the national immunization programme for children, as providing accessible protection and preventative services to the local population. Public education about rabies was reported as an example of a zoonotic disease prevention programme that had improved local awareness of the need for protective measures and postexposure treatment. However, the lack of management plans to address human animal conflicts in local communities as discussed by some participants brings potential zoonotic risks (Box 3) (Supplementary Data II).","The availability of essential health services at the community level is highly important for the ability of countries to minimise potential health emergencies during the earliest stages. Access to essential health services is one of the key indicators that contributes to the indices of enabling function and operational readiness. When an outbreak occurs, national health systems should be strong enough to be able to ensure the continued delivery of essential healthcare services, including immunisation and maternal health services. Many countries, especially those that are low resource, have insufficient access to essential health services. 34 Expanding access to essential health services in such countries would support the achievement of effective operational readiness, which is insufficient for many countries, as shown in our analysis.","First, many families have to live in a single bedroom with shared kitchen and toilet facilities, causing overcrowding and making self-isolation impossible in confined spaces. 5 Often, children have inadequate space to crawl or play and no access to fresh air. Second, no regulation on temporary accommodation exists regarding what is deemed suitable or how long someone can stay in temporary housing. With COVID-19, these children will stay in temporary accommodation for extended periods because no applications or services are being processed or provided. Third, handwashing and hygiene are reduced because of minimal access to soap, water, disinfectants, and bathrooms. Another issue is that no face-to-face contact with general practitioners and health outreach services is available, including health visitors, which limits routine checks such as early identification of need and risk, health and development reviews with screening assessments, immunisations, promotion of social and emotional development, support for parenting, promotion of health and behavioural change, prevention of obesity, and promotion of breastfeeding. 6 Furthermore, for these families, access to basic essentials (eg, food, nappies) is scarce, with no resources to shop online and many charities and dropins now closed. Additionally, they do not have regular support services (eg, legal advice, weekly allowances, housing or immigration, online access to resources from the National Health Service via WiFi). A further consideration is that risks to parental mental health are increased, especially among single mothers, given that housing instability is associated with an increased risk of depression in mothers. 7 Finally, existing vulnerabilities and risk factors for safeguarding are exacerbated by additional factors introduced by the pandemic.","However, our simulations suggest that even in the more optimistic scenario, where all the age groups reduce their contact rates over 85%, the epidemic is set to rebound once the social distancing interventions are lifted. Our results suggest that social distancing interventions can \"buy us\" several weeks that could prove to be essential to strengthen our health systems and restock medical supplies, but will fail to mitigate the current pandemic. This is in agreement with other modeling results which suggested that very long periods of social distancing would be needed to control transmission [20] . Yet, sustaining social distancing interventions over a period of several months might not be feasible, both economically and socially. A combination of social distancing interventions with testing, isolation and contact tracing of new cases is needed to suppress transmission of SARS-CoV-2 [30] . Further, these interventions need to happen in synchrony around the world, as a new imported case could spark a new outbreak in any given region.","Prevention of food-borne and water-borne diseases involves personal precautions and further development and implementation of food safety programs. Individual travelers can reduce their personal risk of exposure by selection of safe foods and beverages, e.g., using water disinfection techniques (Chapter 8), and selecting freshly prepared fully cooked foods (Chapters 7, 27 and 28). Nations can improve the safety of their food and water supplies by adopting integrated approaches to food safety and designating a responsible authority to assure compliance. The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)/World Health Organization (WHO) have recently established a new framework of microbiologic risk assessment to guide efforts of member countries in reducing pathogen contamination at relevant points in food production chains. International efforts to implement this approach are necessary to reduce risks to human health in the global food market that prevails at this time.","With the rapid spread of the epidemic, more designated treatment hospitals and health care workers were needed to meet the growing number of patients. On January 24, 2020, the local government in Wuhan announced the construction of a 1000-bed infirmary, named Huoshenshan hospital, and a 1500-bed infirmary, named Leishenshan hospital within 10 days, to ease the shortage of beds and treat people diagnosed with the SARS-CoV-2. These facilities are specialty hospitals for infectious diseases, rather than simply units to receive and quarantine patients. Wuhan has also been building 11 mobile Fangcang hospitals (a Chinese name which came from Noah's Ark) and creating tens of thousands of beds, to centralize quarantine and provide medical treatment for confirmed patients with mild symptoms, suspected patients and those who need observation. The new facilities further enhance the local public health capacities. Hospitals offer online consultants and medical services to symptomatic patients and suspected patients, which help reduce the frequency that patients go to hospitals and thereby reduce the risk of being infected. Health care workers, including military medical teams, from across the Chinese mainland arrived in Hubei to provide much needed assistance. At present, more than 30,000 health care workers have arrived in Hubei to help fight the novel coronavirus epidemic. In order to prevent health care workers from being infected, the NHC ensured enough supplies of isolation gowns, gloves and masks and issued a technical guideline for the prevention and control of infection caused by the novel coronavirus [128] .","Several recent publications have addressed the issue of expansion of intensive care in an epidemic [31] [32] [33] . Rubinson and colleagues [32] have recommended modifying usual standards of care, termed ''emergency mass critical care practices,'' to maximize the number of patients treated. Others feel that over-stretching resources and deploying unfamiliar staff may backfire and result in staff infection, as well as a standard of care too poor to be of value. However, most investigators agree that there is a need to develop some surge capacity in response to an epidemic. Preparations include stockpiling positive pressure ventilators and medical supplies, adapting general hospital beds for critical care delivery, augmenting and training staff, enhancing infection control measures, and conducting preparedness exercises. To this end, many local, state, and national bodies have developed such stockpiles and disaster management plans. It is incumbent that all critical care practitioners be aware of these resources and plans . The Appendix lists resources for pandemic influenza planning and preparedness.","To avoid this neglect, we recom mend a primary policy focus on basic, effective actions with potential population impact. A conceptual framework has recently been proposed that illustrates the need for hospital readiness and good quality clinical practice for the dual aspects of identification and care of critically ill patients (appendix). 5 Hospitals should establish effective systems for triage and essential care in emergency units and wards, including patient separation and staff safety. User-friendly, concise protocols should be developed, disseminated, and implemented for good quality and feasible clinical care, with WHO's leadership and through national authorities. Simple physiological signs have been shown to identify critical illness, and single-parameter systems might be easier to use than compound scores. The central role of oxygen therapy should be emphasised, oxygen supplies and delivery systems secured, and guidelines for sustainable and appropriate use issued. Other essential care includes a head-up patient position, suction, and simple chest physiotherapy. When human resources are limited, such care can be implemented by less trained health workers or vital-signs assistants through a protocolised approach and task sharing.","Although the scientific basis for these interventions might be robust, ethical considerations are multi faceted. 9 Importantly, political leaders must enact quarantine and social-distancing policies that do not bias against any population group. The legacies of social and economic injustices perpetrated in the name of public health have lasting repercussions. 10 Interventions might pose risks of reduced income and even job loss, disproportionately affecting the most disadvantaged populations: policies to lessen such risks are urgently needed. Special attention should be given to protections for vulnerable populations, such as homeless, incarcerated, older, or disabled individuals, and undocumented migrants. Similarly, exceptions might be necessary for certain groups, including people who are reliant on ongoing medical treatment.","People experiencing homelessness live in environments that are conducive to a disease epidemic. Many people experiencing homelessness live in congregate living settings-be it formal (ie, shelters or halfway houses) or informal (ie, encampments or abandoned buildings)-and might not have regular access to basic hygiene supplies or showering facilities, all of which could facilitate virus transmission. People experiencing homelessness are a vulnerable group, and their potential exposure to COVID-19 might negatively affect their ability to be housed, and their mental and physical health. People experiencing homelessness aged younger than 65 years have all-cause mortality that is 5-10 times higher than that of the general population. 3 COVID-19 infection might further increase this mortality disparity.","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic will have a large impact in low-resource settings (LRS). 20% of COVID-19 patients become critically ill with hypoxia or respiratory failure (figure). 1 Critical illness, describing any acute lifethreatening condition, is receiving increased attention in global health because of its large disease burden and popu lation impact. 2 Before the COVID-19 pandemic, growing evidence suggested that the care of critical illness was overlooked in LRS-hospitals cannot, or do not, prioritise emergency and critical care. 3 Most critically ill patients are cared for in emergency units and general wards and do not have access to advanced care in intensive care units (ICUs). Data from hospital wards in Malawi showed that 89% of hypoxic patients (oxygen saturation &lt;90%) were not receiving oxygen, and 53% of unconscious patients (Glasgow Coma Scale &lt;9) were being nursed supine without a protected airway (unpublished data).","The ACS bulletin stated the following specific recommendations [11]: Each hospital, health system, and surgeon should thoughtfully review all scheduled elective procedures with a plan to minimize, postpone, or cancel electively scheduled operations, endoscopies, or other invasive procedures until we have passed the predicted inflection point in the exposure graph and can be confident that our health care infrastructure can support a potentially rapid and overwhelming uptick in critical patient care needs.Immediately minimize use of essential items needed to care for patients, including but not limited to, ICU beds, personal protective equipment, terminal cleaning supplies, and ventilators. There are many asymptomatic patients who are, nevertheless, shedding virus and are unwittingly exposing other inpatients, outpatients, and health care providers to the risk of contracting COVID-19.","take some five to six months for the first commercial batches of vaccine to become available, even with innovative regulatory solutions for licensure; this turned out to be the case with supplies available from October 2009 after the emergence of the pandemic virus in April. Nevertheless this contrasted sharply with the reality of disease incidence in countries of the southern hemisphere, which suffered first pandemic waves in summer 2009 along with substantial disease activity in Mexico, north America and the UK. Even among well-resourced countries in Europe, pandemic vaccines were introduced gradually throughout autumn 2009 as supplies became available coinciding with major autumn pandemic waves rather than the ideal of vaccination campaigns having been completed, before they began. In resource poor countries, which relied on donated supplies, pandemic vaccine distribution only occurred from early 2010 onwards [27 ] . Such dissonance in the timing of disease activity and the availability of supplies, coupled to generally mild disease meant that the public's perception and receptivity towards vaccine were ultimately rather mixed.","In the wake of widespread closures of schools, universities and retail business, there has been unprecedented demand on food supplies and other household goods (e.g. toilet paper). Similarly, there have been anecdotal reports of patients stockpiling medications. Unless prompt action is taken, this sudden increase in demand could have a considerable and detrimental effect on the medication supply chain.","Some relevant definitions according to Indian FSS Act 2006 are \u2022 \"Food\" means any substance, whether processed, partially processed or unprocessed, which is intended for human consumption and includes primary food as defined in the Act. \u2022 \"Food safety\" means assurance that food is acceptable for human consumption according to its intended use. \u2022 \"Food Safety Management System\" means the adoption of Good Manufacturing Practices, Good Hygienic Practices, Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point and such other practices as may be specified by regulation, for the food business. \u2022 \"Primary food\" means an article of food, being a produce of agriculture or horticulture or animal husbandry and dairying or aquaculture in its natural form, resulting from the growing, raising, cultivation, picking, harvesting, collection, or catching in the hands of a person other than a farmer or fisherman. \u2022 \"Risk\" in relation to any article of food, means the probability of an adverse effect on the health of consumers of such food and the severity of that effect, consequential to a food hazard. \u2022 \"Risk analysis\" in relation to any article of food, means a process consisting of three components, that is, risk assessment, risk management, and risk communication. \u2022 \"Risk assessment\" means a scientifically based process consisting of the following steps: (1) hazard identification, (2) hazard characterization, (3) exposure assessment, and (4) risk characterization. \u2022 \"Risk communication\" means the interactive exchange of information and opinions throughout the risk analysis process concerning risks, risk-related factors and risk perceptions, among risk assessors, risk managers, consumers, industry, the academic community and other interested parties, including the explanation of risk assessment findings and the basis of risk management decisions. \u2022 \"Risk management\" means the process, distinct from risk assessment, of evaluating policy alternatives, in consultation with all interested parties considering risk assessment and other factors relevant for the protection of health of consumers and for the promotion of fair trade practices, and, if needed, selecting appropriate prevention and control options. \u2022 \"Unsafe food\" means an article of food whose nature, substance, or quality is so affected as to render it injurious to health.","Persons at high risk for complications of influenza infection who have no access to vaccination because of shortage in vaccine supplies might receive a prescription for self-administered oseltamivir, which can reduce the duration of illness and viral shedding if administered within the first 24-48 h of onset of influenza-like illness.","Finally, the political environment and differences in communities and their moods and values are important. The ongoing social unrest in Hong Kong has led to a breakdown of public trust with the government 7 and affected front-line health-care staff and the reception and acceptance of government information. 8 In Hong Kong and Singapore, rumours led to panic purchasing to the extent that shops ran out of some food and supplies. 9 In Japan, concerns related to the Diamond Princess cruise ship and the sudden announcement of school closures fuelled increased public anxiety.","Appropriate supportive care was shown to help reduce many unnecessary deaths in the Ebola epidemic (13). Although often considered part of basic care delivery in resource-rich settings, the availability and sustainability of clean water, reliable electricity, oxygen and compressed air, medical equipment, and support services (radiology, laboratory medicine, microbiology, and transfusion services) are essential for the delivery of critical care. In some areas, lack of basic health care resources, including protective gloves and gowns, intravenous fluids, and simple protocols or guidelines of care, limited the impact of frontline healthcare providers who risked their lives to care for those affected by Ebola (83). As a first step, providing ongoing access to these basic resources may improve survival in many resource-limited settings.","The fourth block is medicines and equipment. So far, no serious shortages have been reported but supplies of personal protective equipment in health facilities have been a concern in all regions leading to re-use, despite the known risks. There is a particular shortage of face masks caused by early panic buying. These shortages have encouraged profiteering, with private laboratories, for example, charging exorbitant amounts for tests. 8 In response, the central government has centralised purchasing and introduced price controls on medicines 9 requiring companies producing relevant equipment to inform the central government of their stocks within 48 h.","Facemasks could mitigate aerosolized transmission especially in areas of high-density during MGs-where crowd densities in Hajj can reach 9 persons per square meter. As the public starts to purchase supplies, mass purchasing can cause shortages for masks which would be best used by HCWs in the healthcare setting.","As of May 31, 2013, 50 confirmed cases of MERS-CoV have been reported, and 27 individuals have died. 9 Although the SARS coronavirus had a much larger global influence, application of the resulting infection control recommendations could limit the spread of this new coronavirus. Early screening for cases among patients and health care workers, limiting access to hospitals by visitors, and availability of adequate supplies and staffing were shown to be most beneficial in controlling the SARS coronavirus. 12 Simple infection control measures such as these can be applied in EDs to limit outbreaks and minimize transmission of more common infections such as influenza.","Risk management is the process, distinct from risk assessment, of weighing policy alternatives, in consultation with all interested parties, considering risk assessment and other factors relevant for health protection of consumers and for promotion of fair trade practices and for selecting appropriate prevention and control options, that is, monitoring measures, etc. The management of food-related risks therefore involves balancing of the recommendations formulated by experts and resources of all types that social and commercial groups and manufacturers can set aside for dealing with these risks (CAC, 2013) .","These results suggest that a government-led subscription model is financially feasible and would likely yield significant economic and political benefits to all participating governments. While the usual challenges of broad multi-national cooperation must be overcome, early traction from organizations such as Civica Rx suggests that focused, inclusive collaboration can ensure sustained supplies of life-saving drugs (32). ","As the novel coronavirus threatens the health of Americans and the US economy, 2 cash transfers have received broad bipartisan support in both the House and Senate as one 3 method to address the severe financial distress brought on by the pandemic (Grisales, 4 Snell, and Davis, 2020). In March 2020, members of the Republican and Democratic 5 parties introduced cash transfers as part of a coronavirus stimulus package, illustrating 6 that the concept of cash transfers and guaranteed income (GI) programs have moved out 7 of the research space and into the policy conversation (Grunwald, 2020) . Nonetheless, to 8 date, neither the proposed stimulus package nor other GI policy proposals discuss how 9 these influxes of cash will or will not interact with means tested benefits and income 10 thresholds, leaving some households at risk of preserving their financial stability at the 11 expense of their access to health insurance and other benefits (Identifying Author). In the 12 midst of an unprecedented crisis and a surge of GI experiments, the field of public health 13 and allied disciplines are ideally situated to lead the policy community in developing 14 models that assist policy makers in ensuring that cash transfer interventions and GI 15 experiments preserve benefits rather than produce new forms of inequality. This paper 16 uses the loss mitigation strategies and ethical framework employed by the Stockton The concept of combating poverty by providing Americans with a cash transfer or 22 GI based on economic need first entered policy debates in the 1960s (Steensland, 2008) . 23"],"title":["COVID-19: Projecting the impact in Rohingya refugee camps and beyond","An Ounce of Prevention: Coronavirus (COVID-19) and Mass Gatherings","Telemedicine in the Time of Coronavirus","A Review of Pediatric Critical Care in Resource-Limited Settings: A Look at Past, Present, and Future Directions","Everything old is new again: COVID-19 and public health","Are high-performing health systems resilient against the COVID-19 epidemic?","The COVID-19 outbreak and psychiatric hospitals in China: managing challenges through mental health service reform","The demand for inpatient and ICU beds for COVID-19 in the US: lessons from Chinese cities","A Strategic Vaccine Facility for the UK","A Review of Pediatric Critical Care in Resource-Limited Settings: A Look at Past, Present, and Future Directions","Preparing for a Surge of Coronavirus Cases","Chapter 16 Emerging and Reemerging Viral Diseases","New regulatory strategies to manage medicines shortages in Europe","What is ahead for health policy and technology in the 2020s?","Are high-performing health systems resilient against the COVID-19 epidemic?","Pandemic Influenza: Impact on Perianesthesia Nursing Areas","NEWS","COVID-19 battle during the toughest sanctions against Iran","A Social Network Model of the COVID-19 Pandemic","On the frontline against COVID-19: Community pharmacists\u2019 contribution during a public health crisis","COVID-19: Active measures to support community-dwelling older adults","Historical linkages: epidemic threat, economic risk, and xenophobia","2 Core Competencies to Create Effective Protection Programs","Mechanical Ventilation in an Airborne Epidemic","Mapping the incidence of the COVID-19 hotspot in Iran \u2013 Implications for Travellers","Chapter 5 Role of risk analysis and risk communication in food safety management","A qualitative study of zoonotic risk factors among rural communities in southern China","Health security capacities in the context of COVID-19 outbreak: an analysis of International Health Regulations annual report data from 182 countries","Impacts of COVID-19 on vulnerable children in temporary accommodation in the UK","Evaluating the effectiveness of social distancing interventions against COVID-19","Chapter 3 Emerging Diseases and the International Traveler","The deadly coronaviruses: The 2003 SARS pandemic and the 2020 novel coronavirus epidemic in China","Mechanical Ventilation in an Airborne Epidemic","Essential care of critical illness must not be forgotten in the COVID-19 pandemic","Scientific and ethical basis for social-distancing interventions against COVID-19","COVID-19: a potential public health problem for homeless populations","Essential care of critical illness must not be forgotten in the COVID-19 pandemic","How to risk-stratify elective surgery during the COVID-19 pandemic?","Intervention strategies for emerging respiratory virus infections: policy and public health considerations","On the frontline against COVID-19: Community pharmacists\u2019 contribution during a public health crisis","Chapter 5 Role of risk analysis and risk communication in food safety management","Chapter 57 Respiratory Diseases","Are high-performing health systems resilient against the COVID-19 epidemic?","A Review of Pediatric Critical Care in Resource-Limited Settings: A Look at Past, Present, and Future Directions","The resilience of the Spanish health system against the COVID-19 pandemic","The cancellation of mass gatherings (MGs)?

The numbers of new infections and deaths in Wuhan are still increasing, which have posed major public health and governance concerns. A series of mandatory actions have been taken by the municipal and provincial governments supported by the central government, such as measures to restrict travels across cities, case detection and contact tracing, quarantine, guidance and information to the public, detection kit development, etc. Challenges such as lacking effective drugs, insufficient hospital services and medical supplies, logistics, etc. have much alleviated with the solidarity of the whole society. The pandemic will definitely be ended with the continuous efforts of both national and international multi-sectoral bodies.","To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate the facemask shortage during the novel coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19) outbreak in China. We have summarized in detail the management strategies implemented by the Chinese governments during the outbreaks. By considering three scenarios for the outbreak development, we simulated the facemasks availability from late-December 2019 to late-April 2020 and estimated the duration of sufficient facemask supplies. Our findings showed that if the COVID-19 outbreak occurred only in Wuhan city or Hubei province, facemask shortage would not appear with the existing public health measures. However, if the outbreak occurred in the whole of China, a shortage of facemask could be substantial assuming no alternative public health measures. Supplies of facemasks in the whole of China would have been sufficient for both healthcare workers and the general population if the COVID-19 outbreak only occurred in Wuhan city or Hubei province....","Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is infecting people throughout the world. It is probable that coronavirus disease (COVID-19) will be transmitted to people experiencing homelessness, which will become a major problem in particular in North America where there are sizable populations of people experiencing homelessness in nearly every metropolitan city in the USA and Canada. In the USA, more than 500 000 people were reported to be experiencing homelessness on any given night over the past decade (2007\u201319).1 The State of Homelessness in Canada 2016 report2 estimated 35 000 people are experiencing homelessness on any given night in Canada. People experiencing homelessness live in environments that are conducive to a disease epidemic. Many people experiencing homelessness live in congregate living settings\u2014be it formal (ie, shelters or halfway houses) or informal (ie, encampments or abandoned buildings)\u2014and might not have regular access to basic hygiene supplies...","Recent outbreaks of infectious pathogens such as Zika, Ebola, and COVID-19 have underscored the need for the dependable availability of vaccines against emerging infectious diseases (EIDs). The cost and risk of R&amp;D programs and uniquely unpredictable demand for EID vaccines have discouraged vaccine developers, and government and nonprofit agencies have been unable to provide timely or sufficient incentives for their development and sustained supply. We analyze the economic returns of a portfolio of EID vaccine assets, and find that under realistic financing assumptions, the expected returns are significantly negative, implying that the private sector is unlikely to address this need without public-sector intervention. We have sized the financing deficit for this portfolio and propose several potential solutions, including price increases, enhanced public-private partnerships, and subscription models through which individuals would pay annual fees to obtain access to a portfolio of vacc...","Abstract Health planning and policy seek to create a group of mutually interacting bodies to produce goods and services to meet the health needs of a population. Recent developments in the health status of the population are characterized by continuous improvement in life expectancy, chronic diseases which absorb 90% of total health care expenditure, differences in the causes of mortality (more than 70% mortality from cancer, heart and brain, and external causes). The new trends in health indicators define the current health policies and lead to the necessity of adapting the health system so as to meet the changing health needs of the population. Especially in the context of the changes in the epidemiological spectrum and the variability in the indices of morbidity and mortality, the focus is not only to further prolong life expectancy but also to improve life expectancy without chronic diseases and without disabilities and to reduce the avoidable mortality, the potential years of life...","OBJECTIVE: When faced with an emergent epidemic with high mortality and morbidity potential, policy makers must decide what public health interventions to deploy at different stages of the outbreak. However, almost nothing is known about how the public view these interventions or how they trade off risks (of disease) with inconvenience (of interventions). In this paper, we aim to understand public perceptions on pandemic interventions, as well as to identify if there are any distinct respondent preference classes. DESIGN: A discrete choice experiment. SETTING: This study was fielded in Singapore between November 2012 and February 2013. PARTICIPANTS: A random sample of 500 Singapore residents aged 21 and over, including 271 women and 229 men, was analysed. OUTCOME MEASURES: Demographic information was collected from each participant. Participants were also shown a series of pairs of alternatives, each combining interventions and morbidity, mortality and cost outcomes and declared a pref...","Recently, more than 300 Chinese patients with psychiatric disorders were diagnosed with the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19). Possible reasons quoted in the report were the lack of caution regarding the COVID-19 outbreak in January and insufficient supplies of protective gear. We outlined major challenges for patients with psychiatric disorders and mental health professionals during the COVID-19 outbreak, and also discussed how to manage these challenges through further mental health service reform in China.","Information about the open-access article 'Wuhan novel coronavirus 2019nCoV' in DOAJ.

Science-based approaches, which are an integral part of risk analysis to improve modern food safety systems, are intimately linked to processes such as good quality practices. Risk analysis strengthens the ability of traditional food safety systems to meet current challenges. Risk analysis is just one part of an effective food safety system. Other components of food safety system like food safety policies, food legislation, food inspection, laboratory analysis, epidemiological surveillance of food-borne diseases, monitoring systems for chemical and microbiological contamination in foods, and information, education and communication, also need to be improved continuously. \u201cFood safety controls\u201d are now being replaced by \u201crisk-based controls\u201d in all stages of food production...","Background: With new cases of COVID-19 surging around the world, some countries may have to prepare for moving beyond the containment phase. Prediction of the effectiveness of non-case-based interventions for mitigating, delaying or preventing the epidemic is urgent, especially for countries affected by the increased seasonal influenza activity. Methods: We developed a transmission model to evaluate the impact of self-imposed prevention measures (handwashing, mask-wearing, and social distancing) due to COVID-19 awareness and of short-term government-imposed social distancing on the peak number of diagnoses, attack rate and time until the peak number of diagnoses. Findings: For fast awareness spread in the population, self-imposed measures can significantly reduce the attack rate, diminish and postpone the peak number of diagnoses. A large epidemic can be prevented if the efficacy of these measures exceeds 50%. For slow awareness spread, self-imposed measures reduce the peak number of d...","Abstract A diet containing high levels of fruit has been associated with a lowered risk of chronic diseases as, in addition to their vitamin and mineral content, they also contain various compounds with health-protective effects, in particular antioxidant and antiinflammatory compounds. Wild plant species are of interest to the food industry because of their ability to replace synthetic chemicals and nutraceuticals; however, the nutritional, economical, and sociocultural values of some neglected and underutilized natural resources have not yet been fully exploited. Some of these less well-known and underutilized fruits, which have the potential to provide novel sources of health-promoting agents, are presented in this chapter (i.e., Asimina triloba (L.) Dunal, Crataegus azarolus L., Lycium barbarum L., Morus nigra L., and Amelanchier canadensis (L.) Medicus). Underutilized fruits could represent an opportunity for growers to gain access to these special markets where consumers place em...","The independent risk factors to predict mortality of critical severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) were investigated. One hundred and two patients diagnosed with critical SARS were admitted to hospitals of Shanxi Province, from March 7, 2003 to June 4, 2003. The patients were prospectively studied after admission to access their short term outcomes and the risk factors associated with adverse outcomes, defined as death. All the demographic and clinical characteristics were studied and univariate and multivariate Logistic regression were employed to access the risk factors. The results showed that of the 102 cases, 23 patients died, with a crude mortality rate of 22.5%. Multivariate Logistic regression revealed that age above 50 [odds ratio (OR) 1. 10, 95% confidence internal (CI) 1.03 to 1.16,P=0.004], lymphopenia at early stage (OR 14.62, 95% CI 1.78 to 11.97,P=0.01) were independently associated with mortality. On the other side, psychotherapy (OR 0.01, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.06,P&lt;0.00...","","ABSTRACT Within weeks, COVID-19 has transformed our practice of palliative care and clinical medicine as we know it. Telemedicine has emerged as a critical technology to bring medical care to patients while attempting to reduce the transmission of COVID-19 among patients, families, and clinicians. It is also increasingly necessary to preserve scarce resources like personal protective equipment. In this article, we share just-in-time tips to support palliative care clinicians and program leaders in providing the best care possible by telemedicine. These quick, practical tips cover telemedicine set-up, patient considerations, and clinician considerations. Next steps include ensuring equitable access to affordable telemedicine technology for vulnerable populations through creative solutions and financing, and dedicated attention to telemedicine evaluation and quality improvement.","Early analysis of outbreaks of novel pathogens to evaluate their likely public health impact depends on fitting predictive models to data gathered and updated in real-time. Both transmission rates and the critical threshold (i.e. the pathogen's 'reproductive number') are inferred by finding the values that provide the best model fit to reported case incidence. These models and inferred results are then the basic tools used for public health planning: how many people expected to be infected, at what scales of time and space, and whether potential intervention strategies impact disease transmission and spread. An underlying assumption, however, is that the ability to observe new cases is either constant, or at least constant relative to diagnostic test availability. We present a demonstration, discussion, and mathematical analysis of how this assumption of predictable observability in disease incidence can drastically impact model accuracy. We also demonstrate how to tailor estimations o...","Abstract The globe is currently in the midst of a COVID-19 pandemic resulting in significant morbidity and mortality. This pandemic has placed considerable stress on health care resources and providers. This document from the Canadian Association of Interventional Cardiology - Association Canadienne de Cardiologie d'intervention, specifically addresses the implications for the care of patients in the Cardiac Catheterization Laboratory (CCL) in Canada during the COVID-19 pandemic. The key principles of this document are to maintain essential interventional cardiovascular care while minimizing risks of COVID-19 to patients/staff and maintaining the overall healthcare resources. As the COVID-19 pandemic evolves, procedures will be increased or reduced based on the current level of restriction to health care services. While some consistency across the country is desirable, provincial and regional considerations will influence how these recommendations are implemented. We believe the framew...","Viral infections of the newborn result in significant morbidity and mortality each year. The fetus and newborn are particularly wlnerable to viral infection. The range of expression may vary from no clinical disease to devastating illness and infection occurring before, during, or after birth. Nursing management is determined by the specific viral infection, the severity of the illness, and the unique conditions of the newborn and his/her family. Promising new therapies are on the horizon that may lessen the severity of viral disease. Until such time, the major thrusts of management of neonatal viral disease are prevention of infection and supportive care for the acutely ill newborn.","Abstract The ongoing novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) pandemic is expected to develop into an unprecedented stress test for health care systems worldwide. This brief report, written from a radiation oncology perspective during the developing outbreak of 2019-nCoV in Switzerland, highlights the challenges identified and measures taken in our department to mitigate risks and ensure continued operations during the outbreak.","BACKGROUND: Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a contagious viral illness first recognized in late 2002. It has now been documented in 26 countries worldwide, with significant outbreaks in China, Hong Kong, Singapore, and Toronto. Research into identifying the etiological agent, evaluating modes of disease transmission, and treatment options is currently ongoing. DISCUSSION: The disease can produce a severe bilateral pneumonia, with progressive hypoxemia. Up to 20% of patients require mechanical ventilatory support, with a fatal outcome occurring in about 5% of cases. CONCLUSIONS: We review the current knowledge about this disease, with particular emphasis on ICU management and infection control precautions to prevent disease transmission.

Unfortunately, only 27 of 138 developing countries are expected to achieve MDG 4. The majority of childhood deaths in these settings result from reversible causes, and developing effective pediatric emergency and critical care services could substantially reduce this mortality. The Ebola outbreak highlighted the fragility of health care systems in resource-limited settings and emphasized the urgent need for a paradigm shift in the global approach to healthcare delivery related to critical illness. This review provides an overview of pediatric critical care in resource-limited settings and outlines strategies to address challenges specific to these areas. Implementation of these tools has the potential to move us toward delivery of an adequate standard of critical care for all children globally, and ultimately decrease globa...","The current state of much of the Wuhan pneumonia virus (COVID-19) research shows a regrettable lack of data sharing and considerable analytical obfuscation. This impedes global research cooperation, which is essential for tackling public health emergencies, and requires unimpeded access to data, analysis tools, and computational infrastructure. Here we show that community efforts in developing open analytical software tools over the past ten years, combined with national investments into scientific computational infrastructure, can overcome these deficiencies and provide an accessible platform for tackling global health emergencies in an open and transparent manner. Specifically, we use all COVID-19 genomic data available in the public domain so far to (1) underscore the importance of access to raw data and to (2) demonstrate that existing community efforts in curation and deployment of biomedical software can reliably support rapid, reproducible research during global health crises. A...","Epidemic diseases are not a new phenomenon, but easy access to transport in the modern world has accelerated their spread. Perhaps some botanical understanding can help slow them down.","To provide convenient access to epidemiological data on the coronavirus outbreak, we developed an R package, nCov2019 (https://github.com/GuangchuangYu/nCov2019). Besides detailed real-time statistics, it offers access to three data sources with detailed daily statistics from December 1, 2019, for 43 countries and more than 500 Chinese cities. We also developed a web app (http://www.bcloud.org/e/) with interactive plots and simple time-series forecasts. These analytics tools could be useful in informing the public and studying how this and similar viruses spread in populous countries.","COVID-19, the first pandemic of this decade and the second in less than 15 years, has harshly taught us that viral diseases do not recognize boundaries; however, they truly do discriminate between aggressive and mediocre containment responses. We present a simple epidemiological model that is amenable to implementation in Excel spreadsheets and sufficiently accurate to reproduce observed data on the evolution of the COVID-19 pandemics in different regions (i.e., Italy, Spain, and New York City (NYC)). We also show that the model can be adapted to closely follow the evolution of COVID-19 in any large city by simply adjusting two parameters related to (a) population density and (b) aggressiveness of the response from a society/government to epidemics. Moreover, we show that this simple epidemiological simulator can be used to assess the efficacy of the response of a government/society to an outbreak.","Abstract Only a month after the outbreak of pneumonia caused by 2019-nCoV, more than forty-thousand people were infected. This put enormous pressure on the Chinese government, medical healthcare provider, and the general public, but also made the international community deeply nervous. On the 25th day after the outbreak, the Chinese government implemented strict traffic restrictions on the area where the 2019-nCoV had originated\u2014Hubei province, whose capital city is Wuhan. Ten days later, the rate of increase of cases in Hubei showed a significant difference (p = 0.0001) compared with the total rate of increase in other provinces of China. These preliminary data suggest the effectiveness of a traffic restriction policy for this pandemic thus far. At the same time, solid financial support and improved research ability, along with network communication technology, also greatly facilitated the application of epidemic prevention measures. These measures were motivated by the need to provid...","SUMMARY Domestic animals can be complementary to experimental mice for studying certain aspects of immunology.

The purpose of this study was to determine the feasibility of conducting a randomized controlled trial (RCT) of convalescent plasma therapy for MERS-CoV-infected patients by using MERS-CoV-specific convalescent plasma obtained from previously recovered patients. METHODS: A survey was adapted from validated questionnaire originally aimed to measure network capacities and capabilities within the International Severe Acute Respiratory and emerging Infection Consortium (ISARIC). The questionnaire was modified for this study to include 26 items that were divided into three main domains of interest: (1) the ability to care for critically ill MERS-CoV patients; (2) laboratory capacity to diagnose MERS-CoV and blood bank ability to prepare convalescent plasma; and (3), research capacity to conduct randomized control...","Surveillance is essential for communicable disease prevention and control. Traditional notification of demographic and clinical information, about individuals with selected (notifiable) infectious diseases, allows appropriate public health action and is protected by public health and privacy legislation, but is slow and insensitive. Big data\u2013based electronic surveillance, by commercial bodies and government agencies (for profit or population control), which draws on a plethora of internet- and mobile device\u2013based sources, has been widely accepted, if not universally welcomed. Similar anonymous digital sources also contain syndromic information, which can be analysed, using customised algorithms, to rapidly predict infectious disease outbreaks, but the data are nonspecific and predictions sometimes misleading. However, public health authorities could use these online sources, in combination with de-identified personal health data, to provide more accurate and earlier warning of infectio...","COVID-19 threatens to overwhelm hospital facilities throughout the United States. We created an interactive, quantitative model that forecasts demand for COVID-19 related hospitalization based on county-level population characteristics, data from the literature on COVID-19, and data from online repositories. Using this information as well as user inputs, the model estimates a time series of demand for intensive care beds and acute care beds as well as the availability of those beds. The online model is designed to be intuitive and interactive so that local leaders with limited technical or epidemiological expertise may make decisions based on a variety of scenarios. This complements high-level models designed for public consumption and technically sophisticated models designed for use by epidemiologists. The model is actively being used by several academic medical centers and policy makers, and we believe that broader access will continue to aid community and hospital leaders in their ...","","","The 2019-nCov will not be the last epidemic to challenge public health experts. The growth of AI-driven techniques to identify epidemiologic risks early will be key to our improvement of prediction, prevention, and detection of future global health risks. The devastating situation in Wuhan, China and future epidemics will also find value in ongoing research in 2019-nCov case detection, spread prediction, treatment effectiveness, and containment. The wide variety, velocity, and veracity of data now available in crises yield data sets that many researchers will now need to incorporate into evermore complex models. This requires expansion of talent within AI for healthcare applications. AI is no longer a niche research area nor is it a tool for the most advanced healthcare systems only, its global impact on healthcare is real and its potential to save lives in this epidemic as well as future epidemics should not be underestimated. It is critical to the global health of all humankind for t...","The 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) pneumonia, believed to have originated in a wet market in Wuhan, Hubei province, China at the end of 2019, has gained intense attention nationwide and globally. To lower the risk of further disease transmission, the authority in Wuhan suspended public transport indefinitely from Jan 23, 2020; similar measures were adopted soon in many other cities in China. As of Jan 25, 2020, 30 Chinese provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions covering over 1\u00b73 billion people have initiated first-level responses to major public health emergencies. A range of measures has been urgently adopted,1,2 such as early identification and isolation of suspected and diagnosed cases, contact tracing and monitoring, collection of clinical data and biological samples from patients, dissemination of regional and national diagnostic criteria and expert treatment consensus, establishment of isolation units and hospitals, and prompt provision of medical supplies and exter...","","R\u00e9sum\u00e9 Aujourd\u2019hui, nous disposons de donn\u00e9es suffisantes qui confortent l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat d\u2019utiliser des bact\u00e9ries lactiques (BL), notamment des souches des lactocoques et lactobacilles, pour le d\u00e9veloppement de nouvelles strat\u00e9gies de vaccination mucosale.

However, the risk factors leading to emergence are poorly understood, which presents a challenge in developing appropriate mitigation strategies for local communities. METHODS: Residents in rural communities of Yunnan, Guangxi and Guangdong provinces were recruited and enrolled in this study. Data were collected through ethnographic interviews and field observations, and thematically coded and analysed to identify both risk and protective factors for zoonotic disease emergence at the individual, community and policy levels. RESULTS: Eighty-eight ethnographic interviews and 55 field observations were conducted at nine selected sites. Frequent human\u2013animal interactions and low levels of environmental biosecurity in local communities were identified as risks for zoonotic disease emergence...","","","Background: In the beginning of January 2020, new unknown virus pneumonia cases started to emerge in local hospitals in Wuhan, China. This virus epidemic quickly became a public health emergency of international concern by the WHO. Enormous amount of medical supplies as well as healthcare personals from other provinces were mobilized to support Wuhan. This current work tent to help people understanding how infectious disease spread and the purpose and consequences of various efforts based on simulation model. Method: a simulation model was created using known parameters. R0 set to 3 and mean incubation time to be 7.5days. the epidemic was divided to 3 periods. Simulation would run 50 times to mimic different patient0 status. Personal activity index was used to mimic different level of control measures. 141427709 simulated patients were created. Cumulation number of patients at the end of period 1 (day50) is 2868.7 \u00b1 1739.0. Total infected patients could be 913396.5 \u00b1 559099.9 by the en...","Background China is running a national level antivirus campaign against the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). Strict control measures are being enforced in either the populated areas and remote regions. While the virus is closed to be under control, tremendous economic loss has been caused. Methods and findings We assessed the pandemic risk of 2019-nCoV for all cities/regions in China using the random forest algorithm, taking into account the effect of five factors: the accumulative and increased numbers of confirmed cases, total population, population density, and GDP. We defined four levels of the risk, corresponding to the four response levels to public health emergencies in China. The classification system has good consistency among cities in China, as the error rate of the confusion matrix is 1.58%. Conclusions The pandemic risk of 2019-nCoV is dramatically different among the 442 cities/regions. We recommend to adopt proportionate control policy according to the risk level to reduce...","AbstractRNA knockdown in vivo carries significant potential for disease modelings and therapies. Despite the emerging approaches of CRISPR/Cas9-mediated permanent knock out of targeted genes, strategies targeting RNA for disruption are advantageous in the treatment of acquired metabolic disorders when permanent modification of the genome DNA is not appropriate, and RNA virus infection diseases when pathogenic DNA is not available (such as SARS-Cov-2 and MERS infections). Recently, Cas13d, a family of RNA-targeting CRISPR effectors, has been shown to accomplish robust down-regulation of cellular RNAs in mammalian cells in vitro. Among the various Cas13d subtypes, CasRx (RfxCas13d) showed the most potent RNA knockdown efficiency in HEK293T cells. However, the RNA-targeting activity of Cas13d still needs to be verified in vivo. In this study, the CasRx system was demonstrated to efficiently and functionally knock down genes related to metabolism functions, including Pten, Pcsk9 and lncLst...","The coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has infected more than 600,000 people and has overwhelmed hospital systems around the world. However, the factors mediating fatal SARS-CoV-2 infections are poorly understood. Here, we show that cigarette smoke causes a dose-dependent upregulation of Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2), the SARS-CoV-2 receptor, in rodent and human lungs. Using single-cell sequencing data, we demonstrate that ACE2 is expressed in a subset of epithelial cells that line the respiratory tract, including goblet cells, club cells, and alveolar type 2 cells. Chronic smoke exposure triggers a protective expansion of mucus-secreting goblet cells and a concomitant increase in ACE2 expression. In contrast, quitting smoking causes a decrease in lung ACE2 levels. Taken together, these results may partially explain why smokers are particularly likely to develop severe SARS-CoV-2 infections, and they suggest that quitting smoking could lessen coronavirus susceptibility.","On the basis of a semi-realistic SIR microsimulation for Germany and Poland, we show that the R0 parameter interval for which the COVID-19 epidemic stays overcritical but below the capacity limit of the health care system to reach herd immunity is so narrow that a successful implementation of this strategy is likely to fail. Our microsimulation is based on official census data and involves household composition and age distribution as the main population structure variables. Outside household contacts are characterised by an out-reproduction number R* which is the only free parameter of the model. For a subcritical domain we compute the time till extinction and prevalence as a function of the initial number of infected individuals and R*. For the Polish city of Wroclaw we also discuss the combined impact of testing coverage and contact reduction. For both countries we estimate R* for disease progression until 20th of March 2020.","Social distancing policies are critical but economically painful measures to flatten the curve against emergent infectious diseases. As the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19 spread throughout the United States in early 2020, the federal government issued social distancing recommendations but left to the states the most difficult and consequential decisions restricting behavior, such as canceling events, closing schools and businesses, and issuing stay-at-home orders. We present an original dataset of state-level social distancing policy responses to the epidemic and explore how political partisanship, COVID-19 caseload, and policy diffusion explain the timing of governors' decisions to mandate social distancing. An event history analysis of five social distancing policies across all fifty states reveals the most important predictors are political: all else equal, Republican governors and governors from states with more Trump supporters were slower to adopt social distancing polici...","With the worldwide outbreak of COVID-19, an accurate model to predict how the coronavirus pandemic will evolve becomes important and urgent to help policy makers in different countries address the epidemic outbreak and determine policies to control spread more efficiently and effectively. Unlike the classic public health and virus propagation models, this new projection model takes government intervention and public response into account to make reliable projections of the outbreak 10 days to 2 weeks in advance.","","The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is straining healthcare resources worldwide, prompting social distancing measures to reduce transmission intensity. The amount of social distancing needed to curb the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in the context of seasonally varying transmission remains unclear. Using a mathematical model, we assessed that one-time interventions will be insufficient to maintain COVID-19 prevalence within the critical care capacity of the United States. Seasonal variation in transmission will facilitate epidemic control during the summer months but could lead to an intense resurgence in the autumn. Intermittent distancing measures can maintain control of the epidemic, but without other interventions, these measures may be necessary into 2022. Increasing critical care capacity could reduce the duration of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic while ensuring that critically ill patients receive appropriate care.","An increasingly large proportion of immigrants to developed countries is arriving from less developed countries in Africa, Asia, and Latin America. When these immigrants return to their country of origin to visit friends and relatives, they are at high risk of acquiring tropical infections, compared with other travelers. Immigrants who return to their country of origin to visit friends and relatives (VFRs) are more likely to travel to rural areas for long periods of time, to consume contaminated food and beverages, and to have more prolonged, intimate contact with local populations. As a group, they are less likely to seek pretravel advice or take antimalarial chemoprophylaxis. This article discusses the increased risk of tuberculosis, malaria, food- and waterborne illnesses, hepatitis A, and HIV and other sexually transmitted infections in VFRs."],"title":["The novel coronavirus outbreak in Wuhan, China","Facemask shortage and the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak: Reflection on public health measures","COVID-19: a potential public health problem for homeless populations","Financing Vaccines for Global Health Security","Chapter 25 Public Health Policies in European Union: An Innovation Strategy\u2014Horizon 2020","Public preferences for interventions to prevent emerging infectious disease threats: a discrete choice experiment","The COVID-19 outbreak and psychiatric hospitals in China: managing challenges through mental health service reform","Wuhan novel coronavirus 2019nCoV","Statistics-Based Predictions of Coronavirus Epidemic Spreading in Mainland China","Rapid random access detection of the novel SARS-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2, previously 2019-nCoV) using an open access protocol for the Panther Fusion","Chapter 5 Role of risk analysis and risk communication in food safety management","Impact of self-imposed prevention measures and short-term government intervention on mitigating and delaying a COVID-19 epidemic","Chapter 9 Nutraceuticals in Alternative and Underutilized Fruits as Functional Food Ingredients: Ancient Species for New Health Needs","Short term outcome and risk factors for mortality in adults with critical severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)","Ensuring global access to COVID-19 vaccines","Telemedicine in the Time of Coronavirus","Fear, Access, and the Real-Time Estimation of Etiological Parameters for Outbreaks of Novel Pathogens","Precautions and Procedures for Coronary and Structural Cardiac Interventions during the COVID-19 Pandemic: Guidance from Canadian Association of Interventional Cardiology","Viral Infections of the Newborn","Contingency plans in a radiation oncology department amid the 2019-nCoV outbreak in Switzerland","ICU management of severe acute respiratory syndrome","A Review of Pediatric Critical Care in Resource-Limited Settings: A Look at Past, Present, and Future Directions","No more business as usual: agile and effective responses to emerging pathogen threats require open data and open analytics","Redeploying plant defences","Open-source analytics tools for studying the COVID-19 coronavirus outbreak","Modeling COVID-19 epidemics in an Excel spreadsheet: Democratizing the access to first-hand accurate predictions of epidemic outbreaks","Lessons learned from the 2019-nCoV epidemic on prevention of future infectious diseases","De l\u2019utilit\u00e9 des animaux domestiques pour la recherche en immunologie","Feasibility of a randomized controlled trial to assess treatment of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection in Saudi Arabia: a survey of physicians","Communicable Disease Surveillance Ethics in the Age of Big Data and New Technology","A model to forecast regional demand for COVID-19 related hospital beds","The First Confirmed Case of Human Avian Influenza A(H7N9) in Hong Kong and the Suspension of Volunteer Services: Impact on Palliative Care","Crowdsourcing data to mitigate epidemics","The Role of Augmented Intelligence (AI) in Detecting and Preventing the Spread of Novel Coronavirus","Timely mental health care for the 2019 novel coronavirus outbreak is urgently needed","Will the COVID-19 pandemic make us reconsider the relevance of short food supply chains and local productions?","Utilisation des bact\u00e9ries lactiques comme vecteurs vaccinaux","A qualitative study of zoonotic risk factors among rural communities in southern China","An integrated response to the impact of coronavirus outbreak on the Emergency Medical Services of Emilia Romagna","Essential care of critical illness must not be forgotten in the COVID-19 pandemic","A model simulation study on effects of intervention measures in Wuhan COVID-19 epidemic","Risk map of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) in China: proportionate control is needed","Modulation of metabolic functions through Cas13d-mediated gene knockdown in liver","Cigarette smoke triggers the expansion of a subpopulation of respiratory epithelial cells that express the SARS-CoV-2 receptor ACE2","Mitigation and herd immunity strategy for COVID-19 is likely to fail","Pandemic Politics: Timing State-Level Social Distancing Responses to COVID-19","A New, Simple Projection Model for COVID-19 Pandemic","Cannabidiol as prophylaxis for SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19?
