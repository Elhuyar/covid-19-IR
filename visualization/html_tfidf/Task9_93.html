The IHR bind WHO member countries to not only notify all events that may constitute a public health emergency, but also to respond to requests for verification of information. WHO has also produced outbreak communication guidelines to aid in the dissemination of information to the public, recognizing that 'expertise [in communications] has become as essential to outbreak control as epidemiological training and laboratory analysis'. 2 The boundaries between risk communication and management are not, however, sharply delineated, as illustrated by the controversy surrounding H5N1 influenza virus sharing. Indonesia is one of the countries hardest hit by outbreaks of H5N1. Virus sharing with the international community is the mechanism by which, first, viruses developing pandemic potential can be tracked (risk communication), and second, vaccines can be developed to meet global need (risk management). Indonesia refused to virus share, not because it was opposed to the sharing of technical information to better understand the threat posed by H5N1 avian influenza, but because it felt excluded from equitable access to the resulting vaccine, meaning that its management of a subsequent pandemic would be constrained. 3 It could be argued that Indonesian authorities currently view virus sharing as an important element in risk management and thus a sovereign issue, although the international community, by contrast, views virus sharing as a critical element of risk communication and, by extension, a global risk management issue. Differing interpretations of international treaties are possible and resolution is proving challenging. 4 Ultimately, the debate is centred on the boundary between the governance of risk communication and risk management, the former now being mandated through international laws, with the latter remaining, to a large degree, a national sovereignty responsibility.","COVID-19 is a strong contagious acute respiratory disease, the course of development is fast, the symptom such as patients with high fever, difficulty breathing [1] [2] [3] 5] , there is no specific medicine, treatment is more suit the support is given priority to, appear easily in patients with anxiety and panic, and hospitalization after strict isolation environment cannot receive relatives and friends of emotional support, message block, prone to pessimism and despair, often have a lot of psychological pressure, was in a state of crisis, the urgent need for psychological support and intervention. But as a result of the new virus infectivity, mainly for the droplet and contact transmission in close communication, the traditional face-to-face psychological crisis intervention, on the one hand, easy to cause disease is on the other hand also increases medical supplies such as isolation of a large number of consumption, are more likely to cause cross infection, and telephone psychological crisis intervention is effective to avoid the spread of the virus, but also has better timeliness. Our daily morning patients by phone or radio link, understand the patients psychological condition at present, the problems existing in the process of its life or treatment timely communication and solve, stable patients with their own emotions, and disease education, more positive information feedback to the patient, strengthen the positive emotions, increase treatment adherence, cooperate to ward treatment, prevent impulse to run, self-injury, hurt, such as abnormal behavior, adverse effects on individuals, families and society.","Previous studies have demonstrated that hospital-related transmission was suspected to be the possible mechanism of infection for affected HCWs 45 . Thus, it is easy to understand that family members (that is, HCWs) directly contact with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 patients was associated with higher risk for GAD among participants, because they excessively concerned that their families might be infected or even die. This is consistent with the results of a previous study representing that family members of H1N1 patients suffer anxiety 18 .","In order to protect HCWs from possible long-term psychiatric impact, the health authority should enhance preparedness with constant risk communication to HCWs. Psychological support of HCWs with self-coping strategies should be provided in a timely manner in order to strengthen resilience and capacity to mitigate fear, anxiety and stress. Mental health professionals should be more proactive and be considered part of the multidisciplinary team that manages SARS or other infectious disease outbreaks [12] . Finally, for pandemic planning, the likelihood of prolonged subjective distress and occupational difficulties in a substantial percentage of HCWs should be factored into surge capacity modelling during and after the pandemic [55] . Further longitudinal follow-up studies of SARS survivors should be conducted to evaluate the course of psychiatric consequences. Multicentre or even cross-country research should be actively encouraged so as to increase the power of research studies and explore cultural differences. The psychological effects of the disease outbreak on other at-risk populations (e.g., victims' families) and their correlation with the patient's psychological health should also be determined. The impact of the threat or actual loss of family members and friends due to the disease outbreak should be explored. In case of an unfortunate future massive outbreak, a prospective study with an early baseline and longitudinal assessment should also be adopted. Research networks with protocols and instruments that have been preselected and propositioned should be established well before the occurrence of a massive outbreak in order to avoid chaotic conditions that may pose various constraints to further studies.","Risk Assessment is central scientific component of risk analysis (preferably performed by Veterinary Public Health) but risk management, defines the problem, articulates the goals of the risk analysis, and identifies the questions to be answered by the risk assessment (preferably performed by Public Health). Science-based tasks of measuring and describing nature of risk being analyzed (i.e., risk characterization) are performed during risk assessment. Risk management and risk assessment are performed within an open and transparent environment based on communication and dialog. Risk communication encompasses an interactive exchange of information and opinions among risk managers, risk assessors, the risk analysis team, consumers, and other stakeholders. Process often culminates with implementation and continuous monitoring of a course of action by risk managers (FAO/WHO-Provisional Edition, 2005) .","Risk communication is interactive exchange of information and opinions throughout risk analysis process concerning risk, risk-related factors and risk perceptions, among risk assessors, risk managers, consumers, industry, the academic community and other interested parties, including explanation of risk assessment findings and basis of risk management decisions. Risk communication should:","Drawing on the social amplification of risk model [31], public risk perception is shaped by a process of interplays between psychological, cultural, social, and institutional factors that may result in amplifying or attenuating the public attention to risk. Mass communication is among the list of factors. Public health officials have long recognised the role of the mass media in disseminating risk and emergency information before, during, and after a catastrophe [32]. The World Health Organization establishes guidelines for \u201ceffective media communication\u201d, through which the authorities are able to disseminate information to the public [33]. Communication during crisis was traditionally understood to be a one-way and top-down process, in which the public are assumed to be \u201cdeficient\u201d in knowledge, while the scientists, public health experts, and emergency managers, are \u201csufficient\u201d [34]. But this presumption was profoundly challenged by the emergence of social media. For instance, Leung and Nicoll argued that the 2009 H1N1 pandemic was the first pandemic in which social media \u201cchallenged conventional public health communication\u201d [35]. In China, online messages were published ahead of the official statement in the 2008 Sichuan Earthquake [36]. Social media enabled people under crisis to share information and experience and to seek message credibility and confirmation via multiple media platforms and social networks [34]. Our study demonstrated that official data released by health authorities, whether in Beijing or Geneva, received strong reactions in the Chinese online community. With such knowledge, social media should be incorporated in the best practices for risk and crisis communication [37]. Social media data can also provide health authorities, researchers and the media a quantifiable measure of public attention towards a particular disease outbreak [11].","Furthermore, risk perceptions as well as efficacy beliefs in the early stages of a possible pandemic are dependent on communications with and between the members of the groups at risk. Risk communication messages that are not comprehended by the public at risk, or communication of conflicting risk messages will result in lack of precautionary actions. Communications that are perceived as coming from a non-trustworthy source may have the same results. However, risk communication messages are sometimes very quickly adopted by the media, possibly leading to an \u2018amplification\u2019 of risk information that may lead to unnecessary mass scares and unnecessary or ineffective precautionary actions.","Then there is the matter of the ophthalmologist and others who voiced concerns in the media about a cluster of cases of a flu-like illness near the end of December. At the present time, it is difficult to say whether or not the response could have been faster than it actually was, as this corresponds to the time when work began on viral sequencing. It is possible that medical teams were already working on the sequence at that time. It is also quite possible that officials did not initially sound the alarm publicly because they did not want to cause a panic. Perhaps this was the wrong decision, but these decisions are difficult in times of crisis and it is of course easy to second guess. It is easy to understand that this can be perceived as withholding information and why the public would be frustrated. The lesson here is that dissemination of accurate and validated information and establishing guidelines to prevent the spread of infections is critical.","Implicit to better risk communication is a belief that better risk management will automatically follow. Surveillance is, after all, 'information for action'. Communication, co-operation and coordination are necessary at an international level. However, they are also, as the illustration below highlights, necessary at national and subnational levels.","Of the 176 pharmacists attending training workshops, 50 became DBND trainers. By 13-Nov-07, 50 lectures had been provided by DBND trainers at 6 nursing schools and 19 ECE programmes, targeting over 600 nursing and 250 ECE students or managers. Over 450 classrooms and 13 childcare agencies have participated in this programme, impacting over 12,500 children, their teachers and families. Feedback from pharmacist trainers, nursing instructors and students, children and teachers has been positive. The programme has opened new lines of communication with school boards and public health departments.","Risk communication: the interactive exchange of information and opinions throughout the risk analysis process concerning risk, risk-related factors, and risk perceptions, among risk assessors, risk managers, consumers, industry, the academic community and other interested parties, including the explanation of risk assessment findings and the basis of risk management decisions.","Appropriate risk communication could help prevent infodemics (World Health Organization, 2020b) or an excessive amount of information circulating in affected populations which might induce public restlessness or panic. In response to the ongoing outbreak, our results demonstrated that GT could potentially define the proper timing and location for risk communication.","There are many concepts of communication in relation to risk associated with outbreaks. As these are relatively new concepts, this article will consider approaches relating to highlighting public health threats and supporting operational management, addressing these as the communication of risk and subsequent risk management. Strategic considerations are critical to both, although information, messengers, communication tools and audiences may differ. The communication of risk refers to the process by which information regarding outbreaks is identified and shared with the purpose of increasing awareness amongst key stakeholders of the threat. Key stakeholders for public health threats include WHO, national governments and the public. Risk management, by contrast, refers to the management processes associated with response to the outbreak, for which communication is crucial at each stage. Three examples are used to explore the challenges and demands of communicating effectively and coherently given this changing landscape. This brief paper will attempt to show the progress made, draw lessons to be learned and outline the ways forward.","Some relevant definitions according to Indian FSS Act 2006 are \u2022 \"Food\" means any substance, whether processed, partially processed or unprocessed, which is intended for human consumption and includes primary food as defined in the Act. \u2022 \"Food safety\" means assurance that food is acceptable for human consumption according to its intended use. \u2022 \"Food Safety Management System\" means the adoption of Good Manufacturing Practices, Good Hygienic Practices, Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point and such other practices as may be specified by regulation, for the food business. \u2022 \"Primary food\" means an article of food, being a produce of agriculture or horticulture or animal husbandry and dairying or aquaculture in its natural form, resulting from the growing, raising, cultivation, picking, harvesting, collection, or catching in the hands of a person other than a farmer or fisherman. \u2022 \"Risk\" in relation to any article of food, means the probability of an adverse effect on the health of consumers of such food and the severity of that effect, consequential to a food hazard. \u2022 \"Risk analysis\" in relation to any article of food, means a process consisting of three components, that is, risk assessment, risk management, and risk communication. \u2022 \"Risk assessment\" means a scientifically based process consisting of the following steps: (1) hazard identification, (2) hazard characterization, (3) exposure assessment, and (4) risk characterization. \u2022 \"Risk communication\" means the interactive exchange of information and opinions throughout the risk analysis process concerning risks, risk-related factors and risk perceptions, among risk assessors, risk managers, consumers, industry, the academic community and other interested parties, including the explanation of risk assessment findings and the basis of risk management decisions. \u2022 \"Risk management\" means the process, distinct from risk assessment, of evaluating policy alternatives, in consultation with all interested parties considering risk assessment and other factors relevant for the protection of health of consumers and for the promotion of fair trade practices, and, if needed, selecting appropriate prevention and control options. \u2022 \"Unsafe food\" means an article of food whose nature, substance, or quality is so affected as to render it injurious to health.","For phone conversations with both families and patients, we are developing a protocol which includes finding a quiet space to make the call, stating immediately that there is no emergency, and acknowledging the challenges of phone communication. Due to limits of phone-based communication, we are now acquiring the equipment and experimenting with platforms for video visits. For patients on the ventilator, we allow families to see the serious condition of the family member, as what they often remember from phone calls with staff is the ways in which the patient is \"stable\" (2). This is especially important, as families are remote when making the decision to transition to comfort care, in many cases not being allowed to come to the hospital to say their goodbyes.","Risk analysis should include clear, interactive, and documented communication, among risk assessors and risk managers. In fact risk communication should be more than dissemination of information. Its major function should be to insure that all information and opinion required for effective risk management is incorporated into decision-making process.","In accordance with Xiang et al. (2020) timely mental health care needs to be developed urgently. Some methods used in the SARS outbreak could be helpful for the response to the 2019-nCoV outbreak. Multidisciplinary mental health teams established by health authorities at regional and national levels (including psychiatrists, psychiatric nurses, clinical psychologists, and other mental health workers) should provide mental health support for patients and health workers. Specialized psychiatric treatments and appropriate mental health services and facilities should be supplied to patients with comorbid mental disorders. In addition, health workers and patients should receive clear communication with regular and accurate updates regarding the 2019-nCoV outbreak, in order to address their sense of uncertainty and fear. Treatment plans, progress reports, and health status updates should be given to both patients and their families. Furthermore, safe services should be set up to provide psychological counseling using electronic devices and applications (such as smartphones and WeChat) for not only the affected patients, but also their families and members of the audience. Safe communication channels for patients and their families, such as smartphone communication and WeChat, should be encouraged to decrease isolation.","An effective FSMS helps in developing an effective \"risk analysis framework\" to collect and analyze the best available scientific information on a hazard that presents a risk to people, animals, or plants and consider the information along with other important nonscientific information, about a chemical, biological or physical hazard, possibly associated with food in order to select the best option to manage that risk based on various alternatives identified (FAO/WHO-Provisional Edition, 2005). 5.4 Risk assessment Risk analysis process begins with risk management defining problem, articulating goals of risk analysis and defining questions to be answered by risk assessment. Next step is to develop a risk profile, that is, science-based tasks of \"measuring\" and \"describing\" nature of risk being analyzed (i.e., risk characterization) are performed during risk assessment. Risk management and assessment are performed in an open and transparent environment based on communication and dialog. The process often culminates with the decision for implementation and continuous monitoring of a course of action by risk managers (FAO/WHO-Provisional Edition, 2005) . But the process does not end with the decision itself. Members of the risk analysis team regularly monitor the success and impact of their decision. Modifications are made as required-on the basis of new data or information or changes in the context of the problem-to achieve further reductions in adverse human health effects (FSSAI, 2010).","The development of this case study is grounded on the Crisis and Emergency Risk Communication (CERC) framework, which was created by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) as a theoretical framework for research and practice [3,12]. Such framework describes how health communication functions within the context of risks and crisis. As the name reflects, CERC seeks to merge the traditions and best practices of risk communication into crisis communication. It positions communication centrally throughout the risk and crisis communication process, and it emphasizes the role of communication, primarily as a management tool from centralized authorities to the public through mass media channels. In this case report, we focus on the role of ERC as a crisis management tool during the MERS outbreak in Qatar by describing the delivery of information by central public health authorities and its reporting through a major media channel.","Social media, in addition to being a tool to release and track official outbreak information [38], offers a new opportunity for public health practitioners to understand social and behavioral barriers to infection control, to identify misinformation and emerging rumors [39], and to better understand the sentiments and risk perception associated with outbreaks and preventive and control measures [13]. In turn, these will help facilitate better health communication between public health agencies and the society at large, as well as among citizens themselves.","Major Health-EDRM research evidence gaps were found during a global research agenda setting meeting of the 2018 WHO Health-EDRM global research group in Kobe. Kayano, Chan, Murry et al. [2] highlighted the development need for relevant research methodologies, risk communication approaches, health data management strategies, practical health emergency study ethical guidelines, bridging global research capacity disparities, and infrastructure constraints, to ensure knowledge advancement in Health-EDRM. The authors also pointed out the lack of understanding of psychosocial health risk profiling in population subgroups. Reifel\u2019s analysis showed a better understanding of current doctrines and practices in both clinical mental health practices and policy, which will help to bridge the conceptual interlinkages between the preventive-based disaster risk reduction policy agenda and the curative-focused disaster mental health discipline [3]. Genereux, Schluter, Tamahashi et al. [4] argued that standardizing psychometrically robust instruments would also be urgently needed to identify at-risk patients throughout\u2014before, during, and after emergencies and disasters\u2014to ensure that mental and social health needs are addressed throughout the pathway of care (prevention, screening, diagnosis, treatment, and rehabilitation). Aung, Murry and Kayano [5] discussed the need for new research and ethical guidelines to harmonize research efforts in Health-EDRM and Kubo, Yanasan, Herbosa et al. [6] described the challenges in the standardization of health data collection throughout the research processes.","Health professionals, especially those working in hospitals caring for people with confirmed or suspected 2019-nCoV pneumonia, are vulnerable to both high risk of infection and mental health problems. They may also experience fear of contagion and spreading the virus to their families, friends, or colleagues. Health workers in a Beijing hospital who were quarantined, worked in high-risk clinical settings such as SARS units, or had family or friends who were infected with SARS, had substantially more post-traumatic stress symptoms than those without these experiences. 8 Health professionals who worked in SARS units and hospitals during the SARS outbreak also reported depression, anxiety, fear, and frustration. 6 Despite the common mental health problems and disorders found among patients and health workers in such settings, most health professionals working in isolation units and hospitals do not receive any training in providing mental health care. Timely mental health care needs to be developed urgently. Some methods used in the SARS outbreak could be helpful for the response to the 2019-nCoV outbreak. First, multidisciplinary mental health teams established by health authorities at regional and national levels (including psychiatrists, psychiatric nurses, clinical psychologists, and other mental health workers) should deliver mental health support to patients and health workers. Specialised psychiatric treatments and appropriate mental health services and facilities should be provided for patients with comorbid mental disorders. Second, clear communication with regular and accurate updates about the 2019-nCoV outbreak should be provided to both health workers and patients in order to address their sense of uncertainty and fear. Treatment plans, progress reports, and health status updates should be given to both patients and their families. Third, secure services should be set up to provide psychological counselling using electronic devices and applications (such as smartphones and WeChat) for affected patients, as well as their families and members of the public. Using safe communication channels between patients and families, such as smartphone communication and WeChat, should be encouraged to decrease isolation. Fourth, suspected and diagnosed patients with 2019-nCoV pneumonia as well as health professionals working in hospitals caring for infected patients should receive regular clinical screening for depression, anxiety, and suicidality by mental health workers. Timely psychiatric treatments should be provided for those presenting with more severe mental health problems. For most patients and health workers, emotional and behavioural responses are part of an adaptive response to extraordinary stress, and psychotherapy techniques such as those based on the stress-adaptation model might be helpful. 7, 10 If psychotropic medications are used, such as those prescribed by psychiatrists for severe psychiatric comorbidities, 6 basic pharmacological treatment principles of ensuring minimum harm should be followed to reduce harmful effects of any interactions with 2019-nCoV and its treatments.","One of the dendritic cell populations, the plasmacytoids, is able to make T cells expand but to a lesser degree than their parents, the myeloids. While the first can induce tolerance to allergens, particularly inhaled allergens, the second are strongly immunogenic and favour the Th 2 profile in the immune response and allergy, attenuating the role of plasmacytoids in TNF-\u03b1 secretion and facilitate the proliferation of memory CD 8 + cells 3, 56 . Viral stimulation can cause an interconversion of the plasmacytoids cells into myeloids, passing in terms of inhaled allergens from tolerogenic behaviour to an increased response with allergy profile 57 . This is a significant handicap, particularly for the popu lations at risk of allergy and asthma. Viral influence in neurogenic inflammation deserves mentioning, even if is seemingly less important or less studied. If the rupture of the epithelium can lead to the discovery of nervous fibre terminals, the virus stimulates the M 2 receptors and determines the hyperexpression of NK 1 , contributing to an increased bronchoconstrictor reflex and inflammation 29, 58 . This fragility demonstrated by the asthmatic in the face of viral attack makes it easy to understand that defences can be easily breached in severe infections, for example RSV, and the virus's persistence is a decisive influence on the phenotype and the syndrome's clinical course. We must not forget that an ineffectual antiviral response can be a determinant in the onset of allergy and asthma, especially in susceptible patients. This is theoretical and widely accepted today, but awaiting scientific confirmation and validation in clinical reality.","One of the dendritic cell populations, the plasmacytoids, is able to make T cells expand but to a lesser degree than their parents, the myeloids.

It is possible to use a variety of non-public facing video communication tools, many of which are free or low cost, including, Apple FaceTime, Facebook Messenger video chat, Google Hangouts video, and Skype. Consult with local leadership for specific institutional guidelines. \u2022 Patients need access to a smartphone, tablet, or a computer with audio and a camera as well as a data-plan or internet connection. \u2022 For patients who are new to telemedicine, identify one key contact (preferably Englishspeaking) who can serve as the \"technological liaison\" for the patient/family. \u2022 When resources allow, designate palliative care program administrative staff and/or volunteers to reach out to the \"technological liaison\" at least 1-2 days before the telemedicine visit to provide set-up instructions and perform a test run. Ensure the \"technological liaison\" is available during the scheduled visit to troubleshoot technological glitches in real-time. \u2022 For programs that have a patient portal as part of the electronic medical record, a \"dot phrase\" that includes instructions for patients/families on how to download the telemedicine platform and prepare for the visit can be helpful. Provide this information a few days prior to the visit.","The emergence of new unknown virus in conjunction with high fatality rate of the disease has led to major public health and international concern [15]. The WHO guidelines apply a relatively sensitive definition of suspected cases and emphasize the importance of a high index of clinical suspicion for diagnosis owing to the high mortality rate. Some countries, especially those in endemic regions, have developed their own preparedness and response plans which are based on WHO and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)\u2019s recommendations. The Oman\u2019s Ministry of Health implemented a national plan which was based on strengthening five pillars of action, including: (1) public health surveillance and contact management. Field visits were conducted to every confirmed case by the national public health services and exposed individuals were monitored for 14 days after the last exposure; (2) building laboratory capacity, including diagnostic capacity with primers for MERS-CoV testing, and training laboratory personnel on triple-packing and shipment of samples. Furthermore, training to first responders and intensivists on how to collect nasopharyngeal samples; (3) infection prevention and control, including mask-fit testing for all healthcare workers who could be involved in patient care; (4) case management; and (5) risk communication [26]. The government of the Republic of Korea summoned a Rapid Response Team following the outbreak in their country. The team was composed of infectious disease specialists and infection control professionals, and they established national guidelines for the diagnosis and management of MERS-CoV infection. Together with the epidemiology investigation team of the local government, control strategies were discussed, which included: (1) contact tracing; (2) surveillance of polymerase chain reaction testing of healthcare workers and patients according to their level of contact; (3) preemptive isolation of pneumonia cases; (4) environmental disinfection; and (5) cleaning and enforcing the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) among healthcare providers [27]. The possibility of MERS-CoV occurring in Israel is high given Israel\u2019s geographic location in the Middle East and the thousands of Israeli Moslems who make the pilgrimage to Mecca (the Hajj) each year. Therefore, the Israel Ministry of Health (IMOH) has drafted preparedness guidelines that generally follow the CDC guidelines, although the CDC did not include Israel among the countries at risk. These guidelines recommend laboratory evaluation for all healthcare workers with a severe acute respiratory illness of unknown etiology, and in cases of clusters of severe respiratory symptoms of known etiology. In addition, the approval of the public health services is required before any case may be designated a suspected MERS-CoV infection, thereby ensuring early involvement on a national level in every instance of the disease. Information regarding MERS-CoV was disseminated by the distribution of leaflets and placement of informative posters at Ben-Gurion International Airport and three land-border crossings between Israel and Jordan [28].","For example, understanding human behaviors and practices at the interface of tropical forests and villages could help us to interpret how zoonotic transmission happens. Through acting upon these behaviors and habits, we could lower this type of emerging risk. Currently EcoHealth Alliance has research sites in Uganda, Malaysia and Brazil; they are investigating the role played by habitat changes such as deforestation, human interaction with biodiversity through behavior and use. In Manaus in Brazil for example, the maximum risk of new infection is not in the heart of the city where the major markets are located, but in the peri-urban areas where agriculture and ranching are developing. These zones which ecologists call ''ecotones'', or transition zones, are located near strongly species-rich regions, with high concentrations of livestock which can come into contact with wild fauna, and which are furthermore inhabited by ranchers and farmers. These regions which are now located everywhere in the intertropical world for the purpose of feeding urban populations, are generally those where new infections appear, and where future pandemics will also most likely appear. At the heart of this research is the priority of understanding behaviors, habits and practices of populations with the goal of changing these factors. This is a long-term endeavor which requires developing approaches in the field for communicating with local populations, and for developing community participation in our own research, which we also consider an excellent means of education. O. Borraz recalled the fact that we live in a society of risk. It is not that the dangers surrounding us are more numerous or more fearsome than before, but simply that the notion of risk plays a central role in public policies, in public and private organizational management, and in the controversies around new technologies. Genetically modified organisms, mobile phones, nuclear waste, urban sanitation sludge; the activities now considered health or environmental risks are countless. This categorization puts public authorities in a position of having to ensure the safety of populations, even as the State itself sometimes represents a risk factor. It is therefore essential to understand how an activity becomes a risk, and how it is then managed by public authorities as well as by companies, associations and local conglomerates. Risk from its identification to its management, from its highlighting to its instrumentalization becomes a tool linked to the emergence and expansion of a welfare state. It is used by politicians to justify on the one hand its lack of involvement in risk management, on the other the seizing of power over sectors from which they had previously disengaged. This political power seizure plays on politicians' selective dissemination within society of risk identification and the knowledge required for its management.","Current guidelines from the World Health Organization for testing COVID-19 recommend collection of both acute and convalescent serum samples from patients for serological testing, which can support the identification of the immune response to a specific viral pathogen [10]. The SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid has been found also in anal swabs and blood [11], however we did not detect it in serum samples in this case. As yet, only limited data are available on antibody responses during SARS-CoV-2 infection [11,12]. Further studies are needed to better understand the seroprevalence of antibodies to different corona viruses in populations and the role of these antibodies in the risk of disease.","Patients with severe mental illness (SMI) are inevitably affected by the COVID-19 outbreak. In early February, 2020, over 40 inpatients in Wuhan Mental Health Center were diagnosed with the COVID-19 17. As of 18th February, 2020, a total of 323 patients with SMI have been infected 17. In-patients, especially those requiring long-term hospitalization in closed wards, may experience fear of high risk of cluster contagion. Due to traffic restrictions and isolation measures, outpatients with SMI are facing difficulties to receive maintenance treatment, and may thus end up with mental relapse and uncontrollable behaviors (e.g., hyperactivity, agitation, and self- harm) 18. Patients with chronic diseases (e.g., chronic renal failure, diabetes mellitus, and cardio- cerebrovascular diseases), however, also need medical follow-up in hospitals regularly. These patients may also have difficulties to obtain maintenance treatment. As such, these preventive measures may lead to diminished physical wellbeing which exacerbates increased risk of negative feelings and suicidality. Families of deceased patients may suffer from bereavement and grief. The rapid transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 will increase the likelihood of mental distress and psychiatric morbidities in different sub-populations, not simply attributed to persistent quarantine and massive negative news portrayal, but also influenced by the growing number of confirmed and suspected cases, and death in China and the globe on a daily basis.","Rising multidrug resistance also imperils the control of gonococcal infections worldwide. Since 2009, Euro-GASP monitors emerging resistance in Neisseria gonorrhoeae to therapeutic antimicrobials. The program is using a standardized methodology across the EU/EEA which integrates epidemiological and microbiological data to understand the risk factors associated with resistance and thereby inform intervention strategies (39). For AST, the Euro-GASP uses a hybrid approach of EU centralized and decentralized national testing (39). EQA and training activities helped standardize surveillance across Europe: between 2009 and 2014, the number of EU/EEA countries participating in Euro-GASP increased from 17 to 23 countries while the number of countries providing quality-assured (decentralized) testing increased from 3 to 17. In addition, Euro-GASP also piloted molecular typing to unravel associations between clonal type and antimicrobial resistance profiles that could aid understanding of the dissemination of resistance within at risk populations (46). Euro-GASP results have revealed rapidly changing patterns of N. gonorrhoeae resistance to drugs of choice across Europe, leading to the revision of European and national gonorrhea treatment guidelines and development by ECDC of the \u201cResponse plan to control and manage the threat of multidrug-resistant gonorrhoea in Europe\u201d (47).","In December 2019 a number of novel coronavirus-infected pneumonia (NCIP) cases were recorded in a large metropolitan City in China, Wuhan, caused by infection with a novel coronavirus named SARS-CoV-21. The outbreak subsequently spread to other cities in Hubei province and across China. Increasingly, epidemiological studies are performed in real-time during an outbreak to understand key metrics such as the epidemic\u2019s reproduction number, serial interval distribution, incubation period and risk of international spread2,3. Geo-positioned records of case data can be important for risk communication and evaluation during outbreaks, especially when they are available in real-time4,5.","The objective of the current study is to analyze the COVID-19 outbreak situation in India and assess the trends in near future. Also the study aims to take an overview of the preparedness levels of this outbreak from Indian Government. The scope of this study is limited to building forecasting models for Indian region and uses time series based forecasting methods which are easy to build and easy to understand in these kind of critical conditions. The study does not include forecasting for any other nation suffering from COVID-19 outbreak.","Working with journalists and the media to help them understand the science and epidemiology, particularly in a fast moving event, will improve risk communication to the public and reduce inappropriate concerns and panic.","1. Protection of human health should be primary objective in risk management decisions. 2. Risk management should follow a structured approach. 3. Risk management decisions and practices should be transparent, consistent, and fully documented. 4. Risk management should take into account whole food chain. 5. Risk management should insure scientific integrity of risk assessment process by maintaining the functional separation of risk management and risk assessment. 6. Risk managers should take account of risks resulting from regional differences in hazards in the food chain and regional differences in available risk management options.","After finalisation of the guidelines on March 10, 2020, the coordinator of the group (BY) was interviewed by HCSP on March 11, 2020. The guidelines were adopted and published by HCSP on March 14, 2020. The preparation of these guidelines is justified by data 1 suggesting patients with cancer are at high risk of respiratory complications related to SARS-CoV-2 infection. The susceptibility of patients with cancer to influenza was described 2 before the emergence of SARS-CoV-2. For patients with cancer infected with influenza, the risk of hospital admission for respiratory distress is four times higher, and the risk of death ten times higher than patients without cancer. This exacerbation seems to be particularly marked in those with neutropenia or lymphopenia, a feature commonly seen in patients with cancer treated with multiple therapies. 2 A Comment 1 from Wenhua Liang and colleagues, published in The Lancet Oncology, on the situation in China suggests that patients with cancer are at higher risk of infection with SARS-CoV-2 than the general population (1% of patients with COVID-19 in the study had cancer, whereas the incidence of cancer in the Chinese population is 0\u00b729%), which could be related to the closer medical follow-up of these patients. More concerning is the increased risk of severe respiratory complications requiring time in the intensive care unit in patients with cancer, as compared with patients without cancer (39% vs 8%, respectively; p=0\u00b70003). A covariate signifi cantly associated with this risk was a history of chemotherapy or surgery in the month preceding infection (odds ratio 5\u00b734, 95% CI 1\u00b780-16\u00b718; p=0\u00b70026), a factor that includes the majority of patients with cancer. Finally, patients with cancer deteriorated more rapidly than those without cancer (median time to severe events 13 days vs 43 days; p&lt;0\u00b70001; hazard ratio 3\u00b756, 95% CI 1\u00b765-7\u00b769).","As per CAC (2013), risk analysis is a process which follows a structured approach comprising three distinct but closely linked components, namely, risk assessment, risk management, and risk communication, each component being integral to overall risk analysis and playing an essential and complementary role in risk analysis process. The overall objective of risk analysis applied to food safety is to insure human health protection and it should be based on all available scientific evidence, information on perceptions, costs, environmental, cultural factors, etc., which is gathered and analyzed according to scientific principles.","countries that points towards fewer new cases. However, this trend is not easy to follow by looking only at the curves ( Figure 1C ). One way to follow how the DT trends change is to calculate nested DTs over a period of 5-6 days (Supplemental Figure 1 ).","Hospitals and health systems must develop agile ways to transmit timely and critical information in times of crises. A designated communication team that is integrated into the work so they have a strong understanding of the clinical care being provided and the communication needs of the workforce, patients, and public is recommended. Crisis communications should ideally occur via several media, such as a telephone hotline, the hospital Web page, social media platforms, or text-based messages. Important metrics, including the number of cases being triaged, investigated, or managed; bed capacity and availability; and new or emerging data on treatments or care strategies, should be provided. Similarly, timely communication of national updates on travel restrictions, policies for self-monitoring and quarantine, and trends in infection rates must occur. To this end, health care leaders must remember that patients and their families are as much in need of actionable information as hospital personnel. Comprehensive communication strategies for both internal and external stakeholders are key.","We cannot exclude the possibility that shifts in distributions may be due to heightened awareness among the general population which may have increased reporting in female cases later in the epidemic. Further, more work will be necessary to understand the differential risk of severe or symptomatic disease to fully understand the age and sex distributions in this outbreak. For example, why there are relatively few reports of cases &lt;18y old. However, as for other respiratory pathogens symptomatic and severe infection were more concentrated in older populations. We do not intend to make any general statements about differential risk but were more interested in shifts in reported cases across multiple geographies in China.","Risk analysis: a process consisting of three components: risk assessment, risk management, and risk communication.","(1) MERS: On September 24, 2012, through routine surveillance using Internet-based data, China CDC found a piece of information as following: on September 23, 2012 the official website of the WHO reported a case of novel coronavirus (later named \"MERS coronavirus\") infected case identified by UK Department of Health; previously, Saudi Arabia also reported a case; the clinical presentations of the two cases primarily included fever, cough, polypnea and dyspnea and other acute serious respiratory tract conditions, both complicated by acute renal failure. The daily information screening and assessment team preliminarily concluded that the disease was a serious emerging infectious disease which might be international spreading, and therefore suggested China CDC to follow up. On the same day, the Deputy Director General of China CDC organized experts to assess the risk, and then proposed the Chinese Ministry of Health to communicate with the WHO through the information exchange mechanism defined in the International Health Regulations (2005) , in order to be informed of the latest development; and communicate promptly with other health agencies around the globe to obtain information on virus, epidemic and response; prepare necessary risk communication materials to launch risk communication in a timely manner as needed; the National Institute for Viral Disease Control and Prevention of China CDC makes preparations for emergency laboratory testing; China CDC carries out dynamic risk assessment according to further information gained. Subsequently, China CDC continuously tracked the progress of the epidemic according to Internet information. The official websites of the WHO, the Ministry of Health of Saudi Arabia, US CDC, ECDC and other health agencies, ProMED, CIDRAP and other third-party professional websites, and news media, etc. have become important sources of information on the disease and related studies for China CDC, and important evidence base to inform the decision of China Ministry of Health to launch joint prevention and control mechanism with the other departments.","\u2022 Does the plan provide guidance towards compliance with protection of personal information legislation and regulations? \u2022 Will the families and communities (and media) be able to rely on regular, reliable and transparent communication from competent source that represents all response agencies and groups? Where will they go to receive updates and status reports on the response? \u2022 Who will recover deceased persons from their homes and what training and equipment will they receive to protect themselves and the bereaved families in an infectious disease outbreak?","In the changing landscape outlined, there are clearly many challenges for effective risk communication and risk management. In terms of the communication of risk, this article has focused on progress on the international stage. It is recognized that challenges still remain at national level, but the diversity of these is beyond the scope of this brief paper.","All successful strategies for preventing healthcare-associated infections require a multifaceted evidence-based approach that includes providing practitioners with best evidence for clinically effective practice and then supporting them to understand and use this evidence to minimise infection risks and increase patient safety. This presentation will describe how national evidence-based guidelines from the Department of Health and the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence in England form the foundations for ensuring the availability of best evidence to practitioners in the National Health Service (NHS) and, how the development of an associated e-learning/blended learning programme is now supporting all practitioners to effectively use this evidence to protect patients from the risk of preventable infections during care. By incorporating these national guidelines into local policies and protocols and then into routine daily clinical practice, patient safety can be enhanced and the risk of patients acquiring an infection during episodes of healthcare in NHS facilities in England minimised.","The close phylogenetic relationship between Rs-BatCoV HKU32 and BatCoV HKU10 may be explained by the geographical proximity of their hosts. Besides Rs-BatCoV HKU32 and Tr-BatCoV HKU33, diverse alphaCoVs and betaCoVs were also detected in our bat samples. Hi-BatCoV HKU10 and Coronavirus PREDICT CoV-37, belonging to alphaCoVs, were detected in bats in Hong Kong, while SARSr-BatCoVs and Ty-BatCoV HKU4, belonging to lineage B (Sarbecovirus) and C (Merbecovirus) betaCoVs, respectively, were detected in bats in Guangdong and Guizhou provinces. It is of note that Rs-BatCoV HKU32 and BatCoV HKU10 were detected in bats of different families but captured from the same sampling location at a country park in Hong Kong. This suggests that these viruses may have evolved among geographically close but phylogenetically distant bat populations. We have also previously described interspecies transmission of BatCoV HKU10 between Rousettus leschenaultii and Hipposideros pomona bats which belonged to two different bat families [42]. Given that the genetic cluster formed by Rs-BatCoV HKU32, BatCoV HKU10, BtRs-AlphaCoV and BtMs-AlphaCoV were detected from diverse bat families, this suggests that these alphaCoVs may have a tendency for cross-species transmission. This is in contrast to Tr-BatCoV HKU33 and related viruses which were limited to the family Vespertilionidae. Greater bamboo bats, the host of Tr-BatCoV HKU33, and other Vesper bats are geographically widespread and able to occupy distinct and diverse habitats [43]. Interestingly, MERS-CoV-related bat lineage C betaCoVs (Merbecovirus) have also been exclusively detected in the family Vespertilionidae [10,11,13,14,15,44,45]. Further studies are needed to understand the mechanism for host tropism, especially the stringency of host receptor usage by different alphaCoVs, the interspecies transmissibility of coronaviruses among different bats and the contribution of bat ecology to this phenomenon.","Psychological factors are known to play a vital role in the success of public health strategies used to manage epidemics and pandemics; that is, risk communication, vaccination and antiviral therapy, hygiene practices, and social distancing. Health anxiety is important in influencing the success or failure of each of these strategies (Taylor, 2019) . Accordingly, it is critical that public health decision-makers, health authorities, and health care providers across disciplines understand how health anxiety will influence responses to viral outbreaks, including current responses to COVID-19.","Numerous viruses exist in European bat species, some of which currently no effective human or animal vaccines are available. Vaccination of bats, through their protected status in the EU is unlikely to ever be a viable option although developments in vaccine applications for chiroptera may have future applications in preventing the disease in wild bat populations [162]. For lyssaviruses, the OIE and WHO have targeted 2030 for the elimination of dog-mediated human rabies. It is possible that should this be achieved, the spill over of bat lyssaviruses may become more evident and host switching events may occur with pathogens for which there is no vaccine protection. Certainly, the recent detection of highly divergent lyssaviruses (LLEBV) and filoviruses (LLOV) in bats across the EU poses potential the risk to human populations, especially as vaccines or antiviral drugs against these viruses do not exist. Further studies are required to understand: the mechanisms of both maintenance and transmission of viral pathogens within bat populations; the zoonotic potential of viral pathogens detected in bats; and the risk of host switching events that may impact on human and animal health.","Typing methods should have three important properties that favor their wide application: high discriminatory power, simplicity of use and low cost. In light of the whooping cough resurgence in several countries, Norman Fry (PHE, Colindale, UK) reviewed existing recommendations for Bordetella pertussis strain molecular characterization [37] . The observed increase in infection could reflect waning immunity, improved surveillance or pathogen adaptation. Understanding these factors is an important public health objective. Of the typing methods that are used, serotyping offers low discrimination, but provides an easy way of detecting changes in B. pertussis populations. PFGE, MLVA and DNA sequencing offer higher discrimination. More importantly, DNA sequence-based methods can monitor changes in particular genes e for example genes coding for cellular vaccine components, but are more labor-intensive. As for other microorganisms, wholegenome sequencing offers the greatest amount of information. For monitoring of the emergence of vaccine antigendeficient variants, N. Fry and colleagues recommend a combination of DNA sequence analysis (Sanger or HTS) and protein detection techniques, which must ideally conform to guidelines for the validation and application of typing methods used in bacterial epidemiology [46] .","This rapid communication was developed over a 72-hour period prior to posting the results on 22 March 2020; and will be peer reviewed in due course. We seek to work with others to report further estimates of prevalence and mortality for cancer, pregnancy and chemotherapy, cause-specific mortality and cause specific hospital admissions (particularly respiratory) and critical care admissions, as well as the further conditions listed today (22 March 2020) (organ transplants, cystic fibrosis, specific cancers of the blood or bone marrow and immunosuppression (12) . There are many avenues for further modelling to better understand how to target different preventive interventions. An (incomplete) list includes statistical aspects (dynamic models, weekly rates of mortality, competing risks), public health aspects (regional variation, social deprivation and ethnicity), clinical aspects (including hospital and critical care admissions) and health service factors (including data on healthcare workers, and operational features). We have assumed that the impact (RR) of COVID-19 on excess mortality is the same across all risk groups, irrespective of how they are combined, which may not be the case. However, we researchers can use the estimate that we provide to allow modelling of such interactions in different subgroups within populations. We prioritised sharing estimates of 1-year mortality at a time when all clinical academics in the UK and around the globe are being called to the frontline (40) . In these times, our science must cross disciplines, disease specialisms and national and jurisdictional borders even more than before and we invite colleagues to improve, develop and validate our models and update estimates and projections using richer, more real time real-world data."],"title":["Risk communication and management in public health crises","Analysis of psychological state and clinical psychological intervention model of patients with COVID-19","Mental health status among family members of health care workers in Ningbo, China during the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak: a Cross-sectional Study","Long-term psychiatric morbidities among SARS survivors","Chapter 5 Role of risk analysis and risk communication in food safety management","Chapter 5 Role of risk analysis and risk communication in food safety management","Chinese social media reaction to the MERS-CoV and avian influenza A(H7N9) outbreaks","Risk Perceptions and Behaviour: Towards Pandemic Control of Emerging Infectious Diseases: International Research on Risk Perception in the Control of Emerging Infectious Diseases","The deadly coronaviruses: The 2003 SARS pandemic and the 2020 novel coronavirus epidemic in China","Risk communication and management in public health crises","Oral presentations","Chapter 5 Role of risk analysis and risk communication in food safety management","Applications of google search trends for risk communication in infectious disease management: A case study of COVID-19 outbreak in Taiwan","Risk communication and management in public health crises","Chapter 5 Role of risk analysis and risk communication in food safety management","Goals of Care in a Pandemic: Our Experience and Recommendations","Chapter 5 Role of risk analysis and risk communication in food safety management","The psychiatric impact of the novel coronavirus outbreak","Chapter 5 Role of risk analysis and risk communication in food safety management","How Do the First Days Count?

Science-based approaches, which are an integral part of risk analysis to improve modern food safety systems, are intimately linked to processes such as good quality practices. Risk analysis strengthens the ability of traditional food safety systems to meet current challenges. Risk analysis is just one part of an effective food safety system. Other components of food safety system like food safety policies, food legislation, food inspection, laboratory analysis, epidemiological surveillance of food-borne diseases, monitoring systems for chemical and microbiological contamination in foods, and information, education and communication, also need to be improved continuously. \u201cFood safety controls\u201d are now being replaced by \u201crisk-based controls\u201d in all stages of food production...","This case study is the first to be developed in the Middle East region to document what happened during the response to the 2013 MERS outbreak in Qatar. It provides a description of key epidemiologic events and news released from a prime daily newspaper and main Emergency Risk Communication (ERC) actions that were undertaken by public health authorities. Using the Crisis and Emergency Risk Communication (CERC) theoretical framework, the study analyzes how the performed ERC strategies during the first days of the outbreak might have contributed to the outbreak management. Methods: MERS-CoV related events were chronologically tracked, together with the relevant stories that were published in a major newspaper over the course of three distinct phases of the epidemic. The collected media stories were then assessed against the practiced emergency risk communication (ERC) activities during the same time frame. Results: The Crisis &amp; Emergency Risk Communication (CERC) framework was partially ...","Abstract Background and aims No drugs are currently approved for Coronavirus Disease-2019 (COVID-19), although some have been tried. In view of recent studies and discussion on chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), we aimed to review existing literature and relevant websites regarding these drugs and COVID-19, adverse effects related to drugs, and related guidelines. Aims and methods We systematically searched the PubMed database up till March 21, 2020 and retrieved all the articles published on chloroquine and HCQ and COVID-19. Results Two small human studies have been conducted with both these drugs in COVID-19, and have shown significant improvement in some parameters in patients with COVID-19. Conclusion Considering minimal risk upon use, a long experience of use in other diseases, cost-effectiveness and easy availability across India, we propose that both these drugs are worthy of fast track clinical trial for treatment, and may be carefully considered for clinical use as expe...","Epidemic diseases are not a new phenomenon, but easy access to transport in the modern world has accelerated their spread. Perhaps some botanical understanding can help slow them down.","Abstract Objective An emerging outbreak of COVID-19 has been detected in at least 26 countries worldwide. Given this pandemic situation, robust risk communication is urgently needed particularly in affected countries. Therefore, this study explored the potential use of Google Trends (GT) to monitor public restlessness toward COVID-19 epidemic infection in Taiwan. Methods We retrieved GT data for the specific locations of Taiwan nationwide and subregions using defined search terms related to coronavirus, handwashing, and face masks. Results Searches related to COVID-19 and face masks in Taiwan increased rapidly, following the announcements of Taiwan\u2019 first imported case and reached its peak as local cases were reported. However, searches for handwashing were gradually increased in period of face masks shortage. Moreover, high to moderate correlations between Google relative search volume (RSV) and COVID-19 cases were found in Taipei (lag-3), New Taipei (lag-2), Taoyuan (lag-2), Tainan (...","The novel coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19)epidemic has brought serious social psychological impact to the Chinese people, especially those quarantined and thus with limited access to face-to-face communication and traditional social psychological interventions. To better deal with the urgent psychological problems of people involved in the COVID-19 epidemic, we developed a new psychological crisis intervention model by utilizing internet technology. This new model, one of West China Hospital, integrates physicians, psychiatrists, psychologists and social workers into Internet platforms to carry out psychological intervention to patients, their families and medical staff. We hope this model will make a sound basis for developing a more comprehensive psychological crisis intervention response system that is applicable for urgent social and psychological problems.","","To understand the severity of infection for a given disease, it is common epidemiological practice to estimate the case fatality risk, defined as the risk of death among cases. However, there are three technical obstacles that should be addressed to appropriately measure this risk. First, division of the cumulative number of deaths by that of cases tends to underestimate the actual risk because deaths that will occur have not yet observed, and so the delay in time from illness onset to death must be addressed. Second, the observed dataset of reported cases represents only a proportion of all infected individuals and there can be a substantial number of asymptomatic and mildly infected individuals who are never diagnosed. Third, ascertainment bias and risk of death among all those infected would be smaller when estimated using shorter virus detection windows and less sensitive diagnostic laboratory tests. In the ongoing COVID-19 epidemic, health authorities must cope with the uncertaint...","Zoonotic transmissions of emerging pathogens from wildlife to human have shaped the history of mankind. These events have also highlighted our poor understanding of microorganisms circulated in wild animals. Coronaviruses and astroviruses, which can be found from a wide range of mammals, were recently detected in bats. Strikingly, these bat viruses are genetically highly diverse and these interesting findings might help to better understand the evolution and ecology of these viruses. The discoveries of these novel bats viruses not only suggested that bats are important hosts for these virus families, but also reiterated the role of bats as a reservoir of viruses that might pose a zoonotic threat to human health.","Certain bat species serve as natural reservoirs for pathogens in several key viral families including henipa-, lyssa-, corona-, and filoviruses, which may pose serious threats to human health. The Common Vampire Bat (Desmodus rotundus), due to its abundance, sanguivorous feeding habit involving humans and domestic animals, and highly social behavioral ecology, may have an unusually high potential for interspecies disease transmission. Previous studies have investigated rabies dynamics in D. rotundus, yet the diversity of other viruses, bacteria, and other microbes that these bats may carry remains largely unknown. We screened 396 blood, urine, saliva, and fecal samples from D. rotundus captured in Guatemala for 13 viral families and genera. Positive results were found for rhabdovirus, adenovirus, and herpesvirus assays. We also screened these samples for Bartonella spp. and found that 38% of individuals tested positive. To characterize potential for interspecies transmission associated...","BACKGROUND: Infectious diseases emerge frequently in China, partly because of its large and highly mobile population. Therefore, a rapid and cost-effective pathogen screening method with broad coverage is required for prevention and control of infectious diseases. The availability of a large number of microbial genome sequences generated by conventional Sanger sequencing and next generation sequencing has enabled the development of a high-throughput high-density microarray platform for rapid large-scale screening of vertebrate pathogens. METHODS: An easy operating pathogen microarray (EOPM) was designed to detect almost all known pathogens and related species based on their genomic sequences. For effective identification of pathogens from EOPM data, a statistical enrichment algorithm has been proposed, and further implemented in a user-friendly web-based interface. RESULTS: Using multiple probes designed to specifically detect a microbial genus or species, EOPM can correctly identify k...","Viral diseases are one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in the world. Virus-specific vaccines and antiviral drugs are the most powerful tools to combat viral diseases. However, broad-spectrum antiviral agents (BSAAs, i.e. compounds targeting viruses belonging to two or more viral families) could provide additional protection of general population from emerging and re-emerging viral diseases reinforcing the arsenal of available antiviral options. Here, we reviewed discovery and development of BSAAs and summarized the information on 119 safe-in-man agents in freely accessible database (https://drugvirus.info/). Future and ongoing pre-clinical and clinical studies will increase the number of BSAAs, expand spectrum of their indications, and identify drug combinations for treatment of emerging and re-emerging viral infections as well as co-infections.","Background: The overall objective of this rapid review was to identify infection protection and control recommendations from published clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) for adults aged 60 years and older in long-term care settings Methods: Comprehensive searches in MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, and relevant CPG publishers/repositories were carried out in early March 2020. Title/abstract and full-text screening, data abstraction, and quality appraisal (AGREE-II) were carried out by single reviewers. Results: A total of 17 relevant CPGs were identified, published in the USA (n=8), Canada (n=6), Australia (n=2), and the United Kingdom (n=1). All of the CPGs dealt with infection control in long-term care facilities (LTCF) and addressed various types of viral respiratory infections (e.g., influenza, COVID-19, severe acute respiratory syndrome). Ten or more CPGs recommended the following infection control measures in LTCF: hand hygiene (n=13), wearing personal protective equipment...","BACKGROUND: Strategies are urgently needed to mitigate the risk of zoonotic disease emergence in southern China, where pathogens with zoonotic potential are known to circulate in wild animal populations. However, the risk factors leading to emergence are poorly understood, which presents a challenge in developing appropriate mitigation strategies for local communities. METHODS: Residents in rural communities of Yunnan, Guangxi and Guangdong provinces were recruited and enrolled in this study. Data were collected through ethnographic interviews and field observations, and thematically coded and analysed to identify both risk and protective factors for zoonotic disease emergence at the individual, community and policy levels. RESULTS: Eighty-eight ethnographic interviews and 55 field observations were conducted at nine selected sites. Frequent human\u2013animal interactions and low levels of environmental biosecurity in local communities were identified as risks for zoonotic disease emergence...","RAPID COMMUNICATION 22 March 2020 Estimating excess 1- year mortality from COVID-19 according to underlying conditions and age in England: a rapid analysis using NHS health records in 3.8 million adults Background: The medical, health service, societal and economic impact of the COVID-19 emergency has unknown effects on overall population mortality. Previous models of population mortality are based on death over days among infected people, nearly all of whom (to date at least) have underlying conditions. Models have not incorporated information on high risk conditions or their longer term background (pre-COVID-19) mortality. We estimated the excess number of deaths over 1 year under different COVID-19 incidence rates and differing mortality impacts. Methods: Using population based linked primary and secondary care electronic health records in England (HDR UK - CALIBER), we report the prevalence of underlying conditions defined by UK Public Health England COVID-19 guidelines (16 March 2...","Background: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a worldwide pandemic since mid-December 2019, which greatly challenge public medical systems. With limited medical resources, it is a natural strategy, while adopted, to access the severity of patients then determine the treatment priority. However, our work observes the fact that the condition of many mild outpatients quickly worsens in a short time, i.e. deteriorate into severe/critical cases. Hence, it has been crucial to early identify those cases and give timely treatment for optimizing treatment strategy and reducing mortality. This study aims to establish an AI model to predict mild patients with potential malignant progression. Methods: A total of 133 consecutively mild COVID-19 patients at admission who was hospitalized in Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital from January 3 to February 13, 2020, were selected in this retrospective IRB-approved study. All mild patients at admission were categorized into groups with or without m...","ABSTRACT Within weeks, COVID-19 has transformed our practice of palliative care and clinical medicine as we know it. Telemedicine has emerged as a critical technology to bring medical care to patients while attempting to reduce the transmission of COVID-19 among patients, families, and clinicians. It is also increasingly necessary to preserve scarce resources like personal protective equipment. In this article, we share just-in-time tips to support palliative care clinicians and program leaders in providing the best care possible by telemedicine. These quick, practical tips cover telemedicine set-up, patient considerations, and clinician considerations. Next steps include ensuring equitable access to affordable telemedicine technology for vulnerable populations through creative solutions and financing, and dedicated attention to telemedicine evaluation and quality improvement.","Background: COVID-19 outbreak is spreading globally. Although the risk of infection in the US is currently low, it is important to understand the public perception of risk and trust in sources of information to better inform public health messaging. In this study, we surveyed the adult US population to understand their risk perceptions about the COVID-19 outbreak. Methods and Findings: We used an online platform to survey 718 adults in the US in early February 2020 using a questionnaire that we developed. Our sample was fairly similar to the general adult US population in terms of age, gender, race, ethnicity and education. We found that 69% of the respondents wanted the scientific/public health leadership (either the CDC Director or NIH Director) to lead the US response to COVID-19 outbreak as compared to 14% who wanted the political leadership (either the president or the Congress) to lead the response. Risk perception was low (median score of 5 out of 10) with the respondents trusti...","","Pneumonia patients of 2019-ncov in latent period are not easy to be effectively quarantined, but there is evidence that they have strong infectious ability. Here, the infectious ability of patients during the latent period is slightly less than that of the infected patients was assumed. We established a new SEIR propagation dynamics model, that considered the weak transmission ability of the incubation period, the variation of the incubation period length, and the government intervention measures to track and isolate comprehensively. Based on the raw epidemic data of China from January 23, 2020 to February 10, 2020, the dynamic parameters of the new present SEIR model are fitted. Through the Euler integration algorithm to solve the model, the effect of infectious ability of incubation patients on the theoretical estimation of the present SEIR model was analyzed, and the occurrence time of peak number in China was predicted.","ABSTRACT BACKGROUND The epidemiological and clinical characteristics of heart transplant (HTx) recipients during the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic remains unclear. We studied the characteristics of HTx recipients during Dec 20, 2019 and Feb 25, 2020 in an effort to understand their risk and outcomes. METHODS All accessible HTx recipients were included in this single-center, retrospective study. We collected information on the recipients using a web-based questionnaire as well as the hospital database. RESULTS We followed 87 HTx recipients (72.4% were men and average age was 51 years). 79 recipients resided in Hubei, and 57 recipients had a Wuhan related history of travel or contact. The majority took precautionary measures while in contact with suspicious crowds. 96.6% of the families and communities undertook prevention and quarantine procedures. 4 upper airway infection were reported, and 3 of them tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 (the 4th recovered and was not tested). All cases were mild and s...","Bats are being increasingly recognized as an important reservoir of zoonotic viruses of different families, including SARS coronavirus, Nipah virus, Hendra virus and Ebola virus. Several recent studies hypothesized that bats, an ancient group of flying mammals, are the major reservoir of several important RNA virus families from which other mammalian viruses of livestock and humans were derived. Although this hypothesis needs further investigation, the premise that bats carry a large number of viruses is commonly accepted. The question of whether bats have unique biological features making them ideal reservoir hosts has been the subject of several recent reviews. In this review, we will focus on the public health implications of bat derived zoonotic viral disease outbreaks, examine the drivers and risk factors of past disease outbreaks and outline research directions for better control of future disease events.","Abstract The emergence of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic presents an unprecedented health communications challenge. Healthcare providers should reinforce behaviors that limit the spread of the pandemic, including social distancing and remaining in the home whenever possible. Formal communications toolkits may not be prepared in a timely fashion. Community pharmacists can reinforce mitigation behaviors by applying the health belief model (HBM). This commentary provides an overview of the HBM and offers suggestions on how community pharmacists can use it as a guide to patient communication in these uncertain contexts.","The rapid expansion of coronavirus (COVID-19) has been observed in many parts of the world. Many newly reported cases of this new coronavirus during early outbreak phases have been associated with travel history from an epidemic region (identified as imported cases). For those cases without travel history, the risk of wider spreads through community contact is even higher. However, most population models assume a homogeneous infected population without considering that the imported and secondary cases contracted by the imported cases can pose a different risk to community spread. We have developed an \u201ceasy-to-use\u201d mathematical framework extending from a meta-population model embedding city-to-city connections to stratify the dynamics of transmission waves caused by imported, secondary, and others from an outbreak source region when control measures are considered. Using the dynamics of the secondary cases, we are able to determine the probability of community spread. Using the top 10 v...","Since the outbreak of the novel coronavirus disease COVID-19, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, this disease has spread rapidly around the globe. Considering the potential threat of a pandemic, scientists and physicians have been racing to understand this new virus and the pathophysiology of this disease to uncover possible treatment regimens and discover effective therapeutic agents and vaccines. To support the current research and development, CAS has produced a special report to provide an overview of published scientific information with an emphasis on patents in the CAS content collection. It highlights antiviral strategies involving small molecules and biologics targeting complex molecular interactions involved in coronavirus infection and replication. The drug-repurposing effort documented herein focuses primarily on agents known to be effective against other RNA viruses including SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. The patent analysis of coronavirus-related biologics includes therapeutic anti...","Abstract SARS-associated coronavirus was identified as the etiological agent of severe acute respiratory syndrome and a large virus pool was identified in wild animals. Virus generates drug resistance through fast mutagenesis and escapes antiviral treatment. siRNAs targeting different genes would be an alternative for overcoming drug resistance. Here, we report effective siRNAs targeting structural genes (i.e., spike, envelope, membrane, and nucleocapsid) and their antiviral kinetics. We also showed the synergistic effects of two siRNAs targeting different functional genes at a very low dose. Our findings may pave a way to develop cost effective siRNA agents for antiviral therapy in the future.","The 2019-nCoV is reported to share the same entry (ACE2) as SARS-CoV according to the updated findings. Analyzing the distribution and expression level of the route of coronavirus may help reveal underlying mechanisms of viral susceptibility and post-infection modulation. In this study, we found that the expression of ACE2 in healthy populations and patients with underlying diseases was not significantly different, suggesting relatively similar susceptibility, which was consistent with current clinical observations. Moreover, based on the expression of ACE2 in smoking individuals, we inferred that long-term smoking might be a risk factor for 2019-nCoV. Analyzing the ACE2 in SARS-CoV infected cells suggested that ACE2 was more than just a receptor but also participated in post-infection regulation, including immune response, cytokine secretion, and viral genome replication. We also constructed Protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks and identified hub genes in viral activity and cyto...","Abstract The aim is to diagnose COVID-19 earlier and to improve its treatment by applying medical technology, the \u201cCOVID-19 Intelligent Diagnosis and Treatment Assistant Program (nCapp)\u201d based on the Internet of Things. Terminal eight functions can be implemented in real-time online communication with the \u201ccloud\u201d through the page selection key. According to existing data, questionnaires, and check results, the diagnosis is automatically generated as confirmed, suspected, or suspicious of 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection. It classifies patients into mild, moderate, severe or critical pneumonia. nCapp can also establish an online COVID-19 real-time update database, and it updates the model of diagnosis in real time based on the latest real-world case data to improve diagnostic accuracy. Additionally, nCapp can guide treatment. Front-line physicians, experts, and managers are linked to perform consultation and prevention. nCapp also contributes to the long-term follow-up of pa...","As the outbreak of a deadly new coronavirus in China and its rapid spread is rattling countries, only the collective international experience and advances derived from past outbreaks can accelerate its control.","","Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a recently emerged life-threatening disease caused by SARS-CoV-2. Real- time fluorescent PCR (RT-PCR) is the clinical standard for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid detection. To detect SARS-CoV-2 early and control the disease spreading on time, a faster and more convenient method for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid detecting, RT-LAMP method (reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification) was developed. RNA reverse transcription and nucleic acid amplification were performed in one step at 63 \u2103 isothermal conditions, and the results can be obtained within 30 minutes. ORF1ab gene, E gene and N gene were detected at the same time. ORF1ab gene was very specific and N gene was very sensitivity, so they can guarantee both sensitivity and specificity for SARS-CoV-2. The sensitivity of RT-LAMP assay is similar to RT-PCR, and specificity was 99% as detecting 208 clinical specimens. The RT-LAMP assay reported here has the advantages of rapid amplification, si...","ABSTRACT THE CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL and Prevention has published updated guidelines for isolation precautions that outline how health care workers can prevent the transmission of infectious agents to their patients and to themselves. THE GUIDELINES RE-EMPHASIZE standard precautions, which guide clinicians in the use of appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE), depending on the expected type of exposure. Respiratory hygiene/cough etiquette is incorporated into infection control practices as a new component of standard precautions. THE ARTICLE PROVIDES information on the new guidelines as well as information on newly emerging patho gens and methods to prevent disease transmission in health care settings.","This study aims to analyze the different clinical characteristics between children and their families infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. Clinical data from nine children and their 14 families were collected, including general status, clinical, laboratory test, and imaging characteristics. All the children were detected positive result after their families onset. Three children had fever (22.2%) or cough (11.2%) symptoms and six (66.7%) children had no symptom. Among the 14 adult patients, the major symptoms included fever (57.1%), cough (35.7%), chest tightness/pain (21.4%), fatigue (21.4%) and sore throat (7.1%). Nearly 70% of the patients had normal (71.4%) or decreased (28.6%) white blood cell counts, and 50% (7/14) had lymphocytopenia. There were 10 adults (71.4%) showed abnormal imaging. The main manifestations were pulmonary consolidation (70%), nodular shadow (50%), and ground glass opacity (50%). Five discharged children were admitted again because t...","Abstract The recent discovery of Middle East Respiratory Coronavirus and another novel dromedary camel coronavirus UAE-HKU23 in dromedaries has boosted interest in search of novel viruses in dromedaries. In this study, fecal samples of 203 dromedaries in Dubai were pooled and deep sequenced. Among the 7330 assembled viral contigs, 1970 were assigned to mammalian viruses. The largest groups of these contigs matched to Picobirnaviridae, Circoviridae, Picornaviridae, Parvoviridae, Astroviridae and Hepeviridae. Many of these viral families were previously unknown to dromedaries. In addition to the high abundance of contigs from Circoviridae (n=598 with 14 complete genomes) and Picobirnaviridae (n=1236), a high diversity of contigs from these two families was found, with the 14 Circoviridae complete genomes forming at least five clusters and contigs from both genogroup I and genogroup II potentially novel picobirnaviruses. Further studies comparing the incidence of these viral families in h...","Abstract The world is faced with a remarkable coronavirus outbreak with epicentre in Wuhan, China. Altogether 40554 cases have been confirmed globally with novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) until February 10, 2020. Rigorous surveillance in other countries is required to prevent further global expansion of the outbreak, but resolving the exact mechanism of the initial transmission events is crucial. Most initial cases had visited Huanan South Seafood Market in Wuhan selling also various exotic live animals. Based on the limited initial human-to-human transmission and timely clustering of cases in Huanan market among elderly men, coupled with knowledge that coronaviruses are derived from animals and relationship of SARS-CoV-2 to bat coronavirus, zoonotic transmission in the first instance is probable. To target the actions, similar epidemiological actions to human cases are needed with animal or food exposures. According to current information, an exceptionally wide contamination of seafood...","Abstract Background Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is pandemic and has caused illness to many people worldwide. This review aimed to summarize and analyze the herbal formulae provided by the guidelines for their pattern identifications (PIs) and compositions of herbs to treat patients with COVID-19. Methods We searched 7 data sources for eligible traditional medicine guidelines up to March 6, 2020 and found a total of 28 traditional medicine guidelines that provide treatment measures for COVID-19. Results Of the 28 guidelines, there were 26 government-issued Chinese guidelines and 2 Korean guidelines. After standardizing the terminology of the PIs and herbal formulae, there were 8 PIs and 23 herbal formulae for the mild stage, 11 PIs and 31 herbal formulae for the moderate stage, 8 PIs and 21 herbal formulae for the severe stage, and 6 PIs and 23 herbal formulae for the recovery stage in the Chinese guidelines. In the Korean guidelines, there were 4 PIs and 15 herbal formulae for ...","Background Traditional infection control policies have focused on engineering controls, specific protocols, and personal protective equipment (PPE). In light of the variable success in protecting health care workers (HCWs) from Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2003, organizational and individual factors related to self-protective behavior in health care settings may also play an important role. Methods A critical review of the literature was conducted, directed at understanding what organizational and individual factors are important in protecting HCWs from infectious diseases at work. Results Organizational factors, such as a positive safety climate, have been associated with increased HCW adherence to universal precautions. There is some evidence that appropriate training of HCWs could be effective in changing HCW behavior if appropriate follow-up is applied. Very little research into these factors has been conducted with regard to preventing exposures to respiratory tract...","Abstract Objective This document summarizes the limited experience of SARS in pregnancy and suggests guidelines for management. Outcomes Cases reported from Asia suggest that maternal and fetal outcomes are worsened by SARS during pregnancy. Evidence Medline was searched for relevant articles published in English from 2000 to 2007. Case reports were reviewed and expert opinion sought. Values Recommendations were made according to the guidelines developed by the Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care.","BACKGROUND: Array comparative genomic hybridization is a fast and cost-effective method for detecting, genotyping, and comparing the genomic sequence of unknown bacterial isolates. This method, as with all microarray applications, requires adequate coverage of probes targeting the regions of interest. An unbiased tiling of probes across the entire length of the genome is the most flexible design approach. However, such a whole-genome tiling requires that the genome sequence is known in advance. For the accurate analysis of uncharacterized bacteria, an array must query a fully representative set of sequences from the species' pan-genome. Prior microarrays have included only a single strain per array or the conserved sequences of gene families. These arrays omit potentially important genes and sequence variants from the pan-genome. RESULTS: This paper presents a new probe selection algorithm (PanArray) that can tile multiple whole genomes using a minimal number of probes. Unlike arrays b...","Abstract The Internet of Things (IoT) includes three core procedures: full spectrum perception, reliable transmission, and intelligent processing. It can be applied for the prevention and control of SARI (severe acute respiratory infection). By combining sensors, information technology, artificial intelligence, and available dynamic networking devices, IoT could realize long-distance communication between hospitals, patients, and medical devices, which could ultimately improve current medical conditions.","SARS-CoV (the SARS-Associated Coronavirus) was reported as a novel virus member in the coronavirus family, which was the cause of severe acute respiratory syndrome. Coronavirus replication occurs through a unique mechanism employing Leader sequence in the transcripts when initiating transcription from the genome. Therefore, we cloned the Leader sequence from SARS-CoV(BJ01), which is identical to that identified from SARS-CoV(HKU-39849), and constructed specific siRNA targeting the Leader sequence. Using EGFP and RFP reporter genes fused with the cloned SARS-CoV Leader sequence, we demonstrated that the siRNA targeting the Leader sequence decreased the mRNA abundance and protein expression levels of the reporter genes in 293T cells. By stably expressing the siRNA in Vero E6 cells, we provided data that the siRNA could effectively and specifically decrease the mRNA abundance of SARS-CoV genes as analyzed by RT-PCR and Northern blot. Our data indicated that the siRNA targeting the Leader ...","Introduction. Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) outbreaks have had a considerable negative impact on health systems in Saudi Arabia. We aimed to study the psychological impact of a Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) outbreak on emergency room resident physicians (ERRPs). Methods. We assessed the MERS-related psychological impact and concerns of ERRPs using a self-report questionnaire. Results. The majority (91%) of the ERRPs agreed that their work put them at risk of infection, but most (65%) did not agree that they should not be looking after patients infected with MERS. Despite that, 54% of ERRPs reported being afraid of contracting the infection from infected patients and only 4.2% of them were willing to change their current job. The majority of the ERRPs (85%) felt that their job would expose their families to risk of infection. Conclusions. Our study demonstrated the considerable psychological impact of MERS outbreaks on ERRPs. The ERRPs' concerns and t...","Background: COVID-19 is still becoming an increasing global threat to public health. More detailed and specific characteristics of COVID-19 are needed to better understand this disease. Additionally, durations of COVID-19, e.g., the average time from exposure to recovery, which is of great value in understanding this disease, has not been reported so far. Aims: To give the information on clinical characteristics and different durations of COVID-19 and to identify the potential risk factors for longer hospitalization duration. Methods: In this retrospective study, we enrolled 77 patients (mean age: 52 years; 44.2% males) with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 admitted to Beijing YouAn Hospital during 21st Jan and 8th February 2020. Epidemiological, clinical and radiological data on admission were collected; complications and outcomes were followed up until 29th February 2020. The study endpoint was the discharge within two weeks. Cox proportional-hazards regression was performed to identify...","Abstract The Covid-19 pandemic is changing the organization of healthcare and has a direct impact on digestive surgery. Healthcare priorities and circuits are being modified. Emergency surgery is still a priority. Functional surgery is to be deferred. Laparoscopic surgery must follow strict rules so as not to expose healthcare professionals (HCPs) to added risk. The question looms large in cancer surgery \u2013 go ahead or defer? There is probably an added risk due to the pandemic that must be balanced against the risk incurred by deferring surgery. For each type of cancer \u2013 colon, pancreas, oesogastric, hepatocellular carcinoma \u2013 morbidity and mortality rates are stated and compared with the oncological risk incurred by deferring surgery and/or the tumour doubling time. Strategies can be proposed based on this comparison. For colonic cancers T1-2, N0, it is advisable to defer surgery. For advanced colonic lesions, it seems judicious to undertake neoadjuvant chemotherapy and then wait. For ...","Summary The Middle East Respiratory Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) was first isolated from a patient who died with severe pneumonia in June 2012. As of 19 June 2015, a total of 1,338 MERS-CoV infections have been notified to the World Health Organization (WHO). Clinical illness associated with MERS-CoV ranges from mild upper respiratory symptoms to rapidly progressive pneumonia and multi-organ failure. A significant proportion of patients present with non-respiratory symptoms such as headache, myalgia, vomiting and diarrhoea. A few potential therapeutic agents have been identified but none have been conclusively shown to be clinically effective. Human to human transmission is well documented, but the epidemic potential of MERS-CoV remains limited at present. Healthcare-associated clusters of MERS-CoV have been responsible for the majority of reported cases. The largest outbreaks have been driven by delayed diagnosis, overcrowding and poor infection control practices. However, chains of MERS-Co...","Background: Management of high mortality risk due to significant progression requires prior assessment of time-to-progression. However, few related methods are available for COVID-19 pneumonia. Methods: We retrospectively enrolled 338 adult patients admitted to one hospital between Jan 11, 2020 to Feb 29, 2020. The final follow-up date was March 8, 2020. We compared characteristics between patients with severe and non-severe outcome, and used multivariate survival analyses to assess the risk of progression to severe conditions. Results: A total of 76 (31.9%) patients progressed to severe conditions and 3 (0.9%) died. The mean time from hospital admission to severity onset is 3.7 days. Age, body mass index (BMI), fever symptom on admission, co-existing hypertension or diabetes are associated with severe progression. Compared to non-severe group, the severe group already demonstrated, at an early stage, abnormalities in biomarkers indicating organ function, inflammatory responses, blood ...","In early December 2019 a cluster of cases of pneumonia of unknown cause was identified in Wuhan, a city of 11 million persons in the People&amp;rsquo;s Republic of China. Further investigation revealed these cases to result from infection with a newly identified coronavirus, termed the 2019-nCoV. The infection moved rapidly through China, spread to Thailand and Japan, extended into adjacent countries through infected persons travelling by air, eventually reaching multiple countries and continents. Similar to such other coronaviruses as those causing the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), the new coronavirus was reported to spread via natural aerosols from human-to-human. In the early stages of this epidemic the case fatality rate is estimated to be approximately 2%, with the majority of deaths occurring in special populations. Unfortunately, there is limited experience with coronavirus infections during pregnancy, and it now appears certai...","Abstract The impact of communicable diseases (infectious diseases) on human health is obvious. The sudden outbreak of COVID-19 (Corona Virus Disease 2019), making people realize the threat of communicable diseases to mankind. As a city composed of migrants, Zhuhai Special Economic Zone experienced great challenges brought about by COVID-19 epidemic. Experience has been acquired from all aspects. A highly reactive, multifunctional and efficient emergency management system would be established, and the significance of information communication should be fully understood in the future.","Abstract: We propose that the palliative care team response will occur in two waves: first communication and second symptom management. Our experience with discussing goals of care with the family of a COVID positive patient highlighted some expected and unexpected challenges. We describe these challenges along with recommendations for approaching these conversations. We also propose a framework for proactively mobilizing the palliative care workforce to aggressively address goals of care in all patients, with the aim of reducing the need for rationing of resources."],"title":["Applying Palliative Care Principles to Communicate with Children about COVID-19","Chapter 5 Role of risk analysis and risk communication in food safety management","How Do the First Days Count?
