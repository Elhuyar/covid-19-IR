On January 7, 2020, Chinese health officials confirmed that a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) was associated with this initial cluster (1). As of February 4, 2020, a total of 20,471 confirmed cases, including 2,788 (13.6%) with severe illness,* and 425 deaths (2.1%) had been reported by the National Health Commission of China (2). Cases have also been reported in 26 locations outside of mainland China, including documentation of some person-to-person transmission and one death (2).

These, and other recent public health events, provide an opportunity for us to review and reflect on the evolution of Canada\u2019s public health emergency response over the past 15 years\u2014from SARS, to the 2009 H1N1 pandemic influenza, to Ebola virus and Zika virus disease. Key lessons have been learned and milestones achieved that have shaped and sharpened our response approach and structures. While SARS was a wake-up-call to strengthen infection prevention and control capacity in health care settings and led to the formation of the Public Health Agency of Canada, it also strengthened our Federal/Provincial/Territorial (FPT) senior-level governance and led to agreements for pan-Canadian mutual aid and infectious disease information sharing. As well, our collective public health laboratory capacity has been strengthened through ongoing ...","The novel coronavirus, COVID-19, has sparked an outflow of scientific research seeking to understand the virus, its spread, and best practices in prevention and treatment. If this international research effort is going to be as swift and effective as possible, it will need to rely on a principle of open science. When researchers share data, code, and software and generally make their work as transparent as possible, it allows other researchers to verify and expand upon their work. Furthermore, it allows public officials to make informed decisions. In this study, we analyzed 535 preprint articles related to COVID-19 for eight transparency criteria and recorded study location and funding information. We found that individual researchers have lined up to help during this crisis, quickly tackling important public health questions, often without funding or support from outside organizations. However, most authors could improve their data sharing and scientific reporting practices. The contr...","For two months between May and July 2015, a nationwide outbreak of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) occurred in Korea. On June 3, 2015, the Korean Society for Laboratory Medicine (KSLM) launched a MERS-CoV Laboratory Response Task Force (LR-TF) to facilitate clinical laboratories to set up the diagnosis of MERS-CoV infection. Based on the WHO interim recommendations, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention of United States guidelines for MERS-CoV laboratory testing, and other available resources, the KSLM MERS-CoV LR-TF provided the first version of the laboratory practice guidelines for the molecular diagnosis of MERS-CoV to the clinical laboratories on June 12, 2015. The guidelines described here are an updated version that includes case definition, indications for testing, specimen type and protocols for specimen collection, specimen packing and transport, specimen handling and nucleic acid extraction, molecular detection of MERS-CoV, interpretation of ...","As of March 5, 2020, there has been sustained local transmission of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Hong Kong, Singapore, and Japan.1 Containment strategies seem to have prevented smaller transmission chains from amplifying into widespread community transmission. The health systems in these locations have generally been able to adapt,2 , 3 but their resilience could be affected if the COVID-19 epidemic continues for many more months and increasing numbers of people require services. We outline some of the core dimensions of these resilient health systems4 and their responses to the COVID-19 epidemic. First, after variable periods of adaptation, the three locations took actions to manage the outbreak of a new pathogen. Surveillance systems were readjusted to identify potential cases while public health staff identified their contacts. National laboratory networks developed diagnostic tests once the COVID-19 genetic sequences were published5 and laboratory testing capacity was inc...","Abstract Medicine shortages have been spreading in European countries. In many cases, the unavailability of medicinal products has a substantial impact on the capability of National Healthcare Systems in ensuring the continuity of care. Shortages originate from multifactorial causes. In particular, they can be due to supply-related factors (e.g., manufacturing issues, regulatory issues, logistics, distribution) and demand-related ones (e.g., fluctuating drug demand, parallel market, tendering, price and reimbursement policies). However, some extraordinary geopolitical events (e.g., Brexit) may also affect medicines\u2019 availability. The capability of European Regulatory Authorities and other stakeholders, which are involved in the pharmaceutical distribution chain and the healthcare assistance services, to define suitable problem-solving strategies has been limited for years by the fragmentation of the European regulatory framework, starting from the lack of a univocal definition of a med...","Background Despite available recommendations on infection control for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), information is limited on actual practices in Asian hospitals during the epidemic. We describe practices observed by mobile SARS containment teams (mobile teams) during outbreak investigations. Methods We retrospectively summarized infection control practices observed in hospitals visited by mobile teams in the Lao People's Democratic Republic (PDR), Taiwan, and Thailand, during March and April 2003. Results Mobile teams investigated 22 reports of SARS in 20 hospitals (1, 5, and 14 hospitals in Lao PDR, Taiwan, and Thailand, respectively). Facilities ranged from urban hospitals with negative-pressure isolation rooms and high-efficiency particulate air filtration to rural hospitals with patient rooms open to outside air circulation and intermittent running water. At the time of mobile team visits, 5 (25%) hospitals implemented infection control practices consistent with World ...","We here predicted some trajectories of COVID-19 in the coming days (until April 30, 2020) using the most advanced Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average Model (ARIMA). Our analysis predicted very frightening outcomes, which defines to worsen the conditions in Iran, entire Europe, especially Italy, Spain, and France. While South Korea, after the initial blast, has come to stability, the same goes for the COVID-19 origin country China with more positive recovery cases and confirm to remain stable. The United States of America (USA) will come as a surprise and going to become the epicenter for new cases during the mid-April 2020. Based on our predictions, public health officials should tailor aggressive interventions to grasp the power exponential growth, and rapid infection control measures at hospital levels are urgently needed to curtail the COVID-19 pandemic.","Human infections with a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) were first identified via syndromic surveillance in December of 2019 in Wuhan China. Since identification, infections (coronavirus disease-2019; COVID-19) caused by this novel pathogen have spread globally, with more than 180,000 confirmed cases as of March 16, 2020. Effective public health interventions, including social distancing, contact tracing, and isolation/quarantine rely on the rapid and accurate identification of confirmed cases. However, testing capacity (having sufficient tests and laboratory throughput) to support these non-pharmaceutical interventions remains a challenge for containment and mitigation of COVID-19 infections. We undertook a sentinel event strategy (where single health events signal emerging trends) to estimate the incidence of COVID-19 in the US. Data from a recent national conference, the Conservative Political Action Conference, (CPAC) near Washington, DC and from the outbreak in Wuhan, China were us...","Abstract The world is currently suffering through a pandemic outbreak of severe respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) known as Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). The United States (US) Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) currently advises medical facilities to \u201creschedule non-urgent outpatient visits as necessary\u201d (1). The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, the United Kingdom National Health Service and several other international agencies covering Asia, North America and most regions of the world have recommended similar \u201csocial distancing\u201d measures(2, 3). The Society of Cardiovascular Computed Tomography (SCCT) offers guidance for cardiac CT (CCT) practitioners to help implement these international recommendations in order to decrease the risk of COVID-19 transmission in their facilities while deciding on the timing of outpatient and inpatient CCT exams. This document also emphasizes SCCT\u2019s commitment to the health and well-being of CCT techn...","Background The epidemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 was first reported in Wuhan, China, and now is spreading worldwide. The Chinese government responded to this epidemic with multiple public health policies including locking down the city of Wuhan, establishing multiple temporary hospitals, and prohibiting public gathering events. Here, we constructed a new real-time status dynamic model of SEIO (MH) to reveal the influence of national public health policies and to model the epidemic in Wuhan. Methods A real-time status dynamic model was proposed to model the population of Wuhan in status Susceptible (S), Exposed (E), Infected with symptoms (I), with Medical care (M), and Out of the system (O) daily. Model parameters were fitted according to the daily report of new infections from Jan. 27th, 2020 to Feb. 2nd, 2020. Using the fitted parameters, the epidemic under different conditions was simulated and compared with the current situation. Finding According to our study, the first patient is mos...","Background: The coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) pandemic threatens to overwhelm the healthcare resources of the country, but also poses a personal hazard to healthcare workers, including physicians. To address the potential impact of excluding physicians with a high risk of adverse outcomes based on age, we evaluated the current patterns of age of licensed physicians across the United States. Methods: We compiled information from the 2018 database of actively licensed physicians in the Federation of State Medical Boards (FSMB) across the US. Both at a national- and the state-level, we assessed the number and proportion of physicians who would be at an elevated risk due to age over 60 years. Results: Of the 985,026 licensed physicians in the US, 235857 or 23.9% were aged 25-40 years, 447052 or 45.4% are 40-60 years, 191794 or 19.5% were 60-70 years, and 106121 or 10.8% were 70 years or older. Age was not reported in 4202 or 0.4% of physicians. Overall, 297915 or 30.2% of physicians we...","As of March 22, 2020, the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in the U.S. has reached nearly 30,000. While rapid and accessible diagnosis is paramount to monitoring and reducing the spread of disease, COVID-19 testing capabilities across the U.S. remain constrained. For many individuals, urgent care centers (UCCs) may offer the most accessible avenue to be tested. Through a phone survey, we describe the COVID-19 testing capabilities at UCCs and provide a snapshot highlighting the limited COVID-19 testing capabilities at UCCs in states with the greatest disease burden.","Abstract The goal of syndromic surveillance is the earlier detection of epidemics, allowing a timelier public health response than is possible using traditional surveillance methods. Syndromic surveillance application for public health purposes has changed over time and reflects a dynamic evolution from the collection, interpretation of data with dissemination of data to those who need to act, to a more holistic approach that incorporates response as a core component of the surveillance system. Recent infectious disease threats, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), avian influenza (H5N1) and pandemic influenza (H1N1), have all highlighted the need for countries to be rapidly aware of the spread of infectious diseases within a region and across the globe. The International Health Regulations (IHR) obligation to report public health emergencies of international concern has raised the importance of early outbreak detection and response. The emphasis in syndromic surveillance ...","","Abstract The emergence of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic presents an unprecedented health communications challenge. Healthcare providers should reinforce behaviors that limit the spread of the pandemic, including social distancing and remaining in the home whenever possible. Formal communications toolkits may not be prepared in a timely fashion. Community pharmacists can reinforce mitigation behaviors by applying the health belief model (HBM). This commentary provides an overview of the HBM and offers suggestions on how community pharmacists can use it as a guide to patient communication in these uncertain contexts.","BACKGROUND: The ongoing outbreak of the recently emerged novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) poses a challenge for public health laboratories as virus isolates are unavailable while there is growing evidence that the outbreak is more widespread than initially thought, and international spread through travellers does already occur. AIM: We aimed to develop and deploy robust diagnostic methodology for use in public health laboratory settings without having virus material available. METHODS: Here we present a validated diagnostic workflow for 2019-nCoV, its design relying on close genetic relatedness of 2019-nCoV with SARS coronavirus, making use of synthetic nucleic acid technology. RESULTS: The workflow reliably detects 2019-nCoV, and further discriminates 2019-nCoV from SARS-CoV. Through coordination between academic and public laboratories, we confirmed assay exclusivity based on 297 original clinical specimens containing a full spectrum of human respiratory viruses. Control material is mad...","Countries across the world observed dramatic rises in COVID-19 cases and deaths in March 2020. In the United States, delays in the availability of diagnostic testing have prompted questions about the extent of unobserved community transmission. Using a simulation model informed by reported cases and deaths, we estimated that tens of thousands of people (median: \u200b22,876, 95% posterior predictive interval: 7,451 - 53,044) were infected by the time a national emergency was declared. Our results also indicate that fewer than 10% of locally acquired, symptomatic infections in the US were detected throughout much of late February. These results point to the need for immediate, large-scale efforts to mitigate the impacts of SARS-CoV-2 on the US.","Social distancing policies are critical but economically painful measures to flatten the curve against emergent infectious diseases. As the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19 spread throughout the United States in early 2020, the federal government issued social distancing recommendations but left to the states the most difficult and consequential decisions restricting behavior, such as canceling events, closing schools and businesses, and issuing stay-at-home orders. We present an original dataset of state-level social distancing policy responses to the epidemic and explore how political partisanship, COVID-19 caseload, and policy diffusion explain the timing of governors' decisions to mandate social distancing. An event history analysis of five social distancing policies across all fifty states reveals the most important predictors are political: all else equal, Republican governors and governors from states with more Trump supporters were slower to adopt social distancing polici...","A standard SEIR-type compartment model, parameterised for New Zealand, was used to simulate the spread of Covid19 in New Zealand and to test the effectiveness of various control strategies. Control aims can be broadly categorised as either suppression or mitigation. Suppression aims to keep cases to an absolute minimum for as long as possible. Mitigation aims to allow a controlled outbreak to occur, with the aim of preventing significant overloads on healthcare systems and gradually allowing the population to develop herd immunity. Both types of strategy are fraught with uncertainty. Suppression strategies can succeed in delaying an outbreak, but only for as long as such control measures can be sustained. Once controls are eased or restricted, an epidemic is likely to follow as no herd immunity has been acquired. The success or failure of mitigation strategies can depend sensitively on the timing and efficacy of control measures, and require the ability to bring rapidly growing outbrea...","The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared COVID-19 a global pandemic. Healthcare providers should prepare internal guidelines covering all aspect of the organization in order to have their unit ready as soon as possible. This document addresses the current COVID-19 pandemic for maternal-fetal medicine (MFM) practitioners. The goals the guidelines put forth here are two fold- first to reduce patient risk through healthcare exposure, understanding that asymptomatic health systems/healthcare providers may become the most common vector for transmission, and second to reduce the public health burden of COVID-19 transmission throughout the general population. Box 1 outlines general guidance to prevent spread of COVID-19 and protect our obstetric patients. Section 1 outlines suggested modifications of outpatient obstetrical (prenatal) visits. Section 2 details suggested scheduling of obstetrical ultrasound. Section 3 reviews suggested modification of nonstress tests (NST) and biophysic...","The recent pandemic of COVID-19 has involved tens of thousands of patients in numerous countries and the causative virus, SARS COV-2 is highly transmissible. Molecular diagnostic tools are central to containment of the virus and initiating proper clinical care. Rapidity, user-friendliness, and high degree of sensitivity and specificity are desirable features of diagnostic assays for screening purposes. Herein, we present a single step reverse transcriptase LAMP assay (RT-LAMP), which can detect up to 500 viral copies in 30 minutes. We challenged our assay with a large number of clinical samples collected from 47 confirmed cases and 213 negative patients. Our LAMP assay showed a high degree of sensitivity and specificity compared to two commercialized qRT-PCR assay as gold standard. We present a rapid RT-LAMP assay that could extend the capacity of laboratories to process 2.5 more clinical samples relative to qRT-PCR and potentially could be used for high-throughput screening purposes.","Recent outbreaks of infectious pathogens such as Zika, Ebola, and COVID-19 have underscored the need for the dependable availability of vaccines against emerging infectious diseases (EIDs). The cost and risk of R&amp;D programs and uniquely unpredictable demand for EID vaccines have discouraged vaccine developers, and government and nonprofit agencies have been unable to provide timely or sufficient incentives for their development and sustained supply. We analyze the economic returns of a portfolio of EID vaccine assets, and find that under realistic financing assumptions, the expected returns are significantly negative, implying that the private sector is unlikely to address this need without public-sector intervention. We have sized the financing deficit for this portfolio and propose several potential solutions, including price increases, enhanced public-private partnerships, and subscription models through which individuals would pay annual fees to obtain access to a portfolio of vacc...","ABSTRACT THE CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL and Prevention has published updated guidelines for isolation precautions that outline how health care workers can prevent the transmission of infectious agents to their patients and to themselves. THE GUIDELINES RE-EMPHASIZE standard precautions, which guide clinicians in the use of appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE), depending on the expected type of exposure. Respiratory hygiene/cough etiquette is incorporated into infection control practices as a new component of standard precautions. THE ARTICLE PROVIDES information on the new guidelines as well as information on newly emerging patho gens and methods to prevent disease transmission in health care settings.","Summary Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), a novel coronavirus that causes a severe lower respiratory tract infection in humans, emerged in the Middle East in 2012. Since then, MERS-CoV has caused an ongoing epidemic in the Arabian Peninsula with sporadic cases imported in Europe, North Africa, Southeast Asia, and the United States of America. As of 28th May 2014, 636 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV have been reported to World Health Organization including 14 cases imported by travelers. The epicenter of the current MERS-CoV epidemic is located in Saudi Arabia, where millions of pilgrims travel for two mass gatherings annually. In this review we summarize MERS-CoV cases in relation to travel with focus on the epidemiology and prevention in travelers. It is important to increase awareness of travelers about the risks and appropriate preventive measures and for health professionals to be on alert if a patient with severe respiratory symptoms re...","Abstract Viral metagenomics, modeling of protein structure, and manipulation of viral genetics are key approaches that have laid the foundations of our understanding of coronavirus biology. In this review, we discuss the major advances each method has provided and discuss how future studies should leverage these strategies synergistically to answer novel questions.","Background: The overall objective of this rapid review was to identify infection protection and control recommendations from published clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) for adults aged 60 years and older in long-term care settings Methods: Comprehensive searches in MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, and relevant CPG publishers/repositories were carried out in early March 2020. Title/abstract and full-text screening, data abstraction, and quality appraisal (AGREE-II) were carried out by single reviewers. Results: A total of 17 relevant CPGs were identified, published in the USA (n=8), Canada (n=6), Australia (n=2), and the United Kingdom (n=1). All of the CPGs dealt with infection control in long-term care facilities (LTCF) and addressed various types of viral respiratory infections (e.g., influenza, COVID-19, severe acute respiratory syndrome). Ten or more CPGs recommended the following infection control measures in LTCF: hand hygiene (n=13), wearing personal protective equipment...","COVID-19 is spreading really fast around the world. The current study describes the situation of the outbreak of this disease in India and predicts the number of cases expected to rise in India. The study also discusses the regional analysis of Indian states and presents the preparedness level of India in combating this outbreak. The study uses exploratory data analysis to report the current situation and uses time-series forecasting methods to predict the future trends. The data has been considered from the repository of John Hopkins University and covers up the time period from 30th January 2020 when the first case occurred in India till the end of 24th March 2020 when the Prime Minister of India declared a complete lockdown in the country for 21 days starting 25th March 2020. The major findings show that number of infected cases in India is rising quickly with the average infected cases per day rising from 10 to 73 from the first case to the 300th case. The current mortality rate fo...","COVID-19 is now a pandemic and many of the affected countries face severe shortages of hospital resources. In Brazil, the first case was reported on February 26. As the number of cases grows in the country, there is a concern that the health system may become overwhelmed, resulting in shortages of hospital beds, intensive care unit beds, and mechanical ventilators. The timing of shortage is likely to vary geographically depending on the observed onset and pace of transmission observed, on the availability of resources, and on the actions implemented. Here we consider the daily number of cases reported in municipalities in Brazil to simulate twelve alternative scenarios of the likely timing of shortage, based on parameters consistently reported for China and Italy, on rates of hospital occupancy for other health conditions observed in Brazil in 2019, and on assumptions of allocation of patients in public and private facilities. Results show that hospital services could start to experien...","Abstract Purpose The purpose of the study was (1) to identify the requirements for syndromic, disease surveillance and epidemiology systems arising from events such as the SARS outbreak in March 2003, and the deliberate spread of Bacillus anthracis, or anthrax, in the US in 2001; and (2) to use these specifications as input to the construction of a system intended to meet these requirements. An important goal was to provide information about the diffusion of a communicable disease without being dependent on centralised storage of information about individual patients or revealing patient-identifiable information. Methods The method applied is rooted in the engineering paradigm involving phases of analysis, system specification, design, implementation, and testing. The requirements were established from earlier projects\u2019 conclusions and analysis of disease outbreaks. The requirements were validated by a literature study of syndromic and disease surveillance systems. The system was teste...","Motivated by the rapid upsurge of COVID-19 cases in the United States beginning March 2020, we forecast the disease spread and assess the effectiveness of containment strategies by using an estalished network-driven epidemic dynamic model. Our model is initialized using the daily counts of active and confirmed COVID-19 cases across the US. Based on our model predictions for the March 14-16 timeframe, the national epidemic peak could be expected to arrive by early June, corresponding to a daily active count of \u2248 7% of the US population, if no containment plans are implemented. Epidemic peaks are expected to arrive in the states of Washington and New York by May 21 and 25, respectively. With a modest 25% reduction in COVID-19 transmissibility via community-level interventions, the epidemic progression could be delayed by up to 34 days. Wholesale interstate traffic restriction is ineffective in delaying the epidemic outbreak, but it does desynchronize the arrival of state-wise epidemic pe...","Background: COVID-19 outbreak is spreading globally. Although the risk of infection in the US is currently low, it is important to understand the public perception of risk and trust in sources of information to better inform public health messaging. In this study, we surveyed the adult US population to understand their risk perceptions about the COVID-19 outbreak. Methods and Findings: We used an online platform to survey 718 adults in the US in early February 2020 using a questionnaire that we developed. Our sample was fairly similar to the general adult US population in terms of age, gender, race, ethnicity and education. We found that 69% of the respondents wanted the scientific/public health leadership (either the CDC Director or NIH Director) to lead the US response to COVID-19 outbreak as compared to 14% who wanted the political leadership (either the president or the Congress) to lead the response. Risk perception was low (median score of 5 out of 10) with the respondents trusti...","Acute febrile respiratory illness (FRI) leading to respiratory failure is a common reason for admission to the ICU. Viral pneumonia constitutes a portion of these cases, and often the viral etiology goes undiagnosed. Emerging viral infectious diseases such as severe acute respiratory syndrome and avian influenza present with acute FRIs progressing to respiratory failure and ARDS. Therefore, early recognition of a viral cause of acute FRI leading to ARDS becomes important for protection of health-care workers (HCWs), lessening spread to other patients, and notification of public health officials. These patients often have longer courses of viral shedding and undergo higher-risk procedures that may potentially generate aerosols, such as intubation, bronchoscopy, bag-valve mask ventilation, noninvasive positive pressure ventilation, and medication nebulization, further illustrating the importance of early detection and isolation. A small number of viral agents lead to acute FRI, respirato...","Abstract: The 2019-nCoV outbreak has raised concern of global spread. While person-to-person transmission within the Wuhan district has led to a large outbreak, the transmission potential outside of the region remains unclear. Here we present a simple approach for determining whether the upper limit of the confidence interval for the reproduction number exceeds one for transmission in the United States, which would allow endemic transmission. As of February 7, 2020, the number of cases in the United states support subcritical transmission, rather than ongoing transmission. However, this conclusion can change if pre-symptomatic cases resulting from human-to-human transmission have not yet been identified.","","The 2019-nCov will not be the last epidemic to challenge public health experts. The growth of AI-driven techniques to identify epidemiologic risks early will be key to our improvement of prediction, prevention, and detection of future global health risks. The devastating situation in Wuhan, China and future epidemics will also find value in ongoing research in 2019-nCov case detection, spread prediction, treatment effectiveness, and containment. The wide variety, velocity, and veracity of data now available in crises yield data sets that many researchers will now need to incorporate into evermore complex models. This requires expansion of talent within AI for healthcare applications. AI is no longer a niche research area nor is it a tool for the most advanced healthcare systems only, its global impact on healthcare is real and its potential to save lives in this epidemic as well as future epidemics should not be underestimated. It is critical to the global health of all humankind for t...","Viral infections, such as Ebola, severe acute respiratory syndrome/Middle East respiratory syndrome and West Nile virus have emerged as a serious health threat with no effective therapies. These infections have little commercial potential and are not a high priority for the pharmaceutical industry. However, the academic community has been active in this area for many years. The challenge is how to take this academic virology knowledge into a drug discovery and development domain. One approach is the use of consortia and public\u2013private partnerships \u2013 this article highlights ongoing efforts in the USA. Public funds, such as those from government sources, can support research efforts that do not to appear to have commercial value. The key to success is finding a way to combine the different cultural and operational values and reward systems into a productive collaboration to identify new antivirals.","AbstractDuring its first month, the recently emerged 2019 Wuhan novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) has already infected many thousands of people in mainland China and worldwide and took hundreds of lives. However, the swiftly spreading virus also caused an unprecedentedly rapid response from the research community facing the unknown health challenge of potentially enormous proportions. Unfortunately, the experimental research to understand the molecular mechanisms behind the viral infection and to design a vaccine or antivirals is costly and takes months to develop. To expedite the advancement of our knowledge we leverage the data about the related coronaviruses that is readily available in public databases, and integrate these data into a single computational pipeline. As a result, we provide a comprehensive structural genomics and interactomics road-maps of 2019-nCoV and use these information to infer the possible functional differences and similarities with the related SARS coronavirus. ...","In an era of global health threats caused by epidemics of infectious diseases and rising multidrug resistance, microbiology laboratories provide essential scientific evidence for risk assessment, prevention, and control. Microbiology has been at the core of European infectious disease surveillance networks for decades. Since 2010, these networks have been coordinated by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC). Activities delivered in these networks include harmonization of laboratory diagnostic, antimicrobial susceptibility and molecular typing methods, multicentre method validation, technical capacity mapping, training of laboratory staff, and continuing quality assessment of laboratory testing. Cooperation among the European laboratory networks in the past 7 years has proved successful in strengthening epidemic preparedness by enabling adaptive capabilities for rapid detection of emerging pathogens across Europe. In partnership with food safety authorities, inte...","Rapid diagnostics, vaccines and therapeutics are important interventions for the management of the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak. It is timely to systematically review the potential of these interventions, including those for Middle East respiratory syndrome-Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV, to guide policymakers globally on their prioritization of resources for research and development. A systematic search was carried out in three major electronic databases (PubMed, Embase and Cochrane Library) to identify published studies in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Supplementary strategies through Google Search and personal communications were used. A total of 27 studies fulfilled the criteria for review. Several laboratory protocols for confirmation of suspected 2019-nCoV cases using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) have been publ...","","Background Since December 2019, pneumonia associated with the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) has emerged in Wuhan, China. The exponential increase of the confirmed number of cases of 2019n-CoV is of great concern to the global community. The fears and panic among residents in the epicenters have prompted diverse responses, which are understudied. During such a crisis, community trust and support for the government and health authorities are important to contain the outbreak. We aimed to investigate the influence of institutional trust on public responses to the 2019-nCoV outbreak. Methods An anonymous Internet-based, cross-sectional survey was administered on January 29, 2020. The study population comprised all residents currently residing or working in the province of Hubei, where Wuhan is the capital city. The level of trust in information provision and preventive instructions, individual preventive behaviors and treatment-seeking behaviors were queried. Findings The majority of ...","The novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV, or COVID-19) epidemic first broke out in Wuhan and has been spreading in whole China and the world. The numbers of new infections and deaths in Wuhan are still increasing, which have posed major public health and governance concerns. A series of mandatory actions have been taken by the municipal and provincial governments supported by the central government, such as measures to restrict travels across cities, case detection and contact tracing, quarantine, guidance and information to the public, detection kit development, etc. Challenges such as lacking effective drugs, insufficient hospital services and medical supplies, logistics, etc. have much alleviated with the solidarity of the whole society. The pandemic will definitely be ended with the continuous efforts of both national and international multi-sectoral bodies.","Abstract Bronchiolitis is the number one cause of hospitalization in infants during the first year of life. Clinical guidelines recommend primarily supportive care and discourage use of pharmacotherapies and diagnostics. However, there continues to be widespread use of non-recommended therapies and variation in the use of therapeutic interventions among hospitals in the United States. Here we review evidence-based management of this common disease in order to optimize resource utilization, decrease healthcare costs, and decrease unnecessary hospitalization. Current evidence does not support the routine use of chest radiographs, viral testing or laboratory evaluation in children with bronchiolitis. In addition, routine administration of bronchodilators, including albuterol and nebulized epinephrine, corticosteroids and hypertonic saline are not recommended for infants and children with bronchiolitis. Intravenous or nasogastric hydration and nutritional support, supplemental oxygen, and ...","BACKGROUND: There is an ongoing debate regarding the type of respiratory protection that should be recommended for use for healthcare workers. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was conducted in three countries: China, Pakistan and Vietnam. RESULTS: In China and Pakistan, the infection control guidelines were developed to be in line with the recommendations from the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, while in the Vietnamese guidelines the recommendations correspond with the WHO suggestions only. The guidelines from all three countries document the need for training and fit testing; however there is no system to monitor the training and fit testing programs. Across the three countries, there was some inconsistency with regard to the types of products (i.e. masks vs. respirators) recommended for influenza, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and tuberculosis. CONCLUSIONS: Available evidence should be examined and a compre...","","The number of confirmed COVID-19 cases admitted in hospitals is continuously increasing in the Philippines. Frontline health care workers are faced with imminent risks of getting infected. In this study, we formulate a theoretical model to calculate the risk of being infected in health care facilities considering the following factors: the average number of encounters with a suspected COVID-19 patient per hour; interaction time for each encounter; work shift duration or exposure time; crowd density, which may depend on the amount of space available in a given location; and availability and effectiveness of protective gears and facilities provided for the frontline health care workers. Based on the simulation results, we recommend the following: (i) decrease the rate of patient encounter per frontline health care worker, e.g., maximum of three encounters per hour in a 12-hour work shift duration; (ii) decrease the interaction time between the frontline health care worker and the patient...","The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has been rapidly transmitted in China, Macau, Hong Kong, and other Asian and European counterparts. This COVID-19 epidemic has aroused increasing attention nationwide. Patients, health professionals, and the general public are under insurmountable psychological pressure which may lead to various psychological problems, such as anxiety, fear, depression, and insomnia. Psychological crisis intervention plays a pivotal role in the overall deployment of the disease control. The National Health Commission of China has summoned a call for emergency psychological crisis intervention and thus, various mental health associations and organizations have established expert teams to compile guidelines and public health educational articles/videos for mental health professionals and the general public alongside with online mental health services.

The developmental process identified 17 critical infrastructure sectors encompassing both public and private interests. These 17 sectors were considered \"so vital to the united States that their incapacity or destruction would have a debilitating impact on national security, national economic security, and national public health of safety, or any combination of these matters\" (Box 2.4). While terrorism served as an impetus for the creation of the NIpp, public/private cooperation has been enhanced through more efficient responses to major emergencies such as hurricanes. NIpp initiated voluntary private sector councils to advise on how to strengthen security in the sector by cooperation and the institution of best practices. The private sector participates in all the national infrastructure partnerships, except those exclusively concerned with government issues.","To efficiently cope with the 2019-nCoV outbreak, the Chinese Government has implemented rapid and comprehensive public health emergency interventions. To date, all of the 31 provincial-level regions in mainland China with confirmed 2019-nCoV cases have activated socalled level 1 public health emergency responses (ie, the highest level of emergency public health alerts and responses within the national public health management system). 6 The provincial governments are responsible for organising, coordinating, and handling all emergency public health treatments, disclosing information, and gathering emergency materials and facilities under the guidance of the State Council. For health-care sectors, in addition to public health interventions, dealing with public psychological barriers and performing psychological crisis intervention is included in the level 1 response. The National Health Commission has released guidelines for local authorities to promote psychological crisis intervention for patients, medical personnel, and people under medical observation during the 2019-nCoV outbreak. 7 Peking University is preparing a mental health handbook for the public that describes how to deal with stress and other psychological problems occurring due to the outbreak of 2019-nCoV. 8 The Chinese Government strives to improve the public's awareness of prevention and intervention strategies by providing daily updates about surveillance and active cases on websites and social media. Increasingly, psychologists and psychiatrists use the internet and social media (eg, WeChat, Weibo, etc) to share strategies for dealing with psychological stress. For example, experts from Peking University Sixth Hospital made six suggestions for the public to cope with mental stress. 9 These included assessing the accuracy of information disclosed, enhancing social support systems (eg, families and friends), eliminating stigma associated with the epidemic, maintaining a normal life under safe conditions, and using the psychosocial service system, particularly telephone-based and internet-based counselling for health-care staff, patients, family members, and the public. Numerous psychiatric hospitals, psychological counselling centres, and psychology departments within universities have launched specialised hotlines to provide psychological counselling services for people in need. 7 We believe that including mental health care in the national public health emergency system will empower China and the world during the campaign to contain and eradicate 2019-nCoV.","China has exploited global networks in a number of ways. First, as Hirschman reminded us, great powers regularly seek to convert their economic might into political leverage around the world. China is no exception. With the development of global and regional connectivity, China has used its financial muscles to gain control over major natural resources and strategic locations and to influence other states' stances in disputes. China has provided a substantial amount of aid to African countries to harden its grasp on natural resources. Beijing has also launched comprehensive programs of financial statecraft, known as Belt and Road Initiatives (BRI), to establish its sphere of influence in the Indo-Pacific region and even the whole of Eurasia. China's financial prowess successfully has swayed some states' stances in many regional disputes. Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte's recent concession on the South China Sea dispute is one notable example. Another salient case is China's successful effort to induce the Solomon Islands to end its diplomatic relationship with Taiwan. 15 Second, the fundamental goal for the Chinese leadership is to create a world that is safe for China's authoritarian regime. Such an objective could be achieved if there are more non-democratic regimes around the world, or more countries adopting the \"China model.\" Therefore, China does not only seek to develop its repressive capacities, but also it tries to export its censorship regime-encouraging other authoritarian regimes to censor and silence domestic dissidents with the technologies and programs it supplies. China's strategy is twofold: first, it has exploited global supply chains and cross-border networks to upgrade its infrastructural power for censorship and monitoring domestic citizens. For example, China has engaged in intellectual property theft worldwide and cyber espionage to increase its information and communication technologies. 16 It has also provided various governmental supports to develop Huawei, China's largest telecommunications company and Chinese \"national champion\" of the 5G industry. Huawei's success and control over 5G network technologies have enabled the Chinese government to collect and store the data of almost every Chinese citizen. The government also used similar industrial policies to develop Hikvision Digital Technology and Dahua Technology, Chinese manufacturers and the world's two largest suppliers of video surveillance products. The monitoring capacity provided by Chinese surveillance camera companies, together with Huawei's big data technology, strengthen China's policing capacity and the Communist Party's censorship. 17 The second fold of China's strategy is to export its censorship regime to other countries as well as surveillance hardware and data-analytics tools. China has engaged in social penetration into other societies and wielded its sharp power globally to justify the China model. For example, Beijing is cultivating media elites and government ministers around the world to create a network of countries that will follow its lead on internet policy. Chinese officials have held many all-expensespaid trainings, workshops, seminars, and conferences with representatives from other countries. During those events, China regularly propagates that the Chinese model of censorship is helpful in combating terrorism and fake news, monitoring public opinion, china/diplomacy/article/3027827/us-cancels-solomon-islands-meeting-after-disappointmentit. 16 and ensuring cyber security. Several countries introduced cyber-security laws that closely mimic China's own version after their official participated in those events. 18 Finally, and much more concerning, the Chinese state apparatus has been developing its \"information troops\" to silence or deter dissidents as well as to enforce pro-China views at home and abroad. The great majority of these troops-called by some as the \"50-cent army\"-may not actually be part of the security apparatus, but independent operators including student volunteers at universities, Communist Youth League members, and government bureaucrats. 19 According to political scientists Gary King at Harvard, Jennifer Pan at Stanford, and Margaret E. Roberts at University of California San Diego, the Chinese state apparatus is involved in faking several hundred million social media accounts and posts. 20 The Chinese information troops often use social media to launch campaigns against voices or opinions that criticize the Chinese government or challenge the legitimacy of the CCP. The troops constantly use fake news or specious arguments to manipulate public opinion. With help from Chinese government censorship, they can easily silence dissents and \"manufacture\" some public consensus. Then, backed by this manufactured consensus, the Chinese government is able to resort to coercion against the dissenters.","\u2022 Social distancing -keeping at least six feet (1.8 meters) between individuals in waiting rooms and work spaces as much as feasible. \u2022 Encourage sick employees to stay home. Personnel who develop respiratory symptoms (e.g., cough, shortness of breath) or unexplained fever should be instructed not to report to work. \u2022 Ensure that your sick leave policies are flexible and consistent with public health guidance and that employees are aware of these policies.

Through Global Alert and Response (GAR) Disease Outbreak News (DON) releases, the WHO kept the world updated with detailed, deidentified case information provided soon after they had been forwarded on to them from each country's Ministry of Health or equivalent, as per the transparency required by the International Health Regulations (IHR), 2005. However there were often delays in the posting of such information, most notably during the Jeddah-2014 outbreak when no new case details were confirmed by the WHO as originating from KSA for more than six weeks. Cases announced via the KSA Ministry of Health website have often had data inconsistencies including errors, format variations, have often lacked key information including dates, have presented deaths with insufficient information to permit linkage with the announced case and over one hundred cases remain devoid of all key data, excluding them from most epidemiological analyses. This was a particular problem during periods when rapid case accumulation became a concern for the global community. When available, WHO DONs fill in vital missing detail, with additional important demographic data like age, sex or essential dates permitting improved understanding of when illness onset occurred, when cases were hospitalised, whether they were asymptomatic and if the newly announced case was a contact of another case, an animal or an animal product. However DONs are only effective when the underlying data is forwarded to the WHO. Such comprehensive data permits other calculations, for instance the likely laboratory turnaround time, the possibility for nosocomial spread occurring and the location of cases as a determining factor in whether a cluster has become an outbreak or a local epidemic. WHO data can be viewed by the public but are also relied upon by WHO Member States' epidemiology analysts. Such experts report to many levels of Health management and government who seek to understand threats to their own population so as to make the most informed judgements. The decisions which follow may include the need to raise alert levels, prepare laboratory capacity, create educational materials, free specific response funds, ramp up messaging, manage and alter border controls or issue travel alerts. The activities of the WHO have been essential for global preparedness against MERS. The WHO rapidly and comprehensively adopted, updated and publicly promoted diagnostic tools and testing algorithms, case definitions and guidelines for investigations, research study protocols, IPC guidance, travel advice, risk assessments and summary updates via a purpose-built coronavirus-focussed website. Their social media unit strove to answer questions posed by everyone and anyone through Twitter, which in turn allowed users to take control of further disseminating the information they found most interesting, informative, relevant or concerning to others in their social networks; a process that can also be informative to public health bodies who seek to provide their clients the detail they desire. The role of WHO as a nexus for collaboration laid the groundwork for the accumulation and advancement of knowledge about MERS and the MERS-CoV through the formation of, and reporting by, the IHR (2005) Emergency Committee concerning MERS-CoV. Their role is to advise the WHO Director-General on the need for action and, as yet, no Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) has been declared. The IHR Emergency Committee has met eight times to date. Upon request, the WHO has also sent risk assessment teams to the region to gauge the MERS situation. Gregory H\u00e4rtl, Coordinator of the Department of Communications for the WHO, noted that \"the more answers public health experts can provide now, the greater the public's trust in these institutions will be if and when the virus should become easily transmissible between humans and cause more widespread morbidity and mortality\" (Hartl, 2013) . This is a comment that applies equally well to the emergence of any infectious disease. By comparison, officials within the KSA were widely and regularly criticised for moving slowly, shunning collaborations and failing to show proactive action in commencing local research into MERS and MERS-CoV (2014c; Editorial, 2014; Holmes, 2014; Kupferschmidt, 2014; Reuters, 2014; World Health Organization, 2014f) .","Drawing on the social amplification of risk model [31], public risk perception is shaped by a process of interplays between psychological, cultural, social, and institutional factors that may result in amplifying or attenuating the public attention to risk. Mass communication is among the list of factors. Public health officials have long recognised the role of the mass media in disseminating risk and emergency information before, during, and after a catastrophe [32]. The World Health Organization establishes guidelines for \u201ceffective media communication\u201d, through which the authorities are able to disseminate information to the public [33]. Communication during crisis was traditionally understood to be a one-way and top-down process, in which the public are assumed to be \u201cdeficient\u201d in knowledge, while the scientists, public health experts, and emergency managers, are \u201csufficient\u201d [34]. But this presumption was profoundly challenged by the emergence of social media. For instance, Leung and Nicoll argued that the 2009 H1N1 pandemic was the first pandemic in which social media \u201cchallenged conventional public health communication\u201d [35]. In China, online messages were published ahead of the official statement in the 2008 Sichuan Earthquake [36]. Social media enabled people under crisis to share information and experience and to seek message credibility and confirmation via multiple media platforms and social networks [34]. Our study demonstrated that official data released by health authorities, whether in Beijing or Geneva, received strong reactions in the Chinese online community. With such knowledge, social media should be incorporated in the best practices for risk and crisis communication [37]. Social media data can also provide health authorities, researchers and the media a quantifiable measure of public attention towards a particular disease outbreak [11].","The mooching approach resembles the manpower exchange approach. For example, both approaches include approaching/inviting Taiwan's opinion leaders, 48 China's Economic Statecraft and Social Penetration against Taiwan local politicians, community leaders, 49 and key figures, such as retired ministers, 50 exmilitary generals, religious leaders, school principals, and teachers, as well as young students to take part in cross-Strait forums and various exchange programs organized by China's public and private sectors. Nevertheless, these two approaches are different. First, they rely on different ways to govern cross-Strait ties. The manpower exchange approach focuses on building institutionalized channels to conduct routine cross-Strait interactions, while the mooching approach emphasizes developing informal networks to deal with ad hoc tasks. Second, each approach has a distinct strategic goal. The manpower exchange approach seeks to shape Taiwanese general public opinion toward China and the CCP, and to foster a group of constituents that can influence Taiwanese politics in China's favor. In contrast, the mooching approach aims for cultivating specific pro-China agents to conduct ad hoc cross-Strait affairs. A salient example is the recent Taiwanese evacuation from Wuhan due to the coronavirus. After the 2019 outbreak of the novel coronavirus (also commonly known as the Wuhan coronavirus) in China, Taiwan's government kept requesting that Beijing permit the evacuation of Taiwanese citizens from Wuhan. However, the Chinese government did not respond to Taiwan's request because China stopped official communications with the incumbent government led by President Tsai Ing-wen since 2016. China also continues to block Taiwan's attendance at the World Health Organization, constricting the Taiwanese government's ability to receive timely information about the coronavirus situation. Beijing eventually allowed an evacuation flight due to the worsening situation. However, media reported that the Chinese officials only collaborated with pro-China Taiwanese businesspersons and elites when drafting flight manifests, rather than allowing Taiwan's government to directly handle the evacuation. 51 The mooching method is also widely adopted by China's local governments, enterprises, and associations when they approach young Taiwanese. For example, China's universities provide young Taiwanese doctorates with assistant 49 The author interviewed a community leader in Yilan County on his opinion regarding cross-Strait local community interaction. He argued, \"China is developing democracy at the grassroots level. Wealthy and strong community organizations are important to improve their quality of life. Therefore, community representatives came to Taiwan to learn about the development and reinvigoration of local community and are aimed at establishing close ties between grassroots communities in China and Taiwan. From their perspective, it is to facilitate natural social integration of both sides. Nevertheless, with our successful experience, they shall and will thank Taiwan and maintain good relationship with us.\" Interview with a local community leader in Yilan County, Dec. 19, 2019. 50 Huang Tzu-ti, \"x-defense minister of Taiwan says Beijing approached him,\" Taiwan News, Dec. 2, 2019, https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/3828785. 51 \"Coronavirus: Beijing allows Taipei to evacuate Taiwanese in Wuhan,\" The Straits Times, Feb 05, 2020, https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/east-asia/beijing-allows-taipei-to-evacuatetaiwanese-in-wuhan; and Nick Aspinwall, \"Taiwan's Coronavirus Response Hits Obstacles Set by Chinese Government?,\" The Diplomat, Feb. 7, 2020, https://thediplomat.com/2020/02/taiwans-coronavirus-response-hits-obstacles-set-bychinese-government/.","Following the attacks of September 11, 2001, and the 2001 anthrax events, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) increased efforts for the procurement and development of medical countermeasures for CBRN threats. Consequently, CDC's role as the lead agency responsible for preparedness and response to public health emergencies involving bioterrorism Category A agents (e.g. smallpox, botulism, anthrax, plague, viral hemorrhagic fevers, tularemia) and other emerging public health threats (e.g. avian influenza, 2009 pandemic influenza A [H1N1], monkeypox, severe acute respiratory syndrome) also expanded. One of the notable expansions has been the management of medical countermeasures for these CBRN and emerging threats. The medical countermeasures stockpiled in CDC's Strategic National Stockpile consist of drugs, biologics, and devices. These medical countermeasures can be used for the treatment, mitigation, or prevention of serious or life-threatening conditions/diseases resulting from CBRN or other potential public health threats. Many of these medical countermeasures are considered investigational products (i.e., unapproved products or unapproved uses of approved products) by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Moreover, additional medical countermeasures for CBRN and public health threats that are under development or are being considered for procurement are investigational and are not anticipated to have FDA approval prior to stockpiling. Therefore, these investigational medical countermeasures require FDA-regulated mechanisms such as IND applications, IDE applications, EUA requests, or other FDA-regulated applications for receipt into stockpile and for deployment and use in response to a potential or actual public health event. As a result of this expansion, it became essential for CDC to prepare and submit, in a timely manner, high-quality IND and IDE documents to FDA. RA is the entity within CDC responsible for centralizing and ensuring CDC's consistency in submissions and communications with FDA. RA fulfills its responsibilities of ensuring appropriate regulatory mechanisms for stockpiling, deployment, and use of investigational medical countermeasures. Additionally, RA ensures compliance with laws and regulations (applicable parts under Code of Federal Regulations Title 21) enforced by FDA, which are delivered through the specific activities of but not limited to coordinating, drafting, reviewing, submitting, and maintaining the applications regulated by FDA [e.g., IND, IDE, EUA, 510(k)]. These activities ensure that the deployment and use of Strategic National Stockpile investigational medical countermeasures and other medical countermeasures only available through CDC (e.g., therapeutics for rare diseases in the United States such as parasitic and tropical diseases) adhere to FDA regulations.","The directives will give regulatory effect to the de facto situation in most member states. A Commission document published in 1988 (EC, 1988) contains, in addition to contemporary versions of the draft directives and their annexes, an explanatory memorandum for each directive which includes a summary of the objectives and a review of the contemporary regulatory position in each member state. In the UK, regulations under the Health and Safety at Work Act, 1974 (SI 1810 provide for authorization and monitoring of the use of GMOs by the HSE, whereas in Ireland similar provisions are contained in guidelines monitored by a national RDNA Committee, which represents industry, government interests, the universities and the trades unions, under the aegis of the National Board for Science and Technology (NBST, 1987) . As in most member states, this procedure is voluntary but serious breaches of the guidelines could be prosecuted under environmental and worker protection legislation.","On January 31, CDC published its third Health Advisory with interim guidance for clinicians and public health practitioners.\u2020\u2020\u2020 In addition, CDC issued a Clinical Action Alert through its Clinician Outreach and Communication Activity network on January 31.\u00a7\u00a7\u00a7 Interim guidance for health care professionals is available at https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-nCoV/hcp/clinical-criteria.html. Health care providers should identify patients who might have been exposed and who have signs or symptoms related to 2019-nCoV infection, isolate these patients, and inform public health departments. This includes obtaining a detailed travel history for patients being evaluated with fever and lower respiratory tract illness. Criteria to guide evaluation and testing of PUIs for 2019-nCoV include 1) fever or signs or symptoms of lower respiratory tract illness (e.g., cough or shortness of breath) in any person, including health care workers, who has had close contact\u00b6\u00b6\u00b6 with a patient with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection within 14 days of symptom onset; 2) fever and signs or symptoms of lower respiratory tract illness (e.g., cough or shortness of breath) in any person with a history of travel from Hubei Province, China, within 14 days of symptom onset; or 3) fever and signs or symptoms of lower respiratory tract illness (e.g., cough or shortness of breath) requiring hospitalization in any person with a history of travel from mainland China within 14 days of symptom onset. Additional nonhospitalized PUIs may be tested based on consultation with state and local public health officials. Clinicians should evaluate PUIs for other possible causes of illness (e.g., influenza and respiratory syncytial virus) as clinically indicated.","The third, and perhaps largest objective of the Working Group, is to strengthen influenza-related public health practices, infrastructure, and research. A successful component of this objective is the promotion of adult immunization programs with improved vaccine coverage of individuals at increased risk of complications from influenza. Several groups are developing communications networks and protocols to disseminate up-to-date information to healthcare providers and the public. Research on influenza biology and epidemiology, animal surveillance, and vaccine and antiviral development has been and will continue to be supported by NIH through grants to academic researchers and through grants that support public-private partnerships. Development of cell culture-based vaccines and the testing in humans of candidate pandemic vaccines made using reverse genetics or classical reassortment techniques should be encouraged. There is also a need to test adjuvanted vaccines and to develop new antiviral agents. It is noteworthy that there are currently only two influenza vaccine manufacturers licensed to distribute vaccine in the US for the 2003-2004 influenza season. It is also noteworthy that 80-90% of produced vaccine is purchased privately, and it takes nearly a full year from the time of selection of strains to the production of usable vaccine. As a result, it will be essential to encourage new vaccine manufacturers and new approaches, including reverse genetics to prepare seed strains, in addition to developing and implementing a vaccine policy that ensures adequate and fair procurement and distribution of the vaccine during an influenza pandemic. Such policies will need to take into account liability protection and equitable global access. Finally, identifying appropriate antiviral drugs to stockpile and developing plans to prioritize use of these antivirals are necessary for pandemic preparedness.","New vaccines begin with the recognition of an infectious disease burden worth preventing. 29 Basic research regarding pathogens and immune responses, often funded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH), vaccine manufacturers, and nonprofit organizations such as the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, is performed mainly at universities. 1 Certain vaccines for yellow fever, typhoid, and anthrax are funded and developed in the Department of Defense. Before entering clinical trials, prototype vaccines undergo toxicology testing that is conducted in a Good Laboratory Practice-compliant laboratory. Private firms then build on this knowledge to develop clinically feasible vaccine products and shepherd them through clinical testing. The vaccine's manufacturer then must submit a Biological License Application (BLA) to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for evaluation and approval before marketing. The approval process tests extensively for safety and efficacy, along with purity and absence of contaminants. If data raise serious concerns about product safety or efficacy during any phase, FDA may request additional information or studies or may halt ongoing clinical studies. 30 The entire research, development, and approval process may require 10 years or more. 31 Estimates of the cost of this process range from $110 million to $802 million ($US 2000). 1, 32 Table 1 summarizes information on the different phases in vaccine research. Manufacturing complexities. Although vaccine manufacturing regulation originally was controlled by the U.S. Public Health Service under the Biologics Control Act of 1902, this authority now rests with FDA. The majority of vaccines approved by FDA are manufactured from live (attenuated) or killed (inactivated) organisms. Some are based on partially purified components of an organism such as diphtheria and tetanus, and a handful are recombinantly produced, such as the hepatitis B vaccine. 4 Vaccines are manufactured by at least three methods: egg-based (e.g., influenza vaccine), cell-derived (e.g., polio vaccine), or recombinant (e.g., hepatitis B vaccine). For bacterial vaccines, the bacterial pathogens are grown in bioreactors using media developed for optimizing the yield of the antigen (e.g., Hib) 31 ( Figure 1 ).","Chinese health officials posted the full 2019-nCoV genome sequence on January 10, 2020, to inform the development of specific diagnostic tests for this emergent coronavirus (1). Within a week, CDC developed a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments\u2013approved real-time RT-PCR test that can diagnose 2019-nCoV respiratory samples from clinical specimens. On January 24, CDC publicly posted the assay protocol for this test (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-nCoV/lab/index.html). On January 4, 2020, the Food and Drug Administration issued an Emergency Use Authorization to enable emergency use of CDC\u2019s 2019-nCoV Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel. To date, this test has been limited to use at CDC laboratories. This authorization allows the use of the test at any CDC-qualified lab across the country. CDC is working closely with FDA and public health partners, including the American Public Health Laboratories, to rapidly share these tests domestically and internationally through CDC\u2019s International Reagent Resource (https://www.internationalreagentresource.org/). In addition, CDC uploaded the genome of the virus from the first reported cases in the United States to GenBank, the National Institutes of Health genetic sequence database of publicly available DNA sequences (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/). CDC also is growing the virus in cell culture, which is necessary for further studies, including for additional genetic characterization. Once isolated, the virus will be made available through BEI Resources (https://www.beiresources.org/) to assist research efforts.","However, a careful analysis shows that China's information manipulation may have contributed to Han's victory. As Paul Huang points out, many of Han's Facebook supporting groups were created, managed, and nurtured by what looks very much like a professional cyber group from China. Those groups helped mobilize the support for Han through many means, including using fake news to manipulate the public attitude. 45 China's manipulation tactics and espionage are also common in Taiwanese academia. An anonymous scholar from National Sun Yat-sen University pointed out that since 2016, unidentified hackers have silently accessed and checked the email of more than 10 professors of Political Science and International Relations through several fake accounts posing as senior school administrators. The intruders' IP address has been traced back to China, Hong Kong, and the United States. This year, the hackers' IP addresses were highly concentrated in Hong Kong and were suspected of being a domain address generated by using a virtual private network (VPN). 46 This suspicion indicates that China may have extended its cyber espionage network into the Taiwanese academia and universities to increase political control by monitoring the behavior of teachers and students.","At the national level there should be an IC programme, which would provide healthcare facilities with appropriate direction, guidance and support in preventing the spread of infection in healthcare facilities. This will ensure consistency of approach. 49 In those areas without existing legislation to make IC and prevention interventions mandatory, public health officials should promote meetings with policy makers to lobby for legislation to mandate that each hospital should have an IC committee (ICC) with a specified core membership and an appropriate IC infrastructure, including resources. Functions of the hospital ICC should include outbreak investigation, surveillance, reviewing local epidemiological data, educating staff, patients and visitors, developing and promoting local guidelines and estimating resource needs. The ICC should be multidisciplinary and include nursing, medical, laboratory, public health, pharmacy, occupational health, hospital management and engineering representatives.","Licensed security guard companies and investigators have been on the scene for decades. But by the late 1960s, no independent critical analysis of this growing security industry had taken place. That changed. In 1970, contemporary security practices in the United States were described and evaluated by the scathing and influential Rand Report. This document represented the first time the burgeoning security industry received a systematic analysis from a disinterested research group. With a grant from the Law Enforcement Assistance Administration (LEAA), the Rand Corporation began, in 1970, a 16-month investigation of \"private police\" in the United States. The authors, James S. Kakalik and Sorrel Wildhorn, were lawyers trained as policy analysts and employed by rand in Santa Monica, California. Their task was to assess private security businesses and personnel with an eye to how private security might be a concern of public policy.","Methods of guiding students to effectively and appropriately regulate their emotions during public health emergencies and avoid losses caused by crisis events have become an urgent problem for colleges and universities. Therefore, we investigated and analyzed the mental health status of college students during the epidemic for the following purposes. (1) To evaluate the mental situation of college students during the epidemic; (2) to provide a theoretical basis for psychological interventions with college students; and (3) to provide a basis for the promulgation of national and governmental policies.","For any country, eff ective control of infectious diseases is dependent on focused eff orts to decrease endemic infections in at-risk and susceptible populations, combined with strong epidemiological and laboratory capacity to detect and stop emerging threats. Inherent in these eff orts are well established links between clinical, public health, and research communities working with non-traditional partners such as industry, law enforcement, businesses, and the media. Although at their core these collaborations need to be established locally, such crucial partnerships have to extend across state, national, and international levels. Together, these alliances can form a global infrastructure and system to detect and control infectious diseases. With that aim, in February, 2014, the USA and other nations joined WHO, the Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations, and the World Organization for Animal Health in a new global health security agenda designed to enhance strategies to prevent, detect, and respond to threats of infectious disease. 123 Partner countries will work together to meet a series of objectives covering crucial issues aff ecting control of infectious disease such as antimicrobial resistance, biosafety and biosecurity, global disease detection and response networks, and emergency responses. Much emphasis has been placed on the aptly named perfect storm inherent in today's globalised world for rapid emergence and spread of infectious diseases. Despite this persistent challenge, extraordinary achievements in science and technology continue to bolster the capacity to recognise and respond to these threats. Scientifi cally, next-generation sequencing and state-of-the-art bioinformatics capabilities are transforming the practice of microbiology and the speed at which infectious pathogens can be detected and analysed. 85,124 These technologies provide a new level of information about infectious pathogens and therefore off er tremendous opportunities for public health eff orts to detect and control outbreaks, target antimicrobial resistance, and develop and refi ne treatments and vaccines. [125] [126] [127] Additionally, the increasing understanding of the role of human microbiomes in disease development and new links between infectious agents and chronic diseases opens new possibilities for disease prevention and treatment. 128 Advances in electronic communications have also been essential and have enabled rapid sharing of health and safety information and expertise by health-care and public health workers, researchers, law enforcement, the media, and private individuals. These communication capacities can facilitate and enhance research and public health partnerships worldwide, generating broad sharing of research fi ndings and health updates in near real time. The latest surge in health communications has come from social media tools, which are increasingly being used to extend the reach of public health information. To ensure that these rapidly changing scientifi c and technological advances are routinely used in public health is a crucial challenge and priority.","time. If we expect the Italian people to remain inside and keep following the recommendations of public health officials for the next few weeks or even months (as may be necessary to curb the spread of COVID-19) it would be helpful to find ways of reducing these negative effects of the quarantine. A messaging campaign that suggests how to make the quarantine easier and more frictionless, rather than repeating the now well-known dire reasons to stay indoors, should begin. Possibilities include messaging about online collective exercises, social reading activities (e.g., Perusall.com for schools and universities), safe ways for people to get fresh air outside, classes (e.g., edx.org for online classes), or novel ways of bridging social capital between young and old, or even distribution of inexpensive tablets or laptops to ensure the whole population has video conferencing abilities. If we look for activities and interventions that make the quarantine easier for those affected by it, the population may be able to better tolerate the treatment for as long as it takes to overcome this public health crisis. respondent of an intensely personal impact of non-compliance with the quarantine. The message was as follows:","According to Brodie (1981) , the traditional role of dispensing medications has been expanded. Pharmacists should be both health generalists and health specialists, which will have an impact on public health. Even the American Public Health Association (1981) supports the pharmacists' role in public health. Should community pharmacists move beyond their traditional role? Even when dispensing medicines through paper-based prescription services, pharmacists should comply with some fundamental standards. Safety issues must be considered when dispensing medications. The Pharmacy Board of Australia published guidelines for medication dispensing (i.e., guidelines for scanned and faxed prescriptions and steps to take when handling Internet or mail-order dispensing); guidelines for dispensing extemporaneous medications; guidelines when handling errors (e.g., dispensing errors); guidelines for appropriate medication labeling; guidelines for patient counseling, privacy, and confidentiality; and pharmacy technicians' functions, responsibilities, and competencies (Pharmacy Board of Australia, n.d.). In addition, for pharmacies that use electronic and computer systems, the Royal Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain (n.d.) has provided several guidelines and principles for good dispensing and appropriate dispensing procedures (e.g., professional checking, medication substitution, and labeling). Malaysia, a developing country, has also developed Guide to Good Dispensing Practice (Malaysian Pharmaceutical Services Division, 2016) . These guidelines aim to have both public and private facilities dispensing medications according to the law and guidelines, which may ensure that patients receive the correct medications, adherence is improved, adverse effects are minimized, and errors are avoided. The document's contents relate to processing prescriptions, preparing medications, labeling, recoding, and issuing medications to the patient. In geographical areas where no pharmacists are available, a guide about managing medicines would be a handy document indeed (Andersson &amp; Snell, 2010) .","When WHO named the disease COVID-19, the choice was based on scientific standards. But it also matters how the global public might use the name. COVID-19 seems to be a tough term for news media worldwide and the general public. Perhaps even more confusing to the general public is the notion that the disease and the virus (SARS-CoV-2) have seemingly unrelated monikers. Parts of the media have settled for calling the microbial threat the coronavirus. One assumption could be that no expert in commu nications was asked to weigh in on the namings. But had WHO given serious consideration to future control of the public narrative, the agency's communications staff would have had opportunity to capture online brands and social media monikers before public announcement, such as #COVID19 or a myriad of Facebook page names using permutations of SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19. This was not done, and online public discourse using those tags is in private hands.","The National Swine Survey was conceived and implemented by veterinarians in the United States Department of Agriculture: Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service: Veterinary Services (USDA:APHIS:VS), in collaboration with universities and producer groups, to estimate health and productivity parameters for swine in the United States. The objective of the present study was to use data from the National Swine Survey (NSS) collected between November 1989 and February 1991 to identify herd-level management and demographic risk factors for TGE seropositivity and quantify the magnitude of these risks.","The United States could publicly announce that if Beijing poaches all of Taiwan's diplomatic allies in the Caribbean and Latin America, the United States would still welcome President Tsai, and future leaders of Taiwan, to the travel to the United States (and even to Washington, D.C.-which is currently off-limits to top-level leaders) without the pretense of a stopover/refueling visit. Such a move is broadly supported by the Taiwan Travel Act (TTA), and this support could be made clearer by an amendment to the law calling for the United States to \"allow high-level officials of Taiwan, including the President and Vice President of the Republic of China Taiwan, to enter the United States, under conditions which demonstrate appropriate respect for the dignity of such officials, and to meet with officials of the United States, including officials from the Department of State and the Department of Defense and other Cabinet agencies, anywhere in the United States of America.\" A Race to Zero?: China's Poaching of Taiwan's Diplomatic Allies","Timely, accurate, and transparent risk communication is essential and challenging in emergencies because it determines whether the public will trust authorities more than rumours and misinformation. 6 Singapore health authorities provide daily information on mainstream media, the Ministry of Health has Telegram and WhatsApp groups set up with doctors in the public and private sectors where more detailed clinical and logistics information is shared, and authorities use websites to debunk circulating misinformation. Risk communications to establish trust in authorities has been less successful in Japan and Hong Kong.","Our Series paper describes examples of recent and continuing challenges to control infectious diseases in the USA. We discuss vaccine-preventable diseases and the substantial successes and persistent challenges in their control; health-care-associated infections (HAIs), a leading preventable cause of death; emerging zoonotic and vector-borne diseases and their spread across a globalised world; foodborne infections, increasingly linked to new sources of contamination; and the intersecting epidemics of HIV, sexually transmitted infections (STIs), chronic viral hepatitis, and tuberculosis. Antimicrobial-resistant pathogens, several of which have become or are becoming resistant to all available drugs, are intensifying these threats. In addition to their eff ect \u2022 Despite major advances towards their control, infectious diseases continue to present substantial challenges to health and health-care resources in the USA \u2022 Priority actions to meet these challenges include addressing high-burden diseases such as HIV and chronic hepatitis, foodborne diseases, and health-care-associ ated infections; targeting outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases; and controlling endemic and emerging vector-borne and zoonotic infections \u2022 Antimicrobial resistance has become a global health crisis that demands new multidisciplinary approaches and collaborations across local, state, regional, national, and international levels \u2022 Rapidly evolving molecular technologies and increases in microbial understanding off er new opportunities for treatment, prevention, and control of infectious diseases \u2022 Ongoing enhancements in communication capacities, including social media, are bringing new techniques to monitor infectious diseases and rapidly share prevention information on human health, these diseases cause substantial health-care, workplace, and other societal costs. We discuss priority actions needed to meet these challenges including modernisation of existing surveillance systems to better inform public health action; enhancement of public health laboratories to incorporate the latest molecular technologies for improved disease detection and outbreak response; and strengthening of the clinical and public health interface to facilitate information exchange and leverage changes in health care to improve prevention and control of infectious diseases.","A major obstacle to pandemic planning in Europe is the lack of a centralized planning organization and dependence on national governments to address public health issues. The first pandemic planning meeting of European Union members included policy makers, scientists, and industry in Brussels, Belgium in November 2001. Since then, an EU draft pandemic plan, with guidance from the WHO's draft guidelines and those prepared by the CDC, has been produced and is currently circulating for discussion. In addition, the IVS Taskforce was developed and has two important subcommittees: the Policy, Practice, and Communications committee and the Science, Production, and Regulations (SPR) committee. The SPR committee has developed goals of creating high-yield seeds through production of influenza virus libraries, with the help of MedImmune, CDC, and European FluPlan partners, and enhancement of reverse genetics technology. The SPR is also working to enhance reagent availability, speed regulatory clearance of future vaccines and antivirals, and to collect clinical data on the safety, necessary antigen concentrations, most appropriate adjuvants and dose schedule, and immunogenicity of candidate vaccines.","Considering the traffic limits and quarantine measures in many areas, online mental health services have been widely adopted, such as hotlines and mobile application platforms. For example, the Psychological Rescue Branch of Chinese Association for Disaster and Emergency Rescue Medicine developed the 'National Crisis Intervention Platform for New Coronavirus Pneumonia' at the Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University on the 31th January, 2020 32. The 'Supporting System of Strengthening Lung and Mental Health' has also been established by the Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University. This system provides online consulting services and assigned crisis response teams to provide mental health education for both patients and frontline medical staff 33. The University of Macau established a team of psychological professionals who assisted the Social Work Bureau to provide psychological counseling via hotline, WeChat, and video for isolated persons 34. In addition, psychologists and psychiatrists provide individual counseling on ePlatforms (e.g., Alihealth and HaoDaiFu) and adopt strategies to relieve stress via social media (e.g., Weibo and WeChat) 14, 35. In order to effectively supervise online psychological crisis intervention, the NHC released the 'Notices on Establishing Psychological Assistance Hotlines for COVID-19 Outbreak' on the 2th February, 2020 36, and the Bureau of Disease Prevention and Control released the 'Guidelines for Psychological Assistance Hotlines during the New Coronavirus Pneumonia Outbreak' on the 7th February, 2020 37. The guidelines addressed that the hotline services should be set up by psychiatric institutions, students' mental health education and counseling centers at universities, mental health associations and academic societies. The qualifications and responsibilities of the consultants and the supervisors in the hotline services have also been stipulated. Moreover, the Chinese Psychological Society published the 'Work Guideline for Psychological Assistance Hotline during the COVID-19 Outbreak' 38 and the 'Guidelines for Internet Psychological Counseling during Special Epidemic Period' 39 to provide professional assistance for online psychological services (Table 1). Apart from online mental health services, hundreds of psychologists and psychiatrists, alongside with the emergency rescue team went to Wuhan, China 40, 41 to provide on-site psychological counseling and professional guidance.","An important resolution of the Chinese government was to improve its disease surveillance system to rapidly identify newly emerging infectious diseases and to minimize their spread in China and to the rest of the world. The traditional surveillance network using reporting cards filled out by hand and sent by mail or fax has been replaced with an automatic information system called the China Information System for Disease Control and Prevention, which is the world's largest internet-based disease reporting system. 12 The government has also increased their investment in enhancing the capabilities of detecting, diagnosing, preventing, and controlling newly emerging infectious diseases at various levels. New and innovative strategies have been established for response to health emergencies, such as the establishment of the parallel laboratory confirmation mechanism for newly emerging infectious pathogens to reduce the risk of errors, rapid disclosure of information to the WHO and to the public, international information exchange and collaboration, and the provision of more information on public health and on infectious diseases to the public. Furthermore, the Chinese government has strengthened both the related aspects of the legal system and the disease prevention and control system. For example, the government issued the Law of the People's Republic of China on Prevention and Treatment of Infectious Diseases (Revised Draft) in 2004 and Regulations on Preparedness for and Response to Emergent Public Health Hazards in 2003, created the Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention, and improved surveillance systems of infectious diseases and preparedness and response capacity for emerging public health events. [28] [29] [30] Education and training projects, such as training courses for public health officials and HCWs, have been initiated, and new training has been added to the education programs of universities. Funds for research projects on the development of vaccines, drugs, and diagnostic techniques have been granted to develop new approaches in the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of emerging infectious diseases.","Antimicrobial susceptibility of pneumococcal isolates causing bacteraemic community-acquired pneumonia in the public and private sectors in Gauteng, South Africa Objectives: Contradictory and very high rates of pneumococcal resistance have been reported previously from different surveillance studies conducted in South Africa. The aim of this study was to review susceptibility data of isolates from adult patients presenting with bacteremic pneumococcal communityacquired pneumonia (CAP), comparing cases in the public and private sectors in Gauteng, South Africa. Methods: We wished to recruit 100 consecutive adult patients with pneumococcal bacteraemia and CAP. Patients without radiographic evidence of pneumonia, or with other clinical diagnoses (e.g. meningitis) were excluded. Repeat isolates were excluded. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was done according to CLSI guidelines, using disc screening and MIC determination with agar dilution and E-tests. Results: 149 cases were recruited, 97 in the public and 52 in the private sector. Public sector patients were younger (median age 33 years vs. 45 years; p &lt; 0.001), with more HIV infection and less co-morbid illness. Cases in the private sector were more likely to have received antibiotics in the past 3 months. The overall rate of antimicrobial resistance was considerably lower than reported previously in South Africa. Resistance to penicillin was 16% in the public and 23% in the private sector (not significantly different). There were also no significant differences in the susceptibility of the isolates to ceftriaxone, chloramphenicol, tetracycline, rifampicin or ofloxacin. However significantly more resistance was seen in the private sector isolates to erythromycin (28% vs. 4%; P &lt; 0.001) and clindamycin (21% vs. 3%; p = 0.001). Conclusion: A number of clinical differences were seen in public vs. private sector patients with bacteraemic pneumococcal pneumonia in Gauteng, South Africa. Rates of antibiotic resistance were much lower than previously reported from South Africa. The only differences noted were higher rates of resistance to erythromycin and clindamycin in the private sector (possible erm gene mutation as mechanism of macrolide resistance).","Measures to control the spread of COVID-19 are similar to the general advice for preventing any respiratory viral illness. At the national and international level, travel restrictions have been implemented for regions with the highest COVID-19 incidence currently, but these recommendations and polices are likely to rapidly change and warrant close monitoring. Patients with potential symptoms of COVID-19 with recent travel to areas of higher incidence (China, South Korea, Japan, Iran, and Italy based on the most recent CDC data) should be asked to wear a standard surgical mask as soon as they are identified and be placed in a private room with the door closed, ideally an airborne isolation room (negative-pressure room). 3, 7 It is important to note that travel history criteria for testing for COVID-19 will change as community-based spread is emerging within the United States and patients living in or with recent travel to areas where COVID-19 has been confirmed should be considered for testing as well. Any concern for possible COVID-19 should immediately prompt notification of institutional infection prevention and control as well as local or state health departments. Healthcare personnel entering the room should use standard precautions, contact precautions (gown and gloves), airborne precautions (with N95 respirator), and eye protection (goggles or a face shield). Testing has been performed at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) but is now more widely available in state and city laboratories and is becoming available commercially. It is important that more common respiratory illnesses (influenza, etc.) are also ruled out. What should we tell our patients based on our current knowledge? First, this is a rapidly evolving area with new information emerging on a daily basis. Therefore periodically checking on recommendations from leading national and international health organizations, such as the CDC or the World Health Organization (WHO), is the most important way for both patients and physicians to stay informed with accurate information. Second, it is important to realize that the majority of cases (80+%) have been mild, the fatality rate for COVID-19 is lower than prior coronavirus outbreaks, and the proportion of severe/fatal cases may be an overestimate as milder or asymptomatic cases are likely under-reported. 15 Third, there are currently no specific recommendations for people on immunosuppression, such as IBD patients. Prior IBD research has found that viral infections are more likely among patients on immunomodulators (such as 6-mercaptopurine and azathioprine) than those on biologics but it is unclear if this can be extended to COVID-19. 16 There are no data currently about the impact of immunosuppressive agents, although one of the largest case series from China did note that 2 patients with immunodeficiency (not further specified) had non-severe disease. 8 17 Last, the best measures to decrease the risk of contracting SARS-CoV-2 are the same as standard practices against any viral illness. These include good hand hygiene with alcohol-based hand sanitizers or soap and water, covering your mouth and nose with a tissue or your sleeve (not your hands) when coughing or sneezing, limiting touching your face, avoiding close contact with anyone with influenza-like and/or upper respiratory symptoms, and staying home if you are sick.","Case reports for use in surveillance can be collected in an active or a passive manner. Active surveillance involves a regular, systematic effort to contact reporting sources or to review records within an institution to ascertain information on the occurrence of newly diagnosed diseases or infections. An example of an active surveillance system for foodborne illnesses is FoodNet, which operates as part of CDC's Emerging Infections Program. 56 Active laboratory-based surveillance for confirmed cases of Campylobacter, Cryptosporidium, Cyclospora, E. coli O157:H7, Listeria, Salmonella, Shigella, and Vibrio increased from five sites, covering 5% of the U.S. population in 1996 to 10 sites covering approximately 15% of the population in 2007. Each clinical laboratory in the surveillance catchment areas is contacted weekly or monthly to ensure that all confirmed infections under surveillance have been reported. These data have been extremely useful in establishing national estimates for the burden of foodborne illness in the United States and for monitoring trends in the incidence of specific foodborne agents. Passive surveillance relies on the individual clinician or laboratory to initiate the report. For many diseases of public health importance, passive surveillance can be almost as comprehensive as active surveillance. Although surveillance systems are labeled as active or passive based on how cases are reported, all surveillance systems require an active review and analysis of reported cases, with dissemination of results to key stakeholders. 44 Two key qualities of community-based surveillance for infectious diseases that must be considered when interpreting surveillance data are representativeness and timeliness. These qualities vary by disease and depend on multiple factors. The first factor of importance is that the patient must seek medical attention. It is not common for persons with mild or limited illnesses to seek medical attention. Second, the physician must seek laboratory testing of appropriate clinical specimens to confirm the diagnosis. Third, the laboratory must have the capability to identify the agent. Fourth, the physician and laboratory must report the clinical and laboratory findings to public health officials in a timely manner. Fifth, the availability of molecular subtyping techniques such as PFGE and the ability to compare PFGE patterns electronically through the national computer network PulseNet can greatly increase both the sensitivity and the specificity of pathogenspecific surveillance. Even in states where laboratory-based infectious disease reporting is required, there may be confusion among physicians and laboratory officials regarding who has the responsibility for reporting. Finally, public health agencies must have the resources to conduct timely and routine follow-up of such reports, to ascertain basic case demographic and other relevant data. Failure at any step of this process results in loss of information to the community-based surveillance system.","Because this situation is changing rapidly and advice may change, all organizations should have a person(s) assigned to actively review information and guidance as it becomes available and evaluate the need to modify current practices and communications within their organization. Organizations are also encouraged to review their internal and external communication systems to ensure that those responsible know how to contact their local health authority during the day or night in the event of a suspected case. This is also a good time to remind everyone of the routine practices that will decrease the risk of transmission of any infectious agent. These should be in place regardless of any new identified infectious threat.","The SARS epidemic provided valuable experience and lessons with regard to controlling outbreaks of newly emerging infectious diseases, which are surely due to come. Human infection with avian influenza viruses, the novel A influenza (H1N1), and imported infectious diseases such as the Zika virus disease and yellow fever disease are already knocking at our doors! Important lessons learned in China included the need for more honesty and transparency, improvement of surveillance, better laboratory facilities, and optimized case management. 27 Also, public health measures to control infectious diseases, reporting systems, and central guidance and coordination came under scrutiny. Another lesson was the need to inform the public about, and involve them in, control measures in an adequate and timely manner. There was a strong realization that the best defense against any threat of newly emerging infectious diseases is a robust public health system in its science, capacity, and practice, and through collaboration with clinical and veterinary medicine, academia, industry, and other public and private partners.","In this new age of heightened concern about terrorist attacks, the possibility of intentional attacks in the United States using biologic weapons has been of increased concern recently, particularly after the anthrax attacks of 2001 [31] . The Working Group on Civilian Biodefense, which is an expert panel composed of representatives from academic, government, military, public health, and emergency management agencies and institutions, has identified a limited number of biologic agents that are of particular concern. These include anthrax, smallpox, botulism, tularemia, plague, and the viral hemorrhagic fevers [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] . Physicians and public health officials have been developing strategies for how to respond to potential bioterrorist attacks, including identifying that an attack has occurred, prophylaxing those exposed, diagnosing and treating cases, and implementing containment measures to minimize the number of people exposed. It is critical that these comprehensive response plans include specific guidance for pregnant women, so that pregnant women who are exposed or who are cases can be treated appropriately. For some of these bioterrorist agents, such as smallpox, we have some information about infection in pregnancy; however, for many of these potential bioterrorist agents there is limited information about these infections in pregnancy.","Member States have defined common objectives emanating from the Lisbon Strategy as well as monitoring indicators and analytical tools through the Progress Program to improve the capabilities of comparative analysis, knowledge transfer, mutual learning, better coordination, and strategic planning. The directions of the OMC for social protection and the basic indicators of an ongoing pan-European research should be expanded and revised regularly as for example, the indicators of material deprivation (digital exclusion), of affluent households, life expectancy, and the transition from work to retirement. 18 The directions of the OMC as an intergovernmental cooperation method on accessible, quality and sustainable health-care, and long-term care, focus on the following: l Access for all to adequate health-care and long-term care, ensuring that the need for care does not lead to poverty and financial dependency while at the same time addressing inequalities related to access to care and the results of health services. l Quality in health-care and long-term health care and adjustment, including preventive care, to the changing needs and preferences of society and individuals, primarily through the development of quality standards that meet international best practices and through the development of a higher sense of responsibility among health professionals and patients and recipients of care. l Sustainability of adequate and quality health-care and long-term care through the rational use of resources and mainly through appropriate incentives for users and providers, good governance and coordination between care systems and public and private entities. Long-term sustainability and quality also require the promotion of a healthy and active lifestyle as well as the existence of good human resources for the health-care sector.","To achieve higher efficacy of the public health interventions, efforts from individuals should not be neglected. In light of no available specific vaccines and treatments for such novel coronavirus thus far, a range of precautionary behaviours between individuals at homes and in communities are essential and vital to obtain proper control of the spreads in public and likely preventing superspreading events. Personal prevention strategies for seasonal influenza and other viral infections are still applicable during the present outbreak, inclusive of restricting ill residents from common activities, excluding symptomatic persons from entering homes/facilities, limiting visit especially of wet markets, live poultry markets or farms. Maintaining personal hygiene (e.g., frequently performing hand hygiene, washing hands with soap and water) and cough etiquette (e.g., covering nose and mouth when coughing, correctly disposing wasted tissues after coughing) are also beneficial. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.01.27.922443 doi: bioRxiv preprint Amongst these preventive practices, facemask wear appears to be the most operationalised and thus effective since it is observable from other members of the public. A recent cluster randomised controlled trial [16] , consisting of multiple region-varying medical settings, showed both N95 respirators and medical masks can effectively prevent influenza and other viral respiratory infections. Apart from facemask wear being required in public of the epicentre city in Hubei province, it has also been mandated by the Guangdong provincial government that facemasks should be worn in public with effect from 26 th January, four days after the implementation in Wuhan. The Centre for Disease Control and Prevention, the United States, also emphasised the importance of wearing a facemask at all times when staying with infected individuals in shared spaces as one of precautions for large-scale spreads in community, specified in their interim guidance for prevention for 2019-nCoV from spreading in home and communities [17] . All these are extremely important in raising awareness in the public as to personal preventive steps given the present situation (mild or subclinical symptoms observed in many cases and observed long incubation period).","Third, National Action Plans for Health Security (NAPHS) need to be implemented. NAPHS outline national priorities for strengthening IHR core capacities and are central to collective efforts for health security. 17 EMR countries have developed NAPHS. Accelerating implementation is a major priority for 2020, focusing on surveillance, laboratories, preparedness, EOCs, risk communications, and rapid response teams.","The development of safe and effective vaccines to protect against global infectious diseases (e.g., tuberculosis, malaria, HIV/ AIDS), enteric diseases, and other neglected diseases of the developing world is of critical public health importance. Development and availability of such vaccines, particularly for use in the developing countries most affected by these diseases, will benefit U.S. and global health. In 2011, the FDA published a revised guidance document to assist sponsors in developing vaccines targeted against infectious diseases or conditions endemic in areas outside the United States. The FDAAA of 2007 revised the FD&amp;C Act by adding Section 524, recognizing the importance of having products to treat and prevent tropical diseases that disproportionately affect poor and marginalized populations and for which there is no significant market in developed nations. Under Section 524, the Agency can grant priority review of applications under Section 505(b)(1) of the FD&amp;C Act or Section 351 of the PHS Act for the treatment and prevention of specified tropical diseases, including tuberculosis, malaria, cholera, and \"any other infectious disease for which there is no significant market in developed nations and that disproportionately affects poor and marginalized populations, designated by regulation by the Secretary.\" Consequently, this guidance provides general recommendations for regulatory pathways to use in the development of vaccines to protect against global infectious diseases for U.S. licensure and clarifies applicable regulations: (a) the FDA can license vaccines to protect against infectious diseases or conditions that are not endemic or have not been reported to occur in the United States; (b) the regulatory pathways to U.S. licensure for the development of vaccines to protect against infectious diseases that are not endemic or have not been reported to occur in the United States are the same as for vaccines to protect against diseases that are endemic in the United States; (c) a sponsor may submit data from clinical trials conducted outside the United States to support product licensure, (d) noting that the accelerated approval regulations may be used in appropriate cases; and (e) that when pivotal studies are conducted outside the United States, in some instances, it may not be necessary to conduct studies in the United States. This guidance also responded to the congressional mandate in Section 740 of the fiscal year 2010 Appropriation Act (Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2010, Public Law 111-80) by requiring the FDA to make recommendations on appropriate preclinical, trial design, and regulatory paradigms to prevent, diagnose, and treat rare diseases and neglected diseases.","On 5 June 2013, the Obama administration designated MERS-CoV a threat to public health and national security and gave officials the authority to fast-track the approval of tests and treatments for MERS-CoV [12] . Dr. Kathleen Sebelius, the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services of the United States, made the designation, allowing the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to quickly approve products after accepting an \"emergency use application (EUA)\" [13] .","Economic Statecraft and Asymmetrical Interdependence. China is not the first great power to resort to economic statecraft and societal penetration in pursuing national ambition. At the end of World War II, the political economist Albert O. Hirschman published National Power and the Structure of Foreign Trade, analyzing how foreign trade could be used as an instrument of national power. The theme of Hirshman's book is Nazi Germany's strategy to expand its trade and political influence during the 1930s. Hirschman pointed out that the gain from \"seemingly harmless\" trade relations can result in the dependence of the country that receives the traded goods. Prior to World War II, Nazi Germany had already launched \"bloodless invasions,\" using economic carrots to penetrate the political systems and societies of Hungary, Bulgaria, Romania, and others. Nazi Germany's economic practices, including the export of capital, personnel, and enterprises, had created a dense network of interests and customers with the result of rendering Eastern and Southeastern Europe subservient to Nazi Germany. 5 Although Hirschman was writing against the backdrop of Nazi Germany's economic aggression, his work has a broader implication for international relations today. Hirschman elucidated that trade relations, or economic interdependence broadly defined, could be used as a means of political pressure and leverage because economic interdependence is usually asymmetrical, suggesting that in such an economic relationship one state is more dependent on the other. And political power and dominion arises out of the asymmetry. In international relations, power is the crucial \"currency\" of great power politics, and states compete for it among themselves. 6 Therefore, great powers constantly pursue asymmetrical economic relationships in order to create dependence and political dominance. David Baldwin, senior political scientist in the Woodrow Wilson School at Princeton, refers to such pursuit of power through economic means as economic statecraft, defined as influence attempts relying on resources which have a reasonable semblance of a market price in terms of money. Economic statecraft, Baldwin contends, has been practiced for centuries.","Evidence from the 1918 influenza pandemic underscores the stakes for elected officials. In that earlier natural experiment, American cities faced similar decisions regarding social distancing policies. For example, Philadelphia decided to hold a parade welcoming soldiers returning from World War I, while St. Louis cancelled its parade, and ultimately experienced one eighth as many deaths per capita during that wave of influenza. The height of the infection in Saint Louis was two months later than in Philadelphia, and was far lower, with deaths peaking at fifty per hundred thousand rather than 250 per hundred thousand.(11; 12) Shortly after community transmission of the coronavirus was discovered in Washington and California in late February 2020, public health experts drew the comparison between Philadelphia and Saint Louis, hoping to inspire policymakers to promote social distancing. Nevertheless, in an echo of the decisions made a century before, there are significant differences in the timing of governors' decisions to mandate social distancing. For instance, on 6 March 2020, after Kentucky had its first confirmed case of COVID-19, Governor Andy Beshear (D) immediately called a state of emergency, encouraged social distancing, and closed bars and restaurants ten days later. But when neighboring Tennesse uncovered its first confirmed case of COVID-19 on March 5th, Governor Bill Lee (R) waited until 12 March to declare a state of emergency and finally closed restaurants and bars on 22 March. (13) Why did governors' responses to a sudden, shared threat differ? Under normal circumstances, governors' policy decisions are shaped by the national leaders and agenda of their political party and the demands of their own constituents, particularly those in their partisan base. Governors may also look to innovative peers and neighbors for examples to follow. But the fast-moving nature of the coronavirus threat, the need to rely on experts to understand complex scientific material, and uncertainty about the nature and scope of the threat might scramble all or some of these usual motivations. pandemic politics \u00b7 Adolph, Amano, Bang-Jensen, Fullman &amp; Wilkerson The public health case for mandatory social distancing in the United States developed quickly in the wake of the first reports of community transmission on 26 February in Washington state. One might expect social distancing measures to quickly follow across the fifty states, perhaps more quickly in states with greater number of confirmed cases. But mandating social distancing is a difficult decision for any political leader. If these measures are successful in preventing widespread mortality, many members of the public who suffered the costs of these mandates may never fully comprehend the benefits. Indeed, the more successful the intervention, the more likely it will appear to many as an \"overreaction.\" Moreover, some states faced higher potential costs from these policies: closing schools is more painful in states where more children depend on schools for subsidized lunches and shutting restaurants and public places is more difficult in states highly dependent on tourism. (14) More generally, states with more limited economic resources are likely far less able to weather the deprivations caused by economic shutdowns, or to expand social insurance protections during mandated social distancing, and thus may be considerably more reluctant to take these steps.","In concert with novel emerging infectious diseases, the communication landscape itself has also changed radically. We now live in an era of real-time electronic communications; consequently, approaches to surveillance are being transformed. Data sources, information messengers, mechanisms of data and information transfer and audiences are all changing. Instant and global transmission of information has become a powerful ally, along with peer pressure, for WHO in ensuring that member states comply with new obligations to swiftly declare outbreaks considered to be of public health importance. There is now significant global attention and accompanying investment which should, the authors suggest, be used as an opportunity to improve strategic and operational communication capacity to respond not only to pandemic influenza but also to other public health threats.","The novel coronavirus (COVID-2019) has spread very rapidly all over China and several other countries, causing an outbreak of acute infectious pneumonia (Bao et al., 2020) . According to the official website of the National Health Commission of China, there were 49824 confirmed cases (including 9915 severe cases) and 3434 suspected cases of COVID-19 in China as of 23 February 2020 (National Health Council, 2020) . This large scale, infectious, public health event, imposed enormous pressure on the Chinese government, medical and healthcare providers, and the general public (Pan et al., 2020; . Thirty-one provinces in China initiated a Level-1 public health response (Deng et al., 2020) . The epidemic brought not only the risk of death from the viral infection but also unbearable psychological pressure to people in China and the rest of the world (Xiao, 2020; Duan, 2020) . The continuous spread of the epidemic, strict isolation measures and delays in starting schools, colleges, and universities across the country is expected to influence the mental health of college students. There have been reports on the psychological impact of the epidemic on the general public, patients, medical staff, children, and older adults Yang et al., 2020; Li et al., 2020) . However, no detailed study on the mental health status of college students facing the epidemic has been conducted to date.","The second building block is financing. Before the decree, central government adopted a series of financial measures to support the health system and protect businesses. It had allocated \u20ac2800 million to all regions for health services and created a new fund with \u20ac1000 million for priority health interventions. 4 However, these amounts need to be seen against the background of almost a decade of austerity from which the health system has yet to recover. 5 Third, in service delivery, the national Ministry of Health has developed a set of clinical protocols, published on its website. Additional advice is published by certain regions and updated, in some cases, on a daily basis. 6 Health facilities in the worst affected regions are struggling, with inadequate intensive care capacity and an insufficient number of ventilators in particular. Both Catalonia and Madrid 7 have cancelled non-emergency surgery and cleared beds where possible. COVID-19 telephone help lines have long delays or have simply collapsed in some regions. The new decree allows the regions to take over management of private health services while military installations will be used for public health purposes.","Health officials in China exhibited a much higher degree of transparency early in this outbreak and were quicker to notify the WHO after they discovered the cluster of pneumonia of unknown origin. The identification of the aetiological virus occurred promptly in early January, and the full genome sequence data were shared on the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data platform. 8 The update International Health Regulations (2005) was signed 2 yr after the SARS outbreak by 194 member states, with legal binding on the protection of all people of the world from international spread of disease. 17 Global surveillance and alerting systems developed since SARS enabled rapid dissemination of information on the emerging outbreak. Public health officials and the WHO have held numerous press conferences to inform the public on important developments. Scientific papers have been published with rapid peer review to share the clinical and epidemiological characteristics of the virus within the medical community.","Given the increasing costs associated with vaccination and the increasing number of vaccine doses, financing for this service has taken on greater importance. Currently, U.S. vaccine financing is a joint responsibility shared by the private and public sectors. As of 2002, more than one-half of the vaccines recommended for children were purchased through federal contract, 45 whereas vaccines for adults typically are covered by private insurance. Private health plans often have insurance coverage for vaccines. However, some children enrolled in private health plans do not have coverage for vaccines and are considered underinsured for immunization. 46 Finally, some studies have shown that health care provid-ers have concerns regarding the costs of purchasing and administering vaccines and their level of reimbursement from public and private insurers. 47 Providers must order and purchase many vaccines (e.g., influenza) months before they are administered, resulting in substantial capital outlay coupled with delayed reimbursement. 47 Recently, Freed et al. 48 conducted a survey exploring physicians' perspectives on reimbursement for childhood immunizations. Approximately one-half of the study respondents reported financial reasons and low profit margins from immunizations as factors affecting their purchase and administration of vaccines. These authors concluded that physicians who provide vaccines to children and adolescents are dissatisfied with third-party reimbursement levels and the increasing financial strain on their practices from immunizations. Thus, increasing vaccine prices, a greater number of vaccine doses, and declining provider reimbursement for these products appear to be factors constraining both patient and provider demand for these products.","An outbreak of a novel strain of coronavirus, now called COVID-19, presents an ongoing health threat across the globe. At the time of this writing (February 27, 2020), the initial epidemic in China is threatening to transform into a pandemic, with a surge of cases in Japan, South Korea, Italy, and Iran. Through terrific work by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and public health officials across the country, we have been able to limit the number of cases in the United States. But if COVID-19 expands worldwide, it seems inevitable that at least some hospitals in the United States will see a surge of patients with the virus.","CBER has issued a guidance document intended to facilitate consistency and efficiency of review of cell therapy products, including stem cells. 4 This document is based on current best review practices and can be consulted by IND sponsors to gain a thorough perspective on the types and organization of information that CBER reviewers are looking for during review of a cell therapy IND. The document is entitled \"Draft Guidance for Reviewers: Instructions and Template for Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Control (CMC) Reviewers of Human Somatic Cell Therapy Investigational New Drug Applications (INDs)\" and is available for public examination and comment. Another guidance document \"Guidance for Industry: Guidance for Human Somatic Cell Therapy and Gene Therapy\" discusses many scientific issues relevant to stem cell therapies. 5","The promotion of ''risk instruments'' and a ''risk-based regulation'' approach makes it possible to deal with risk-creating events. For the last two decades, in a context of decreasing means and in reaction to public-health crises which have led, according to some, to an overprotective state, a new tendency has emerged of governments using ''risk instruments'' to better allocate means and to decrease the State's hold. Despite their differences, these two approaches are to the same end, which is to define -or perpetually re-define -the limits of the State. ''Risk instruments'' contribute in each ''putting at risk'' situation to determining the State's involvement, the reason for its having competencies and resources, and therefore also the State's limits as opposed to that which concerns the private sector and individuals. The outcome of this defining as ''putting at risk'' and of the application of these risk instruments may be used by the State either to invest, or to disinvest; in the latter case for example entrusting risk management which formerly would have been the realm of institutions to local or private agents or to individuals.","Beyond IBD, we are in the process of helping leaders across specialties to leverage this registry blueprint in other disease states. Within the field of gastroenterology, we have worked with cirrhosis and liver transplantation (www.covidcirrhosis.org), eosinophilic GI disease, and celiac disease groups to leverage the SECURE-IBD framework. 5 Outside of gastroenterology, we have supported investigators and organizations studying related immune-mediated diseases (psoriasis, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)) and hematological conditions including sickle cell disease, hematological and solid malignancies.
