To distinguish bacterial from viral sinusitisa challenging, yet important, distinction because management varies-a person must have persistence of symptoms for longer than 7 to 10 days. A common finding when bacterial infection develops in the setting of viral sinusitis is a report of two phases with improvement in between-a ''double sickening'' sign. A change in color of nasal discharge from clear/yellow to greenish also is an indicator of progression to bacterial sinusitis. Transillumination of the sinuses and plain radiographs of the sinuses may help to confirm sinusitis, but they cannot distinguish between viral and bacterial sinusitis [12] . CT or MRI should be reserved for evaluation of complicated sinus cases.","Lower respiratory specimens (e.g., sputum) appear to have a higher viral load than that of upper respiratory specimens (e.g., throat swab)9. Viral RNA was also detected in blood and stool specimens11,12, but it is not known whether these non-respiratory samples are infectious or not. Given that fecal samples from patients with SARS were infectious in some instances (e.g., the Amoy Gardens incident in Hong Kong), precautions against fecal\u2013oral transmission are advisable.","Heparin, the second most widely used drug by weight globally, is formulated as a polydisperse, heterogenous natural product. Unfractionated heparin, low molecular weight heparins and heparinoids are clinically approved as anticoagulants / thrombotic with excellent safety, stability, bioavailability and pharmacokinetic profiles. Crucially, heparin and its derivatives, some of which lacking significant anticoagulant activity 1 , are an under-exploited antiviral drug class, despite possessing broad-spectrum activity against a multitude of distinct viruses, including coronaviridae and SARSassociated coronavirus strain HSR1 2 , in addition to flaviviruses 3, 4 , herpes 5 , influenza 6 and HIV 7, 8 .","In terms of vaccine manufacturing, each viral system requires different cellular systems for high yield propagation, necessitating different manufacturing facilities for each viral vector platform. As viruses may undergo recombination during production, great care must be taken to keep cell cultures free of material that can lead to the emergence of recombined and uncharacterized pathogens (51). In general, the presence of adventitious agents, i.e., microorganisms that may have been unintentionally introduced into the manufacturing process, needs to be assessed vigorously during vaccine manufacturing (52). Since production of viral vector based vaccines is a complex process that often requires a multitude of components of human or animal origin, such as cell substrates, porcine trypsin or bovine serum, the need to exclude contaminants requires extensive testing during various steps of the manufacturing process. Indeed, several examples for contaminants in viral vaccines, such as porcine circovirus contaminations in rotavirus vaccines, have highlighted the reality of this risk (53). These factors make production of viral vector based vaccines a highly complex and comparatively cost-intensive process. If the viral vector is derived from a virus able to infect humans, the effect of pre-existing immunity on vector immunogenicity has to be addressed. Depending on the vector, this effect may or may not hamper immune responses, as was the case for Ad5 and MV vectors, respectively (see above). Dampening of immune responses by pre-existing immunity may necessitate time and cost intensive screening procedures before clinical trials and compromise the use of a given vector for further indications in the same vaccinee.","One of the most unforgettable lessons learnt from the SARS outbreak was that wearing a mask could offer protection against SARS and other viral infections alike. 24 According to the WHO, wearing a surgical mask, in combination with hand hygiene and other preventative measures, is one of the prevention measures to limit the spread of 2019-nCoV in affected areas. 25 More importantly, stable accessibility of this protective gear was considered a key to stability in the society. This posed another vulnerability for the city as the supply of surgical mask totally relied on external sources. On this matter, community pharmacists in Macau were positioned to do three things: (1) help consumers differentiate surgical masks from other types of face masks not made for protection against virus transmission; (2) control the price of surgical masks within reasonable price range; and (3) help implement \"The Guaranteed Mask Supply for Macao Residents Scheme\" in response to the new government policy.","MHV persistence may involve genome stability and result in a distinct evolutionary dynamic. Asymptomatic persisting infections in a Lewis rat, for example, showed no variation in MHV S gene sequence, and no quasispecies as seen in brain infections ( Stuhler et al. , 1997 ) . The need to establish stable persistence could then be providing a strong selection for increased genome complexity and stability and might better explain the selection for the enhanced RNA polymerase fi delity in nidoviruses. How might such selection operate in natural populations? Evolutionary biologists often consider what might differentiate one group from another very similar group in a way that leads to two isolated and distinct populations.","For PUIs, specimens were collected and sent to CDC for testing. Specimens included upper (nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs) and lower respiratory specimens (sputum) if spontaneously produced. For patients with COVID-19, nasopharyngeal, oropharyngeal, serum, sputum, urine, and stool specimens were collected and sent to CDC for testing at initial presentation, and then 10 Criteria were based on published MERS-CoV guidance and additional input from CDC subject matter experts. Close contact was defined as being within approximately 6 feet or within the room or care area of a confirmed COVID-19 case (including sharing a health-care waiting area or room), or being in a shared air space vacated by a confirmed case within the previous 2 h. Transient interactions, such as walking by confirmed case, were not considered close contact. Of note, nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal specimen collection were not listed as aerosol-generating procedures in the CDC guidance, but were included as high-risk exposures in this investigation. \u00a7Risk categorisation was developed on Jan 31, 2020, before published guidance from CDC for COVID-19. 11 Criteria were based on published MERS-CoV guidance and additional input from CDC and state and local health officials. The medium-high-risk classification was included owing to the identification of some community contacts who did not meet the highest category of exposure risk but were nevertheless concerning. ","Experimental evaluation forces us to study fi tness by only those defi nitions that we can currently measure. As fi tness appears to be a relativistic and transient concept, depending very much on the tissue, time, place, extant adaptive and innate immunity, and competition, it is likely that we can only measure with any accuracy one aspect of fi tness at any one time. HIV infection of humans shows evidence of this in that the R5 virus is more fi t for transmission and early disease whereas the X4 virus is fi t later during the AIDS disease phase. Clearly conditional, time-dependent issues relate to fi tness defi nitions. However, much more problematic is that we have no theory for viral persistence or its fi tness. We lack specifi c or measurable parameters other than the simple maintenance of genetic material. Yet it seems clear that some distinguishing features of persistence can already be recognized. For example, the possible participation of viral defectives (normally considered unfi t), which in numerous circumstances can modify or mediate persistence, would need to be included. Clearly, a defective role in persistence would also preclude them from being considered as genetic \" junk, \" or selfish elements, since they would then matter in measurable ways to the biological outcome of virus persistent infection.","Results: A total of 158 strains of S. maltophilia were obtained from 22 outpatients (13.9%), 53 (33.5%) in the general wards, 83 (52.5%) in the intensive care units. In terms of gender, 91 of the patients were male (58%), the remaining 67 patients were female (42%). The sources of samples were sputum (N = 99, 62.7%), wound (N = 32, 20.2%), blood (N = 12, 8%), urine (N = 7, 4%); bile (N = 3, 1%)and other(N = 5, 3%). The resistance of Stenotrophomonas maltophilia isolates to Ceftazidime (CAZ), Levofloxacin (LVX), Sulfamethoxazole (SXT) were resistance rate was 77.8%, 25.9%, 19.6 respectively (Fig 1) .","Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is an enveloped, single-stranded RNA paramyxovirus that includes two major groups, A and B, each of which consists of 5 to 6 genotypes. The RSV genome encodes two nonstructural (NS1 and NS2) and nine structural proteins, including the F (fusion) and G (attachment) glycoproteins on the viral envelope. Antibodies against the F and G proteins are neutralizing, and have been shown to confer protection against RSV infection in animal models. Immunity after primary infection (which generally occurs by 2 years of age) is partial and short-lived; thus, reinfections can occur throughout life. 120 Low serum neutralizing antibody levels in adults predicts infection risk and disease severity. 121 Immunologic mechanisms (e.g. cytokine responses) have been implicated in the pathogenesis of severe RSV diseases; however, emerging evidence suggests that uncontrolled viral replication, as indicated by high respiratory tract viral load, drives disease manifestations and is associated with severe clinical outcomes. 120, [122] [123] [124] [125] Such findings provide an important rationale for the approach to antiviral drug development against RSV. 122 Epidemiology RSV is known to be an important cause of lower respiratory tract infection in infants and young children (e.g. acute bronchiolitis, wheezy attacks), resulting in hospitalizations and deaths. 126 In adults, it has been estimated that RSV infects 3-10% of the population Prevention There is no vaccine or chemoprophylaxis available for coronaviruses at present. 102 Droplet and contact precautions, including the use of face masks, are advisable to prevent transmission. As transmission could be opportunistically airborne, appropriate isolation precautions (in negative-pressure facilities if available) should be implemented in all hospitalized patients confirmed with novel coronavirus infections, particularly when respiratory procedures and devices are applied. [88] [89] [90] [91] Diagnostic Microbiology A high index of suspicion, together with detailed clinical and epidemiological assessments (e.g. travel history to affected areas, case clustering), is required for the diagnosis of novel coronavirus infections. 88, 103 RT-PCR is the diagnostic test of choice. A combination of upper respiratory (nasal, pharyngeal, nasopharyngeal), lower respiratory (higher yield due to higher viral levels, e.g. sputum, tracheal aspirate, bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) whenever available), blood and fecal samples, and repeated sampling should be considered to maximize the chance of virus detection. [103] [104] [105] A single negative test from an upper respiratory sample may be insufficient to rule out the diagnosis. For SARS-CoV, plasma RT-PCR can detect viremia as early as day 2-3 after symptom onset, and its level may have prognostic value. 88, 99 Virus culture (e.g. using Vero cells) is confirmatory, but the delay to a result prevents its use for clinical management; also biosafety level-3 facilities are required. Serological diagnosis is retrospective and largely used for epidemiological surveillance purposes. 103 Clinicians should refer to their local reference laboratories for coronavirus testing (e.g. pancoronavirus RT-PCR, specific SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV RT-PCR). 87, 91 Clinical Manifestations","As of this day, a multitude of clinical tests are available for detection of viruses, e.g., FISH, ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay), and PCR- and their numerous modifications. The latter has become a gold standard, for example, in cases of gastrointestinal [7] and respiratory infections [8]. Indeed, the presence of viral nucleic acids in biological media, particularly in blood plasma, while not definitive, is highly suspect of an ongoing infection, because it strongly implies viral replication. Furthermore, PCR not only enables us to detect pathogens, but also quantify them with great precision, based on the number of copies of a pathogen\u2019s DNA/RNA templates in a sample.","We analyzed a total of thirty-two COVID-19 patients admitted to Central Hospital of Xiangtan from January to February, 2020. Dynamic clinical samples including nasal swabs, blood, fecal, urine, saliva and tears were collected from each patient for surveillance. What's more, we recorded synchronous clinical and epidemiologic information with oral consent. Total RNA was extracted from clinical samples and we performed RT-PCR tests targeting SARS-CoV-2. The continuous variants were described by mean when they conform to Kolmogorov-Smirnov test.","It has been postulated that coronaviruses can be transmitted from contaminated dry surfaces including selfinoculation of mucous membranes of the nose, eyes or mouth [4, 5] . One ml of sputum has been described to contain approximately 10 8 viral copies [6] . In a recent review all E-mail address: guenter.kampf@uni-greifswald.de. available data on the persistence of coronaviruses on inanimate surfaces were summarized [7] . Most data were described with the endemic human coronavirus (HCoV) strain 229E which can remain infectious for 2 h -9 d on different types of materials. A higher temperature such as 30 C or 40 C is associated with a shorter persistence of highly pathogenic Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) coronavirus. Few comparative data obtained with SARS-CoV indicate that persistence was longer with higher inocula. In addition it was shown at room temperature that HCoV-229E persists better at 50% relative humidity compared to 30% [8] .","It has been postulated that coronaviruses can be transmitted from contaminated dry surfaces including selfinoculation of mucous membranes of the nose, eyes or mouth [4, 5] .

The culture sites of clinical specimens were more on sputum (110), urine (51), than blood (24) and wound (13). 3. The distribution of age was more above 60 year-old (80%) and male predominant (54%) was noted. 4. The outcome of our cohort was more on refer to medical center (59%), still admission (22%) than died (13%), discharge (6%). Conclusion: 1. More and more MDR pathogens were isolated from clinical specimens and morbidity and mortality were increasing in these elderly patients. 2. The curde mortality rate of our cohort was 13% and MRSA, CRAB were predominant (69%) between MDR pathogens. 3. Limitation of staff and equipment available, there were many patients refer to medical center (59%) and transfer back to long term care facility later. 4. Respiratory and urinary tract infection were two major sites of infection at our hospital, especial at these elderly patients. 5. Targeted group (elderly and long term care) was our focus of infection control and well antibiotic stewardship was needed.","Rhinoviruses (RVs) are nonenveloped single-strand RNA viruses that belong to the Picornaviridae family. The virus is most frequently associated with common cold. Rhinovirus plays a significant role in the pathogenesis of otitis media and asthma exacerbations [52, 53] . Current evidence indicates that viral, and not bacterial, infections are the most important respiratory illnesses that increase the severity of asthma [52] . The most significant risk factor for the development of preschool childhood wheezing is the occurrence of symptomatic rhinovirus illnesses during infancy, which are clinically and prognostically informative based on their seasonal nature [54] . RVs have proven to be the virus most often found in association with increased asthma severity [52] . With the use of sensitive RT-PCR methods, respiratory viruses are found in approximately 80% of wheezing episodes in children and in approximately one-half of such episodes in adults [53] . In one study, RV RNA was detectable in more than 40% of asthmatic children 6 weeks after an acute exacerbation [55] . Asthma exacerbations were more severe in patients with persistence of RV RNA, suggesting that the severity of acute asthma might be linked to prolonged and possibly more severe RV infections. Most cases of RV infection are mild and self-limited despite its high incidence and prevalence. Nasopharyngitis, croup, and pneumonia are occasionally caused by RV. RVs can be transmitted by aerosol or direct contact. The primary site of inoculation is the nasal mucosa. The conjunctiva may be involved to a lesser extent. RV attaches to respiratory epithelium and spreads locally. RV does not efficiently replicate at body temperature. The optimal temperature for RV replication is 33 to 35 C. This fact may explain why RV replicates well in the nasal passages and upper tracheobronchial tree, but less well in the lower respiratory tract. The incubation period is approximately 2 to 4 days [49] . RV is shed in large amounts, with as many as 1 million infectious virions present per milliliter of nasal washings, but viremia is uncommon. Viral shedding can occur a few days before cold symptoms are recognized by the patient, peaks on days 2 to 7 of the illness, and may last as long as 3 to 4 weeks. A local inflammatory response to the virus in the respiratory tract can lead to nasal discharge, nasal congestion, sneezing, and throat irritation."," Bed rest, strengthen supportive treatment, ensure sufficient energy; pay attention to water-electrolytes balance and maintain the stability of the internal environment; closely monitor vital signs and finger oxygen saturation, and so on.Monitor the blood routine, urine routine, C-reactive protein (CRP) and health indications (liver enzyme, myocardial enzyme, renal function, etc.), coagulation function, arterial blood gas analysis if necessary, and recheck chest imaging.According to the change of oxygen saturation, give effective oxygen therapy in time, including oxygen given by nasal catheter or mask. If necessary, apply high flow oxygen therapy via the nose, noninvasive or invasive mechanical ventilation, and so on.Antiviral treatment: no effective antiviral drug at present. Treat with IFN-\u03b1 aerosol inhalation (five million U per time for adults, two times per day), and/or Lopinavir/Ritonavir oral administration (two tablets per time, two times per day).Antibiotic treatment: avoid blind and improper use of antibiotics, especially the combination use of broad-spectrum antibiotics. Strengthen bacteriological monitoring. Antibiotics should be used in time in secondary bacterial infection. ","We detected one or more respiratory viruses in 41% of exacerbations. Viruses were more likely to be detected in sputum than in nasal fl uid, as has been reported previously. 21, 26 In a majority of cases, the a In addition, combinations of viruses were detected in fi ve exacerbations, two in which coronavirus was present in nasal fl uid and rhinovirus in sputum, one in which respiratory syncytial virus was present in nasal fl uid and human metapneumovirus in sputum, one in which adenovirus was present in nasal fl uid and human rhinovirus in sputum, and one in which adenovirus and coronavirus were both present in sputum . and seven sputum samples. Recruitment occurred in the fall, a period when rhinovirus is most common, 27 and we conclude that the positive participants had colds at the time. Exacerbations coinciding with RVIs took longer to resolve than those without RVIs, consistent with fi ndings in other studies, 26,28 but were no more severe based on Anthonisen scores.","The bacterial fl ora normally present in the mouth are potential etiologic agents in the development of pneumonia. A multitude of organisms (both gram-positive and gram-negative) that favor or require anaerobic conditions for growth are the major organisms composing mouth fl ora. The most common predisposing factor for anaerobic pneumonia is aspiration of secretions from the oropharynx into the tracheobronchial tree. Patients with impaired consciousness (e.g., as a result of coma, alcohol ingestion, or seizures) and those with diffi culty swallowing (e.g., as a result of diseases causing muscle weakness) are prone to aspirate and are at risk for pneumonia caused by anaerobic mouth organisms. In addition, patients with poor dentition or gum disease are more likely to develop aspiration pneumonia because of the larger burden of organisms in their oral cavity.","The bacterial flora normally present in the mouth are potential etiologic agents in the development of pneumonia.

In addition, patients with poor dentition or gum disease are more likely to develop aspiration pneumonia because of the larger burden of organisms in their oral cavity.","The elements of a risk assessment for the deliberate release of a GMO are: (i) an estimate of the probability of survival in competition with other components of the ecosystem; (ii) effective methods for monitoring persistence of the test organism in the ecosystem; (iii) methods for 'recall' of the test organism; and (iv) potential hazards to humans and the ecosystem if the test organism becomes established. Domsch et al. (1988) suggest that the assumption should be made, as a matter of principle, that an ecological disturbance will take place when a GMO is released and that proof is required that such effects will not occur. Colwell et al. (1988) point to serious gaps in our knowledge that must be plugged by research before we can confidently assess the impact of deliberate release. 'If the major ecological issues that arise from introduction of GEMs to the environment are reduced to their essential points, it can be concluded that the following represent information gaps, that is, areas of research needed: (i) detection and monitoring, (ii) horizontal transfer of the genetic information of the GEM, (iii) fate of the GEMs after release into the environment, e.g. survival and dispersion, and (iv) effects of GEMs on the environment. Subsidiary to these, but equally important, are containment and recovery, i.e. 'recall', if adverse effects occur after release of GEMs.'","Presumed bacterial Oral amoxicillin (90 mg/kg/day in 2 doses to a maximum of 4 g/day) or oral amoxicillin-clavulanate (amoxicillin component, 90 mg/kg/day in 2 doses to a maximum dose of 4000 mg/day); add macrolide if cannot distinguish bacterial or atypical Presumed atypical Oral azithromycin (10 mg/kg on day 1, followed by 5 mg/kg/day once daily on days 2-5 to a maximum of 500 mg on day 1, followed by 250 mg on days 2-5) or oral clarithromycin (15 mg/kg/day in 2 doses to a maximum of 1 g/day) or erythromycin or doxycycline for children &gt;7 yr old Continued classic 10-to 14-day duration of care is unsupported by evidence. 330 Recent data now indicate that clinical stability (defined as normalization of previously abnormal physiologic parameters, including heart rate, respiratory rate, oxygenation, blood pressure, mental state, and ability to care for oneself) occurs relatively quickly for patients hospitalized with CAP (see Table 69 -6). 331 Most physiologic abnormalities will correct in 2 to 3 days, and normalization of all physiologic abnormalities generally occurs in 5 to 7 days. Patients with more severe illness generally take longer to stabilize. The addition of monitoring for an at least 50% reduction in C-reactive protein has been suggested as an additional measure to define clinical stability but appeared beneficial only for patients with severe disease, and the cost-effectiveness of this approach has not been assessed. 332 Overall, once stability is achieved, clinical relapses serious enough to require ICU care occur less than 1% of the time. Oral antibiotic therapy is safe after clinical stability has been reached even in patients with severe CAP. [333] [334] [335] There is no clear usefulness of observing a patient within the hospital after a switch to oral therapy. 336 However, it is important to recognize that discharging patients before stability has been reached may lead to increased rehospitalization and death. 337, 338 Using the same definitions of clinical stability, it has been shown that the greater the number of factors remaining abnormal at discharge, the greater is the chance of readmission or death.","Coronaviruses are categorized based on the levels of oral-fecal and respiratory transmission, as indicated by protein intrinsic disorder predictions [50] . Based on these predictions, MERS-CoV has hard inner and outer shells that enable its persistence in the environment [50] . Thus, MERS-CoV is predicted to have the highest oral-fecal transmission rates and relatively low respiratory transmission rates [50] . In a patient with MERS-CoV, the virus was detected in stool samples obtained on days 12 and 16, with a viral load of up to 1031 RNA copies/g [15] . Patients with SARS commonly show high virus concentrations and prolonged virus excretion in stools, leading to the use of stool samples for routine virological diagnosis [51] [52] [53] . Diarrhea was reported to occur in patients with MERS-CoV [6, 8, 13 ]. An oral-fecal route of transmission of MERS-CoV was not documented in the clinical setting. MERS-CoV seems to be more stable at low temperatures and low humidity. MERS-CoV was recovered after 48 h at 208C and 40% relative humidity (RH), and the virus was viable for 8 h at 308C and 80% RH and for 24 h at 308C and 30% RH [54] .","Without knowing the natural reservoir of SARS-CoV, predicting the exact mechanism of transmission from reservoir host to intermediate host is difficult. However, the fecal-oral route represents the main mode of transmission among animals. Although mixing of live reservoir hosts (e.g., bats) and intermediate hosts (e.g., civets) would be an efficient means of transmission, the main source of cross-species transmission in the animal trading chain (including warehouses, transportation vehicles, markets) may come from contaminated feces, urine, blood, or aerosols. This may also be true for civet-to-human transmission. As shown in the case of the infected restaurant customer in 2004, the customer had no direct contact with civets and was sitting at a table \u22485 m from the civet cages (25).","Such a state, however, is clearly affecting colonies (or groups) of host, not individuals. An individual either quickly succumbs to the virus infection or, if infected, transmits it to others in the colony. A colony is thus under selection by MHV. To generalize this state, we expect that the persistence of SARS in specifi c bat populations would be expected to also affect the fi tness of the corresponding specifi c bat populations. Persistence is a more demanding phenotype than acute replication. It requires greater gene complexity to counter host immunity and also to promote self-regulation. Thus the enhanced fi delity of RNA replication is selected in order to conserve this greater genetic complexity and stability.","Patients in this study were tested with the 2019-nCOV nucleic acid test. The specimens included nasopharyngeal swabs, blood, sputum, and anal swabs. We found that nasal swabs and anal swabs were positive even without respiratory symptoms such as cough and gastrointestinal symptoms such as vomiting and diarrhea Therefore, the source of samples cannot be selected based on clinical manifestations, and should be submitted multiple times and at multiple sites to avoid misdiagnosis of patients with mild imaging without imaging manifestations. Although there is no clinical evidence that the virus is transmitted through the conjunctival pathway [13] , mother-infant, and breast-milk [4] , researchers have detected the virus in urine [14] , saliva [15] , suggesting that novel coronavirus has a wide range of transmission routes.","8.2.1. Rest patients in bed, strengthen supportive treatment, and ensure adequate nutrition. Keep the balance of water and electrolyte to maintain the stability of the internal environment. Closely monitor vital signs, oxygen saturation, etc. 8.2.2. Monitor blood routine, urine routine, C-reactive protein, biochemical indicators (liver enzyme, myocardial enzyme, renal function, etc.), coagulation function, arterial blood gas analysis, chest imaging, etc. according to the patient's condition. If possible, cytokine testing should be conducted. 8.2.3. Give effective oxygen therapy measures in time, including nasal cannula, mask oxygen, high-flow nasal oxygen therapy. 8.2.4. Antiviral treatment: Alpha-interferon nebulization (5 million units or equivalent with 2 ml of sterile water for injection per time for adult, twice per day); lopinavir/ritonavir (200 mg/100 mg/capsule, two capsules each time, twice per day for adults, the course of treatment should be &lt;10 days); ribavirin (for adults, 500 mg ribavirin injection combined with interferon or lopinavir/ritonavir per time is recommended, two or three times per day, the course of treatment should be &lt;10 days); chloroquine phosphate (for adult, 500 mg each time, twice per day, the course of treatment should be &lt;10 days); arbidol (for adults, 200 mg each time, three times per day, the course of treatment should be &lt;10 days). Keep alert on side effects related to lopinavir/ritonavir, such as diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and liver damage, as well as harmful interaction with other drugs. Effects of current trial drugs should be further evaluated during clinical usage. Simultaneously use of three or more types of antiviral drugs is not recommended and relevant drug treatment should stop if unacceptable side effects or toxicity occur. 8.2.5. Antibacterial drug treatment: unselective or inappropriate use of antibiotics should be avoided, especially in combination with broad-spectrum antibiotics. ","Such a situation has signifi cant implication for the evolution of immunity and group identity for cells. Host stability becomes a major fi tness issue for a persistent virus life strategy. It is generally thought that a temperate virus attains a stable colonization of its host by simply integrating into and become one with the host genome. However, there are also clear examples of stable phage persistence that does not integrate and uses other strategies to attain host stability (similar to eukaryotic DNA viruses; see below for the P1 phage exemplar of this). Like a temperate phage, a host that is colonized by episomal persisting viruses has also been much affected in its evolutionary potential.","Previously, it had been demonstrated that the respiratory virus assays available for the PF System (e.g. Influenza/RSV) were capable to process a multitude of respiratory specimen types from the upper and lower respiratory tract (LRT) including bronchoalveolar lavages [3, 7] . SARS-CoV-2 virus loads were reported to be higher in LRT specimens [8] . Although LRT specimens originating from SARS-CoV-2 infected patients were not yet available to us, we assume that the novel SARS-CoV-2 PCR protocols for the PF will also be appropriate for LRT specimens, because identical reagents for RNA extraction are used as in the commercially available diagnostic assays for other respiratory viruses (e.g. the PF influenza/RSV assay) [3, 7] . Therefore, a sensitive diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 from upper and lower respiratory tract specimens seems to be feasible. Considering the current epidemiological situation without any circulation of the old 2002 SARS-CoV, the E gene PCR seems to be sufficient for diagnosing a SARS-CoV-2 infection but confirmation of a positive result with the RdRp protocol was recommended [5] . In conclusion, rapid detection of SARS-CoV-2 is feasible with the Panther Fusion but further validation with clinical specimens is required.","HRV-induced colds are clinically indistinguishable from colds of other viral etiologies and the main symptoms are nasal discharge, nasal obstruction, sneezing, sore or scratchy throat, hoarseness, cough, and headache. Facial and ear pressure may be present, but fever and malaise are uncommon. These symptoms last approximately 7 days, but may persist for up to 2 weeks in 25% of cases. Infants and toddlers may display only nasal discharge and be otherwise asymptomatic. There is no clear association between distinct clinical outcomes and any particular serotypes or species of HRV.","In October 2012, fecal samples from 72 bat individuals were collected from 3 different sites in or around the town of Bisha, KSA [11]. Bat capture, morphological measurements and fecal sample collection were conducted as part of an outbreak investigation and surveillance effort with permission from and in coordination with the KSA Ministry of Health (Zoonotic Disease section). No methods for anesthesia, euthanasia, or any kind of animal sacrifice were involved in bat capturing and fecal sample collection. All bats were released after sampling. There was no local IACUC available in KSA at the time of this investigation; however, all bat sampling and handling were carried out in accordance with protocols from previously IACUC approved EcoHealth Alliance studies [12, 13]. All sampling was performed using minimally invasive (non-lethal) techniques detailed in a published protocol [14]. Briefly, individual bats were captured in either mist nets or harp traps located within ten meters of roosting sites or at foraging sites, and held in individual cloth bags until sampling. Bats were restrained manually while blood, urine, oral swabs, and rectal swabs/fecal samples were collected. Microbats (R. hardwickii and T. perforatus) were restrained between the handler\u2019s thumb and palm of the non-preferred hand with wing extended with 90\u00b0 angle between bat\u2019s forearm and upper arm, the skin was wiped with alcohol and venous blood from brachial or propatagial (cephalic) vein was collected using a 25 or 27-gauge needle. Larger bats (R. aegyptiacus and E. helvum) were restrained by one researcher and second collected venous blood from propatagial or saphenous (inter-fermoral) vein [15].","The use of the 6-hour window to implicate a blood-product transfusion in TRALI is not an arbitrary designation. The multitude of case reports in the medical literature confirms a close temporal association with the transfusion of blood products. In fact, it is common for TRALI to develop during the first 30 to 60 minutes of a transfusion [8] . Experimental evidence from animal models supports this temporal association. In at least four different animal models of TRALI using anti-neutrophil antibodies, anti-major histocompatibility class (MHC) I antibodies, and the plasma and lipid fractions from day 42 PRBCs and day 5 platelets, lung injury develops within 6 hours of challenge with these experimental agents [9] . In fact, in the MHC I antibody model, lung injury develops within 2 hours and often within 15 to 30 minutes [10] . The speed with which lung injury develops in a given patient is probably a complex interplay of host susceptibility and dose or titer of the injurious blood product.","Bats were captured and specimens were collected between April and May 2013 in two departments in Guatemala. One hundred Desmodus rotundus individuals were captured at four sites in Finca Los Tarrales, Patalul in the Suchitepequez department (14.519\u00b0, \u221291.136; 14.523\u00b0, \u221291.136; 14.519\u00b0, \u221291.134\u00b0; 15.524\u00b0, \u221291.141\u00b0), and 3 individuals were captured at one site in Cubilg\u00fcitz, Cob\u00e1n in the Alta Verapaz department (15.675\u00b0, \u221290.424\u00b0) (Figure 2). Project protocols for animal capture and use were approved by the Ethics and Animal Care and Use Committee of the Universidad del Valle de Guatemala (Guatemala City, Guatemala), and by the Guatemala National Protected Areas Council (research license I-025-2009, transport and export license N. 1559/2013). Bats were captured in mist nets near roost sites following standard methods (e.g., Kunz and Parsons 1988). After removal from the mist net, the bats were kept in clean cloth bags for 1\u20134 h until sampling. All bats were identified to species, and morphological data were collected including mass, forearm length, age class, sex, physical condition, and pregnancy or lactation status. Whole blood (n = 89), serum (n = 89), oral swabs (n = 103), urine (n = 12), and fecal swabs (n = 103) were collected from 103 individual bats using non-lethal, minimally invasive protocols. Small amounts of blood were collected in the field from the brachial vein and diluted with a 1:10 ratio of phosphate buffered saline. Oropharyngeal swabs, fecal swabs, and urine samples were collected in viral transport media and frozen immediately with dry ice in the field. Samples were maintained at \u221280\u00b0C after field collection and were shipped frozen with dry ice to the Center for Infection and Immunity at Columbia University in New York. ","Secondly, the route of transmission is still enigmatic and the relative infective roles of different body fluids are still under active study.1, 2 Droplets and fomites are established main routes of transmission. Stool and urine have also been implicated as the possible media in harboring the infective agent.1, 2, 3 Tears and eye discharges are body secretions that may be equally or potentially more hazardous to health-care personnel, particularly ophthalmologists. In fact, tears have been reported by WHO to be one of the body fluids conveying the novel SARS-CoV, although the infectivity or clinical significance is still not known for the time being.8 The use of different instruments, which are in direct contact with patients' conjunctival mucosal surface may serve as possible routes and sources for disease transmission. The ultimate infectivity of the tears secretion and ocular discharge from SARS patients may bring impacts on not only the daily ophthalmic practice but also the universal infection control measures practiced by general public and health-care workers.","The bacterial flora normally present in the mouth are potential etiologic agents in the development of pneumonia. A multitude of organisms (both gram-positive and gram-negative) that favor or require anaerobic conditions for growth are the major organisms comprising mouth flora. The most common predisposing factor for anaerobic pneumonia is aspiration of secretions from the oropharynx into the tracheobronchial tree. Patients with impaired consciousness (e.g., as a result of coma, alcohol or drug ingestion, or seizures) and those with difficulty swallowing (e.g., as a result of stroke or diseases causing muscle weakness) are prone to aspirate and are at risk for pneumonia caused by anaerobic or mixed mouth organisms. In addition, patients with poor dentition or gum disease are more likely to develop aspiration pneumonia because of the larger burden of organisms in their oral cavity. In some settings such as prolonged hospitalization or recent use of antibiotics, the type of bacteria residing in the oropharynx may change. Specifically, aerobic gramnegative bacilli and S. aureus are more likely to colonize the oropharynx, and any subsequent pneumonia resulting from aspiration of oropharyngeal contents may include these aerobic organisms as part of the process.","Although it is sometimes possible to observe infectious organisms by direct examination of a clinical specimen macroscopically (e.g., worms passed in feces) or microscopically (e.g., T. pallidum by dark-field microscopy of a genital lesion of suspected syphilis), diagnostic evaluation usually begins with a stained smear of sputum, cerebrospinal fluid, urine, wound exudate, or other specimen. The pathologist examines microscopic sections stained routinely with hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E). Large organisms such as helminths are readily observed and can be identified by their specific morphological characteristics by one with particular expertise.","Sampling of urethral discharge is a simple method for evaluation of prostatic abnormalities, but is the least effective technique (Baker and Lumsden, 1999) . If present, urethral discharge is collected by retracting the prepuce, cleaning the glans, and collecting the discharge into a vial or onto a microscope slide for microscopic evaluation. Some samples may also be collected into sterile containers for bacterial culture and colony counts. Concurrent analysis of urine collected by catheterization or cystocentesis should be performed to differentiate between normal urethral fl ora and cystitis.","Most nasal foreign bodies are painless and do no harm to the nose except cause a foul nasal discharge. Disc batteries, on the other hand, cause very rapid alkali burns of the nasal cavity and pain. Batteries must be removed from the nose quickly because the chemical burn occurs in minutes to hours. If extensive tissue necrosis occurs, it may cause a nasal stenosis.","The prolonged viral shedding in sputum is relevant not only for hospital infection control, but also for discharge management. In a situation characterized by limited capacity of hospital beds in infectious diseases wards, there is pressure for early discharge following treatment.","Adenovirus (Ad) vectors are among the most commonly employed viral vectors, with vast amounts of both preclinical and clinical studies assessing their protective efficacy against a variety of infectious diseases available. Adenoviridae are non-enveloped viruses with an icosahedral capsid and a linear double-stranded DNA genome, whose size ranges from 30 to 40 kb. Next to a multitude of adenoviruses occurring in different animal species, there are 57 identified human adenovirus that are classified into seven species A\u2013G. Adenoviral receptors are expressed on the surface of most human cells, allowing a broad tissue tropism of the virus (24).","The stability of the expression system is also conditioned by the type of polymerases involved in amplification of the minigenome and transcription of the mRNA (Agapov et al., 1998) . The accumulation of mutations during the in vitro expression of minigenome RNAs with T7 DNAdependent RNA-polymerase is 10 \u2212 4 -10 \u2212 5 consisting mostly of 1-nt insertions and deletions (Boyer et al., 1992; Sooknanan et al., 1994) . After transfection of the in vitro produced RNA, synthesis of mRNA by the viral RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase should have an accumulation of mutations with a relatively higher frequency of 10 \u2212 3 -10 \u2212 4 (Ward et al., 1988; de Mercoyrol et al., 1992) . An improvement in expression stability should be observed by using expression systems initiated by DNA transfection, such as those based on the expression of the minigenomes under CMV promoter, since in these cases an eukaryotic RNA polymerase II expresses the minigenome with an estimated error frequency of 5\u00d7 10 \u2212 6 on synthetic polynucleotide substrates (de Mercoyrol et al., 1992) . In addition, the eukaryotic RNA polymerase II has additional mechanisms to insure even more accurate transcription (Thomas et al., 1998) .","Each of these options is biologically relevant. The choice depends on a multitude of factors, such as the genetic background of the interacting partners, the multiplicity of infection, physiological state of the host, and environmental conditions.","IBD is a diagnosis of exclusion, that requires two steps: (1) the histopathologic confirmation of an excessive inflammatory response in the intestinal mucosa, and (2) the elimination of the multitude of potential causes for GI inflammation.","For viral RNA detection, RNA was extracted from kidney, spleen, urine, fecal, rectal and intestinal samples (Table S1). RNA from kidney (n = 6), spleen (n = 5) and urine (n = 13), were extracted using the TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA), and fecal material/swabs (n = 99), rectal and/or intestinal samples (n = 8) (Table S1) were extracted using the Duet RNA/DNA extraction kit (Zymoresearch, CA, USA) from samples homogenized in 300 \u00b5L of phosphate buffered saline (Lonza, Basel, Switzerland). Both extraction methods were performed according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions without deviations.","necrosis factor-R/high interferon-y mRNA responses, whereas high tumor necrosis factor-or/low interferon-~/ mlKNA responses favor disease. Cats that recover from FIP have humoral immune responses and immune complexes that are demonstrable in blood, but, although clearance of virus occurs, persistence may extend for several months with fecal shedding. Cats that do not clear FIPV develop either the dry or wet clinical forms of the disease depending on whether ineffective cell-mediated or humoral immunity dominates the clinical disease.Though often described as distinct entities, the wet and dry forms of FIP are the extremes of a continuum of syndromes, with pasculitis and pyogranulomatous inflammation as the hallmarks. Effusive disease is more common than the dry form.","It is most commonly acquired by inhalation, and so clinical signs are often localized to the respiratory tract. \u2022 Immune response leads to granuloma formation, leading to facial swellings and polypoid mass lesions within the nasal cavity. \u2022 Stertor and inspiratory dyspnea may occur. \u2022 Typically there is sneezing and mucopurulent nasal discharge (unilateral and bilateral), which is commonly blood tinged.","Serum creatinine (Scr), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), urine creatinine (Ucr), urine protein (PRO), urine microalbumin (UMA), \u03b1 1-microglobulin (A1M), urine immunoglobulin G (IGU), and urine transferrin (TRU) were detected. The estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), endogenous creatinine clearance (Ccr), and urine microalbumin/creatinine ratio (UACR) were calculated.","Transmission Respiratory droplets are the major source of infectious virus for transmission of SARS. However, aerosol exposure has probably contributed to disease transmission, at least in some defined instances where aerosol-generating procedures (e.g., nebulizers, high-flow oxygen therapy, intubation) have been used. The unusual stability of SARS CoV also suggests that contaminated surfaces and fomites may contribute to disease spread. As SARS CoV is present in feces and urine (and possibly other body secretions), these body fluids may also play a part in disease transmission. The largest single outbreak of SARS at the Amoy Gardens apartment block in Hong Kong, where over 300 individuals were infected from a single index case, is believed to have been caused by aerosols generated from infected body secretions (e.g., feces).","infection spread in endoscopic units. The topic is of utmost importance because of the potential for fecal-oral transmission of the SARS-CoV-2, 2 its prolonged persistence on different surfaces, 3 and the fact that, from now on, an increasing number of procedures in patients known to be COVID-19 positive will be performed.","Each treatment group was designated one room. The four pigs in each group were housed individually in a raised tub described in detail in previous studies [12, 13]. Individual housing was accomplished using solid transparent dividers, creating four compartments within one tub. The transparent dividers allowed visual and auditory contact between the pigs, but prevented nose-to-nose and fecal-oral contact. Urine and feces fell through a grate at the bottom of the tub and drained into a bucket to minimize the risk of contaminating the room\u2019s floor. Each section of the tub had designated water and feed sources. During the study, each pig was assigned its own bag of feed and feed cup to minimize cross contamination. Previous studies demonstrated that this housing method successfully prevented transmission of PEDV between pigs in a group [12]. Pigs were fed an age appropriate, pelleted, starter diet ad libitum. The diet consisted primarily of corn and soybean meal and did not contain porcine derived products."],"title":["The Management of Respiratory Infections During Pregnancy","Emergence of a novel human

A total of 66 upper respiratory swabs, 51 feces, 56 urine and 56 plasma samples were sequentially collected from 23 patients in a designated hospital. The plasma and urine samples were all negative, except for urine samples from two severe cases at the latest available detection point. Conversely, virus was shed in respiratory swabs and feces samples during the diseased period. Ten of 12 (83.3%) cases were positive for feces samples, while 14 of 21 (66.7%) were positive for respiratory samples. In addition, the median duration of virus shedding was 10.0 days (IQR 8.0 to 17.0) in the upper respiratory swabs, but was 22.0 days (IQR 15.5 to 23.5) for the feces. Notably, at 26 days after discharge, case 3 (a 45-year-old) was detected positive again in the feces samples, but appears to be healt...","Background A pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been spreading over the world. However, the viral dynamics, host serologic responses, and their associations with clinical manifestations, have not been well described in prospective cohort. Methods We conducted a prospective cohort and enrolled 67 COVID-19 patients admitting between Jan 26 and Feb 5, 2020. Clinical specimens including nasopharyngeal swab, sputum, blood, urine and stool were tested periodically according to standardized case report form with final follow-up on February 27. The routes and duration of viral shedding, antibody response, and their associations with disease severity and clinical manifestations were systematically evaluated. Coronaviral particles in clinical specimens were observed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Results The median duration of SARS-CoV-2 RNA shedding were 12 (3-38), 19 (5-37), and 18 (7-26) days i...","As a city famous for tourism, the public healthcare system of Macau SAR has been under great pressure during the outbreak of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). In this study, we report clinical and microbiological features of ten COVID-19 patients enrolled in the Centro Hospitalar Conde de S\u00e3o Janu\u00e1rio (CHCSJ) between January 21 to February 16, 2020. Clinical samples from all patients including nasopharyngeal swab (NPS)/sputum, urine, and feces were collected for serial virus RNA testing by standard qRT-PCR assay. In total, seven were imported cases and three were local cases. The median duration from Macau arrival to admission in imported cases was 3 days. Four patients required oxygen therapy but none of them needed machinal ventilation. No fatal cases were noted. The most common symptoms were fever (80%) and diarrhea (80%). In the \"Severe\" group, there was significantly more elderly patients (p=0.045), higher lactate dehydrogenase levels (p=0.002), and elevated C-Reactive prot...","Ever since the development of the first vaccine more than 200 years ago, vaccinations have greatly decreased the burden of infectious diseases worldwide, famously leading to the eradication of small pox and allowing the restriction of diseases such as polio, tetanus, diphtheria, and measles. A multitude of research efforts focuses on the improvement of established and the discovery of new vaccines such as the HPV (human papilloma virus) vaccine in 2006. However, radical changes in the density, age distribution and traveling habits of the population worldwide as well as the changing climate favor the emergence of old and new pathogens that bear the risk of becoming pandemic threats. In recent years, the rapid spread of severe infections such as HIV, SARS, Ebola, and Zika have highlighted the dire need for global preparedness for pandemics, which necessitates the extremely rapid development and comprehensive distribution of vaccines against potentially previously unknown pathogens. What ...","Certain bat species serve as natural reservoirs for pathogens in several key viral families including henipa-, lyssa-, corona-, and filoviruses, which may pose serious threats to human health. The Common Vampire Bat (Desmodus rotundus), due to its abundance, sanguivorous feeding habit involving humans and domestic animals, and highly social behavioral ecology, may have an unusually high potential for interspecies disease transmission. Previous studies have investigated rabies dynamics in D. rotundus, yet the diversity of other viruses, bacteria, and other microbes that these bats may carry remains largely unknown. We screened 396 blood, urine, saliva, and fecal samples from D. rotundus captured in Guatemala for 13 viral families and genera. Positive results were found for rhabdovirus, adenovirus, and herpesvirus assays. We also screened these samples for Bartonella spp. and found that 38% of individuals tested positive. To characterize potential for interspecies transmission associated...","Background: The outbreak of novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP) caused by 2019-nCoV spread rapidly, and elucidation the diagnostic accuracy of different respiratory specimens is crucial for the control and treatment of this diseases. Methods: Respiratory samples including nasal swabs, throat swabs, sputum and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) were collected from Guangdong CDC confirmed NCP patients, and viral RNAs were detected using a CFDA approved detection kit. Results were analyzed in combination with sample collection date and clinical information. Finding: Except for BALF, the sputum possessed the highest positive rate (74.4%~88.9%), followed by nasal swabs (53.6%~73.3%) for both severe and mild cases during the first 14 days after illness onset (d.a.o). For samples collected \u2265 15 d.a.o, sputum and nasal swabs still possessed a high positive rate ranging from 42.9%~61.1%. The positive rate of throat swabs collected \u2265 8 d.a.o was low, especially in samples from mild cases. Viral R...","Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is one of the major threats to the healthcare systems in some countries, especially in the Arabian Peninsula. MERS-CoV is considered an ideal example of the One Health concept. This is due to the animals, especially dromedary camels, play important roles in the transmission and sustainability of the virus, and the virus can be transmitted through aerosols of infected patients into the environment. However, there is some debate regarding the origin of MERS-CoV either from bats or other unknown reservoirs. The dromedary camel is the only identified animal reservoir to date. These animals play important roles in sustaining the virus in certain communities and may act as an amplifier of the virus by secreting it in their body fluids, especially in nasal and rectal discharges. MERS-CoV has been detected in the nasal and rectal secretions of infected camels, and MERS-CoV of this origin has full capacity to infect human airway epithelium...","We tested samples collected from nine patients diagnosed with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The virus was found in urine, blood, anal swabs and oropharyngeal swabs. It is the first time for SARS-CoV-2 found in urine, though no urinary irritation was found.","Background: In coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), current case definitions presume mainly lower respiratory tract infection. However, cases seen outside the epicenter of the epidemic may differ in their overall clinical appearance due to more sensitive case finding. Methods: We studied viral load courses by RT-PCR in oro- and nasopharyngeal swabs, sputum, stool, blood, and urine in nine hospitalized cases. Infectious virus was detected by cell culture. Active replication was demonstrated by analysis of viral subgenomic replicative intermediates. Serology including neutralization testing was done to characterize immune response. Results: Seven cases had upper respiratory tract disease. Lower respiratory tract symptoms seen in two cases were limited. Clinical sensitivity of RT-PCR on swabs taken on days 1-5 of symptoms was 100%, with no differences comparing swab and sputum samples taken simultaneously. Average viral load was 6.76x10E5 copies per swab during the first 5 days. Live viru...","Summary Currently, the emergence of a novel human coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, has become a global health concern causing severe respiratory tract infections in humans. Human-to-human transmissions have been described with incubation times between 2-10 days, facilitating its spread via droplets, contaminated hands or surfaces. We therefore reviewed the literature on all available information about the persistence of human and veterinary coronaviruses on inanimate surfaces as well as inactivation strategies with biocidal agents used for chemical disinfection, e.g. in healthcare facilities. The analysis of 22 studies reveals that human coronaviruses such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) coronavirus, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) coronavirus or endemic human coronaviruses (HCoV) can persist on inanimate surfaces like metal, glass or plastic for up to 9 days, but can be efficiently inactivated by surface disinfection procedures with 62\u201371% ethanol, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide o...","The virologic test results of 415 patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) were examined. The peak detection rate for SARS-associated coronavirus occurred at week 2 after illness onset for respiratory specimens, at weeks 2 to 3 for stool or rectal swab specimens, and at week 4 for urine specimens. The latest stool sample that was positive by reverse transcription\u2013polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was collected on day 75 while the patient was receiving intensive care. Tracheal aspirate and stool samples had a higher diagnostic yield (RT-PCR average positive rate for first 2 weeks: 66.7% and 56.5%, respectively). Pooled throat and nasal swabs, rectal swab, nasal swab, throat swab, and nasopharyngeal aspirate specimens provided a moderate yield (29.7%\u201340.0%), whereas throat washing and urine specimens showed a lower yield (17.3% and 4.5%). The collection procedures for stool and pooled nasal and throat swab specimens were the least likely to transmit infection, and the comb...","The main route of transmission of SARS CoV infection is presumed to be respiratory droplets. However the virus is also detectable in other body fluids and excreta. The stability of the virus at different temperatures and relative humidity on smooth surfaces were studied. The dried virus on smooth surfaces retained its viability for over 5 days at temperatures of 22\u201325\u00b0C and relative humidity of 40\u201350%, that is, typical air-conditioned environments. However, virus viability was rapidly lost (&gt;3 log(10)) at higher temperatures and higher relative humidity (e.g., 38\u00b0C, and relative humidity of &gt;95%). The better stability of SARS coronavirus at low temperature and low humidity environment may facilitate its transmission in community in subtropical area (such as Hong Kong) during the spring and in air-conditioned environments. It may also explain why some Asian countries in tropical area (such as Malaysia, Indonesia or Thailand) with high temperature and high relative humidity environment d...","Objectives The aim of the study was to analyze the incidence of COVID-19 with early renal injury, and to explore the value of multi-index combined detection in diagnosis of early renal injury in COVID-19. Design The study was an observational, descriptive study. Setting This study was carried out in a tertiary hospital in Guangdong, China. Participants 12 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 from January 20, 2020 to February 20, 2020. Primary and secondary outcome measures The primary outcome was to evaluate the incidence of early renal injury in COVID-19. In this study, the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), endogenous creatinine clearance (Ccr) and urine microalbumin / urinary creatinine ratio (UACR) were calculated to assess the incidence of early renal injury. Secondary outcomes were the diagnostic value of urine microalbumin (UMA), \u03b11-microglobulin (A1M), urine immunoglobulin-G (IGU), urine transferring (TRU) alone and in combination in diagnosis of COVID-19 with early renal...","Resumen Multitud de portales inform\u00e1ticos aparecen d\u00eda a d\u00eda, sobresaturando de informaci\u00f3n a la comunidad m\u00e9dica y no m\u00e9dica, y que no siempre es confiable y puede encubrir motivos comerciales y propaganda diseminada sin control alguno.

Over a month since the outbreak, more than 13,000 patients with COVID-19 have be cured and discharged from hospital until now. For the clinical cure criteria in China, twice successive negative results of Sars-Cov-2 nucleic acid detection are the important index, in addition to normal body temperature for 3 days as well as obvious improvement in respiratory symptoms and CT scan [2]. In the present work, we reported that Sars-Cov-2 nucleic acid was still detectable in sputum obtained by nebulization from a cured patient. On January 22, a 49-year-old man presented himself with fever for 4 days to a clinic. Throat swab detection was positive for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid by real-time RT-PCR. Subsequently, the patient was diagnosed with COVID-19 according to the diagnostic criteria [2] as follows (1): the positive result of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid detection (2); a history ...","Abstract Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) has been globally reported. A novel coronavirus (CoV), SARS-CoV, was identified as the etiological agent of the disease. SARS-CoV 3C-like protease (3CLpro) mediates the proteolytic processing of replicase polypeptides 1a and 1ab into functional proteins, playing an important role in viral replication. In this study, we demonstrated the expression of the SARS-CoV 3CLpro in Escherichia coli and Vero cells, and then characterized the in vitro trans-cleavage and the cell-based cis-cleavage by the 3CLpro. Mutational analysis of the 3CLpro demonstrated the importance of His41, Cys145, and Glu166 in the substrate-binding subsite S1 for keeping the proteolytic activity. In addition, alanine substitution of the cleavage substrates indicated that Gln-P1 in the substrates mainly determined the cleavage efficiency. Therefore, this study not only established the quantifiable and reliable assay for the in vitro and cell-based measurement of the 3CLpr...","Cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) were investigated for SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) through RNA tests, serologic response, and viral culture. Of 537 specimens from patients in whom SARS was clinically diagnosed, 332 (60%) had SARS-CoV RNA in one or more clinical specimens, compared with 1 (0.3%) of 332 samples from controls. Of 417 patients with clinical SARS from whom paired serum samples were available, 92% had an antibody response. Rates of viral RNA positivity increased progressively and peaked at day 11 after onset of illness. Although viral RNA remained detectable in respiratory secretions and stool and urine specimens for &gt;30 days in some patients, virus could not be cultured after week 3 of illness. Nasopharyngeal aspirates, throat swabs, or sputum samples were the most useful clinical specimens in the first 5 days of illness, but later in the illness viral RNA could be detected more readily in stool specimens.","Since December 2019, 62 medical staff of Zhongnan Hospital in Wuhan, China have been hospitalised with coronavirus disease 2019. During the post-discharge surveillance after clinical recovery, swabs were positive in two asymptomatic cases (3.23%). Case 1 had presented typical clinical and radiological manifestations on admission, while manifestation in Case 2 was very mild. In conclusion, a small proportion of recovered patients may test positive after discharge, and post-discharge surveillance and isolation need to be strengthened.","R\u00e9sum\u00e9 Un grand nombre d\u2019infections humaines d\u2019origine hydrique sont caus\u00e9es par des micro-organismes qu\u2019il s\u2019agisse de virus, de bact\u00e9ries ou encore de protozoaires.

The French government decided to repatriate the 337 French nationals living in Wuhan and place them in quarantine in their home country. We decided to test them all for SARS-Cov2 twice in order to reduce anxiety among the population and decision-makers. Methods We investigated the presence of SARS-CoV-19 in asymptomatic carriers by testing all repatriated patients within the first 24 h of their arrival in France and at day 5. Viral RNA was extracted from pooled nasal and oropharyngeal swab fluids or sputum in the absence of nasal/oropharyngeal swabs. Detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA was then carried out using several real-time reverse transcription (RT)-PCR assays. Results We tested 337 passengers at day 0 and day 5. All the tests for SARS-CoV2 were negative. By optimising the sampling process, sending samples se...","A severe respiratory ongoing outbreak of pneumonia associated with 2019 novel coronavirus was recently emerged in China. Here, we reported the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory and radiological characteristics of 19 suspect cases. We compared the positive ratio of 2019-nCoV nucleic acid amplification test from different samples including oropharyngeal swab, blood, urine and stool with 3different Fluorescent RT-PCR kits. Nine out of the 19 patients were detected 2019-nCoV infection using oropharyngeal swab samples, and the virus nucleic acid was also detected in eight of these nine patients using stool samples. None of positive results was identified in the blood and urine samples. Thses three different kits got the same result for each sample and the positive ratio of nucleic acid detection for 2019-nCoV was only 47.4% in the suspect patients. Therefore, it is possible that the really infected patients have been missed by using nucleic acid detection only. It might be better to mak...","BACKGROUND: SARS-CoV-2 has caused a series of COVID-19 globally. SARS-CoV-2 binds angiotensin I converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) of renin-angiotensin system (RAS) and causes prevalent hypokalemia METHODS: The patients with COVID-19 were classified into severe hypokalemia, hypokalemia, and normokalemia group. The study aimed to determine the relationship between hypokalemia and clinical features, the underlying causes and clinical implications of hypokalemia. RESULTS: By Feb 15, 2020, 175 patients with COVID-19 (92 women and 83 men; median age, 46 [IQR, 34-54] years) were admitted to hospital in Wenzhou, China, consisting 39 severe hypokalemia-, 69 hypokalemia-, and 67 normokalemia patients. Gastrointestinal symptoms were not associated with hypokalemia among 108 hypokalemia patients (P&gt;0.05). Body temperature, CK, CK-MB, LDH, and CRP were significantly associated with the severity of hypokalemia (P&lt;0.01). 93% of severe and critically ill patients had hypokalemia which was most common among e...","Abstract Persistence was established after most of the SARS-CoV-infected Vero E6 cells died. RNA of the defective interfering virus was not observed in the persistently infected cells by Northern blot analysis. SARS-CoV diluted to 2 PFU failed to establish persistence, suggesting that some particular viruses in the seed virus did not induce persistent infection. Interestingly, a viral receptor, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE)-2, was down-regulated in persistently infected cells. G418-selected clones established from parent Vero E6 cells, which were transfected with a plasmid containing the neomycin resistance gene, were infected with SARS-CoV, resulting in a potential cell population capable of persistence in Vero E6 cells. Our previous studies demonstrated that signaling pathways of extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK1/2), c-Jun N-terminal protein kinase (JNK), p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), and phosphatidylinositol 3\u2032-kinase (PI3K)/Akt were activated in SARS-Co...","COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) is the most recent pandemic disease the world is currently managing. It started in China at the end of 2019, and it is diffusing throughout Italy, one of the most affected countries, and it is currently spreading through European countries and USA. Patients affected by COVID-19 are identified employing medical swabs applied mainly to (i) citizens with COVID-19 symptoms such as flu or high temperature, or (ii) citizens that had contacts with COVID-19 patients. A percentage of COVID-19 affected patients needs hospitalisation, whereas a portion needs to be treated in Intensive Care Units (ICUs). Nevertheless, it is a matter of current intuition that COVID-19 infected citizens are more than those detected, and sometime the infection is detected too late. Thus there are many efforts in both tracking people activities as well as diffusing low cost reliable COVID-19 tests for early detection. Starting from mortality rates of diseases caused by viruses in the same family ...","ABSTRACT Treatment of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is experimental, and the effectiveness of ribavirin-steroid therapy is unclear. Forty SARS patients with progressive disease after ribavirin treatment and 1.5 g of pulsed methylprednisolone were given either convalescent plasma (n = 19) or further pulsed methylprednisolone (n = 21) in a retrospective non-randomised study. Good clinical outcome was defined as discharge by day 22 following the onset of symptoms. Convalescent plasma was obtained from recovered patients after informed consent. Patients in the plasma group had a shorter hospital stay (p 0.001) and lower mortality (p 0.049) than the comparator group. No immediate adverse effects were observed following plasma infusion.","The study of virus evolution has historically been concerned with disease and its emergence and has not been integrated into the general study of evolution. Yet viruses dominate our planet and their evolution is a broad and applied field that can be studied in the real time (such HIV in human disease) and can also be applied to biotechnological problems. Virus evolution is very similar, but not identical, to host evolution. Darwinian principles apply, such as with Fisher population genetics, but other features, such as reticulated and quasispecies-based evolution, distinguish virus evolution. In RNA viruses, high error rates have led to the quasispecies concept in which collective populations are the basis of evolution. These populations provide viruses with high capacities for adaptation. Yet some RNA viruses show remarkable evolutionary stability. With DNA viruses, especially of bacteria, extensive recombination defines vast dynamic and ancient genetic pools. Temperate viruses can di...","A novel human coronavirus, now named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2, referred to as HCoV-19 here) that emerged in Wuhan, China in late 2019 is now causing a pandemic. Here, we analyze the aerosol and surface stability of HCoV-19 and compare it with SARS-CoV-1, the most closely related human coronavirus.2 We evaluated the stability of HCoV-19 and SARS-CoV-1 in aerosols and on different surfaces and estimated their decay rates using a Bayesian regression model","SARS coronavirus encodes non-structural protein 13 (nsP13), a nucleic acid helicase/NTPase belonging to superfamily 1 helicase, which efficiently unwinds both partial-duplex RNA and DNA. In this study, unwinding of DNA substrates that had different duplex lengths and 5\u2032-overhangs was examined under single-turnover reaction conditions in the presence of excess enzyme. The amount of DNA unwound decreased significantly as the length of the duplex increased, indicating a poor in vitro processivity. However, the quantity of duplex DNA unwound increased as the length of the single-stranded 5\u2032-tail increased for the 50-bp duplex. This enhanced processivity was also observed for duplex DNA that had a longer single-stranded gap in between. These results demonstrate that nsP13 requires the presence of a long 5\u2032-overhang to unwind longer DNA duplexes. In addition, enhanced DNA unwinding was observed for gapped DNA substrates that had a 5\u2032-overhang, indicating that the translocated nsP13 molecules...","The number of confirmed COVID-19 cases admitted in hospitals is continuously increasing in the Philippines. Frontline health care workers are faced with imminent risks of getting infected. In this study, we formulate a theoretical model to calculate the risk of being infected in health care facilities considering the following factors: the average number of encounters with a suspected COVID-19 patient per hour; interaction time for each encounter; work shift duration or exposure time; crowd density, which may depend on the amount of space available in a given location; and availability and effectiveness of protective gears and facilities provided for the frontline health care workers. Based on the simulation results, we recommend the following: (i) decrease the rate of patient encounter per frontline health care worker, e.g., maximum of three encounters per hour in a 12-hour work shift duration; (ii) decrease the interaction time between the frontline health care worker and the patient...","Zoonotic transmission of novel viruses represents a significant threat to global public health and is fueled by globalization, the loss of natural habitats, and exposure to new hosts. For coronaviruses (CoVs), broad diversity exists within bat populations and uniquely positions them to seed future emergence events. In this review, we explore the host and viral dynamics that shape these CoV populations for survival, amplification, and possible emergence in novel hosts.","Many new infectious diseases in humans have been derived from animal sources in the past 20 years. Some are highly contagious and fatal. Vaccination may not be available and antiviral drugs are not effective enough. Infectious control is important in clinical medicine and in Ophthalmology. Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), as an example, is a highly contagious respiratory disease that has recently been reported in Asia, North America, and Europe. Within a matter of weeks, the outbreak has evolved to become a global health threat and more than 30 countries have been afflicted with a novel Coronavirus strain (SARS-CoV) that is the aetiologic agent of SARS. The primary route of transmission of SARS appears involving close person-to-person contact through droplets. Ophthalmologists may be particularly susceptible to the infection as routine ophthalmic examinations like direct ophthalmoscopy and slit-lamp examination are usually performed in a setting that has close doctor\u2013patient c...","Background: The spread of an novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2, previously named 2019-nCoV) has already taken on pandemic proportions, affecting over 100 countries in a matter of weeks. Elucidating the diagnostic value of different methods, especially the auxiliary diagnosis value of antibodies assays for SARS-CoV-2 infection is helpful for improving the sensitivities of pathogenic-diagnosis, providing timely treatment, and differentiating the infected cases from the healthy, thus preventing further epidemics. Methods: Medical records from 38 patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection in the Second People's Hospital of Fuyang from January 22, 2020 to February 28, 2020 were collected and retrospectively analyzed. Specimens including throat swabs, sputum and serum were collected during the hospitalization period, viral RNAs and serum IgM-IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 were measured respectively. The detectability of different methods as well as the auxiliary diagnosis value of antibodies tes...","Background: Community based studies of influenza and other respiratory viruses (e.g. SARS-COV-2) require laboratory confirmation of infection. During the current COVID-19 pandemic, social distancing guidelines require alternative data collection in order protect both research staff and participants. Home-collected respiratory specimens are less resource intensive, can be collected earlier after symptom onset, and provide a low-contact means of data collection. A prospective, multi-year, community-based cohort study is an ideal setting to examine the utility of home-collected specimens for identification of influenza. Methods: We describe the feasibility and reliability of home-collected specimens for the detection of influenza. We collected data and specimens between October 2014 and June 2017 from the Household Influenza Vaccine Evaluation (HIVE) Study. Cohort participants were asked to collect a nasal swab at home upon onset of acute respiratory illness. Research staff also collected...","The outbreak of COVID-19 epidemic has caused worldwide health concerns since Nov., 2019. A previous study described the demographic, epidemiologic, and clinical features for infected infants. However, compared with adult cases, little attention has been paid to the infected pediatric cases. Severity detection is challenging for children since most of children patients have mild symptoms no matter they are moderately or critically ill therein.","","Abstract Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), discovered as a homologue of ACE, acts as its physiological counterbalance providing homeostatic regulation of circulating angiotensin II (Ang II) levels. ACE2 is a zinc metalloenzyme and carboxypeptidase located as an ectoenzyme on the surface of endothelial and other cells. While its primary substrate appears to be Ang II, it can hydrolyze a number of other physiological substrates. Additionally, ACE2 functions in other noncatalytic cellular roles including the regulation of intestinal neutral amino acid transport. It also serendipitously acts as the receptor for the severe acute respiratory syndrome virus. Upregulation of ACE2 expression and function is increasingly recognized as a potential therapeutic strategy in hypertension and cardiovascular disease, diabetes, lung injury, and fibrotic disorders. ACE2 is regulated at multiple levels including transcriptional, posttranscriptional (miRNA and epigenetic), and posttranslational throu...","In December 2019, a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) caused an outbreak in Wuhan, China, and soon spread to other parts of the world. It was believed that 2019-nCoV was transmitted through respiratory tract and then induced pneumonia, thus molecular diagnosis based on oral swabs was used for confirmation of this disease. Likewise, patient will be released upon two times of negative detection from oral swabs. However, many coronaviruses can also be transmitted through oral\u2013fecal route by infecting intestines. Whether 2019-nCoV infected patients also carry virus in other organs like intestine need to be tested. We conducted investigation on patients in a local hospital who were infected with this virus. We found the presence of 2019-nCoV in anal swabs and blood as well, and more anal swab positives than oral swab positives in a later stage of infection, suggesting shedding and thereby transmitted through oral\u2013fecal route. We also showed serology test can improve detection positive rate thus...","AbstractIn December 2019, the first cases of a novel coronavirus infection were diagnosed in Wuhan, China. Due to international travel and human-to-human transmission, the virus spread rapidly inside and outside of China. Currently, there is no effective antiviral treatment for COVID-19, therefore research efforts are focused on the rapid development of vaccines and antiviral drugs. The SARS-CoV-2 Mpro protease constitutes one of the most attractive antiviral drug targets. To address this emerging problem, we have synthesized a combinatorial library of fluorogenic substrates with glutamine in the P1 position. We used it to determine the substrate preferences of the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 proteases, using natural and a large panel of unnatural amino acids. The results of our work provide a structural framework for the design of inhibitors as antiviral agents or diagnostic tests.","Abstract An outbreak of COVID-19 in Wuhan, China caused by SARS-CoV-2 has led to a serious epidemic in China and other countries, resulting in worldwide concern. With the active efforts from prevention and control, the quantity of discharged patients is escalating. How to manage these patients normatively is still challenging. We hereby reported an asymptomatic discharged patient with COVID-19 who was retested positive for SARS-CoV-2, which arouses concern regarding the present discharge standard of COVID-19.","Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) helicase is a superfamily 1 helicase containing seven conserved motifs. We have cloned, expressed, and purified a Strep-fused recombinant MERS-CoV nonstructural protein 13 (M-nsp13) helicase. Characterization of its biochemical properties showed that it unwound DNA and RNA similarly to severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV nsp13 (S-nsp13) helicase. We showed that M-nsp13 unwound in a 5\u2032-to-3\u2032 direction and efficiently unwound the partially duplex RNA substrates with a long loading strand relative to those of the RNA substrates with a short or no loading strand. Moreover, the K(m) of ATP for M-nsp13 is inversely proportional to the length of the 5\u2032 loading strand of the partially duplex RNA substrates. Finally, we also showed that the rate of unwinding (ku) of M-nsp13 is directly proportional to the length of the 5\u2032 loading strand of the partially duplex RNA substrate. These results provide insights that enhance our understanding o...","We present a timely evaluation of the impact of lockdown on the 2019-nCov epidemic in Hubei province, China. The implementation appears to be effective in reducing about 60% of new infections and deaths, and its effect also appears to be sustainable even after its removal. Delaying its implementation reduces its effectiveness. However, the direct economic cost of such a lockdown remains to be seen and whether the model is replicable in other Chinese regions remains a matter of further investigation.","We study a novel multi-strain SIR epidemic model with selective immunity by vaccination. A newer strain is made to emerge in the population when a preexisting strain has reached equilibrium. We assume that this newer strain does not exhibit cross-immunity with the original strain, hence those who are vaccinated and recovered from the original strain become susceptible to the newer strain. Recent events involving the COVID-19 virus demonstrates that it is possible for a viral strain to emerge from a population at a time when the influenza virus, a well-known virus with a vaccine readily available for some of its strains, is active in a population. We solved for four different equilibrium points and investigated the conditions for existence and local stability. The reproduction number was also determined for the epidemiological model and found to be consistent with the local stability condition for the disease-free equilibrium.","Abstract Medicine shortages have been spreading in European countries. In many cases, the unavailability of medicinal products has a substantial impact on the capability of National Healthcare Systems in ensuring the continuity of care. Shortages originate from multifactorial causes. In particular, they can be due to supply-related factors (e.g., manufacturing issues, regulatory issues, logistics, distribution) and demand-related ones (e.g., fluctuating drug demand, parallel market, tendering, price and reimbursement policies). However, some extraordinary geopolitical events (e.g., Brexit) may also affect medicines\u2019 availability. The capability of European Regulatory Authorities and other stakeholders, which are involved in the pharmaceutical distribution chain and the healthcare assistance services, to define suitable problem-solving strategies has been limited for years by the fragmentation of the European regulatory framework, starting from the lack of a univocal definition of a med...","A SARS-CoV lacking the full-length E gene (SARS-CoV-\u2206E) was attenuated and an effective vaccine. Here, we show that this mutant virus regained fitness after serial passages in cell culture or in vivo, resulting in the partial duplication of the membrane gene or in the insertion of a new sequence in gene 8a, respectively. The chimeric proteins generated in cell culture increased virus fitness in vitro but remained attenuated in mice. In contrast, during SARS-CoV-\u2206E passage in mice, the virus incorporated a mutated variant of 8a protein, resulting in reversion to a virulent phenotype. When the full-length E protein was deleted or its PDZ-binding motif (PBM) was mutated, the revertant viruses either incorporated a novel chimeric protein with a PBM or restored the sequence of the PBM on the E protein, respectively. Similarly, after passage in mice, SARS-CoV-\u2206E protein 8a mutated, to now encode a PBM, and also regained virulence. These data indicated that the virus requires a PBM on a trans...","Background: COVID-19 is still becoming an increasing global threat to public health. More detailed and specific characteristics of COVID-19 are needed to better understand this disease. Additionally, durations of COVID-19, e.g., the average time from exposure to recovery, which is of great value in understanding this disease, has not been reported so far. Aims: To give the information on clinical characteristics and different durations of COVID-19 and to identify the potential risk factors for longer hospitalization duration. Methods: In this retrospective study, we enrolled 77 patients (mean age: 52 years; 44.2% males) with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 admitted to Beijing YouAn Hospital during 21st Jan and 8th February 2020. Epidemiological, clinical and radiological data on admission were collected; complications and outcomes were followed up until 29th February 2020. The study endpoint was the discharge within two weeks. Cox proportional-hazards regression was performed to identify...","A novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) was first identified in Wuhan, Hubei Province, and then spreads to the other Provinces of China. WHO decides to determine a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) of 2019-nCoV. 2019-nCov was reported to share the same receptor, Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), with SARS-Cov. Here based on the public single-cell RNA-Seq datasets, we analyzed the ACE2 RNA expression profile in the tissues at different locations of the respiratory tract. The result indicates that the ACE2 expression appears in nasal epithelial cells. We found that the size of this population of ACE2-expressing nasal epithelial cells is comparable with the size of the population of ACE2-expression type II alveolar cells (AT2) in the Asian sample reported by Yu Zhao et al. We further detected 2019-nCoV by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from the nasal-swab and throat-swab of seven suspected cases. We found that 2019-nCoV tends to have a higher concentration in the nas...","Summary By accelerating global mRNA decay, many viruses impair host protein synthesis, limiting host defenses and stimulating virus mRNA translation. Vaccinia virus (VacV) encodes two decapping enzymes (D9, D10) that remove protective 5\u2032 caps on mRNAs, presumably generating substrates for degradation by the host exonuclease Xrn1. Surprisingly, we find VacV infection of Xrn1-depleted cells inhibits protein synthesis, compromising virus growth. These effects are aggravated by D9 deficiency and dependent upon a virus transcription factor required for intermediate and late mRNA biogenesis. Considerable double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) accumulation in Xrn1-depleted cells is accompanied by activation of host dsRNA-responsive defenses controlled by PKR and 2\u2032-5\u2032 oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS), which respectively inactivate the translation initiation factor eIF2 and stimulate RNA cleavage by RNase L. This proceeds despite VacV-encoded PKR and RNase L antagonists being present. Moreover, Xrn1 deple...","Abstract On 10 January 2020, a new coronavirus causing a pneumonia outbreak in Wuhan City in central China was denoted as 2019-nCoV by the World Health Organization (WHO). As of 24 January 2020, there were 887 confirmed cases of 2019-nCoV infection, including 26 deaths, reported in China and other countries. Therefore, combating this new virus and stopping the epidemic is a matter of urgency. Here, we focus on advances in research and development of fast diagnosis methods, as well as potential prophylactics and therapeutics to prevent or treat 2019-nCoV infection.","Abstract The maturation of SARS coronavirus involves the autocleavage of polyproteins 1a and 1ab by the main protease (Mpro) and a papain-like protease; these represent attractive targets for the development of anti-SARS drugs. The functional unit of Mpro is a homodimer, and each subunit has a His-41\u22efCys-145 catalytic dyad. Current thinking in this area is that Mpro dimerization is essential for catalysis, although the influence of the substrate binding on the dimer formation has never been explored. Here, we delineate the contributions of the peptide substrate to Mpro dimerization. Enzyme kinetic assays indicate that the monomeric mutant R298A/L exhibits lower activity but in a cooperative manner. Analytical ultracentrifugation analyses indicate that in the presence of substrates, the major species of R298A/L shows a significant size shift toward the dimeric form and the monomer-dimer dissociation constant of R298A/L decreases by 12- to 17-fold, approaching that for wild-type.
