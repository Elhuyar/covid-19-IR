Organization of the experiments is as follows. First, we compute SC performance subject to such key performance indicators as service levels, sales, lead time, inventory on-hand, and profit for a disruption-free scenario. Subsequently, SC dynamics in different disruption scenarios are simulated in order to analyse the estimated magnitude of the disruptions and the ripple effect as caused by an epidemic outbreak. Such an analysis will be performed for different combinations of factors. Finally, we compare the SC reactions in different cases and draw conclusions on the disruption and ripple effect impacts on the SC performance. For verification, tracking of the simulation runs, analysis of output log files, and testing at deterministic parameters were used. For testing, we use replications in comparison and variation experiments. In Fig. 4 , we illustrate the SC behaviour in disruption-free scenario without any epidemic outbreaks.","We also searched following websites: the WHO (https://www.who.int/), CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, https://www.cdc.gov/), NICE (National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence, https://www.nice.org.uk/), National Health Commission of the People\u2019s Republic of China (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/), and National Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine (http://www.satcm.gov.cn/).","Assembling genomes of uncultivated viruses can not only identify some of the most abundant and widespread viruses in an ecosystem, but these sequences also represent foundational data for targeted follow-up experiments aimed at further characterizing these novel viruses. In the case of crAssphage, two major studies leveraged this initial genome sequence to better understand the diversity and host of these phages. First, predicted proteins from the original crAssphage genome were used as \"bait\" to identify related phages in a broad range of metagenomes. This revealed an extensive and diverse group of \"crAss-like\" phages predicted to represent a new family within the Caudovirales order, that may be related to Podoviridae. Genome comparisons within this new family also enabled the identification of conserved structural and replication gene modules. Meanwhile, another study was able to isolate a member of the crAssphage-like family through broth enrichment on Bacteroides intestinalis strains isolated from human gut samples, confirming the computational predictions from bioinformatic analyses that these phages were likely infecting Bacteroidetes hosts and had a Podoviridae-like morphology.","Our tool has several potential applications. First, while it does not have the ability to diagnose individual cases of COVID-19 infections, it may help predict future spreading zones a few days before an outbreak occurs, with a high level of accuracy given a sufficient sample size. We currently provide a colormap of Israel by regions of symptoms ratio (Figure 3) , however, as the daily response rate will increase, enough data will be collected, enabling us to implement prediction models. These we hope would be leveraged by policy-makers to make informed decisions, by utilization of efficient regional prevention strategies rather than a universal approach. Second, it may also be used to evaluate the effectiveness of prevention strategies implemented by public health organizations, such as the various social distancing measures which are currently being employed in many countries, including Israel. This can be done by measuring the effect of different strategies on reducing the number of symptomatic individuals. Third, it may help in understanding the clinical course of COVID-19 infection by tracking the dynamics of symptoms in the population over time.","All continents reported confirmed cases of COVID-19. Africa confirmed its first case in Egypt on Feb 14, 2020. China is Africa's leading commercial part ner; thus, there are large travel volumes through which severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 could reach the continent. Several measures have already been implemented to prevent and control possible case importations from China; 3,4 however, the ability to limit and control local transmission after importation depends on the application and execution of strict measures of detection, prevention, and control. These measures include heightened surveillance and rapid identification of suspected cases, followed by patient transfer and isolation, rapid diagnosis, tracing, and follow-up of potential contacts. 1 The application of such a vast technical and operational set of interventions depends on each country's public health and laboratory infrastructures and resources.","This work was supported by Laboratory Directed Research and Development (grant number 08-SI-002) from Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, and by the National Biodefense Analysis and Countermeasures Center (award number L164212/F0901).

We leveraged the Graham supercomputer to predict every possible relationship (&gt;280,000) between nCoV and humans and generated these predictions. The algorithms are also used to identify the specific parts of the viral proteins that likely cause these interactions which is potentially useful to design drugs that can block that mechanism. This computational work is meant to function as a comprehensive \"guide\" to support other researchers in their exploration of new ways to protect against the novel coronavirus.

On the same day, public health officials announced a further revision to classify the novel virus as a class A agent (a pathogen that can cause an epidemic in a short time). Some non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs), including intensive contact tracing followed by quarantine of individuals potentially exposed to the disease, and isolation of infected, symptomatic individuals, were implemented, but their effectiveness during the early stage is questionable. ","EDICTS is implemented in a simulated NHI-IC card execution environment. EDICTS prototype block diagram is shown in Fig. 6 . The characteristics of the EDICTS prototype are as follows:","Like SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the recent SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the Betacoronavirus genus [12] . It has a genome size of~30 kilobases which, like other coronaviruses, encodes for multiple structural and non-structural proteins. The structural proteins include the spike (S) protein, the envelope (E) protein, the membrane (M) protein, and the nucleocapsid (N) protein. With SARS-CoV-2 being discovered very recently, there is currently a lack of immunological information available about the virus (e.g., information about immunogenic epitopes eliciting antibody or T cell responses). Preliminary studies suggest that SARS-CoV-2 is quite similar to SARS-CoV based on the full-length genome phylogenetic analysis [9, 12] , and the putatively similar cell entry mechanism and human cell receptor usage [9, 13, 14] . Due to this apparent similarity between the two viruses, previous research that has provided an understanding of protective immune responses against SARS-CoV may potentially be leveraged to aid vaccine development for SARS-CoV-2.","full-length sequence) to examine the probability of solubility, flexibility and GRAVY. This functionality enables protein biochemists to plan their experiments and opt for the domains or regions with high probability of solubility. Furthermore, we implemented a simulated annealing algorithm that maximised the probability of solubility for a given region by generating a list of regions with extended boundaries. Users can also predict the improvement in solubility by selecting a commonly used solubility tag or a custom tag.","Abrar Ahmad Chughtai had testing of filtration of masks by 3 M for his PhD more than 5 years ago. 3 M products were not used in his research.

However, some recent human Like SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the recent SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the Betacoronavirus genus (Lu et al., 2020) . It has a genome size of ~30 kilobases which, like other coronaviruses, encodes for multiple structural and non-structural proteins. The structural proteins include the spike (S) protein, the envelope (E) protein, the membrane (M) protein, and the nucleocapsid (N) protein. With SARS-CoV-2 being discovered very recently, there is currently a lack of immunological information available about the virus (e.g., information about immunogenic epitopes eliciting antibody or T cell responses). Preliminary studies suggest that SARS-CoV-2 is quite similar to SARS-CoV based on the full-length genome phylogenetic analysis (Lu et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2020) , and the putatively similar cell entry mechanism and human cell receptor usage (Hoffmann et al., 2020; Letko &amp; Munster, 2020; Zhou et al., 2020) . Due to this apparent similarity between the two viruses, previous research that has provided an understanding of protective immune responses against SARS-CoV may potentially be leveraged to aid vaccine development for SARS-CoV-2.","The peculiar experimental signature of aggregate-forming compounds can be used to distinguish them from specific, well-behaved inhibitors, 23, 24, 28 and several research groups have used these characteristics to triage their screening hits for potential promiscuity. 12, [28] [29] [30] [31] [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] [40] [41] [42] The appropriate experiments range in complexity and intensity from a rapid biochemical assay to a much more laborious microscopy study. Depending on the purposes of the research effort, these experiments can be tailored appropriately. For most early-stage discovery programs, the following experiments are performed to answer the question: Is this hit likely inhibiting the screening target as an aggregate? If the answer is yes, it is unlikely that the hit will be a favorable starting point for lead design and it should be dropped from further consideration immediately, as the pain of throwing out compounds early in the process pales in comparison to the agony of abandoning leads that have been through several nonproductive development cycles. If the answer to the above question is no, then one element of the hit's potential has been reassuringly established. The necessary experiments and examples of their recent application in drug discovery projects are described below; detailed recipes for performing these assays have been described elsewhere. 43 ","More far reaching for security operations management was the Homeland Security Act of 2002 (PL 107-296). This Act created the most significant change in government structure since establishment of the Department of Defense through the National Security Act of 1947. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) resulted from the merging of 22 federal agencies with a mandate to establish a safe and secure homeland. The impact on security operations didn't end at the federal level. Additionally, Homeland Security Presidential Directive/HSPD-5 tasked DHS to develop and administer a National Incident Management System (NIMS) and a National response plan (Nrp). The private sector was to participate in the process. Within a few years following 9/11, every state government and the District of Columbia established an entity to find ways to protect communities from terrorist risks. This structure also facilitated a practical objective: state governments were now able to receive funding from DHS and other entities concerned with protection. The net effect of DHS was to channel billions of dollars for security products, services, systems, and research throughout the nation. Furthermore, agencies within DHS encouraged and mandated changes in security practices in the private sector.","The ability to limit and control local transmission following introduction depends, however, on the application and execution of strict measures of detection, prevention and control. These include heightened surveillance, rapid identification of suspect cases followed by patient transfer and isolation, rapid diagnosis, tracing and follow-up of potential contacts [1] . The application of such a vast technical and operational set of interventions depends on countries' public health and laboratory infrastructures and resources.","Because of the exceptional nature of the unfolding events, there is little available evidence to compare our results to. Recent studies, based on the analysis of digital traces and contact surveys, have demonstrated that NPIs were effective in containing the COVID-19 outbreak in China (8, 18, 22) .

The ComputeCanada Graham heterogeneous cluster was leveraged to generate these predictions. Boasting more than 41,000 cores and 520 GPU devices across 1,185 nodes, this HPC cluster enabled the rapid computation and compilation of these predictions. Computational research related to the COVID-19 pandemic has been assigned increased priority which expedited the generation of these predictions.","Let us do so within the framework of co-operation -not confrontation -between the public and private sectors. Such co-operation is a necessary condition for competitiveness and is thus a key objective of the Business Council. In the wake of 11 September, co-operation between the public and private sectors reached an unprecedented degree of cohesion in the design and execution of strategies in response to a scenario that was very different from past crises.","With 565 confirmed cases (3) and still counting, COVID-19 now looks certain to cause sustained local transmission within Australia. Therefore, at this time it is reasonable to reflect on the value of travel restrictions imposed to date, and to consider the benefit of ongoing travel restrictions in the coming weeks and months, when community transmission starts to increase. We answer these questions using OAG-travel data and a meta-population model for disease transmission. First we examine the counterfactuals: what would have happened had the travel ban from Wuhan/China not been implemented. Similarly we examine the impacts of bans to other emerging epicentres including Iran, Italy, and South Korea. We then examine the impacts for the future and compare the cases expected through community transmission, and from importation over the next 2 months.","Public-health security transcends borders. In the face of global infectious-disease emergencies, countries have a responsibility to be transparent in their reporting and actions, both to their own populations and to the international community, in order to facilitate and accelerate cooperation that will ultimately curtail outbreaks and minimize harm. The initial global response to the 2019-nCoV outbreak illustrates the power of rapid communication and the importance of sustained research and collaborations that can be leveraged in future outbreaks. Sustained cooperation is essential to their resolution.","Finally, if the surge in patients comes as a tsunami as it did in Italy and Wuhan, Condition Zero will require stretching the infrastructure and manpower beyond the breaking point. In this scenario, ACS surgeons should focus on just ICU patient care, and non-ACS surgeons cover trauma and EGS in a tiered response. Non-emergent cases should not be performed, and non-operative modalities should be pursued if possible for all urgent disease processes. The export of urgent EGS cases may be required to other centers Advanced triage criteria with consideration of available resources, expected increase in surge volume, patient risk factors, and principles of justice and value unfortunately must be considered for the continuation and betterment of our society. Novel ventilation strategies should be pursued whenever able, and even emergent non-COVID care may need to be triaged or suspended for certain disease processes if the system, facility, and providers are over-leveraged. At this level COVID-19+ healthcare workers may need to continue treating COVID-19 patients given the extreme attrition of personnel at this level.","Metagenomic analysis can also be leveraged in response to viral outbreaks, for example to rapidly determine viral subtypes in a novel infection source. This has been applied to cases of influenza infections as well as for a novel wild type Ebola virus outbreak, for which metagenomic approaches could correctly identify the causative agent, even in cases where traditional methods were unsuccessful because the wild type virus was too distantly related to known Ebola viruses. A correct and rapid identification of these viruses could enable the application of the correct therapeutics and guide preventive efforts against potential epidemics.","Seg\u00fan recomienda el National Institute for Health and Care Excellence , para el paciente neutrop\u00e9nico que no re\u00fane las caracter\u00edsticas antes mencionadas, la elecci\u00f3n de tratamiento emp\u00edrico inicial (TEI) es la monoterapia.

Our findings show that NPIs, inter-city travel restrictions, social distancing and contact reductions, as well as early case detection and isolations, have substantially reduced COVID-19 transmission across China, with the effectiveness of different interventions varying. The early detection and isolation of cases was estimated to prevent more infections than travel restrictions and contact reductions, but integrated NPIs would achieve the strongest and most rapid effect. Our findings contribute to improved understanding of integrated NPI measures on COVID-19 containment and can help in tailoring control strategies across contexts.","Finally, we have demonstrated that the S318-510 protein fragment formulated with clinically useful adjuvants (alum and CpG ODN) elicited strong immune responses in mice. We are planning to conduct SARS-CoV challenge experiments in mice and ferrets to study whether our vaccine can protect against SARS-CoV infection.","Array analysis of aCGH experiments is typically conducted on signal ratios between a reference and experimental hybridization. Duplications or deletions in the experimental samples are evident as non-zero values of the log ratio of the two normalized signals. So-called segmentation algorithms examine this log ratio across multiple positions in reference sequence to determine the boundaries of the variations [34,35]. The most accurate methods consider not just individual probes, but a context of probes around a genomic location, and can identify even small polymorphisms between the strains. These analyses require both a reference signal and a reference coordinate system on which the probes are tiled. Usually a whole-genome tiling is constructed for a single reference strain, but because PanArray provides a whole-genome tiling for every reference strain included in the array, the same array design can be used to perform segmentation analysis against any reference strain on the array.","CC carried out IFN induction experiments and drafted the manuscript. LB carried out IFN induction experiments. EL, CA, and GR performed molecular analysis and immunoassays. IA, FP, and MRC participated in the study design and helped to draft the manuscript. All authors read and approved the final manuscript.","In this subsection, we carry out two experiments to verify the nonoverlapping closed pattern mining ability and the performance of NetNCSP. 480 We used the DNA1 database to conduct the first experiment to mine patterns with pattern lengths 2 to 7. The parameters are len= [1, 1000] , gap=[0,100], and In conclusion, NetNCSP compresses the patterns effectively and outperforms competitive algorithms.","The first 18 cases reported had travel history connecting them to Wuhan, China, thus considered evidence of ongoing local transmission, we leveraged viral load data collected 5 for multiple time enables us to infer time of infection (i.e., before or after arrival to Singapore). 69 70","Detection array analysis offers the opportunity to understand microarray behavior in much greater detail, because the samples analyzed are produced from genomic DNA. Sequences are known for many microbial genomes, and standard laboratory techniques exist to measure the concentration of DNA in a sample. Therefore, one can design experiments in which sample DNA molecules with known degrees of similarity to probe sequences are present, at a wide range of known concentrations. The wealth of information available in these experiments makes it possible to develop detection algorithms based on models, in which the probe signal given the presence of a target organism at some concentration is predicted from the probe and target genome sequences. After fitting model parameters from experiments with known samples, one can solve the inverse problem to find the targets that best explain the observed array data for an unknown sample.","Respiratory infections are the leading cause of death in low-or middle-income countries (LMICs) and account for an estimated four million deaths annually [1] . Before the recent emergence of SARS-CoV-2, much research focused on influenza, which causes worldwide annual epidemics of seasonal resulting in 3 to 5 million cases of severe illness, and approximately 250,000 to 500,000 deaths [2] . In the US, influenza causes on average of 226,000 hospitalizations and 3,000 to 49, 000 deaths each year [3, 4] . Control of influenza in children is an acute public health problem because attack rates (i.e., the proportion of the population infected) in unvaccinated children are estimated to average 12.7% [5] and exceed 30% during pandemic years [6] . Children also amplify the outbreak as they infect their peers and families, creating greater opportunities for further transmission in the community. [7, 8] For rapidly emerging outbreaks such as novel strains of influenza or SARS-CoV-2, pharmaceutical measures may be unavailable or less effective, and non-pharmaceutical intervention measures (NPIs) need to be used [9, 10] . NPIs are divided by the World Health Organization into categories of personal protection, social distancing, travel and environment measures [11] . However, when the WHO systematically reviewed all studies supporting each NPI for controlling pandemic influenza, it found gaps in the evidence base for many of the measures [11] . In this study, our goal is to use a computational model to examine the policy of symptom-based isolation -a form of social distancing. Under this NPI, individuals who are showing fever due to a respiratory infection are required to remain in isolation until their symptoms subside, normally followed by an additional period of one day free of fever (or antipyretic medications or steroids). The CDC currently recommends this NPI for controlling pandemic influenza and controlling influenza in schools [12, 13] . The buffer period of 1 day helps reduce transmission by keeping people in isolation when their fever symptoms temporarily subside. It also prevents transmission from viral shedding that often continues past the last episode of fever [14] . This NPI is often referred to as fever absenteeism or return-to-school policy in the context of schools.","For fusion experiments, Pair-wise Student t-tests were used to compare the outcome of a manipulation on fusion as compared to the control. Error bars are SEM (n \u2265 3).","The outbreak of COVID-19 posed an emergency of international concern and challenges in the absence of specific therapeutic treatment and vaccine. On March 11, 2020 COVID-19 has been declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO). The nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) are necessary to prevent person-to-person transmission of COVID-19. So far, a series of measurements have been implemented in China. The isolation of infected cases and quarantine of humans exposed to the cases were the most common public health measures. The .

The team used an integrated knowledge translation approach, with consultation from the knowledge users from the WHO at the following stages: question development, interpretation of results, and draft report. We used the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) Statement 3 to guide the reporting of our rapid review results; a PRISMA extension for rapid reviews is currently under development. This rapid review of guidelines was completed in conjunction with a rapid overview of systematic reviews published in a separate report titled: Preventing respiratory illness in older adults aged 60 years and above living in long-term care: A rapid overview of reviews\".","In summary, detailed computational analyses showed that the designed peptide binders were quite reasonable, as indicated by the recapitulation of critical binding interactions at the proteinpeptide interface and the introduction of new favorable binding interactions, as well as the preservation of secondary structures to maintain these interactions. We have selected dozens of designed peptides (with/without evolutionary information) that had good EvoEF2 binding energy to SARS-CoV-2 RBD to perform wet-lab experimental validation on. Specifically, we are carrying out in vitro experiments to determine their binding affinity and inhibitory potency, as well as in vivo experiments to examine their potential to disrupt the binding of SARS-CoV-2 to hACE2. Due to the urgent situation caused by COVID-19 worldwide, we would like to share our computational data to the scientific community so that researchers can work together to test them. Although we do not have experimental data yet, we believe that our computational results are well examined and reasonable, and these data may help favorably combat the COVID-19 pandemic.","Vero cell monolayers in six-well plates were transfected in triplicate with the indicated plasmids utilizing the Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's directions. Concurrently, Vero cell monolayers in six-well plates were transfected with the plasmid encoding the ACE2 receptor protein utilizing the Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's directions. At 24 h post-transfection, cells containing the mutant plasmids, the ACE2 receptor, and normal untransfected cells were washed with TBS -Ca/ Mg, trypsinized, and overlayed in a single well of a sixwell plate at a ratio of 2 ml (cells transfected with the ACE2 receptor):0.5 ml (cells transfected with the mutant):1.5 ml (untransfected cells). All of the cells transfected with ACE2 were pooled to ensure that every well had an equal amount of cells with receptor expressed on their surface. After incubation for 24 h, the cells were washed with TBS -Ca/Mg and fixed with ice-cold methanol. Immunohistochemistry was performed by utilizing the Vector Laboratories Vectastain Elite ABC kit essentially as described in the manufacturer's directions. Briefly, cells were washed with TBS -Ca/Mg and incubated in TBS blocking buffer supplemented with normal horse serum at room temperature for 1 h. After blocking, cells were reacted with anti-FLAG antibody (1:500) in TBS blocking buffer for 3 h, washed four times with TBS -Ca/Mg, and incubated with biotinylated horse antimouse antibody. Excess antibody was removed by four washes with TBS -Ca/Mg and subsequently incubated with Vectastain Elite ABC reagent for 30 min. Finally, cells were washed three times with TBS -Ca/Mg, and reactions were developed with NovaRed substrate (Vector Laboratories) according to the manufacturer's directions. The average size of syncytia for each mutant was determined by analyzing the area of approximately 300 syncytia, from digital images, using the Image Pro Plus 5.0 software package. The averages were then converted to percentages of the average syncytia size of the wild-type SARS-CoV S. Error bars shown represent the standard deviations calculated through comparison of the data from each of three experiments.

Therefore, integrated NPIs would achieve the strongest and most rapid effect on COVID-19 outbreak containment ( Table 1 ).","The need for excellence in clinical care does not end simply with the referral. In an urban population in Guinea-Bissau, 45% of children under 5 years were hospitalized, and the in-hospital mortality was 12% in 2007 (34), compared with an inpatient mortality of 0.84% in the US in 2009\u20132010 (35). Challenges in presentation, triage, initial management, and admission to the hospital setting prompted guideline development and interventions for improved patient outcomes. Nolan et al. demonstrated that more than half of children were undertreated or inappropriately treated with antibiotics, fluids, or oxygen in 21 hospitals across seven countries in Asia and Africa (36).","Dr. Ali drafted the initial manuscript. Dr. Baloch reviewed the manuscript and edited it. Dr. Ahmed supervised the execution of the entire project. Dr. Ali conceptualized the idea and contributed in the initial draft.","We hypothesize that disruption of the viral SARS-CoV-2-RBD-host ACE2 interaction with 72 peptide-based binders will prevent virus entry into human cells, offering a novel opportunity for 73 therapeutic intervention. Toward this aim, we launched a campaign to rapidly discover peptide 74 binders to SARS-CoV-2-RBD. Analyzing the RBD-ACE2 co-crystal structure, we found that 75 SARS-CoV-2-RBD/ACE2 interface spans a large elongated surface area, as is common for PPIs. 76 .

Using bio-layer interferometry, we determined that SBP1 binds 79 SARS-CoV-2-RBD with low nanomolar affinity (dissociation constant, K D = 47 nM). SBP1 is a 80 first-in-class peptide binder to SARS-CoV-2-RBD, potentially inhibiting entry of the virus into 81 human cells. In addition, the human protein-derived sequence of SBP1 is fully proteinogenic, and 82","To assess how well the model recapitulates what we currently know about COVID-19 we conduct a simulation of the basic model and investigate the distributions of time between events, as shown in Figure 2 . We observe a time from infection to becoming symptomatic between approximately 2 and 14 days with a mode around day 6. Time from symptomatic to sick is observed to peak at 7 to 8 days and time from hospitalisation to death varies between 1 and 10 days approximately. To compare the initial trajectories for mortalities and hospitalised with what has been observed in Italy and the United Kingdom, we overlay data for either country as shown in Figure 3 .","In order to get a better idea of the implications of the results we take a closer look at the protein structures predicted by the DeepTracer and Phenix for the EMD-6272 density map (rotavirus VP6) and compare them to the solved structure (see Fig 9) . We can see in the highlighted areas that the DeepTracer incorrectly connected amino acids in two cases. However, all predicted amino acids are still connected as a single chain. In comparison to that the prediction of Phenix is fragmented into multiple chains. Furthermore, amino acids appear to be missing from the prediction explaining the coverage difference of 8.1% (see Table 1 ). The predicted secondary structure elements in the Phenix prediction, particularly for sheets, appear also much less accurate than the ones made by the DeepTracer. Another noteworthy observation, although not a fair comparison as Phenix predicts more than just the backbone structure, is that the prediction runtime of Phenix for the EMD-6272 map was 1 hour and 45 minutes while the runtime of the DeepTracer for the same map was 40 seconds. As mentioned in the introduction, a central goal of the DeepTracer was to improve the runtime of protein structure predictions. This makes it possible to predict ever larger density maps which allows for a more versatile application of the method. In order to compare the runtime of the Deep-Tracer with the C-CNN method we measure the execution time of each method for the prediction of multiple density maps. A scatter plot of the measured times is depicted in Fig 10.   Fig 10. Scatter plot of prediction runtimes (y-axis) of the DeepTracer (blue) and the C-CNN method (red) for various density maps against the number of predicted atoms (x-axis). In order to see the runtimes more clearly, we use a logarithmic scale with a base of 4.","Soon after its founding, DHS created a National Infrastructure Protection Plan (NIPP). The developmental process identified 17 critical infrastructure sectors encompassing both public and private interests. These 17 sectors were considered \"so vital to the united States that their incapacity or destruction would have a debilitating impact on national security, national economic security, and national public health of safety, or any combination of these matters\" (Box 2.4). While terrorism served as an impetus for the creation of the NIpp, public/private cooperation has been enhanced through more efficient responses to major emergencies such as hurricanes. NIpp initiated voluntary private sector councils to advise on how to strengthen security in the sector by cooperation and the institution of best practices. The private sector participates in all the national infrastructure partnerships, except those exclusively concerned with government issues.","In bilayer experiments, addition of approximately threefold molar excess of affinity-purified antibody recognizing the N-terminal domain of SARS-CoV E protein to the CIS chamber significantly reduced (P z 0.005, n = 4 experiments) the current amplitude in NaCl solution as illustrated for one of the experiments in Fig. 5 . In contrast, addition of the antibody to the TRANS chamber did not affect ion channel conductance (Fig. 5) . In separate experiments (not shown), the antibody did not affect ion channel conductance due to HCV p7 in planar lipid bilayers.","Our results suggest that the dynamics of the 2019-2020 influenza season were impacted directly through transmission-reducing behaviors resulting from COVID-19 risk perception or indirectly through ecological interference between the two infections. While COVID-19 testing remains limited, researchers have advocated using existing sources of ILI tracking for COVID-19 surveillance. In addition to this strategy, we suggest that the interaction between a novel and circulating pathogen due to shared preventative behaviors or a shared susceptible pool can be leveraged to understand circulation of the former."],"title":["Newly discovered coronavirus as the primary cause of severe acute respiratory syndrome","Predicting the impacts of epidemic outbreaks on global supply chains: A

Making the problem worse, there is no specific antiviral drug that can be used to treat COVID-19 to date. SARS-CoV-2 initiates its entry into human cells by binding to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) via the receptor binding domain (RBD) of its spike protein. Therefore, molecules that can block SARS-CoV-2 from binding to hACE2 may potentially prevent the virus from entering human cells and serve as an effective antiviral drug. Based on this idea, we designed a series of peptides that can strongly bind to SARS-CoV-2 RBD in computational experiments. Specifically, we first constructed a 31-mer peptidic scaffold by linking two fragments grafted from hACE2 (a.a. 22-44 and 351-357) with a linker glycine, and then redesigned the peptide sequence to enhance its binding affinity to SARS-CoV-2 RBD. Compare with several computational s...","Abstract Epidemic outbreaks are a special case of supply chain (SC) risks which is distinctively characterized by a long-term disruption existence, disruption propagations (i.e., the ripple effect), and high uncertainty. We present the results of a simulation study that opens some new research tensions on the impact of COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) on the global SCs. First, we articulate the specific features that frame epidemic outbreaks as a unique type of SC disruption risks. Second, we demonstrate how simulation-based methodology can be used to examine and predict the impacts of epidemic outbreaks on the SC performance using the example of coronavirus COVID-19 and anyLogistix simulation and optimization software. We offer an analysis for observing and predicting both short-term and long-term impacts of epidemic outbreaks on the SCs along with managerial insights. A set of sensitivity experiments for different scenarios allows illustrating the model\u2019s behavior and its value for decision-mak...","Abstract In this paper, we propose the daily computed weighted averaging basic reproduction number R 0 , k , \u03c9 n for Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) outbreak in South Korea, May to July 2015. We use an SIR model with piecewise constant parameters \u03b2 (contact rate) and \u03b3 (removed rate). We use the explicit Euler\u2019s method for the solution of the SIR model and a nonlinear least-square fitting procedure for finding the best parameters. In R 0 , k , \u03c9 n , the parameters n , k , and w denote days from a reference date, the number of days in averaging, and a weighting factor, respectively. We perform a series of numerical experiments and compare the results with the real-world data. In particular, using the predicted reproduction number based on the previous two consecutive reproduction numbers, we can predict the future behavior of the reproduction number.","Abstract Recent publications have brought attention to the possible benefit of chloroquine, a broadly used antimalarial drug, in the treatment of patients infected by the novel emerged coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2). The scientific community should consider this information in light of previous experiments with chloroquine in the field of antiviral research.","AbstractWuhan Novel Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak has become a global outbreak which has raised the concern of scientific community to design and discover a definitive cure against this deadly virus which has caused deaths of numerous infected people upon infection and spreading. To date, no antiviral therapy or vaccine is available which can effectively combat the infection caused by this virus. This study was conducted to design possible epitope-based subunit vaccines against the SARS-CoV-2 virus using the approaches of reverse vaccinology and immunoinformatics. Upon continual computational experimentation three possible vaccine constructs were designed and one vaccine construct was selected as the best vaccine based on molecular docking study which is supposed to effectively act against SARS-CoV-2. Later, molecular dynamics simulation and in silico codon adaptation experiments were carried out in order to check biological stability and find effective mass production strate...","Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is an infectious disease caused by a novel coronavirus that cost nearly 800 lives. While there have been no recent outbreaks of the disease, the threat remains as SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) like strains still exist in animal reservoirs. Therefore, the development of a vaccine against SARS is in grave need. Here, we have designed and produced a prototypic SARS vaccine: a self-assembling polypeptide nanoparticle that repetitively displays a SARS B-cell epitope from the C-terminal heptad repeat of the virus\u2019 spike protein. Biophysical analyses with circular dichroism, transmission electron microscopy and dynamic light scattering confirmed the computational design showing \u03b1-helcial nanoparticles with sizes of about 25 nm. Immunization experiments with no adjuvants were performed with BALB/c mice. An investigation of the binding properties of the elicited antibodies showed that they were highly conformation specific for the coiled-coil epitope becau...","Abstract Due to serotype variations among different avian infectious bronchitis viruses isolated in Tunisia since 2000, protection of chicks, especially broiler flocks, with Mass H120 vaccine often fails. Therefore, association of CR88 (793B type) with H120 vaccines was used for better response. Challenge experiments were then conducted to evaluate tracheal and renal cross-protection in chickens immunized via nasal and eye drops. Conferred protection was measured by clinical signs and macroscopic lesions observed, based on scores attributed according to their severities. The results showed a low protection conferred by H120 alone, as vaccination did not reduce tracheal and kidney lesions (70% scored as 3) after TN20/00 virus challenge, which also led to 10% mortality. Conversely, the challenge results indicated that the combination of the 2 strains (H120/CR88) allow high protection. Based on the results of the challenge experiments, a vaccination protocol coupling CR88 to H120 was appl...","The burgeoning epidemic caused by novel coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV) is currently a global concern. Angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) is a receptor of 2019-nCoV spike 1 protein (S1) and mediates viral entry into host cells. Despite the abundance of ACE2 in small intestine, few digestive symptoms are observed in patients infected by 2019-nCoV. Herein, we investigated the interactions between ACE2 and human defensins (HDs) specifically secreted by intestinal Paneth cells. The lectin-like HD5, rather than HD6, bound ACE2 with a high affinity of 39.3 nM and weakened the subsequent recruitment of 2019-nCoV S1. The cloak of HD5 on the ligand-binding domain of ACE2 was confirmed by molecular dynamic simulation. A remarkable dose-dependent preventive effect of HD5 on 2019-nCoV S1 binding to intestinal epithelial cells was further evidenced by in vitro experiments. Our findings unmasked the innate defense function of lectin-like intestinal defensin against 2019-nCoV, which may provide new ...","Abstract Purpose To examine the feasibility of using a computer tool for stratifying the severity of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) based on computed tomography (CT) images. Materials and methods We retrospectively examined 44 confirmed COVID-19 cases. All cases were evaluated separately by radiologists (visually) and through an in-house computer software. The degree of lesions was visually scored by the radiologist, as follows, for each of the 5 lung lobes: 0, no lesion present; 1, &lt;1/3 involvement; 2, &gt;1/3 and &lt; 2/3 involvement; and 3, &gt;2/3 involvement. Lesion density was assessed based on the proportion of ground-glass opacity (GGO), consolidation and fibrosis of the lesions. The parameters obtained using the computer tool included lung volume (mL), lesion volume (mL), lesion percentage (%), and mean lesion density (HU) of the whole lung, right lung, left lung, and each lobe. The scores obtained by the radiologists and quantitative results generated by the computer software wer...","As the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak is ongoing, the number of individuals to be tested for COVID-19 is rapidly increasing. For safe and efficient screening for COVID-19, drive-through (DT) screening centers have been designed and implemented in Korea. Herein, we present the overall concept, advantages, and limitations of the COVID-19 DT screening centers. The steps of the DT centers include registration, examination, specimen collection, and instructions. The entire service takes about 10 minutes for one testee without leaving his or her cars. Increased testing capacity over 100 tests per day and prevention of cross-infection between testees in the waiting space are the major advantages, while protection of staff from the outdoor atmosphere is challenging. It could be implemented in other countries to cope with the global COVID-19 outbreak and transformed according to their own situations.","Background: The COVID-19 outbreak containment strategies in China based on non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) appear to be effective. Quantitative research is still needed however to assess the efficacy of different candidate NPIs and their timings to guide ongoing and future responses to epidemics of this emerging disease across the World. Methods: We built a travel network-based susceptible-exposed-infectious-removed (SEIR) model to simulate the outbreak across cities in mainland China. We used epidemiological parameters estimated for the early stage of outbreak in Wuhan to parameterise the transmission before NPIs were implemented. To quantify the relative effect of various NPIs, daily changes of delay from illness onset to the first reported case in each county were used as a proxy for the improvement of case identification and isolation across the outbreak. Historical and near-real time human movement data, obtained from Baidu location-based service, were used to derive the i...","The nucleocapsid (N) protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus (SARS-CoV) is a major virion structural protein. In this study, two epitopes (N1 and N2) of the N protein of SARS-CoV were predicted by bioinformatics analysis. After immunization with two peptides, the peptides-specific antibodies were isolated from the immunized rabbits. The further experiments demonstrated that N1 peptide-induced polyclonal antibodies had a high affinity to bind to E. coli expressed N protein of SARS-CoV. Furthermore, it was confirmed that N1 peptide-specific IgG antibodies were detectable in the sera of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) patients. The results indicated that an epitope of the N protein has been identified and N protein specific Abs were produced by peptide immunization, which will be useful for the study of SARS-CoV.","Using a sensitive research-grade infrared camera, we find that common facial cosmetics and lotions mask skin temperature in assays of the human forehead. We test a family of 10 commonly-used cosmetic products and find that volatile liquids and creams lower thermal skin temperature by at least 2 C for up to 5-10 min and at least 1 C for up to 20 min, respectively. Powder and cream that contains brightening agent lower indefinitely the skin temperature sensed by infrared camera. With the qualification that these experiments were performed in a controlled laboratory setting rather than the mass crowd screening environment where infrared temperature sensing of humans sees widespread use, our tests suggest that for human subjects whose face was treated with certain cosmetics and lotions, infrared-based screening for elevated facial temperature (fever) can be unreliable.","Ginkgolic acids (GA) are alkylphenol constituents of the leaves and fruits of Ginkgo biloba. GA has shown pleiotropic effects in vitro, including: antitumor effects through inhibition of lipogenesis; decreased expression of invasion associated proteins through AMPK activation; and potential rescue of amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) induced synaptic impairment. GA was also reported to have activity against Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus. Several mechanisms for this activity have been suggested including: SUMOylation inhibition; blocking formation of the E1-SUMO intermediate; inhibition of fatty acid synthase; non-specific SIRT inhibition; and activation of protein phosphatase type-2C. Here we report that GA inhibits Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) by inhibition of both fusion and viral protein synthesis. Additionally, we report that GA inhibits human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) genome replication and Zika virus (ZIKV) infection of normal human astrocytes (NHA). We show a broad spectrum of fus...","As of March 23, 2020 there have been over 354,000 confirmed cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in over 180 countries, the World Health Organization characterized COVID-19 as a pandemic, and the United States (US) announced a national state of emergency.1, 2, 3 In parts of China and Italy the demand for intensive care (IC) beds was higher than the number of available beds.4, 5 We sought to build an accessible interactive model that could facilitate hospital capacity planning in the presence of significant uncertainty about the proportion of the population that is COVID-19+ and the rate at which COVID-19 is spreading in the population. Our approach was to design a tool with parameters that hospital leaders could adjust to reflect their local data and easily modify to conduct sensitivity analyses. We developed a model to facilitate hospital planning with estimates of the number of Intensive Care (IC) beds, Acute Care (AC) beds, and ventilators necessary to accommodate patients w...","Abstract A novel coronavirus has been identified as an etiological agent of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). To rapidly identify anti-SARS drugs available for clinical use, we screened a set of compounds that included antiviral drugs already in wide use. Here we report that the HIV-1 protease inhibitor, nelfinavir, strongly inhibited replication of the SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV). Nelfinavir inhibited the cytopathic effect induced by SARS-CoV infection. Expression of viral antigens was much lower in infected cells treated with nelfinavir than in untreated infected cells. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis showed that nelfinavir could decrease the production of virions from Vero cells. Experiments with various timings of drug addition revealed that nelfinavir exerted its effect not at the entry step, but at the post-entry step of SARS-CoV infection. Our results suggest that nelfinavir should be examined clinically for the treatment of SARS and has potential as a good lead compound fo...","AbstractSARS-CoV-2, a novel coronavirus (CoV), has recently emerged causing an ongoing outbreak of viral pneumonia around the world. While genetically distinct from the original SARS-CoV, both group 2B CoVs share similar genome organization and origins to coronaviruses harbored in bats. Importantly, initial guidance has used insights from SARS-CoV infection to inform treatment and public health strategies. In this report, we evaluate type-I Interferon (IFN-I) sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 relative to the original SARS-CoV. Our results indicate that while SARS-CoV-2 maintains similar viral replication kinetics to SARS-CoV in Vero cell, the novel CoV is much more sensitive to IFN-I pretreatment. Examining transcriptional factor activation and interferon stimulated gene (ISG) induction, SARS-CoV-2 in the context of type I IFN induces phosphorylation of STAT1 and increased ISG proteins. In contrast, the original SARS-CoV has no evidence for STAT1 phosphorylation or ISG protein increases even i...","Abstract The outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) has drawn enormous attention and caused fear worldwide since early 2003. The disease appears to be under control now; however, the possible return of SARS must be emphasized. Although many clinical experiments have been reported, the treatment of SARS is largely anecdotal, and so far no treatment consensus has been reached. We summarize 14 clinical reports and attempt to assess the effectiveness of various treatment regimens. A combination treatment of steroids and ribavirin was widely used empirically from the outset of the epidemic. In general, the use of steroids for SARS seemed beneficial, but the optimal timing, dosage, and duration of treatment have not yet been determined. On the other hand, ribavirin administration apparently reduced neither the rate of intratracheal intubation nor that of mortality. Moreover, significant toxicity, such as hemolytic anemia, has been attributed to ribavirin. A few preliminary tria...","With respect to the asymptomatic transmission characteristics of the novel coronavirus that appeared in 2019 (COVID-19), a susceptible-asymptomatic-infected-recovered-death (SAIRD) model that considered human mobility was constructed in this study. The dissemination of COVID-19 was simulated using computational experiments to identify the mechanisms underlying the impact of city and residential lockdowns on controlling the spread of the epidemic. Results: The implementation of measures to lock down cities led to higher mortality rates in these cities, due to reduced mobility. Moreover, implementing city lockdown along with addition of hospital beds led to improved cure and reduced mortality rates. Stringent implementation and early lockdown of residential units effectively controlled the spread of the epidemic, and reduced the number of hospital bed requirements. Collectively, measures to lock down cities and residential units should be taken to prevent the spread of COVID-19. In addit...","Abstract This article summarizes the likely benefits of melatonin in the attenuation of COVID-19 based on its putative pathogenesis. The recent outbreak of COVID-19 has become a pandemic with tens of thousands of infected patients. Based on clinical features, pathology, the pathogenesis of acute respiratory disorder induced by either highly homogenous coronaviruses or other pathogens, the evidence suggests that excessive inflammation, oxidation, and an exaggerated immune response very likely contribute to COVID-19 pathology. This leads to a cytokine storm and subsequent progression to acute lung injury (ALI)/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and often death. Melatonin, a well-known anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative molecule, is protective against ALI/ARDS caused by viral and other pathogens. Melatonin is effective in critical care patients by reducing vessel permeability, anxiety, sedation use, and improving sleeping quality, which might also be beneficial for better clinic...","SummaryBackgroundThe 2019 new coronavirus, \u201c2019-nCoV\u201d, was discovered from Wuhan Viral Pneumonia cases in December 2019, and was named by the World Health Organization on January 12, 2020. In the early stage, people knows little about the 2019-nCoV virus was not clear, and the spread period was encountering China\u2019s annual spring migration, which made the epidemic spread rapidly from Wuhan to almost all provinces in China.MethodsThis study builds a SEIRD model that considers the movement of people across regions, revealing the effects of three measures on controlling the spread of the epidemic.Based on MATLAB R2017a, computational experiments were performed to simulate the epidemic prevention and control measures.FindingsThe research results show that current prevention and control measures in China are very necessary. This study further validates the concerns of international and domestic experts regarding asymptomatic transmission (E-status).InterpretationThe results of this study ar...","Abstract BACKGROUND: In December 2019, a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) infected pneumonia (COVID-19) occurred in Wuhan, China. Travel-associated cases have also been reported in other countries. The number of cases has increased rapidly but laboratory diagnosis is limited. METHODS: We collect two groups of cases diagnosed with COVID-19 for experiments. One group collected 63 samples for Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) IgG and IgM antibodies. The other group collected 91 plasma samples for colloidal gold-immunochromatographic assay (GICA). RESULTS: The sensitivity of the combined ELISA IgM and ELISA IgG detection was 55/63 ( 87.3%), The sensitivity of the combined GICA IgM and GICA IgG detection was 75/91 ( 82.4%), Both methods are negative for healthy controls, specificity of 100% .There is no significant difference between the sensitivity of between ELISA and GICA (IgM+ IgG). CONCLUSIONS: ELISA and GICA for specific IgM and IgG antibodies are conventional serological assays...","BACKGROUND: Experimental animal data show that protection against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) infection with human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) is feasible. For an effective immune prophylaxis in humans, broad coverage of different strains of SARS-CoV and control of potential neutralization escape variants will be required. Combinations of virus-neutralizing, noncompeting mAbs may have these properties. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Human mAb CR3014 has been shown to completely prevent lung pathology and abolish pharyngeal shedding of SARS-CoV in infected ferrets. We generated in vitro SARS-CoV variants escaping neutralization by CR3014, which all had a single P462L mutation in the glycoprotein spike (S) of the escape virus. In vitro experiments confirmed that binding of CR3014 to a recombinant S fragment (amino acid residues 318\u2013510) harboring this mutation was abolished. We therefore screened an antibody-phage library derived from blood of a convalescent SARS pat...","As of March 22, 2020, the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in the U.S. has reached nearly 30,000. While rapid and accessible diagnosis is paramount to monitoring and reducing the spread of disease, COVID-19 testing capabilities across the U.S. remain constrained. For many individuals, urgent care centers (UCCs) may offer the most accessible avenue to be tested. Through a phone survey, we describe the COVID-19 testing capabilities at UCCs and provide a snapshot highlighting the limited COVID-19 testing capabilities at UCCs in states with the greatest disease burden.","To control the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak, China undertook stringent traffic restrictions and self-quarantine measures. We herein examine the change in air pollution levels and the potentially avoided cause-specific mortality during this massive population quarantine episode. We found that, due to the quarantine, NO2 dropped by 22.8 \u03bcg/m3 and 12.9 \u03bcg/m3 in Wuhan and China, respectively. PM2.5 dropped by 1.4 \u03bcg/m3 in Wuhan but decreased by 18.9 \u03bcg/m3 across 367 cities. Our findings show that interventions to contain the COVID-19 outbreak led to air quality improvements that brought health benefits which outnumbered the confirmed deaths due to COVID-19 in China","SARS-CoV-2, a member of the coronavirus family, is responsible for the current COVID-19 pandemic. Based on our analysis of hepatitis C virus and coronavirus replication, and the molecular structures and activities of viral inhibitors, we previously demonstrated that three nucleotide analogues inhibit the SARS-CoV RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). Here, using polymerase extension experiments, we have demonstrated that the active triphosphate form of Sofosbuvir (a key component of the FDA approved hepatitis C drug EPCLUSA), is incorporated by SARS-CoV-2 RdRp, and blocks further incorporation. Using the same molecular insight, we selected the active triphosphate forms of three other anti-viral agents, Alovudine, AZT (an FDA approved HIV/AIDS drug) and Tenofovir alafenamide (TAF, an FDA approved drug for HIV and hepatitis B) for evaluation as inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 RdRp. We demonstrated the ability of these three viral polymerase inhibitors, 3\u2032-fluoro-3\u2032-deoxythymidine triphosphate, 3...","ABSTRACTCOVID-19 has caused a major epidemic worldwide, however, much is yet to be known about the epidemiology and evolution of the virus. One reason is that the challenges underneath sequencing HCoV-19 directly from clinical samples have not been completely tackled. Here we illustrate the application of amplicon and hybrid capture (capture)-based sequencing, as well as ultra-high-throughput metatranscriptomic (meta) sequencing in retrieving complete genomes, inter-individual and intra-individual variations of HCoV-19 from clinical samples covering a range of sample types and viral load. We also examine and compare the bias, sensitivity, accuracy, and other characteristics of these approaches in a comprehensive manner. This is, to date, the first work systematically implements amplicon and capture approaches in sequencing HCoV-19, as well as the first comparative study across methods. Our work offers practical solutions for genome sequencing and analyses of HCoV-19 and other emerging ...","Abstract Propagation of new human respiratory virus pathogens in established cell lines is hampered by a lack of predictability regarding cell line permissivity and by availability of suitable antibody reagents to detect infection in cell lines that do not exhibit significant cytopathic effect. Recently, molecular methods have been used to amplify and identify novel nucleic acid sequences directly from clinical samples, but these methods may be hampered by the quantity of virus present in respiratory secretions at different time points following the onset of infection. Human airway epithelial (HAE) cultures, which effectively mimic the human bronchial environment, allow for cultivation of a wide variety of human respiratory viral pathogens. The goal of the experiments described here was to determine if propagation and identification of a human respiratory virus may be achieved through inoculation of HAE cultures followed by whole transcriptome amplification (WTA) and sequence analysis....","Social conflicts occur frequently during the social transition period and the polarization of public opinion happens occasionally. By introducing the social preference theory, the target of this paper is to reveal the micro-interaction mechanism of public opinion polarization. Firstly, we divide the social preferences of Internet users (network nodes) into three categories: egoistic, altruistic, and fair preferences, and adopt the revenue function to define the benefits obtained by individuals with different preferences among their interaction process so as to analyze their decision-making behaviors driven by the revenue. Secondly, the revenue function is used to judge the exit rules of nodes in a network, and then a dynamic network of spreading public opinion with the node (individual) exit mechanism is built based on a BA scale-free network. Subsequently, the influences of different social preferences, as well as individual revenue on the effect of public opinion polarization, are an...","SARS-CoV (the SARS-Associated Coronavirus) was reported as a novel virus member in the coronavirus family, which was the cause of severe acute respiratory syndrome. Coronavirus replication occurs through a unique mechanism employing Leader sequence in the transcripts when initiating transcription from the genome. Therefore, we cloned the Leader sequence from SARS-CoV(BJ01), which is identical to that identified from SARS-CoV(HKU-39849), and constructed specific siRNA targeting the Leader sequence. Using EGFP and RFP reporter genes fused with the cloned SARS-CoV Leader sequence, we demonstrated that the siRNA targeting the Leader sequence decreased the mRNA abundance and protein expression levels of the reporter genes in 293T cells. By stably expressing the siRNA in Vero E6 cells, we provided data that the siRNA could effectively and specifically decrease the mRNA abundance of SARS-CoV genes as analyzed by RT-PCR and Northern blot. Our data indicated that the siRNA targeting the Leader ...","Abstract In 2002/2003, a novel coronavirus (CoV) caused a pandemic, infecting more than 8000 people, of whom nearly 10% died. This virus, termed severe acute respiratory syndrome-CoV was linked to a zoonotic origin from rhinolophid bats in 2005. Since then, numerous studies have described novel bat CoVs, including close relatives of the newly emerging Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV. In this paper we discuss CoV genomic properties and compare different taxonomic approaches in light of the technical difficulties of obtaining full genomic sequences directly from bat specimens. We first present an overview of the available studies on bat CoVs, with details on their chiropteran hosts, then comparatively analyze the increase in bat CoV studies and novel genomic sequences obtained since the SARS pandemic. We then conduct a comprehensive phylogenetic analysis of the genera Alpha- and Betacoronavirus, to show that bats harbour more CoV diversity than other mammalian hosts and are w...","SummarySARS-CoV-2, a member of the coronavirus family, has caused a global public health emergency.1 Based on our analysis of hepatitis C virus and coronavirus replication, and the molecular structures and activities of viral inhibitors, we previously reasoned that the FDA-approved heptatitis C drug EPCLUSA (Sofosbuvir/Velpatasvir) should inhibit coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2.2 Here, using model polymerase extension experiments, we demonstrate that the activated triphosphate form of Sofosbuvir is incorporated by low-fidelity polymerases and SARS-CoV RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), and blocks further incorporation by these polymerases; the activated triphosphate form of Sofosbuvir is not incorporated by a host-like high-fidelity DNA polymerase. Using the same molecular insight, we selected two other anti-viral agents, Alovudine and AZT (an FDA approved HIV/AIDS drug) for evaluation as inhibitors of SARS-CoV RdRp. We demonstrate the ability of two HIV reverse transcriptase inh...","The newly emerged Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is a highly pathogenic respiratory virus with pathogenic mechanisms that may be driven by innate immune pathways. The goal of this study is to characterize the expression of the structural (S, E, M, N) and accessory (ORF 3, ORF 4a, ORF 4b, ORF 5) proteins of MERS-CoV and to determine whether any of these proteins acts as an interferon antagonist. Individual structural and accessory protein-coding plasmids with an N-terminal HA tag were constructed and transiently transfected into cells, and their native expression and subcellular localization were assessed using Wes tern blotting and indirect immunofluorescence. While ORF 4b demonstrated majorly nuclear localization, all of the other proteins demonstrated cytoplasmic localization. In addition, for the first time, our experiments revealed that the M, ORF 4a, ORF 4b, and ORF 5 proteins are potent interferon antagonists. Further examination revealed that the ORF 4a ...","BACKGROUND: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) caused a global panic due to its high morbidity and mortality during 2002 and 2003. Soon after the deadly disease outbreak, the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) was identified as a functional cellular receptor in vitro and in vivo for SARS-CoV spike protein. However, ACE2 solely is not sufficient to allow host cells to become susceptible to SARS-CoV infection, and other host factors may be involved in SARS-CoV spike protein-ACE2 complex. RESULTS: A host intracellular filamentous cytoskeletal protein vimentin was identified by immunoprecipitation and LC-MS/MS analysis following chemical cross-linking on Vero E6 cells that were pre-incubated with the SARS-CoV spike protein. Moreover, flow cytometry data demonstrated an increase of the cell surface vimentin level by 16.5 % after SARS-CoV permissive Vero E6 cells were treated with SARS-CoV virus-like particles (VLPs). A direct interaction between SARS-CoV spike prot...","ABSTRARCTThe fast accumulation of viral metagenomic data has contributed significantly to new RNA virus discovery. However, the short read size, complex composition, and large data size can all make taxonomic analysis difficult. In particular, commonly used alignment-based methods are not ideal choices for detecting new viral species. In this work, we present a novel hierarchical classification model named CHEER, which can conduct read-level taxonomic classification from order to genus for new species. By combining k-mer embedding-based encoding, hierarchically organized CNNs, and carefully trained rejection layer, CHEER is able to assign correct taxonomic labels for reads from new species. We tested CHEER on both simulated and real sequencing data. The results show that CHEER can achieve higher accuracy than popular alignment-based and alignment-free taxonomic assignment tools. The source code, scripts, and pre-trained parameters for CHEER are available via GitHub: https://github.com/...","Abstract Sequential pattern mining (SPM) has been applied in many fields. However, traditional SPM neglects the pattern repetition in sequence. To solve this problem, gap constraint SPM was proposed and can avoid finding too many useless patterns. Nonoverlapping SPM, as a branch of gap constraint SPM, means that any two occurrences cannot use the same sequence letter in the same position as the occurrences. Nonoverlapping SPM can make a balance between efficiency and completeness. The frequent patterns discovered by existing methods normally contain redundant patterns. To reduce redundant patterns and improve the mining performance, this paper adopts the closed pattern mining strategy and proposes a complete algorithm, named Nettree for Nonoverlapping Closed Sequential Pattern (NetNCSP) based on the Nettree structure. NetNCSP is equipped with two key steps, support calculation and closeness determination. A backtracking strategy is employed to calculate the nonoverlapping support of a ...","Abstract Enveloped viruses exploit the existing routes of membrane traffic to enter and leave the host cell. The similarity between viral envelopes and cellular membranes has allowed the use of animal viruses as probes to examine aspects of intracellular traffic.","Abstract Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus (SARS-CoV) caused a severe outbreak in several regions of the world in 2003. The SARS-CoV genome is predicted to contain 14 functional open reading frames (ORFs). The first ORF (1a and 1b) encodes a large polyprotein that is cleaved into nonstructural proteins (nsp). The other ORFs encode for four structural proteins (spike, membrane, nucleocapsid and envelope) as well as eight SARS-CoV-specific accessory proteins (3a, 3b, 6, 7a, 7b, 8a, 8b and 9b). In this report we have cloned the predicted nsp8 gene and the ORF6 gene of the SARS-CoV and studied their abilities to interact with each other. We expressed the two proteins as fusion proteins in the yeast two-hybrid system to demonstrate protein\u2013protein interactions and tested the same using a yeast genetic cross. Further the strength of the interaction was measured by challenging growth of the positive interaction clones on increasing gradients of 2-amino trizole. The interact...","Objective The purpose of this study was to summarize 3 recent high-profile infectious disease threats that have affected the United States: severe acute respiratory syndrome, West Nile virus, and anthrax. Study design A systematic review was conducted with the use of Medline searches, searches of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website, and review by experts at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Results The 3 emerging infectious diseases pose very different threats: Severe acute respiratory syndrome is a newly identified pathogen that caused an international pandemic; the West Nile virus investigation involved an old pathogen that was identified in a new location; and the anthrax attacks involved the intentional introduction of a pathogen. Conclusion All 3 outbreaks highlight the importance of obstetrician-gynecologists keeping current with new information as it emerges. In this global environment, it is likely that novel disease threats will continue to eme...","This article is an updated version of the previous edition article by Stephen B. Thacker, David J. Sencer, volume 1, pp. 549\u2013555, \u00a9 2008, Elsevier Inc.","BACKGROUND: The first documented case of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) occurred in 2012, and outbreaks have continued ever since, mainly in Saudi Arabia. MERS-CoV is primarily diagnosed using a real-time RT-PCR assay, with at least two different genomic targets required for a positive diagnosis according to the case definition of The World Health Organization (WHO) as of 3 July 2013. Therefore, it is urgently necessary to develop as many specific genetic diagnostic methods as possible to allow stable diagnosis of MERS-CoV infections. METHODS: Reverse transcription-loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) is a genetic diagnostic method used widely for the detection of viral pathogens, which requires only a single temperature for amplification, and can be completed in less than 1 h. This study developed a novel RT-LAMP assay for detecting MERS-CoV using primer sets targeting a conserved nucleocapsid protein region. RESULTS: The RT-LAMP assay was capable ...","The recent spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) exemplifies the critical need for accurate and rapid diagnostic assays to prompt public health actions. Currently, several quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) assays are being used by clinical, research, and public health laboratories for rapid detection of the virus. However, it is currently unclear if results from different tests are comparable. Our goal was to evaluate the primer-probe sets used in four common diagnostic assays available on the World Health Organization (WHO) website. To facilitate this effort, we generated RNA transcripts to create standards and distributed them to other laboratories for internal validation. We then used these RNA transcript standards, full-length SARS-CoV-2 RNA, and RNA-spiked mock samples to determine analytical efficiency and sensitivity of nine primer-probe sets. We show that all primer-probe sets can be used to detect SARS-CoV-2, ...","BACKGROUND: The outcome of a viral infection is regulated by complex interactions of viral and host factors. SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) engages and regulates several innate immune response pathways during infection. We have previously shown that the SARS-CoV Papain-like Protease (PLpro) inhibits type I interferon (IFN) by inhibiting IRF3 phosphorylation thereby blocking downstream Interferon induction. This finding prompted us to identify other potential mechanisms of inhibition of PLpro on IFN induction. METHODS: We have used plasmids expressing PLpro and IRF3 including an IRF3 mutant that is constitutively active, called IRF3(5D). In these experiments we utilize transfections, chromatin immunoprecipitation, Electro-mobility Shift Assays (EMSA) and protein localization to identify where IRF3 and IRF3(5D) are inhibited by PLpro. RESULTS: Here we show that PLpro also inhibits IRF3 activation at a step after phosphorylation and that this inhibition is dependent on the de-ubiquitination ...","It has been reported that lactoferrin (LF) participates in the host immune response against Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) invasion by enhancing NK cell activity and stimulating neutrophil aggregation and adhesion. We further investigated the role of LF in the entry of SARS pseudovirus into HEK293E/ACE2-Myc cells. Our results reveal that LF inhibits SARS pseudovirus infection in a dose-dependent manner. Further analysis suggested that LF was able to block the binding of spike protein to host cells at 4\u00b0C, indicating that LF exerted its inhibitory function at the viral attachment stage. However, LF did not disrupt the interaction of spike protein with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the functional receptor of SARS-CoV. Previous studies have shown that LF colocalizes with the widely distributed cell-surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs). Our experiments have also confirmed this conclusion. Treatment of the cells with heparinase or exogenous hepar...","Novel Corona virus (COVID-19 or 2019-nCoV) is an emerging global health concern that requires a rapid diagnostic test. Quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) is currently the standard for COVID-19 detection; however, Reverse Transcription Loop-Mediated Isothermal Amplification (RT-LAMP) may allow for faster and cheaper field based testing at point-of-risk. The objective of this study was to develop a rapid screening diagnostic test that could be completed in under 30 minutes. Simulated patient samples were generated by spiking serum, urine, saliva, oropharyngeal swabs, and nasopharyngeal swabs with a portion of the COVID-19 nucleic sequence. The samples were tested using RT-LAMP as well as by conventional qRT-PCR. Specificity of the RT-LAMP was evaluated by also testing against other related coronaviruses. RT-LAMP specifically detected COVID-19 in simulated patient samples. This test was performed in under 30 minutes. This approach could be used for monitoring of exposed indi...","Abstract The world is currently suffering through a pandemic outbreak of severe respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) known as Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). The United States (US) Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) currently advises medical facilities to \u201creschedule non-urgent outpatient visits as necessary\u201d (1). The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, the United Kingdom National Health Service and several other international agencies covering Asia, North America and most regions of the world have recommended similar \u201csocial distancing\u201d measures(2, 3). The Society of Cardiovascular Computed Tomography (SCCT) offers guidance for cardiac CT (CCT) practitioners to help implement these international recommendations in order to decrease the risk of COVID-19 transmission in their facilities while deciding on the timing of outpatient and inpatient CCT exams. This document also emphasizes SCCT\u2019s commitment to the health and well-being of CCT techn...","The review aims to examine the emergence and reemergence of infectious diseases in Jordan, in parallel with the Syrian refugee crisis. Qualitative approach has been adopted for systematically examining the outcomes of the Syrian crisis, which resulted in emerging and reemerging infectious diseases. It has adhered that infectious diseases, including measles, tuberculosis, and cutaneous leishmaniasis, have hazardous effects on Syrian refugees along with the local population in Jordan. The threat of major infectious diseases is higher and alarming in Jordan. National health policies should be implemented to adhere the influence of infectious diseases as well as to reduce the extent of infectious diseases in Jordan. In the 21st century, Syrian conflict can be deliberated as one of the biggest humanitarian disasters. In this multifaceted emergency with devastating requirements and limitations, it has been found essential for dominant medical healthcare providers to develop medical strategie...","AbstractThe World Health Organization (WHO) has declared the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection outbreak a global health emergency. Currently, there is no effective anti-2019-nCoV medication. The sequence identity of the 3CL proteases of 2019-nCoV and SARS is 96%, which provides a sound foundation for structural-based drug repositioning (SBDR). Based on a SARS 3CL protease X-ray crystal structure, we construct a 3D homology structure of 2019-nCoV 3CL protease. Based on this structure and existing experimental datasets for SARS 3CL protease inhibitors, we develop an SBDR model based on machine learning and mathematics to screen 1465 drugs in the DrugBank that have been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). We found that many FDA approved drugs are potentially highly potent to 2019-nCoV.","Abstract Background After the declaration of COVID-19 pandemic on March 11th, 2020, local transmission chains starting in different countries including Canada are forcing governments to take decisions on public health interventions to mitigate the spread of the epidemic. Methods We conduct data-driven and model-free estimations for the growth rates of the COVID-19 epidemics in Italy and Canada, by fitting an exponential curve to the daily reported cases. We use these estimates to predict epidemic trends in Canada under different scenarios of public health interventions. Results In Italy, the initial growth rate (0.22) has reduced to 0.1 two weeks after the lockdown of the country on March 8th, 2020. This corresponds to an increase of the doubling time from about 3.15 to almost 7 days. In comparison, the growth rate in Canada has increased from 0.13 between March 1st and 13th, to 0.25 between March 13th to 22nd. This current growth rate corresponds to a doubling time of 2.7 days, and th...","A symptom-based mass screening and testing intervention (MSTI) can identify a large fraction of infected individuals during an infectious disease outbreak.
