As a result, some midwives who work alone or in small groups may feel isolated. For example, the International Confederation of Midwives (ICM) have made the difficult decision to postpone the Congress until 2021 in order to comply with the public health recommendation to maintain social distancing. Now is a time for midwives to provide support (informational and emotional) for each other. Social media (e.g. WhatsApp, Twitter, blogs) has proved useful for this purpose, strengthening the midwifery community by sharing each other's experiences and timely access to accurate, reliable resources. It is important that midwives' voices are present in this discussion to reassure pregnant women. Due to social distancing and those colleagues working alone and/or in higher prevalence regions, virtual communication opportunities have a vital role in keeping the profession connected. Importantly, this distancing concerns 'physical' distancing and does not require us to socially isolate ourselves from each other. The International Day of the Midwife Virtual (VIDM) conference in May is one conference that does not need to be postponed and may prove to be an important connecting opportunity.","Based on the experiences gained on this disease during this short time, a strong recommendation for all people, clinicians, and policymakers is to guide people to protect themselves to avoid being exposed to SARS-CoV-2, whenever possible (32). Another very important advice to patients with underlying diseases during the epidemics like the one caused by the novel virus is to follow guidance on travel restrictions. These groups must be aware of their high-risk situation and comply with all health guidelines such as hand hygiene, face care, and restricting social interactions. In addition, to reduce the morbidity and complications of COVID-19 in different populations, especially patients with the mentioned underlying diseases, we recommend clinicians and policymakers to launch diagnostic procedures for such individuals first so that proper treatments can be designed and followed to ensure they are protected within epidemic regions (33). ","Although the principles of the surveying protocol are derived from the animal health realm, where they have had extensive use [e.g. 4-5-6-7-8-9-10], a similar approach in surveillance of the human population could be applicable [11] , and requires public health leadership. At a first glance, t he application of the proposed principles and protocol ( Fig. 1 to 3) , could appear as unfeasible; because it could require overpassing some social, logistic and economical barriers; as never seen before. Nevertheless, we must also consider that this is a particular situation, which is challenging the health and economy as rarely seen in history. If the virus has been able to adapt across species, the human society should be able adapting quickly too, by working across countries, sectors and communities. The protocol is not a strict guideline with which everybody must comply. Rather, is a proposal for potential solutions and it is only a \"starting\" point open to improvements and adaptations across different capacities and realities. In Table 1 , are resumed some considerations on: strengths, limitations, and possible solutions for the protocol applications. Permission to sample at random in the human needs to be considered quickly. However, it is very likely that the vast majority of randomly selected people will agree to participate, because of the urgency and a good understanding among the public. Some considerations on survey\u00b4s setting and comparing their outputs for human populations can be found in [13] [14] \uf0b7 Applying the protocol on a National scale in a population of several million people could be unfeasible if the costs are perceived as too high and participation/capacity is low. Nevertheless if the protocol can be used only in part of the affected countries, then the estimated TP could be generalized to other areas/cities/regions that seem to be in a similar: environmental, demographic, logistical and epidemiological situation.","Developing countries also suffer from an insufficient number of pharmacists. In addition, for economic reasons, pharmacists prefer to work or set up their pharmacies in urban areas rather than in rural areas (Smith, 2001 (Smith, , 2004 . In addition, some pharmacists are hard to find in pharmacies (\"the invisible pharmacist\"), and patients/customers have to rely on pharmacy assistants/technicians (Amin &amp; Chewning, 2016) . Most of the time, these staff have no proper professional qualifications and lack important skills and knowledge. Even worse, some community pharmacists lack particular competencies and communication skills, have no or few business skills, and do not have up-to-date knowledge. In some cases, pharmacists do not comply with regulations (e.g., selling antibiotics or psychotropic drugs without a prescription), and they often fail to assume responsibility for pharmaceutical care. In the eyes of the consumers, community pharmacists are always regarded as businesspeople rather than as healthcare professionals. Community pharmacists must strike a balance between professional and business responsibilities. Having both qualities, i.e., having a high level of professionalism and an excellent business sense, should not be so difficult. How these two aspects influence the health and well-being of individuals and society is what matters.","What does the Italian public believe about recommended health measures regarding the COVID-19 crisis? Figure 1 shows that our subjects are appropriately cautious: nearly 100% endorse four recommended public health measures (handshake avoidance, social gathering avoidance, non-essential activities curfew, and non-essential shop closure). Of the four, the curfew and shop closure are slightly less popular, but an 89% endorsement rate is still remarkable. Compared with decades of advice to reduce smoking, drinking, and lack of exercise, these levels are very high. All demographic groups strongly agree with these four measures, though there is consistent (small) disagreement amongst respondents reporting that they are in \"excellent\" health ( Figure 2 ). When asked to reflect in writing about the social costs of reneging on the quarantine, nearly all respondents express agreement and emphasize collective responsibility. A representative (open text) reflection from the entire respondent sample reads : 3 \"I believe that EVERYONE should stay at home, leaving only for the bare minimum and taking security measures. Only in this way can we solve and solve this enormous problem in the shortest possible time.\"","Increasing human populations place great demands on the public health and other government services, especially in developing countries where needs for zoonoses diagnosis, control, and prevention are greatest and resources are most limited. Some preventive measures could be implemented by the people who live in the affected areas themselves, and at minimal costs, if they knew why and how they needed to do it. Public education and information is essential for control and prevention of zoonotic diseases; however, it takes more than civic action to deal with them. Delivery of public education, disease surveillance and diagnosis, and the technical materials and logistical support for control or preventive programs depend on national or international scientific and financial support. International technical cooperation and financial support are imperative.","Increasing human populations place great demands on the public health and other government services, especially in developing countries where needs for zoonoses diagnosis, control, and prevention are greatest and resources are most limited.

Indeed, especially for low-price medicinal products, the market competition may affect the economic sustainability of the MAHs significantly, decreasing their manufacturing capacity and resilience to demand fluctuation. In this context, MAHs may not be able to fulfil appropriately the guidance reported in the ISPE drug shortage prevention plan as suggested by the last HMA/ EMA guideline (EMA and HMA, 2019a) . Indeed, especially for old medicinal products, the costs of the upgrade to the required high-quality standards and risk assessment plan may be too high to maintain the MAH economic sustainability. In this context, European associations representing manufacturers, parallel distributors, pharmaceutical full-line wholesalers and industrial pharmacists recently stressed the need of establishing proper reward actions by the competent Authorities for supporting their activities to comply with regulation upgrades (e.g., Falsified Medicines Directive) (Various Associations, 2019b).","The authors wish to thank Roberto Mateo, David Constant and Khanh Nguyen for helpful discussions and technical advice.

Measures, whether traffic control or social distancing, are aiming to reduce physical contact between people, and in cities with smaller populations, the contact there is already less than in high-density cities, so the effects of those measures fail in low-population cities. In short, the effects of the two measures are not the same in different regions, which depending on conditions of the city, and the implementation of prevention and control measures will incur huge social and economic costs, especially in the outbreak of COVID-19, in order to control the spread of the disease, many cities across the country have implemented strict prevention and control measures such as \"lockdown\" the city. While controlling the epidemic, they have also increased social and economic burdens. Therefore, when formulating an epidemic prevention and control policy, full consideration should be given to the local situation, implementing policies according to the city and achieving precise epidemic prevention. ","Given the increasing costs associated with vaccination and the increasing number of vaccine doses, financing for this service has taken on greater importance. Currently, U.S. vaccine financing is a joint responsibility shared by the private and public sectors. As of 2002, more than one-half of the vaccines recommended for children were purchased through federal contract, 45 whereas vaccines for adults typically are covered by private insurance. Private health plans often have insurance coverage for vaccines. However, some children enrolled in private health plans do not have coverage for vaccines and are considered underinsured for immunization. 46 Finally, some studies have shown that health care provid-ers have concerns regarding the costs of purchasing and administering vaccines and their level of reimbursement from public and private insurers. 47 Providers must order and purchase many vaccines (e.g., influenza) months before they are administered, resulting in substantial capital outlay coupled with delayed reimbursement. 47 Recently, Freed et al. 48 conducted a survey exploring physicians' perspectives on reimbursement for childhood immunizations. Approximately one-half of the study respondents reported financial reasons and low profit margins from immunizations as factors affecting their purchase and administration of vaccines. These authors concluded that physicians who provide vaccines to children and adolescents are dissatisfied with third-party reimbursement levels and the increasing financial strain on their practices from immunizations. Thus, increasing vaccine prices, a greater number of vaccine doses, and declining provider reimbursement for these products appear to be factors constraining both patient and provider demand for these products.","In May 2005 the World Health Assembly adopted the revision of the International Health Regulations (IHR). The previous IHR were set up in 1969 with the purpose to monitor six different infectious diseases: cholera, plague, yellow fever, smallpox, relapsing fever and typhus. In view of newly emerging diseases such as viral hemorrhagic fevers, increasing cross-border travel and the lack of an internationally coordinated mechanism to contain international disease spread, the revision of this international agreement was initiated in the 1990s. The IHR (2005) are a set of rules that are legally binding on 194 countries around the world. They require that all countries strengthen their public health and surveillance capacities and that they notify WHO in case of a ''public health emergency of international concern'' which is determined as any event that ''constitutes a public health risk to other states through the international spread of disease and that potentially requires a coordinated international response''. In response WHO offers advice as well as technical and possibly financial support to meet these new obligations [12] .","Use of existing financing systems to support this work offers the benefits of speed and lower transaction costs than for new financing approaches. CEPI is supported by a World Bank financial intermediary fund that brings together public, philanthropic, and private funding to respond to global priorities. 7 Through this fund, CEPI can act as a global mechanism for funding vaccine development until vaccines can be licensed or used under emergency use provisions. Mobilising $2 billion in funding will require funding from all sources. Given the enormous health, social, and economic consequences of COVID-19, there is a strong case for all governments to invest in vaccines.","We explain our conclusion here. First, under Article 43.2, countries cannot implement additional health measures exclusively as a precaution but must rather ground their decision making in \"scientific principles\", \"scientific evidence\", and \"advice from WHO\". 1 Many of the travel restrictions being implemented during the COVID-19 outbreak are not supported by science or WHO. Travel restrictions for these kinds of viruses have been challenged by public health researchers, [4] [5] [6] and WHO has advised against travel restrictions, arguing they cause more harm than good. 7, 8 Second, under Article 43.1 any additional health measures implemented by countries \"shall not be more restrictive of international traffic and not more invasive or intrusive to persons than reasonably available alternatives\". 1 In this case, even if travel restrictions did work, there are so many other more effective measures that countries can take to protect their citizens. WHO has issued COVID-19 technical guidance on several such measures, including risk communication, surveillance, patient management, and screening at ports of entry and exit. 9 Third, and most importantly, Article 3.1 strictly requires all additional health measures to be implemented \"with full respect for the dignity, human rights and fundamental freedoms of persons\", 1 which in turn must reflect the international law principles of necessity, legitimacy, and proportionality that govern limitations to and derogations from rights and freedoms. 10 Under no circumstances should public health or foreign policy decisions be based on the racism and xenophobia that are now being directed at Chinese people and those of Asian descent. 11 Many of the travel restrictions implemented by dozens of countries during the COVID-19 outbreak are therefore violations of the IHR. 12 Yet, perhaps even more troubling, is that at least two-thirds of these countries have not reported their additional health measures to WHO, 12 response to public health emergencies and prevents countries from holding each other accountable for their obligations under the IHR. Some countries argue that they would rather be safe than sorry. But evidence belies the claim that illegal travel restrictions make countries safer. [4] [5] [6] In the short term, travel restrictions prevent supplies from getting into affected areas, slow down the international public health response, stigmatise entire populations, and disproportionately harm the most vulnerable among us. In the longer term, countries selecting which international laws to follow encourages other countries to do the same, which in turn undermines the broader rules-based world order. Effective global governance is not possible when countries cannot depend on each other to comply with international agreements. 13 Of course, the IHR is far from perfect. For example, the IHR only governs countries, not corporations and other non-governmental actors. Thus, some countries are finding themselves with de-facto travel restrictions when airlines stop flying to places affected by COVID-19.","Previous studies have demonstrated that nasal swabs collected by research participants under the supervision of research or clinical staff are feasible for the identification of respiratory virus infections [6] [7] [8] [9] 12, 16, 17] . In many of these studies acceptability of self-or parent-collection was preferred to investigator or clinician collection [7, 16] . In the few studies of unsupervised collection, self-collected specimens were collected and returned in the timeframe recommended by the research team [6, 16] . In addition, specimen quality in many studies has been similar regardless of collection method [5, 19] . A Canadian study found that both viral loads and RNaseP were similar between self-collected and investigator-collected specimens [8] . A study in pregnant women found 100% of self-collected specimens detected RNaseP [6] , as we found in the current study. Other measures of specimen quality have also been similar between collection methods [11, 18] . Importantly, many of these feasibility studies were pilot studies with relatively small sample sizes, and self-collection was often completed in the presence of the study investigators. Our study confirms the feasibility and timeliness of unsupervised collection of respiratory specimens in a large, longitudinal cohort study. As we are currently experiencing with COVID-19 pandemic, unsupervised collection Is essential to provide maximum protection to research staff and participants and to comply with social distancing guidelines from public health authorities.","This collaborative process aims to prevent or identify and solve pharmaceutical and health-related problems-a continuous quality improvement process regarding the use of medicines (Wiedenmayer et al., 2006) . The philosophy of pharmaceutical care promoted in the early 1990s is no longer new. Many studies, initiatives, and interventions, especially in developed countries, have been conducted to improve patient care and health outcomes. In an attempt to provide health and pharmaceutical care to patients and society, the healthcare and pharmaceutical sectors in developing countries, particularly low-and middle-income countries (LMICs), are facing challenges. These challenges include the shortage of human resources in the pharmacy workforce; inefficient health systems; the rising costs of medicines and healthcare; limited financial resources; the huge burden of disease; and changing social, epidemiological, technological, economic, and political situations (Mohamed Ibrahim, Palaian, Al-Sulaiti, &amp; El-Shami, 2016) .","According to Brodie (1981) , the traditional role of dispensing medications has been expanded. Pharmacists should be both health generalists and health specialists, which will have an impact on public health. Even the American Public Health Association (1981) supports the pharmacists' role in public health. Should community pharmacists move beyond their traditional role? Even when dispensing medicines through paper-based prescription services, pharmacists should comply with some fundamental standards. Safety issues must be considered when dispensing medications. The Pharmacy Board of Australia published guidelines for medication dispensing (i.e., guidelines for scanned and faxed prescriptions and steps to take when handling Internet or mail-order dispensing); guidelines for dispensing extemporaneous medications; guidelines when handling errors (e.g., dispensing errors); guidelines for appropriate medication labeling; guidelines for patient counseling, privacy, and confidentiality; and pharmacy technicians' functions, responsibilities, and competencies (Pharmacy Board of Australia, n.d.). In addition, for pharmacies that use electronic and computer systems, the Royal Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain (n.d.) has provided several guidelines and principles for good dispensing and appropriate dispensing procedures (e.g., professional checking, medication substitution, and labeling). Malaysia, a developing country, has also developed Guide to Good Dispensing Practice (Malaysian Pharmaceutical Services Division, 2016) . These guidelines aim to have both public and private facilities dispensing medications according to the law and guidelines, which may ensure that patients receive the correct medications, adherence is improved, adverse effects are minimized, and errors are avoided. The document's contents relate to processing prescriptions, preparing medications, labeling, recoding, and issuing medications to the patient. In geographical areas where no pharmacists are available, a guide about managing medicines would be a handy document indeed (Andersson &amp; Snell, 2010) .","The second building block is financing. Before the decree, central government adopted a series of financial measures to support the health system and protect businesses. It had allocated \u20ac2800 million to all regions for health services and created a new fund with \u20ac1000 million for priority health interventions. 4 However, these amounts need to be seen against the background of almost a decade of austerity from which the health system has yet to recover. 5 Third, in service delivery, the national Ministry of Health has developed a set of clinical protocols, published on its website. Additional advice is published by certain regions and updated, in some cases, on a daily basis. 6 Health facilities in the worst affected regions are struggling, with inadequate intensive care capacity and an insufficient number of ventilators in particular. Both Catalonia and Madrid 7 have cancelled non-emergency surgery and cleared beds where possible. COVID-19 telephone help lines have long delays or have simply collapsed in some regions. The new decree allows the regions to take over management of private health services while military installations will be used for public health purposes.","It is yet not clear whether the apparent success of South Korea could be applied to other countries in North America and Europe. It is, however, obvious that extreme non-selective measures are associated with tremendous economic costs that will result in a global financial crisis that will most likely affect public health and other essential aspects of our lives in the coming years.","Financial incentives. Large, government-funded research and academic institutions play a vital role in basic vaccine research. Public funding of vaccine discovery and early developmental efforts coupled with tax subsidies to private firms can reduce manufacturers' upfront financial outlays substantially and alter return on investment calculations for vaccine research favorably. 2,28 For example, NIH sponsors approximately one-third of all vaccine-related basic research. Most of this funding is in the form of grants to academic institutions and health-related agencies.","IC guidelines should be developed, revised and updated regularly and compliance monitored and reinforced as part of an IC strategy. 50 Most will require HCWs to comply with hand hygiene which is the single most effective IC measure, they should also emphasise the safe donning, removal and disposal of PPE. 51 It is recognised that HCWs work within a wide range of financial, technological and human resource constraints and that policies should be adapted for local use employing locally available infrastructure. The design of health care facilities is therefore important and should support HCWs in their implementation of IC procedures. IC practitioners should be consulted when designing new hospitals and when other hospital buildings are being redesigned or renovated. 52 Prompt diagnosis is critical for any effective IC programme. This requires reliable and effective methods of surveillance with early detection of outbreaks and contact tracing in both the healthcare setting as well as in the community. As clinical diagnosis may not always be sufficiently reliable, rapid isolation and strict IC practices will need to be applied. Also, given that the clustering of fever and respiratory tract illness in HCWs was a feature of SARS, clusters of infection among staff members should be recognised and investigated.","Inevitably, the health sectors are primarily reactive to these events, acting to save lives as well as undertake surveillance and control. The drama and panic typically fade into history with the substantial costs being absorbed by ordinary people, international financial systems, and tax bases, making life go on as normal, but not quite. The frequency, severity, and financial impacts of these events are growing, and the world can no longer afford to just wait and see, especially because prevention of these threats is in theory relatively simple and where addressed has resulted in a cessation of risk. The best example being Nipah virus, where separation of pig farms from fruit agriculture, and by the same measure, fruit bats, has substantially reduced the potential for Nipah virus spill over. Bats have always had viral populations, and despite close association with humans for millennia, this has not resulted in pandemics until recent times.","Inevitably, the health sectors are primarily reactive to these events, acting to save lives as well as undertake surveillance and control.

For instance, several of the measures suggested above are necessary because ECRs are routinely required to pay for conferences and travel out of their own pocket before seeking reimbursement several months later. This is an insurmountable financial barrier for many ECRs and scientists from countries with limited research funding (Malloy, 2020). We hope that this crisis leads to widespread adoption of new policies to pay ECRs for conferences and travel costs upfront.","We recognize that conference cancellations may have a severe impact on organizations\u2019 and societies\u2019 finances, though we ask that they endeavor to issue refunds of registration fees promptly. If needed, refunds should be prioritized for those researchers who are most likely to be experiencing financial hardship in this difficult time. Researchers from countries with limited funding, graduate students and postdoctoral researchers tend to be the lowest paid and are perhaps more likely to have covered the costs of attending these meetings out of their own pocket (Malloy, 2020). These groups\u2019 risk of financial hardship may be exacerbated by the fact that those with limited resources are often obligated to book the cheapest flights and accommodation, which may not be eligible for refunding or rebooking. For meetings that are not canceled, refunds of registration fees should be given to those who are unable to attend due to travel bans, or who choose not to attend for reasons of personal safety and public health.","Under the EUA for N95 respirators, FDA authorized four models of respirators for use by the general public to help reduce the wearer's exposure to airborne germs during the public health medical emergency. (\"General public\" is a broad term and includes people performing work-related duties.) If respirators are used for people performing work-related duties, employers must comply with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's Respiratory Protection Standard (29 CFR 1910.134; see www.osha.gov for more information). The EUAs for oseltamivir and zanamivir allow the approved products to be used for unapproved indications. The EUAs allow these products to be used in patients who are symptomatic for more than 2 days and in patients who have complicated illness requiring hospitalization. The EUA for oseltamivir also extended product use to include an unapproved population by authorizing and providing dosing recommendations for pediatric patients younger than 1 year of age. Additionally, given the potential product shortage, the EUAs allowed extended use of certain lots of oseltamivir and zanamivir products beyond their labeled expiry dates based on FDA review of supportive stability and potency data (additional details regarding expired product available at www. In addition to the development and submission of the above EUA requests, RA created the CDC EUA website (www.cdc.gov/ h1n1flu/eua) to provide essential information relating to FDAissued EUAs and to organize all of the EUA-related materials for educating outside audiences such as state/local health de-SPECIAL FEATURE PHARMACISTS AND REGuLATORy AFFAIRS AT CDC partments, health care personnel, and the general public about EUAs. At the time of this writing, it has received more than 360,000 visits and was still being viewed daily.","According to a recent French study, despite the Saudi Arabia Ministry of Health recommendation for people at highest risk of the complications of MERS (CoeV) to refrain from the 2013 Hajj for their own safety, 48% of pilgrims preparing for Hajj from France did not comply [31, 32] . Knowledge, attitudes and practices of Hajj pilgrims about MERS (CoeV) may be influenced by cultural and religious beliefs; although they may be aware about the Saudi Ministry of Health recommendations and may be informed about the risks during a pre-travel consultation there is a need for communication strategies for this high risk group of travelers in order to improve their risk perception and attitudes towards prevention [33] .","Governments and (public) health authorities alone cannot succeed in combating the outbreak. People need to protect themselves and others from contracting COVID-19 by following public health advice, adopting the suggested preventive measures, and complying with the guidance issued by health authorities.","This pathogen represents a significant challenge for public health, pandemic planning, and healthcare systems. The SARS-CoV-2 virus is highly transmissible (4) (5) (6) (7) . It causes moderate to severe clinical outcomes in approximately 20% of all recognized infected individuals (5, 8, 9) . In the absence of a vaccine, public health responses have focused on the use of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) (10) . These NPIs include: (1) \"case-based\" measures such as testing, contact tracing, isolation, and quarantine, and (2) \"non-case-based\" measures such as reducing the probability of transmission given an effective contact (e.g. hand hygiene, and cough etiquette), and social distancing measures to reduce the contact rate in the population. Social distancing minimizes opportunities for person-to-person transmission of the virus to occur. These social distancing measures include some combination of school closure, teleworking, cancellation of group activities and events, and a general overall reduction in community contacts. While they are expected to be effective in reducing transmission of SARS-CoV-2, they are also associated with substantial economic costs and social disruption.","In concert with novel emerging infectious diseases, the communication landscape itself has also changed radically. We now live in an era of real-time electronic communications; consequently, approaches to surveillance are being transformed. Data sources, information messengers, mechanisms of data and information transfer and audiences are all changing. Instant and global transmission of information has become a powerful ally, along with peer pressure, for WHO in ensuring that member states comply with new obligations to swiftly declare outbreaks considered to be of public health importance. There is now significant global attention and accompanying investment which should, the authors suggest, be used as an opportunity to improve strategic and operational communication capacity to respond not only to pandemic influenza but also to other public health threats.","Individual behaviour will be crucial to control the spread of COVID-19. Personal, rather than government action, in western democracies might be the most important issue. Early self-isolation, seeking medical advice remotely unless symptoms are severe, and social distancing are key. Government actions to ban mass gatherings are important, as are good diagnostic facilities and remotely accessed health advice, together with specialised treatment for people with severe disease. Isolating towns or even cities is not yet part of the UK Government action plan. 15 This plan is light on detail, given the early stages of the COVID-19 epidemic and the many uncertainties, but it outlines four phases of action entitled contain, delay, research, and mitigate. 15 The UK has just moved from contain to delay, which aims to flatten the epidemic and lower peak morbidity and mortality. If measures are relaxed after a few months to avoid severe economic impact, a further peak is likely to occur in the autumn (figure). Italy, South Korea, Japan, and Iran are at the mitigate phase and trying to provide the best care possible for a rapidly growing number of people with COVID-19.","Lastly, we note that the results presented here are not sufficient, on their own, to determine which anti-contagion policies are ideal for individual populations, nor whether the social costs of individual policies are larger or smaller than the social value of their health benefits. Computing a full value of health benefits also requires understanding how different growth rates of infections and total active infections affect mortality rates, as well as determining a social value for all of these impacts. Furthermore, this analysis does not quantify the sizable social costs of anti-contagion policies, a critical topic for future investigations.","In 2004, China revised the Prevention and Treatment of Infectious Diseases Law, adding SARS and avian flu as notifiable diseases and revising the law to comply with the principal rules of infectious disease prevention and control (i.e., infection source control, interruption of route of transmission, and susceptible people protection) [20]. The law adheres to the \u201cfive early\u201d principle of early detection, diagnosis, reporting, isolation, and treatment. Early isolation can restrain contagion. The law applied China's experience in emerging epidemics to prevent and control 37 infectious diseases.","There were significant financial considerations that stemmed from limited group therapies and reversion to a strictly oneon-one therapy approach. Similarly, routine use of infection control measures, including the costs of PPE, time taken to don and doff, and greatly reduced work efficiency among health care workers need to be factored in. The question of expertise arose when physiatrists had to manage medical complications themselves instead of being able to call in consultants or transfer patients to an appropriate specialist. The accuracy of a telephone consultation that relies on the reported history and examination findings of the doctor calling the consult may be questioned. There is a high probability of fatigue and stress after a prolonged period under semimilitary rules and regulations, and attentiveness and vigilance to precautions may slip. Health care workers may need to prepare for extended periods in full PPE.","The cost to the airline may be substantial, including the effects of aircraft and crew unavailability for the next scheduled sector, as well as the direct airport and fuel costs of the diversion.

This was true worldwide and it remains true in most of the developing countries in the world today. The Internet and its various applications have reduced such role in some countries. Nevertheless, electronic newspapers are making use of the Internet huge capacity to extend the roles played by traditional newspapers. This makes research studies conducted earlier in the area of journalism and newspapers still useful in understanding the influences and effects of such media on the general public knowledge and their information about medicines. Moynihan et al. (2000) reviewed a sample of 180 newspaper articles and 27 television reports that appeared between 1994 and 1998 in the United States, covering information about three medications that are used for preventing major diseases, namely, pravastatin, alendronate, and aspirin. The researchers reported that news media stories about medications may include inadequate or incomplete information about the benefits, risks, and costs of the drugs. The researchers reported presence of financial ties between the study groups or experts cited in news media stories and pharmaceutical manufacturers. Another study from the Netherlands revealed that pharmaceutical industry represented the third most frequently cited source of information in the newspaper articles (van Trigt, Haaijer-Ruskamp, Willems, &amp; Tromp, 1994) .","The age structure of populations also suggests that the often squeezed \"sandwich\" generation of adults who care for both the old and young are an important link for mitigating transmission. Beyond introducing sick pay for those who need to self-isolate or care for family members, joint government and industry emergency policy measures should seek to counter family economic crises by delaying rent and mortgage payments for example, particularly for vulnerable and precarious workers. In the absence of economic security measures, this crucial sandwich generation may be less able to comply with policies that allow social distancing.","The clinical students could work as volunteers in return for accreditation of valuable experiential learning in community health. This approach would meet a gap in UK undergraduate experience and might become a long-term feature of medical education. 6 For a future scaled workforce, there will be financial implications, but the costs should be affordable. On the basis of the Brazilian CHW model, estimates of the cost of a scaled CHW workforce in England suggest this could amount to about \u00a32\u00b72 billion per annum for 100 000 CHWs. 7 Such an amount is a small proportion of the existing NHS budget that is projected to increase in the coming years. 8 Some would argue that it is too risky to put CHWs with only limited training in contact with vulnerable members of society. However, there are risks associated with prolonged unmonitored isolation, from the effects of COVID-19, as well as loneliness and mental health deterioration. The risks of using CHWs in this way could be reduced by supervision, with independent monitoring and evaluative research to identify problems early and correct them. The CHWs could visit in pairs to reduce the risks.","Where, \uf07a is the human intervention factor of public health policy, \uf068 is the minimum intensity of intervention, 0 t is the time point of human intervention, m t is the point at which and public health policy intervention. Any public health policy intervention requires costs, and the cost of different interventions varies. In this paper, the various measures to prevent and control the spread of COVID -19 in China are divided into two categories: One is traffic control, which not only affects the movement of people across regions and even across the country, but also affects the transportation of goods. The price of this is to force companies and other institutions to stop operations, which is at huge cost. Another is social distancing, including closure of public places in the city, community containment, isolation of the infected, and quarantine of the suspected, which affects the operation of some urban institutions, and the cost is less than the traffic control. Based on the mechanism analyzed above and the classification of prevention and control measures against COVID-19, we then propose the hypothesis: traffic control and social distancing can quickly contain the spreads of COVID-19 epidemic, but they perform different effect in various regions.","The hospital was kept closed for new admissions for 40 days until the hospital was declared free of new MERS-CoV cases on the 10th of November 2015. The regional community and our hospital healthcare workers (HCWs) developed anxiety to the risk of developing MERS-CoV infection. Following the opening of our facility for new patient admissions, significant reduction in patient visits and admission was noted which costs the hospital management, significant financial loss and loss of reputation.","The experience of the cell therapy community can also play a key role in shaping the FDA recommendations that pertain to regulation of cell therapy products. The experience of stem cell manufacturers is communicated in meetings with the FDA staff, at presentations at scientific meetings, and at presentations to the FDA's BRMAC. BRMAC meetings allow the FDA to obtain advice in a public forum on scientific issues that affect stem cell experiments. This format allows all interested parties to participate. Transcripts of these meetings are available on the CBER Web site (http://www.fda.gov/cber/). The BRMAC's advice on issues such as characterization of neuronal stem cell therapy products has been valuable as the CBER staffs develop stem cell policy. 1 Another important resource that facilitates development of recommendations for regulation of stem cells involves the FDA-National Institutes of Health (NIH) interagency interactions through formalized Memoranda of Understanding Agreements (MOUs) that allow bidirectional input on translational research. The FDA benefits from the scientific expertise of NIH program managers and intramural scientists, and the NIH benefits from the FDA scientific perspectives on important funding initiatives to expedite translation of research from bench to bedside. For example, under the MOU, the NIH can involve FDA expertise in Request for Application (RFA) design for translational research. In addition to these MOUs, there is increasing participation by the FDA in expert advisory panels that develop recommendations for NIH translational research programs. These feedback mechanisms serve the FDA-regulated community, the NIH-funded research community, and the public by focusing scientific and funding resources on developing novel technologies such as stem cell use to address challenges to public health.","On the other hand, various government agencies, scientific organizations and healthcare professionals used social media to enhance networking and facilitate communication of epidemiological, medical and scientific developments; in addition to presenting the public with factual material, timely updates, and relevant advice. 121 The Saudi Ministry of Health, for example, posts daily updates on its website and through social media outlining details of current MERS-CoV cases. The Korean Ministry of Health and Welfare did the same during their MERS-CoV outbreak. Such steps are important to gain the public's trust and to remove barriers to appropriate sources of information. Taking on board the surging role of social media and using them effectively to disseminate appropriate information turns them into invaluable tools for controlling an emerging infectious disease such as MERS-CoV.","\u2610Purpose and intent of the external review (e.g., to improve quality, gather feedback on draft recommendations, assess applicability and feasibility, disseminate evidence) \u2610Methods taken to undertake the external review (e.g., rating scale, open-ended questions) \u2610Description of the external reviewers (e.g., number, type of reviewers, affiliations) \u2610Outcomes/information gathered from the external review (e.g., summary of key findings) \u2610How the information gathered was used to inform the guideline development process and/or formation of the recommendations (e.g., guideline panel considered results of \u2610Types of facilitators and barriers that were considered \u2610Methods by which information regarding the facilitators and barriers to implementing recommendations were sought (e.g., feedback from key stakeholders, pilot testing of guidelines before widespread implementation) \u2610Information/description of the types of facilitators and barriers that emerged from the inquiry (e.g., practitioners have the skills to deliver the recommended care, sufficient equipment is not available to ensure all eligible members of the population receive mammography) \u2610How the information influenced the guideline development process and/or formation of the recommendations NR 19.

In particular, these challenges are more pronounced when it comes to public health. This is because most of the health-related data collected not only can compromise local nations, but also captures those of travelers. In such cases, in a bid to improve the health status of a nation, it becomes paramount to factor in data from other regions necessitating unhindered sharing of this data.","1.11 Be aware of and comply with relevant international, national, state and/or hospital guidelines for infection control in healthcare facilities.

It already has. The indignation of the public health sector is unlikely to quash new forms of aid, but health partisans can provide safeguards. They can engage with and interrogate the language and priorities of finance. They can require that the bonds' triggers be publicly negotiated and open access. They can push for disbursement criteria that place the needs of the sick before the demands of investors. They can fight for consultation with communities where pandemics occur.

Only a month after the outbreak of pneumonia caused by 2019-nCoV, more than forty-thousand people were infected. This put enormous pressure on the Chinese government, medical healthcare provider, and the general public, but also made the international community deeply nervous. On the 25th day after the outbreak, the Chinese government implemented strict traffic restrictions on the area where the 2019-nCoV had originated\u2014Hubei province, whose capital city is Wuhan. Ten days later, the rate of increase of cases in Hubei showed a significant difference (p = 0.0001) compared with the total rate of increase in other provinces of China. These preliminary data suggest the effectiveness of a traffic restriction policy for this pandemic thus far. At the same time, solid financial support and improved research ability, along with network communication technology, also greatly facilitated the application of epidemic prevention measures. These measures were motivated by the need to provid...","Background Emergency school closures are often used as public health interventions during infectious disease outbreaks in an attempt to minimise the spread of infection. However, if children continue to mix with others outside the home during the closures, these measures are unlikely to be effective. Objectives This review aimed to summarise existing literature on children's activities and contacts made outside the home during unplanned school closures. Methods We searched four databases from inception to February 2020 for relevant literature. Main findings were extracted. Results 3,343 citations were screened and 19 included in the review. Activities and social contacts appeared to decrease during closures but contact was still common. All studies reported children leaving the house or being looked after by non-household members. There was some evidence that older child age and parental disagreement with closure were predictive of children leaving the house, and mixed evidence regardi...","","","The paper evaluates total inclusive costs of three public health approaches to address the COVID-19 epidemic in the US based on epidemiological projections in Ferguson et al (2020). We calculate and add costs of lost productivity and costs of mortality measured through the value of statistical life. We find that the aggressive approach which involves strict suppression measures and a drastic reduction of economic activity for three months with extensive testing and case tracking afterwards results in the lowest total costs for the society. The approach of doing no non-pharmaceutical measures results in the lowest total costs if the infection fatality rate falls below 0.15%.","Viruses are evolving at an alarming rate, spreading and inconspicuously adapting to cutting-edge therapies. Therefore, the search for rapid, informative and reliable diagnostic methods is becoming urgent as ever. Conventional clinical tests (PCR, serology, etc.) are being continually optimized, yet provide very limited data. Could high throughput sequencing (HTS) become the future gold standard in molecular diagnostics of viral infections? Compared to conventional clinical tests, HTS is universal and more precise at profiling pathogens. Nevertheless, it has not yet been widely accepted as a diagnostic tool, owing primarily to its high cost and the complexity of sample preparation and data analysis. Those obstacles must be tackled to integrate HTS into daily clinical practice. For this, three objectives are to be achieved: (1) designing and assessing universal protocols for library preparation, (2) assembling purpose-specific pipelines, and (3) building computational infrastructure to s...","Relevant pandemic-spread scenario simulations provide guiding principles for containment and mitigation policy developments. Here we devise a simple model to predict the effectiveness of different mitigation strategies. The model consists of a set of simple differential equations considering the population size, reported and unreported infections, reported and unreported recoveries and the number of Covid-19-inflicted deaths. For simplification, we assume that Covid-19 survivors are immune (e.g. mutations are not considered) and that the virus can only be passed on by persons with undetected infections. While the latter assumption is a simplification (it is neglected that e.g. hospital staff may be infected by detected patients with symptoms), it was introduced here to keep the model as simple as possible. Moreover, the current version of the model does not account for age-dependent differences in the death rates, but considers higher mortality rates due to temporary shortage of intens...","The number of confirmed COVID-19 cases admitted in hospitals is continuously increasing in the Philippines. Frontline health care workers are faced with imminent risks of getting infected. In this study, we formulate a theoretical model to calculate the risk of being infected in health care facilities considering the following factors: the average number of encounters with a suspected COVID-19 patient per hour; interaction time for each encounter; work shift duration or exposure time; crowd density, which may depend on the amount of space available in a given location; and availability and effectiveness of protective gears and facilities provided for the frontline health care workers. Based on the simulation results, we recommend the following: (i) decrease the rate of patient encounter per frontline health care worker, e.g., maximum of three encounters per hour in a 12-hour work shift duration; (ii) decrease the interaction time between the frontline health care worker and the patient...","In December 2019, a new type viral pneumonia cases occurred in Wuhan, Hubei Province; and then named \u201c2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV)\u201d by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 12 January 2020. For it is a never been experienced respiratory disease before and with infection ability widely and quickly, it attracted the world\u2019s attention but without treatment and control manual. For the request from frontline clinicians and public health professionals of 2019-nCoV infected pneumonia management, an evidence-based guideline urgently needs to be developed. Therefore, we drafted this guideline according to the rapid advice guidelines methodology and general rules of WHO guideline development; we also added the first-hand management data of Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University. This guideline includes the guideline methodology, epidemiological characteristics, disease screening and population prevention, diagnosis, treatment and control (including traditional Chinese Medicine), nosocomial...","The World Health Organization currently recommends that governments scale up testing for COVID-19 infection. We performed health economic analyses projecting whether the additional costs from screening would be offset by the avoided costs with hospitalizations. We analysed Portuguese COVID-19 data up until the 22nd March 2020, and estimated the additional number of cases that would be detected if different testing rates and frequencies of positive results would have been observed. We projected that, in most scenarios, the costs with scaling up COVID-19 tests would be lower than savings with hospitalization costs, rendering large scale testing cost-saving.","If COVID-19 containment policies fail and social distancing measures cannot be sustained until vaccines becomes available, the next best approach is to use interventions that reduce mortality and prevent excess infections while allowing low-risk individuals to acquire immunity through natural infection until population level immunity is achieved. In such a situation, allowing some infections to occur in lower-risk groups might lead to an overall greater reduction in mortality than trying to protect everyone equally.","Summary Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) emerged recently as a new infectious disease that was transmitted efficiently in the healthcare setting and particularly affected healthcare workers (HCWs), patients and visitors. The efficiency of transmission within healthcare facilities was recognised following significant hospital outbreaks of SARS in Canada, China, Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan and Vietnam. The causative agent of SARS was identified as a novel coronavirus, the SARS coronavirus. This was largely spread by direct or indirect contact with large respiratory droplets, although airborne transmission has also been reported. High infection rates among HCWs led initially to the theory that SARS was highly contagious and the concept of \u2018super-spreading events\u2019. Such events illustrated that lack of infection control (IC) measures or failure to comply with IC precautions could lead to large-scale hospital outbreaks. SARS was eventually contained by the stringent application of I...","An increasingly large proportion of immigrants to developed countries is arriving from less developed countries in Africa, Asia, and Latin America. When these immigrants return to their country of origin to visit friends and relatives, they are at high risk of acquiring tropical infections, compared with other travelers. Immigrants who return to their country of origin to visit friends and relatives (VFRs) are more likely to travel to rural areas for long periods of time, to consume contaminated food and beverages, and to have more prolonged, intimate contact with local populations. As a group, they are less likely to seek pretravel advice or take antimalarial chemoprophylaxis. This article discusses the increased risk of tuberculosis, malaria, food- and waterborne illnesses, hepatitis A, and HIV and other sexually transmitted infections in VFRs.","Abstract Based on its forensic capacity and experience gained worldwide from the management of the dead in emergencies, including epidemics, the International Committee of the Red Cross have been asked by the authorities and other relevant stakeholders to advise on the management of the dead from COVID-19 infection, for which it has prepared the following guidance. This includes advice on the handling of COVID-19 fatalities and a set of considerations for managers faced with the need to plan for adequately responding to a possible surge in fatalities caused by COVID-19.","A SEIR simulation model for the COVID-19 pandemic was developed (http://covidsim.eu) and applied to a hypothetical European country of 10 million population. Our results show which interventions potentially push the epidemic peak into the subsequent year (when vaccinations may be available) or which fail. Different levels of control (via contact reduction) resulted in 22% to 63% of the population sick, 0.2% to 0.6% hospitalised, and 0.07% to 0.28% dead (n=6,450 to 28,228).","Abstract Objective To identify drug interaction databases (DID) and assess the quality of their structures. Method A search was made of the literature for DID and a series of exclusion and structural quality criteria were defined (at least 4 quality criteria: classification according to severity, classification according to level of evidence, bibliographical reference data, description of clinical management, and 11 criteria used for weighting). The level of compliance of every DID with the criteria defined was analysed, together with the level of compliance of each criteria in each DID. Results A total of 54 DID were identified, 30 of which complied with exclusion criteria and 15 of which did not meet the minimum criteria. The rest of the criteria were evaluated in 9 DID: Botplus and Medinteract (100%), SEFH Guide, Lexi-interact and Medscape (89%), Hansten (83%), Micromedex and Stockley (78%), Drug Interactions Facts (68%). Ninety-two percent of the DID describe the mechanism of actio...","Objective: Establishing a social contact data sharing initiative and an interactive tool to assess mitigation strategies for COVID-19. Results: We organized data sharing of published social contact surveys via online repositories and formatting guidelines. We analyzed this social contact data in terms of weighted social contact matrices, next generation matrices, relative incidence and R0. We incorporated location-specific isolation measures (e.g. school closure or telework) and capture their effect on transmission dynamics. All methods have been implemented in an online application based on R Shiny and applied to COVID-19 with age-specific susceptibility and infectiousness. Using our online tool with the available social contact data, we illustrate that social distancing could have a considerable impact on reducing transmission for COVID-19. The effect itself depends on assumptions made about disease-specific characteristics and the choice of intervention(s). Keywords: social contact ...","On the basis of a semi-realistic SIR microsimulation for Germany and Poland, we show that the R0 parameter interval for which the COVID-19 epidemic stays overcritical but below the capacity limit of the health care system to reach herd immunity is so narrow that a successful implementation of this strategy is likely to fail. Our microsimulation is based on official census data and involves household composition and age distribution as the main population structure variables. Outside household contacts are characterised by an out-reproduction number R* which is the only free parameter of the model. For a subcritical domain we compute the time till extinction and prevalence as a function of the initial number of infected individuals and R*. For the Polish city of Wroclaw we also discuss the combined impact of testing coverage and contact reduction. For both countries we estimate R* for disease progression until 20th of March 2020.","Various epidemic prevention and control measures aimed at reducing person-to-person contact has paid a certain cost while controlling the epidemic. So accurate evaluation of these measures helps to maximize the effectiveness of prevention and control while minimizing social costs. In this paper, we develop the model in Dirk Brockmann and Dirk Helbing (2013) to theoretically explain the impact mechanism of traffic control and social distancing measures on the spread of the epidemic, and empirically tests the effect of the two measures in China at the present stage using econometric approach. We found that both traffic control and social distancing measures have played a very good role in controlling the development of the epidemic. Nationally, social distancing measures are better than traffic control measures; the two measures are complementary and their combined action will play a better epidemic prevention effect; Traffic control and social distancing do not work everywhere. Traffic ...","Abstract Lim PA, Ng YS, Tay BK. Impact of a viral respiratory epidemic on the practice of medicine and rehabilitation: severe acute respiratory syndrome. Arch Phys Med Rehabil 2004;85:1365\u201370. Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a new respiratory viral epidemic that originated in China but has affected many parts of the world, with devastating impact on economies and the practice of medicine and rehabilitation. A novel coronavirus has been implicated, with transmission through respiratory droplets. Rehabilitation was significantly affected by SARS, because strict infection control measures run counter to principles such as multidisciplinary interactions, patients encouraging and learning from each other, and close physical contact during therapy. Immunocompromised patients who may silently carry SARS are common in rehabilitation and include those with renal failure, diabetes, and cancer. Routine procedures such as management of feces and respiratory secretions (eg, airway sucti...","Background: Since the new coronavirus epidemic in China in December 2019, information and discussions about COVID-19 have spread rapidly on the Internet and have quickly become the focus of worldwide attention, especially on social media. Objective: This study aims to investigate and analyze the public's attention to COVID-19-related events in China at the beginning of the COVID-19 epidemic in China (December 31, 2019, to February 20, 2020) through the Sina Microblog hot search list. Methods: We collected topics related to the COVID-19 epidemic on the Sina Microblog hot search list from December 31, 2019, to February 20, 2020 and described the trend of public attention on COVID-19 epidemic-related topics. ROST CM6.0 (ROST Content Mining System Version 6.0) was used to analyze the collected text for word segmentation, word frequency, and sentiment analysis. We further described the hot topic keywords and sentiment trends of public attention. We used VOSviewer to implement a visual clust...","Social distancing is an effective way to contain the spread of a contagious disease, particularly when pharmacological interventions are not available. Conventional wisdom suggests that social distancing measures should be introduced as soon as possible after the beginning of an outbreak. Using a simple epidemiological model we show, however, that there is in fact an optimal time to initiate a temporal social distancing intervention if the goal is to reduce the final epidemic size or flatten the epidemic curve. The optimal timing depends strongly on the effective reproduction number (R0) of the disease, such that as the R0 increases, the optimal time decreases non-linearly. Additionally, if pharmacological interventions (e.g., a vaccine) become available at some point during the epidemic, the sooner these interventions become available the sooner social distancing should be initiated to maximize its effectiveness. Although based on a simple model, we hope that these insights inspire fu...","Abstract On the Internet, there is a lot of open access information related to infectious diseases, e.g., official announcement, media news, bulletin boards, blogs, and other social media. If proper data retrieval and screening methods were applied on these Internet-based data, it would be very useful to improve the timeliness of early detection for infectious diseases. In China, we practice early warning using Internet-based data with routine intelligence screening assessment every day, and respond to any unusual event in a timely manner. Through this mechanism, the surveillance and early warning of Internet-based data for infectious disease and public health emergency plays an important supplemental role to the traditional surveillance systems.","Abstract Medicine shortages have been spreading in European countries. In many cases, the unavailability of medicinal products has a substantial impact on the capability of National Healthcare Systems in ensuring the continuity of care. Shortages originate from multifactorial causes. In particular, they can be due to supply-related factors (e.g., manufacturing issues, regulatory issues, logistics, distribution) and demand-related ones (e.g., fluctuating drug demand, parallel market, tendering, price and reimbursement policies). However, some extraordinary geopolitical events (e.g., Brexit) may also affect medicines\u2019 availability. The capability of European Regulatory Authorities and other stakeholders, which are involved in the pharmaceutical distribution chain and the healthcare assistance services, to define suitable problem-solving strategies has been limited for years by the fragmentation of the European regulatory framework, starting from the lack of a univocal definition of a med...","Abstract In 2009, a novel H1N1 Influenza virus has emerged and on June 11 the World Health Organization declared it as pandemic. It may cause acute respiratory failure ranging from severe Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome to exacerbations of airflow limitation. Non-invasive ventilation is now considered first-line intervention for different causes of acute respiratory failure and may be considered in the context of H1N1 pandemic. Although infection control issues have been arisen, non-invasive ventilation was effective and safe during the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome in Asia. It is reasonable to recommend non-invasive ventilation in H1N1-related exacerbations of chronic respiratory diseases, especially in negative-pressure wards. Treatment of early Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome associated with H1N1 using non-invasive ventilation could be tried rapidly identifying those who fail without delaying endotracheal intubation. Considering the high demand for critical care beds dur...","Abstract In 2009, a novel H1N1 Influenza virus has emerged and on June 11 the World Health Organization declared it as pandemic.

It contributes to the understanding of medical explanation, both at the general level of the causes of diseases and at the individual level of the diagnoses of particular cases of a disease. The syntactic, model-theoretic, paradigm, and third-world accounts fail to capture the complexity of medical theories and explanations. Explanations of a disease do not always need to go down to the deep biochemical level displayed. Depending on the problem and audience at hand, a medical explanation may operate at a superficial level\u2014for example, when physicians tell their patients how they got sick. The most important task in medical research after determining the cause of a disease is developing a treatment for it. While drug discovery used to be largely a matter of serendipity or exhaustive search, current pharmaceutical research is based on a deep und...","Summary The Middle East Respiratory Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) was first isolated from a patient who died with severe pneumonia in June 2012. As of 19 June 2015, a total of 1,338 MERS-CoV infections have been notified to the World Health Organization (WHO). Clinical illness associated with MERS-CoV ranges from mild upper respiratory symptoms to rapidly progressive pneumonia and multi-organ failure. A significant proportion of patients present with non-respiratory symptoms such as headache, myalgia, vomiting and diarrhoea. A few potential therapeutic agents have been identified but none have been conclusively shown to be clinically effective. Human to human transmission is well documented, but the epidemic potential of MERS-CoV remains limited at present. Healthcare-associated clusters of MERS-CoV have been responsible for the majority of reported cases. The largest outbreaks have been driven by delayed diagnosis, overcrowding and poor infection control practices. However, chains of MERS-Co...","Objective To provide an overview of supply and demand issues in the vaccine industry and the policy options that have been implemented to resolve these issues. Data sources Medline, Policy File, and International Pharmaceutical Abstracts were searched to locate academic journal articles. Other sources reviewed included texts on the topics of vaccine history and policy, government agency reports, and reports from independent think tanks. Keywords included vaccines, immunizations, supply, demand, and policy. Study selection Search criteria were limited to English language and human studies. Articles pertaining to vaccine demand, supply, and public policy were selected and reviewed for inclusion. Data extraction By the authors. Data synthesis Vaccines are biologic medications, therefore making their development and production more difficult and costly compared with \u201csmall-molecule\u201d drugs. Research and development costs for vaccines can exceed $800 million, and development may require 10 y...","School closures have been enacted as a measure of mitigation during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic due to their ability to reduce transmission. It has been shown that school closures could cause absenteeism amongst healthcare workers with dependent children, but there is a need for detailed high-resolution analysis of the relationship between school closures and healthcare worker absenteeism to inform local community preparedness. We provide national- and county-level simulations of school closures and absenteeism across the United States. At the national level, we estimate the projected absenteeism rate to range from 7.5% to 8.6%, and the effectiveness of school closures to range from 172 to 218 fewer hospital beds used per 100,000 people at peak demand. At the county-level, we find substantial variations of projected absenteeism and school closure effects, ranging from 2.0% to 18.6% absenteeism and 88 to 280 fewer hospital beds used per 100,000 people at peak demand. We also find sign...","The response to the novel coronavirus outbreak in China suggests that many of the lessons from the 2003 SARS epidemic have been implemented and the response improved as a consequence. Nevertheless some questions remain and not all lessons have been successful. The national and international response demonstrates the complex link between public health, science and politics when an outbreak threatens to impact on global economies and reputations. The unprecedented measures implemented in China are a bold attempt to control the outbreak \u2013 we need to understand their effectiveness to balance costs and benefits for similar events in the future.","Purpose: The COVID-19 death-rate in Italy continues to climb, surpassing that in every other country. We implement one of the first nationally representative surveys about this unprecedented public health crisis and use it to evaluate the Italian government's public health efforts and citizen responses. Findings: (1) Public health messaging is being heard. At this point, the Italian people understand how to keep themselves and others safe from the SARS-Cov-2 virus. This is true for all population groups we studied, with the partial exception of slightly lower compliance among young adults. Remarkably, even those who do not trust the government, and those who think the government has been untruthful about the crisis mostly believe the public health message and claim to be acting in accordance. (2) The quarantine is beginning to have serious negative effects on the population's mental health. Policy Recommendations: Public health messaging is being heard and understood. The focus now sho...","Abstract There are many diseases for which a microbial aetiology is suspected. The hypothesis that a disease has an infectious cause is supported by: clinical features (similar to those of known infectious diseases, e.g. fever, leucocytosis), epidemiology (case clustering in time or location), histology (inflammation of affected tissues, e.g. granulomata) or characteristic microbial structures, treatment (clinical response to antimicrobial treatment), and prevention of disease by vaccines targeting microbial antigens. Proof that a microbe causes a disease requires more rigorous evidence. Future attempts to identify novel microbes associated with human disease may use sequence-based approaches. High-throughput sequencing may allow identification of unique microbial nucleic acid sequences in a background of host DNA. The complete sequencing of the human genome and multiple microbial genomes make this approach more feasible. DNA microarrays are also likely to be used in the search for nov...","The goal of contact tracing is to reduce the likelihood of transmission, particularly to individuals who are at greatest risk for developing complications of infection, as well as identifying individuals who are in need of medical treatment of other interventions. In this paper, we develop a simple mathematical model of contact investigations among a small group of individuals and apply game theory to explore conflicts of interest that may arise in the context of perceived costs of disclosure. Using analytic Kolmogorov equations, we determine whether or not it is possible for individual incentives to drive noncooperation, even though cooperation would yield a better group outcome. We found that if all individuals have a cost of disclosure, then the optimal individual decision is to simply not disclose each other. With further analysis of (1) completely offsetting the costs of disclosure and (2) partially offsetting the costs of disclosure, we found that all individuals disclose all con...","Background: The novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic is driving many countries to adopt global isolation measures in an attempt to slow-down its spread. These extreme measures are associated with extraordinary economic costs. Objective: To compare the cost-effectiveness of global isolation of the whole population to focused isolation of individuals at high risk of being exposed, augmented by thorough PCR testing. Design: We applied a modified Susceptible, Exposed, Infectious, Removed (SEIR) model to compare two different strategies in controlling the SARS-CoV-2 spread. Data sources and target population: We modeled the dynamics in Israel, a small country with ~ 9 million people. Time horizon: 200 days. Interventions: 1. Global isolation of the whole population (strategy 1) 2. Focused isolation of people at high risk of exposure with extensive PCR testing (strategy 2). Outcome measures: Number of deaths and the cost per one avoided death in strategy 1 vs 2. Results of Base-Case analy...","Abstract The outbreak of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) causing novel coronavirus-infected pneumonia (NCIP), has affected the lives of 71,429 people globally. Originating in China, the disease has a rapid progression to other countries. Research suggests remarkable genomic resemblance of 2019-nCoV with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) which has a history of a pandemic in 2002. With evidence of nosocomial spread, a number of diligent measures are being employed to constrain its propagation. Hence, the Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) has been established by the World Health Organization (WHO) with strategic objectives for public health to curtail its impact on global health and economy.","Social conflicts occur frequently during the social transition period and the polarization of public opinion happens occasionally. By introducing the social preference theory, the target of this paper is to reveal the micro-interaction mechanism of public opinion polarization. Firstly, we divide the social preferences of Internet users (network nodes) into three categories: egoistic, altruistic, and fair preferences, and adopt the revenue function to define the benefits obtained by individuals with different preferences among their interaction process so as to analyze their decision-making behaviors driven by the revenue. Secondly, the revenue function is used to judge the exit rules of nodes in a network, and then a dynamic network of spreading public opinion with the node (individual) exit mechanism is built based on a BA scale-free network. Subsequently, the influences of different social preferences, as well as individual revenue on the effect of public opinion polarization, are an...","The novel coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19)epidemic has brought serious social psychological impact to the Chinese people, especially those quarantined and thus with limited access to face-to-face communication and traditional social psychological interventions. To better deal with the urgent psychological problems of people involved in the COVID-19 epidemic, we developed a new psychological crisis intervention model by utilizing internet technology. This new model, one of West China Hospital, integrates physicians, psychiatrists, psychologists and social workers into Internet platforms to carry out psychological intervention to patients, their families and medical staff. We hope this model will make a sound basis for developing a more comprehensive psychological crisis intervention response system that is applicable for urgent social and psychological problems.","BACKGROUND: As the 2014 Ebola virus disease outbreak (EVD) transitions to its post-endemic phase, its impact on the future of global public health, particularly the World Health Organization (WHO), is the subject of continued debate. Criticism of WHO\u2019s performance grew louder in the outbreak\u2019s wake, placing this international health UN-specialized agency in the difficult position of navigating a complex series of reform recommendations put forth by different stakeholders. Decisions on WHO governance reform and the broader role of the United Nations could very well shape the future landscape of 21st century global health and how the international community responds to health emergencies. DISCUSSION: In order to better understand the implications of the EVD outbreak on global health and infectious disease governance, this debate article critically examines a series of reports issued by four high-level commissions/panels convened to specifically assess WHO\u2019s performance post-Ebola. Collec...","Public health preparedness requires effective surveillance of and rapid response to infectious disease outbreaks. Inclusion of research activities within the outbreak setting provides important opportunities to maximize limited resources, to enhance gains in scientific knowledge, and ultimately to increase levels of preparedness. With rapid advances in laboratory technologies, banking and analysis of human genomic specimens can be conducted as part of public health investigations, enabling valuable research well into the future.","Abstract Bronchiolitis is the number one cause of hospitalization in infants during the first year of life. Clinical guidelines recommend primarily supportive care and discourage use of pharmacotherapies and diagnostics. However, there continues to be widespread use of non-recommended therapies and variation in the use of therapeutic interventions among hospitals in the United States. Here we review evidence-based management of this common disease in order to optimize resource utilization, decrease healthcare costs, and decrease unnecessary hospitalization. Current evidence does not support the routine use of chest radiographs, viral testing or laboratory evaluation in children with bronchiolitis. In addition, routine administration of bronchodilators, including albuterol and nebulized epinephrine, corticosteroids and hypertonic saline are not recommended for infants and children with bronchiolitis. Intravenous or nasogastric hydration and nutritional support, supplemental oxygen, and ...","BACKGROUND: As internet and social media use have skyrocketed, epidemiologists have begun to use online data such as Google query data and Twitter trends to track the activity levels of influenza and other infectious diseases. In China, Weibo is an extremely popular microblogging site that is equivalent to Twitter. Capitalizing on the wealth of public opinion data contained in posts on Weibo, this study used Weibo as a measure of the Chinese people\u2019s reactions to two different outbreaks: the 2012 Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) outbreak, and the 2013 outbreak of human infection of avian influenza A(H7N9) in China. METHODS: Keyword searches were performed in Weibo data collected by The University of Hong Kong\u2019s Weiboscope project. Baseline values were determined for each keyword and reaction values per million posts in the days after outbreak information was released to the public. RESULTS: The results show that the Chinese people reacted significantly to both ou...","Social mixing patterns are crucial in driving transmission of infectious diseases and informing public health interventions to contain their spread. Age-specific social mixing is often inferred from surveys of self-recorded contacts which by design often have a very limited number of participants. In addition, such surveys are rare, so public health interventions are often evaluated by considering only one such study. Here we report detailed population contact patterns for United Kingdom based self-reported contact data from over 36,000 volunteers that participated in the massive citizen science project BBC Pandemic. The amount of data collected allows us generate fine-scale age-specific population contact matrices by context (home, work, school, other) and type (conversational or physical) of contact that took place. These matrices are highly relevant for informing prevention and control of new outbreaks, and evaluating strategies that reduce the amount of mixing in the population (su...","","In the past twenty years, numerous novel zoonotic viral agents with pandemic potential have emerged in China, such as the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus and, more recently, the avian-origin influenza A/H7N9 virus, which have caused outbreaks among humans with high morbidity and mortality. In addition, several emerging and re-emerging viral pathogens have also been imported into China from travelers, e.g. the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus and Zika virus (ZIKV). Herein, we review these emerging viral pathogens in China and focus on how surveillance by pathogen genomics has been employed to discover and annotate novel pathogenic agents, identify natural reservoirs, monitor the transmission events and delineate their evolution and adaption to the human host. We also highlight the application of genomic sequencing in the recent Ebola epidemics in Western Africa. In summary, genomic sequencing has become a standard research tool in the field of eme...","Summary Increasing international travel and migration can interfere with public health in both the country of destination and back home. The revised International Health Regulations (IHR) and travel disease sentinel networks are means to protect public and individual health. Public health risks related to infectious disease are higher in mass gatherings, in travellers visiting friends and relatives and in sexual encounters away from home. In contrast, in-flight transmission of infections plays only a limited role.","Over the past several decades, we have witnessed the emergence of many new infectious agents, some of which are major public threats. New and emerging infectious diseases which are both transmissible from patient-to-patient and virulent with a high mortality include novel coronaviruses (SARS-CoV, MERS-CV), hemorrhagic fever viruses (Lassa, Ebola), and highly pathogenic avian influenza A viruses, A(H5N1) and A(H7N9). All healthcare facilities need to have policies and plans in place for early identification of patients with a highly communicable diseases which are highly virulent, ability to immediately isolate such patients, and provide proper management (e.g., training and availability of personal protective equipment) to prevent transmission to healthcare personnel, other patients and visitors to the healthcare facility.","","Social distancing policies are critical but economically painful measures to flatten the curve against emergent infectious diseases. As the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19 spread throughout the United States in early 2020, the federal government issued social distancing recommendations but left to the states the most difficult and consequential decisions restricting behavior, such as canceling events, closing schools and businesses, and issuing stay-at-home orders. We present an original dataset of state-level social distancing policy responses to the epidemic and explore how political partisanship, COVID-19 caseload, and policy diffusion explain the timing of governors' decisions to mandate social distancing. An event history analysis of five social distancing policies across all fifty states reveals the most important predictors are political: all else equal, Republican governors and governors from states with more Trump supporters were slower to adopt social distancing polici..."],"title":["Will financial innovation transform pandemic response?","Lessons learned from the 2019-nCoV epidemic on prevention of future infectious diseases","The impact of unplanned school closure on children's social contact: Rapid evidence review","Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) coronavirus.
