Science-based approaches, which are an integral part of risk analysis to improve modern food safety systems, are intimately linked to processes such as good quality practices. Risk analysis strengthens the ability of traditional food safety systems to meet current challenges. Risk analysis is just one part of an effective food safety system. Other components of food safety system like food safety policies, food legislation, food inspection, laboratory analysis, epidemiological surveillance of food-borne diseases, monitoring systems for chemical and microbiological contamination in foods, and information, education and communication, also need to be improved continuously. \u201cFood safety controls\u201d are now being replaced by \u201crisk-based controls\u201d in all stages of food production...","Global gene expression analysis is beginning to move from the laboratories of basic investigators to large-scale clinical trials. The potential of this technology to improve diagnosis and tailored treatment of human disease may soon be realised, now that several comprehensive studies have demonstrated the utility of gene expression profiles for the classification of tumours into distinct, clinically relevant subtypes and the prediction of clinical outcomes. In addition, new data from the emerging proteomics platforms add another layer of molecular information to the study of human disease, as scientists attempt to catalogue a complete inventory of the proteins encoded by the genome and to establish a 'biosignature' profile of human health and disease. As a result, it is anticipated that, together, these technologies will facilitate the comprehensive study of genes, gene products and signalling pathways so that the objective of personalised molecular medicine can be achieved. This paper...","Microarrays can be constructed with dozens to millions of probes on their surface to allow high-throughput analyses of many biologic processes to be performed simultaneously on the same sample. Microarrays are now widely used for gene expression analysis, deoxyribonucleic acid resequencing, single-nucleotide polymorphism genotyping, and comparative genomic hybridization. Microarray technology is accelerating research in many fields and now microarrays are moving into clinical application. This review discusses the emerging role of microarrays in molecular diagnostics, pathogen detection, oncology, and pharmacogenomics.","Publisher Summary Proteomics is a promising approach for the study of viruses allowing a better understanding of disease processes and the development of new biomarkers for diagnosis and early detection of disease, thus accelerating drug development. Viral proteomics has included the analysis of viral particles to determine all proteins that compose the infectious virus, the examination of cellular proteins associated with a single viral protein in the hopes of determining all the functions of that viral protein, or the determination of cellular proteins induced or altered during a particular disease state. Viral particles of human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) and Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus/human herpesvirus 8 (KSHV/HHV-8) have been recently examined. During the herpesviral replicative cycle, different viral particles are formed. For HCMV, this includes mature, infectious virions, noninfectious enveloped particles, and dense bodies. A proteome database of B-lymphoblastoid cell l...","Abstract Since the outbreak of the new coronavirus epidemic, novel coronavirus has infected nearly 100,000 people in more than 110 countries. How to face this new coronavirus epidemic outbreak is an important issue. Basic reproduction number (R0) is an important parameter in epidemiology; The basic reproduction number of an infection can be thought of as the expected number of cases directly generated by one case in a population where all individuals are susceptible to infection. Epidemiology dynamics is a mathematical model based on a susceptibility-infection-recovery epidemic model. Researchers analyzed the epidemiological benefits of different transmission rates for the establishment of effective strategy in prevention and control strategies for epidemic infectious diseases. In this review, the early use of TCM for light and ordinary patients, can rapidly improve symptoms, shorten hospitalization days and reduce severe cases transformed from light and normal. Many TCM formulas and p...","Laboratory researchers and students may expose to hazardous and toxic chemicals. Implementation of the Occupational Health, Safety, and Environment Management System (OHSEMS) has become a critical aspect in higher education. This study presents an overview of the evaluation of the implementation of the OHSEMS in higher education laboratories. The implementation of the OHSEMS is to prevent occupational accidents in the laboratory. The study design is a semiquantitative descriptive study. The aim of the study is to evaluate the implementation of the OHSEMS in higher education institution laboratories by evaluating the percentages of OHSEMS compliance in higher education laboratories. Five aspects are evaluated: occupational health, safety, and environment (OHSE) policy and commitment, planning, implementation, evaluation, and management review. The result shows that the average compliance with the OHSE policy and commitment aspect is 59.4% and for the planning, implementation, evaluation...","Abstract Purpose The purpose of the study was (1) to identify the requirements for syndromic, disease surveillance and epidemiology systems arising from events such as the SARS outbreak in March 2003, and the deliberate spread of Bacillus anthracis, or anthrax, in the US in 2001; and (2) to use these specifications as input to the construction of a system intended to meet these requirements. An important goal was to provide information about the diffusion of a communicable disease without being dependent on centralised storage of information about individual patients or revealing patient-identifiable information. Methods The method applied is rooted in the engineering paradigm involving phases of analysis, system specification, design, implementation, and testing. The requirements were established from earlier projects\u2019 conclusions and analysis of disease outbreaks. The requirements were validated by a literature study of syndromic and disease surveillance systems. The system was teste...","Immunity to respiratory virus infection is governed by complex biological networks that influence disease progression and pathogenesis. Systems biology provides an opportunity to explore and understand these multifaceted interactions based on integration and modeling of multiple biological parameters. In this review, we describe new and refined systems-based approaches used to model, identify, and validate novel targets within complex networks following influenza and coronavirus infection. In addition, we propose avenues for extension and expansion that can revolutionize our understanding of infectious disease processes. Together, we hope to provide a window into the unique and expansive opportunity presented by systems biology to understand complex disease processes within the context of infectious diseases.","As an emerging infectious disease, the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has developed into a global pandemic. During the initial spreading of the virus in China, we demonstrated the ensemble Kalman filter performed well as a short-term predictor of the daily cases reported in Wuhan City. Second, we used an individual-level network-based model to reconstruct the epidemic dynamics in Hubei Province at its early stage and examine the effectiveness of non-pharmaceutical interventions on the epidemic spreading with various scenarios. Our simulation results show that without continued control measures, the epidemic in Hubei Province could have become persistent. Only by continuing to decrease the infection rate through 1) protective measures and 2) social distancing can the actual epidemic trajectory that happened in Hubei Province be reconstructed in simulation. Finally, we simulate the COVID-19 transmission with non-Markovian processes and show how these models produce different epidemi...","ABSTRACT Purpose Published literature regarding calf nutrition was reviewed to create an information base for the implementation of proper nutritional management to maximize health and productivity. Sources The main source of data and information for this review was peer-reviewed literature. Synthesis Feeding a sufficient volume of colostrum during the first hours of life is crucial to calf health and survival; however, less is known about transition milk feeding and the potential benefits of the myriad of bioactive compounds it contains. After feeding colostrum and transition milk, calves are susceptible to diarrhea when moved onto high amounts of milk, and antibiotic use is often necessary to decrease disease. Feeding an elevated plane of milk nutrition results in increased ADG and, in some studies, increased future milk production. Thus, this nutritional strategy is recommended; however, weaning calves from high volumes of milk represents massive changes in the structure and microbi...","Abstract The human bocavirus is one of the most common respiratory viruses and occurs in all age groups. It is associated with upper and lower respiratory tract infections, and causes clinical symptoms from the mild common cold to life threatening respiratory diseases. Besides its ability to persist the virus appears to trigger chronic lung disease and increase the clinical symptoms, while being a putative trigger for fibrotic lung diseases. Laboratory diagnostics should include serological diagnostics in order to rule out a viremia because due to prolonged viral shedding acute and chronic infections cannot be differentiated on the detection of viral nucleic acids in respiratory specimen alone. Although Koch\u2019s postulates cannot be formally fulfilled due to the lack of an animal model and the chance for clinical trials with volunteers are limited due to the long term effects of HBoV infections, there is no doubt that the virus is a serious pathogen and requires attention. The aim of the...","The recent Ebola and Zika epidemics demonstrate the need for the continuous surveillance, rapid diagnosis and real-time tracking of emerging infectious diseases. Fast, affordable sequencing of pathogen genomes \u2014 now a staple of the public health microbiology laboratory in well-resourced settings \u2014 can affect each of these areas. Coupling genomic diagnostics and epidemiology to innovative digital disease detection platforms raises the possibility of an open, global, digital pathogen surveillance system. When informed by a One Health approach, in which human, animal and environmental health are considered together, such a genomics-based system has profound potential to improve public health in settings lacking robust laboratory capacity. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The online version of this article (doi:10.1038/nrg.2017.88) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.","Mass spectrometry (MS) has found numerous applications in life sciences. It has high accuracy, sensitivity and wide dynamic range in addition to medium- to high-throughput capabilities. These features make MS a superior platform for analysis of various biomolecules including proteins, lipids, nucleic acids and carbohydrates. Until recently, MS was applied for protein detection and characterization. During the last decade, however, MS has successfully been used for molecular diagnostics of microbial and viral infections with the most notable applications being identification of pathogens, genomic sequencing, mutation detection, DNA methylation analysis, tracking of transmissions, and characterization of genetic heterogeneity. These new developments vastly expand the MS application from experimental research to public health and clinical fields. Matching of molecular techniques with specific requirements of the major MS platforms has produced powerful technologies for molecular diagnosti...","Abstract A novel coronavirus designated as 2019-nCoV first appeared in Wuhan, China in late December 2019. Dozens of people died in China, and thousands of people infected as 2019-nCoV continues to spread around the world. We have described the discovery, emergence, genomic characteristics, and clinical diagnostics of 2019-nCoV.","Viruses are evolving at an alarming rate, spreading and inconspicuously adapting to cutting-edge therapies. Therefore, the search for rapid, informative and reliable diagnostic methods is becoming urgent as ever. Conventional clinical tests (PCR, serology, etc.) are being continually optimized, yet provide very limited data. Could high throughput sequencing (HTS) become the future gold standard in molecular diagnostics of viral infections? Compared to conventional clinical tests, HTS is universal and more precise at profiling pathogens. Nevertheless, it has not yet been widely accepted as a diagnostic tool, owing primarily to its high cost and the complexity of sample preparation and data analysis. Those obstacles must be tackled to integrate HTS into daily clinical practice. For this, three objectives are to be achieved: (1) designing and assessing universal protocols for library preparation, (2) assembling purpose-specific pipelines, and (3) building computational infrastructure to s...","Since the first identification of the virus in 1971, the disease caused by canine coronavirus (CCoV) has not been adequately investigated, and the role that the virus plays in canine enteric illness has not been well established. Only after the emergence in 2002 of SARS in human has new attention been focused on coronaviruses. As a consequence of the relatively high mutation frequency of RNA-positive stranded viruses, CCoV has evolved and, with the biomolecular techniques developed over the last two decades, new virus strains, serotypes, and subtypes have been identified in infected dogs. Considering the widespread nature of CCoV infections among dog populations, several studies have been carried out, focusing upon the epidemiological relevance of these viruses and underlining the need for further investigation into the biology of CCoVs and into the pathogenetic role of the infections. This paper reports the evolutionary processes of CCoVs with a note onto recent diagnostic methods.","The World Health Organization (WHO) published 2 alcohol-based formulations to be used in healthcare settings and for outbreak-associated infections, but inactivation efficacies of these products have not been determined against (re-)emerging viruses. In this study, we evaluated the virucidal activity of these WHO products in a comparative analysis. Zika virus (ZIKV), Ebola virus (EBOV), severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) as (re-)emerging viral pathogens and other enveloped viruses could be efficiently inactivated by both WHO formulations, implicating their use in healthcare systems and viral outbreak situations.","Public health professionals are considering how molecular medicine applications can impact on preventive medicine and health provision enabling interventions to start earlier. There is the potential for molecular medicine to improve the workplace although inappropriate use will lead to discrimination. The public health issue of communicable diseases is being addressed through molecular medicine in more effective and early detection and a better understanding of pathogenesis. A threat from emerging and re-emerging infections requires multiple approaches but early and definitive detection will need nucleic acid based approaches. The non-communicable diseases are now a global world problem, particularly obesity. While molecular medicine is still to make a significant impact on this disorder some interesting findings are emerging about the role of genes in obesity. Ultimately, global health issues must include more efficient and environmentally sustainable strategies. Molecular technologie...","Human coronaviruses continue to pose a threat to human health. The emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in December 2019 which causes coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19), an acute respiratory disease marked the third introduction of a highly pathogenic coronavirus into the human population in the twenty-first century. This recent emergence of a previously unknown coronavirus in China leads to huge impacts on humans globally. Covid-19 is a challenge to global public health. Here, we discuss the COVID-19 outbreak in a one health context, highlighting the need for the implementation of one health measures and practices to improve human health and reduce the emergence of pandemic viruses.","A recent outbreak of novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of COVID-19, has spread rapidly all over the world. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is another deadly virus and causes acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Rapid and early detection of these viruses will facilitate early intervention and reduce disease transmission risk. Here, we present an All-In-One Dual CRISPR-Cas12a (termed \"AIOD-CRISPR\") assay method for simple, rapid, ultrasensitive, one-pot, and visual detection of coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 and HIV virus. In our AIOD CRISPR assay, a pair of crRNAs was introduced to initiate dual CRISPR-Cas12a detection and improve detection sensitivity. The AIOD-CRISPR assay system was successfully utilized to detect nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) of SARS-CoV-2 and HIV with a sensitivity of few copies. Also, it was evaluated by detecting HIV-1 RNA extracted from human plasma samples, achieving a comparable sensitivity with real-time RT-PCR method. Thus, our method has a ...","Much of the uncertainty about the progression of the COVID-19 pandemic stems from questions about when and how non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPI) by governments, in particular social distancing measures, are implemented, to what extent the population complies with these measures, and how compliance changes through time. Further uncertainty comes from a lack of knowledge of the potential effects of removing interventions once the epidemic is declining. By combining an epidemiological model of COVID-19 for the United Kingdom with simple sub-models for these societal processes, this study aims to shed light on the conceivable trajectories that the pandemic might follow over the next 1.5 years. We show strong improvements in outcomes if governments review NPI more frequently whereas, in comparison, the stability of compliance has surprisingly small effects on cumulative mortality. Assuming that mortality does considerably increase once a country's hospital capacity is breached, we show...","Sepsis, acute lung injury, and ARDS contribute substantially to the expanding burden of critical illness within our ICUs. Each of these processes is characterized by a myriad of injurious events, including apoptosis, microvascular dysfunction, abnormal coagulation, and dysregulated host immunity. Only recently have platelets\u2014long considered merely effectors of thrombosis\u2014been implicated in inflammatory conditions and the pathobiology of these disease processes. A growing body of evidence suggests a prominent role for maladaptive platelet activation and aggregation during sepsis and ARDS and has begun to underscore the pluripotential influence of platelets on outcomes in critical illness. Not only do platelets enhance vascular injury through thrombotic mechanisms but also appear to help orchestrate pathologic immune responses and are pivotal players in facilitating leukocyte recruitment to vulnerable tissue. These events contribute to the organ damage and poor patient outcomes that stil...","Abstract It was widely believed in the late 1960s that infectious diseases had been conquered by vaccines and antibiotics and humans were no longer under threat by microbial pathogens. Yet, since that time more than 60 pathogens have been discovered that can cause serious emerging infectious diseases. Molecular methods have played critical roles in the discovery, monitoring, and clinical diagnostics of emerging pathogens. In this chapter, we present well-recognized emerging pathogens. We provide examples of the utility of molecular assays in research and clinical care of emerging infectious diseases. We also discuss some theoretical and practical limitations of molecular tests and the future prospects of expanding molecular diagnostics for emerging pathogens based on new advances of knowledge and technologies.","","More than 50 emerging and reemerging pathogens have been identified during the last 40 years. Until 1992 when the Institute of Medicine issued a report that defined emerging infectious diseases, medicine had been complacent about such infectious diseases despite the alarm bells of infections with human immunodeficiency virus. Molecular tools have proven useful in discovering and characterizing emerging viruses and bacteria such as Sin Nombre virus (hantaviral pulmonary syndrome), hepatitis C virus, Bartonella henselae (cat scratch disease, bacillary angiomatosis), and Anaplasma phagocytophilum (human granulocytotropic anaplasmosis). The feasibility of applying molecular diagnostics to dangerous, fastidious, and uncultivated agents for which conventional tests do not yield timely diagnoses has achieved proof of concept for many agents, but widespread use of cost-effective, validated commercial assays has yet to occur. This review presents representative emerging viral respiratory infect...","","Abstract With the outbreak of unknown pneumonia in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, a new coronavirus, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), aroused the attention of the entire world. The current outbreak of infections with SARS-CoV-2 is termed Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). The World Health Organization declared COVID-19 in China as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. Two other coronavirus infections\u2014SARS in 2002-2003 and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) in 2012\u2014both caused severe respiratory syndrome in humans. All 3 of these emerging infectious diseases leading to a global spread are caused by \u03b2-coronaviruses. Although coronaviruses usually infect the upper or lower respiratory tract, viral shedding in plasma or serum is common. Therefore, there is still a theoretical risk of transmission of coronaviruses through the transfusion of labile blood products. Because more and more asymptomatic infections are being found among COVID-19 c...","Abstract To accomplish the goals of successful management practice, what\u2019s important has to be determined. This chapter looks at the evolution of security as a management activity. The growth of services, products, and systems is provided. Most important security threats are presented.","The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak, which was identified in late 2019, requires special attention because of its future epidemics and possible global threats. Beside clinical procedures and treatments, since Artificial Intelligence (AI) promises a new paradigm for healthcare, several different AI tools that are built upon Machine Learning (ML) algorithms are employed for analyzing data and decision-making processes. This means that AI-driven tools help identify COVID-19 outbreaks as well as forecast their nature of spread across the globe. However, unlike other healthcare issues, for COVID-19, to detect COVID-19, AI-driven tools are expected to have active learning-based cross-population train/test models that employs multitudinal and multimodal data, which is the primary purpose of the paper.","Publisher Summary This chapter lists the important subjects that are discussed in the publication Studies in Natural Products Chemistry, Volumes 1\u201330, such as abdominal pain, acaricidal activities, acanthenes, gibberellins, glucoamylases, macarpine, and quercetin. The terms are mentioned along with the page numbers in which they are discussed in the publication.","For more than 30 years X-ray crystallography has been by far the most powerful approach for determining the structures of viruses and viral proteins at atomic resolution. The information provided by these structures, which covers many important aspects of the viral life cycle such as cell-receptor recognition, viral entry, nucleic acid transfer and genome replication, has extensively enriched our vision of the virus world. Many of the structures available correspond to potential targets for antiviral drugs against important human pathogens. This article provides an overview of the current knowledge of different structural aspects of the above-mentioned processes.","Many viruses are surrounded by a continuous bilayer membrane studded with viral proteins. Its purpose is to protect the genome-containing virus nucleocapsid from damage, and to facilitate entry of the nucleocapsid into a host cell. Viral membrane proteins attach the virus to the host cell, and promote fusion between viral and host cell membranes. Enveloped viruses form by a budding process, involving the wrapping up of newly synthesized nucleocapsids with regions of host cell membranes containing host cell lipids but exclusively viral proteins. Host cell machinery and processes are co-opted by enveloped viruses for use at every stage of these viral events.","Abstract The development of rapid, accurate, and sensitive diagnostic methods for detecting pathogens is the basis for treating, controlling, and eradicating infectious diseases of veterinary importance. Scientific and technological advancements have revolutionized the field of veterinary diagnostics. Genome sequencing has allowed efficient, sensitive, and specific diagnostic assays to be developed based on the detection of nucleic acids. The integration of advances in biochemistry, proteomics, engineering, and medicine offers enormous potential for the rapid and accurate diagnosis of viral, microbial, genetic, and metabolic disease. In the future, polymerase chain reaction assays, microarray testing, genomic analysis, and metabolic profiling will be accomplished in a rapid, portable, sensitive, and cost-efficient manner.","Publisher Summary Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is caused by a coronavirus (CoV), SARSCoV. SARS-CoV belongs to the family Coronaviridae, which are enveloped RNA viruses in the order Nidovirales. Global research efforts are continuing to increase the understanding of the virus, the pathogenesis of the disease it causes (SARS), and the \u201cheterogeneity of individual infectiousness\u201d as well as shedding light on how to prepare for other emerging viral diseases. Promising drugs and vaccines have been identified. The milestones achieved have resulted from a truly international effort. Molecular studies dissected the adaptation of this virus as it jumped from an intermediary animal, the civet, to humans, thus providing valuable insights into processes of molecular emergence.","The aim of this study was to demonstrate how latent epidemics can potentially evolve into a pandemic instantaneously due to globally mobile human population in recent times, as can be seen in the ongoing Ebola epidemic in West Africa. Selected cases of current epidemics are used in this study to identify emergent patterns. These cases exemplify the need for a comprehensive analysis of infectious diseases and serve as an initial stage when developing appropriate strategies in improving epidemic management. This study can help better understand the complexities of infectious diseases and assist in developing a specific set of preventative processes from the individual to international levels when developing strategies to reducing the effects of an epidemic outbreak.","Abstract This review is concerned with what has been learned about feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) diagnostics and therapeutics since the publication of an extensive overview of literature covering the period 1963\u20132009. Although progress has been made in both areas, obtaining a definitive diagnosis of FIP remains a problem for those veterinarians and/or cat owners who require absolute certainty. This review will cover both indirect and direct diagnostic tests for the disease and will emphasize their limitations, as well as their specificity and sensitivity. There is still no effective treatment for FIP, although there are both claims that such therapies exist and glimmers of hope coming from new therapies that are under research. FIP has also been identified in wild felids and FIP-like disease is now a growing problem among pet ferrets.","This work compares deaths for confirmed COVID-19 cases in China to eight other countries, Italy, Spain, France, USA, UK, Germany, Netherlands and South Korea. After implementing varying intensities and timing of social distancing measures, several appear to be converging onto the decline in the daily growth rate of deaths, or relative second derivative of total deaths, seen in China after the implementation an aggressive social distancing policy. By calculating future trajectories in these countries based on the observed Chinese fatality statistics, an estimate of the total deaths and maximum daily death rates over a defined period of time is made. Our lower bound estimate for the United Kingdom based on the real data approximates the lower bound estimate of the recent modelling study of Ferguson et al. [1]. These results suggest there may be a threshold of effective public health intervention. Our method of viewing the data may be helpful in monitoring the course of the epidemic, judg...","With respect to the asymptomatic transmission characteristics of the novel coronavirus that appeared in 2019 (COVID-19), a susceptible-asymptomatic-infected-recovered-death (SAIRD) model that considered human mobility was constructed in this study. The dissemination of COVID-19 was simulated using computational experiments to identify the mechanisms underlying the impact of city and residential lockdowns on controlling the spread of the epidemic. Results: The implementation of measures to lock down cities led to higher mortality rates in these cities, due to reduced mobility. Moreover, implementing city lockdown along with addition of hospital beds led to improved cure and reduced mortality rates. Stringent implementation and early lockdown of residential units effectively controlled the spread of the epidemic, and reduced the number of hospital bed requirements. Collectively, measures to lock down cities and residential units should be taken to prevent the spread of COVID-19. In addit...","We present a timely evaluation of the impact of lockdown on the 2019-nCov epidemic in Hubei province, China. The implementation appears to be effective in reducing about 60% of new infections and deaths, and its effect also appears to be sustainable even after its removal. Delaying its implementation reduces its effectiveness. However, the direct economic cost of such a lockdown remains to be seen and whether the model is replicable in other Chinese regions remains a matter of further investigation.","Summary Bananins are a class of antiviral compounds with a unique structural signature incorporating a trioxa-adamantane moiety covalently bound to a pyridoxal derivative. Six members of this class of compounds: bananin, iodobananin, vanillinbananin, ansabananin, eubananin, and adeninobananin were synthesized and tested as inhibitors of the SARS Coronavirus (SCV) helicase. Bananin, iodobananin, vanillinbananin, and eubananin were effective inhibitors of the ATPase activity of the SCV helicase with IC50 values in the range 0.5\u20133 \u03bcM. A similar trend, though at slightly higher inhibitor concentrations, was observed for inhibition of the helicase activities, using a FRET-based fluorescent assay. In a cell culture system of SCV, bananin exhibited an EC50 of less than 10 \u03bcM and a CC50 of over 300 \u03bcM. Kinetics of inhibition are consistent with bananin inhibiting an intracellular process or processes involved in SCV replication.","In December 2019, an outbreak of atypical pneumonia (Coronavirus disease 2019 -COVID-19) associated with a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) was reported in Wuhan city, Hubei province, China. The outbreak was traced to a seafood wholesale market and human to human transmission was confirmed. The rapid spread and the death toll of the new epidemic warrants immediate intervention. The intra-host genomic variability of SARS-CoV-2 plays a pivotal role in the development of effective antiviral agents and vaccines, but also in the design of accurate diagnostics. We analyzed NGS data derived from clinical samples of three Chinese patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, in order to identify small- and large-scale intra-host variations in the viral genome. We identified tens of low- or higher-frequency single nucleotide variations (SNVs) with variable density across the viral genome, affecting 7 out of 10 protein-coding viral genes. The majority of these SNVs corresponded to missense changes. The annot...","Cellular and viral S-adenosylmethionine-dependent methyltransferases are involved in many regulated processes such as metabolism, detoxification, signal transduction, chromatin remodeling, nucleic acid processing, and mRNA capping. The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus nsp16 protein is a S-adenosylmethionine-dependent (nucleoside-2\u2032-O)-methyltransferase only active in the presence of its activating partner nsp10. We report the nsp10/nsp16 complex structure at 2.0 \u00c5 resolution, which shows nsp10 bound to nsp16 through a \u223c930 \u00c5(2) surface area in nsp10. Functional assays identify key residues involved in nsp10/nsp16 association, and in RNA binding or catalysis, the latter likely through a SN2-like mechanism. We present two other crystal structures, the inhibitor Sinefungin bound in the S-adenosylmethionine binding pocket and the tighter complex nsp10(Y96F)/nsp16, providing the first structural insight into the regulation of RNA capping enzymes in (+)RNA viruses.","","Type I interferon (IFN) is one of the first lines of cellular defense against viral pathogens. As a result of IFN signaling, a wide array of IFN-stimulated gene (ISG) products is upregulated to target different stages of the viral life cycle. We review recent findings implicating a subset of ISGs in translational regulation of viral and host mRNAs. Translation inhibition is mediated either by binding to viral RNA or by disrupting physiological interactions or levels of the translation complex components. In addition, many of these ISGs localize to translationally silent cytoplasmic granules, such as stress granules and processing bodies, and intersect with the microRNA (miRNA)-mediated silencing pathway to regulate translation of cellular mRNAs.","Background: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a virus that causes severe respiratory illness in humans, which eventually results in the current outbreak of novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) around the world. The research community is interested to know what are the hotspots in coronavirus (CoV) research and how much is known about COVID-19. This study aimed to evaluate the characteristics of publications involving coronaviruses as well as COVID-19 by using a topic modeling analysis. Methods: We extracted all abstracts and retained the most informative words from the COVID-19 Open Research Dataset, which contains all the 35,092 pieces of coronavirus related literature published up to March 20, 2020. Using Latent Dirichlet Allocation modeling, we trained an eight-topic model from the corpus. We then analyzed the semantic relationships between topics and compared the topic distribution between COVID-19 and other CoV infections. Results: Eight topics emerge...","Practical relevance Blood transfusions are a potentially life-saving procedure that are within the reach of most small animal practitioners. Only minimal equipment is required. Patient group Any cat with clinical signs attributable to a reduced red blood cell mass that is affecting oxygen transport (as a result of reduced packed cell volume or acute blood loss) is a potential candidate for a transfusion. Clinical challenges Although the principles of transfusion medicine are not complicated, there can be fatal consequences if certain steps are omitted. Diagnostics Blood typing kits and blood filters are readily available from veterinary wholesalers, laboratories and blood banking services. Evidence base Over the past three decades, a substantial body of clinical research and reports has built up covering feline blood types and transfusion medicine. This article draws on that research to provide clinical guidance aimed at all veterinarians in feline or small animal practice who either c...","Abstract This paper reviews the impact of infections on the onset and clinical course of bronchial asthma. A just emphasis is given to the role viral infections, particularly rhinovirus infections, play in exacerbations, and that played by respiratory syncytial virus, suspected of triggering the asthmatic syndrome. The mechanisms of the immune response to virus attacks are explained, highlighting the asthmatic and allergic patient's weakened response, particularly in the perinatal period. Further stressed is a potentiating effect of viral aggression on the allergic response. The hygiene hypothesis and its lack of scientific consistency is detailed, at least as far as the role it seeks to confer on an unproven antagonism of the Th1 and Th2 lymphocyte responses. The current importance of research not into bacteria, but into bacterial products, including endotoxins, on the modulation of asthma and allergy is noted. Studies which, along these lines, show an environmental impact on genetic ...","Rapid diagnostics, vaccines and therapeutics are important interventions for the management of the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak. It is timely to systematically review the potential of these interventions, including those for Middle East respiratory syndrome-Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV, to guide policymakers globally on their prioritization of resources for research and development. A systematic search was carried out in three major electronic databases (PubMed, Embase and Cochrane Library) to identify published studies in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Supplementary strategies through Google Search and personal communications were used. A total of 27 studies fulfilled the criteria for review. Several laboratory protocols for confirmation of suspected 2019-nCoV cases using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) have been publ...","Using a sensitive research-grade infrared camera, we find that common facial cosmetics and lotions mask skin temperature in assays of the human forehead. We test a family of 10 commonly-used cosmetic products and find that volatile liquids and creams lower thermal skin temperature by at least 2 C for up to 5-10 min and at least 1 C for up to 20 min, respectively. Powder and cream that contains brightening agent lower indefinitely the skin temperature sensed by infrared camera. With the qualification that these experiments were performed in a controlled laboratory setting rather than the mass crowd screening environment where infrared temperature sensing of humans sees widespread use, our tests suggest that for human subjects whose face was treated with certain cosmetics and lotions, infrared-based screening for elevated facial temperature (fever) can be unreliable."],"title":["Inactivation photochimique des pathog\u00e8nes des plaquettes et du plasma : cinq ans d\u2019utilisation clinique de routine et d\u2019h\u00e9movigilance.

1 , Chin-Yu Chen 2 , Tzu-Ping Shih 2 , Wen-Chih Wu 3 , Cho-ching Sun 4 Background: The use of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) for the intensive care unit quality indicators to monitor important items,not only will extend the hospital stay will increase the cost of medical care (Ashraf &amp; Ostrosky-Zeichner, 2012), so there is a systematic introduction to prevent the combination of care, remodel the correct concept of staff care, the implementation of unified and more effective care measures in the combined care, but also to respirator patients with oral care is more important, Expect effective prevention of VAP, improve patient cleaning and comfort, in order to enhance the professional care and service quality. In April 2016, The team used technical audit and observation methods. The average correct rate of nursing staff was 73.3%, and the integrity of oral care was only 68.7%. First, the newly transferred personnel to protect the lack of awareness (19.7%); Second, the lack of appropriate care products can be used (21.8%);Third, there is no relevant care operation check mechanism and standard operating practices (16.2%), so the purpose of this project is to improve the integrity of oral care to 95%. Methods: In order to improve the integrity of oral care for nursing staff, improvement measures are made every month from June to September, 2016. 1. Participate in TRM competition and external expert clinical guidance. 2. Improved care products and equipment, use multi-functional aspiration toothbrush,oral denture and 0.2% Chlorhexidine oral cleaning gel to mouthwash. 3. System to prevent the prevention of VAP care standards: revised special oral care technology, and develop the use of breathing apparatus operating instructions. 4. Implementation of VAP care check and reward: internal check, outside the hospital inspection counseling, Bundle protection angel recognition and implementation of the incentive system. Results: June 2016-May 2017prevention of VAP care integrity check results care integrity 99.4%, Nurses' knowledge of oral care increased from 81.2% to 100%; And maintain VAP zero case. Conclusion: Since the introduction of modular care, the unit has been effective in preventing infection and significantly improving peer awareness and care skills. Effective teamwork can increase the efficiency of the work, in the process of care, while buy and use the new improved care products, not only more convenient and effective; the current hospital has been promoted to the implementation of the respiratory care ward, To share the unit to promote the implementation of experience, in order to achieve the purpose of maintaining patient safety and improve the quality of medical services.","-The Sepsitest\u2122-assay can be used in clinical practice for molecular analysis directly on blood samples. -Implementation of the assay may provide additional detection of bacteraemic patients, but results have to be evaluated with sequence results. -Gel-based analysis is applicable, but may be troublesome to implement in the routine workflow. Background and Objectives: Respiratory Infections cause significant morbidity and mortality in both developed and developing countries. Influenza A and B (Flu A&amp;B), RNA viruses of the family Orthomyxoviridae, spreads in regular epidemics resulting in the deaths of more than 250,000 people worldwide annually. Human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a negative single-stranded RNA virus of the family Paramyxoviridae. RSV is the major cause of lower respiratory tract infection and hospital visits during infancy and childhood. Human metapneumovirus (hMPV) is a negative single-stranded RNA virus of the family Paramyxoviridae, and may be the second most common cause (after RSV) of lower respiratory infection in young children. Utilizing proprietary chemistries and processes, we have developed novel, room temperature stable reagents for use in our AmpliVue Taqman \u00ae -based, multiplexed, rt-PCR assays for the detection of Flu A&amp;B or hMPV/RSV. As an added benefit, the AmpliVue\u2122 assays provide a simplified workflow, significantly reducing the number of end-user manipulations required to perform testing. These attributes allow for more widespread and reliable use of molecular diagnostics in the detection of respiratory viruses. In this report, we describe the initial studies performed with these reagents on both the Applied Biosystems \u00ae 7500 FastDx and the Cepheid \u00ae SmartCycler. Methods and Results: Testing was performed on cultured isolates or clinical specimens to establish initial performance of the assays. RNA was extracted on either a NucliSENS \u00ae easyMag \u00ae or Roche MagNA Pure Compact and 5 ul of each sample was added to reconstituted master mix. Each cultured influenza A and B isolate was detected; 19/19 and 14/14, respectively. Clinical specimens analyzed for the presence of either RSV A, RSV B or hMPV were able to detect 10/10 RSV A, 13/13 RSV B, and 26/26 hMPV. Specificity was 100% for all samples evaluated. Initial analytical sensitivity tests for the various viruses indicated detection limits less than 50 TCID50/ml and/or 10vp/mL for each target. Testing with isolates of other common viruses and bacteria confirmed that these reagents are not cross reactive with other common respiratory pathogens.","Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) will continue to be an emerging global threat. The WHO and other agencies have developed ambitious initiatives to combat AMR. However, a serious barrier to surveillance of AMR is that the worst affected regions of the world, including sub-Saharan Africa, have generated the least data on prevalence and trends of AMR, a key step in addressing the problem [8] . Effective resolution of AMR will need multistakeholder international cooperation, including the biotechnology industry and regulatory authorities, and effective international implementation by health authorities and health professionals of guidelines on the judicious use of any powerful new classes of treatment which emerge [9 , 10] . Developments in diagnostics are likely to include more advanced imaging, increasing availability of point of care testing (biochemical and genomic), and the further extension of genomics into clinical practice, potentially before and around the time of birth. There will be increasing opportunities for using real-world evidence to assist in regulation of medicines, in particular for rare and orphan diseases [11] . Expected further and new therapeutic approaches -many with ethical challenges -include biosimilars, more precision medicines with companion diagnostics [12] , regenerative medicine, gene editing, more advanced microsurgery and robotics, therapeutic radiology and new devices for managing diabetes mellitus, pain control, heart disease and many other conditions. Also in prospect is much more from digital health, including both empowering patients and further transfer of responsibility for health monitoring from health professionals to patients. However, another side to digital health is the power of social media to inform -and misinform -patients, health professionals and other stakeholders about health-related matters. This is one of several reasons for low adherence to long-term treatment, for example for control of high blood pressure [13] . Another possible impact of widespread access to and use of social media has been vaccine hesitancy: delay or refusal to accept immunization [14] . For example, population protection from the potentially serious infectious disease measles has decreased alarmingly both in the general public -and in some regions even among health professionals. To counter this, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control has been funded to work jointly with the European Medicines Agency to provide Europe-wide information to vaccine-hesitant populations and respond to their concerns, and to provide toolkits for healthcare workers and public health experts to support their effort s to improve the uptake of immunization programmes [15] .","The GenoType \u00ae Cdiff assay for the direct detection of Clostridium difficile and major ribotypes from stool shows rapid, sensitive and specific results. The DNA isolation is fully automated. The turnaround time (including hands on time) is approximately 1.5 hours for DNA isolation, 2 hours for amplification and 2 hours for hybridization. The assay provides more information (ribotypes, toxins, binary toxins and Moxifloxacin resistance) as any presently available commercial CD test. Objectives: Implementation of rapid molecular diagnostics in bloodstream infections could significantly improve speed of diagnosis, and thereby outcome. Current molecular tests directly on whole blood samples have suboptimal sensitivity, due to the use of small volumes. Larger volumes show an inhibitory effect of human DNA. The Sepsitest\u2122-assay (Molzym, Germany) incorporates a pre-test enrichment method, which selectively eliminates human cells. This may lead to an increase in input volume and subsequent diagnostic sensitivity. We investigated the use of this assay in a cohort of patient with sepsis on the ICU.","The UK parliament formalized Brexit -divorce from the EUat the end of January 2020. The type of manpower mobility arrangements for health workers due to be negotiated by the end of 2020 between the UK and EU will have a specific and important bearing on the already hard-pressed medical services in the UK [6] . There remains additional uncertainty following Brexit about arrangements for continuity of supplies of medicines, regulation of medicinal products and transnational access to new medicines across the region [7] . Trade and tariff barriers arising from evolving isolationist policies of the USA are also likely to restrict progress on implementation and the health impact of achieving the UN's Sustainable Development Goals, not least through increased international costs of diagnostics, devices and medicines.","The production of finished feeds ready for consumption by the animal can occur on the farm, in a feed mill, or at a pet food manufacturing facility. In all cases, raw materials are received and included in species-specific formulations. Animal diet formulations take into account the required nutrients of the animal and the nutrients provided by the raw ingredients. The manufacture of raw ingredients into complete finished feeds can include multiple processes. These processes can include grinding, mixing, pelleting, and/or extrusion. Grinding can be done through a roller mill or hammer mill. The goal of grinding is to ensure all components for the finished feed have a similar particle size for uniform distribution during further processing and consumption. Following grinding, all ingredients must be mixed or blended for uniform distribution. Uniformly blended feeds can be further processed by pelleting or extrusion, both thermally intensive processes. During both pelleting and extrusion, the ground ingredients are passed through a mixing chamber and pushed through a die of a desired size. Pelleted and extruded products can increase bulk density and improve handling along with improving protein digestibility. The form of the complete finished diets can vary, from ground mash types to pelleted. Finished pet foods can also be in various forms, from kibbles to pate with gravy to jerky type.","Therefore, we maintain that the urgent implementation and monitoring of diagnostic capacities and capabilities for SARS-CoV-2 in Europe is proportional to the containment and expected mitigation phase of the global public health response and is critical for care of local patients. The implementation of SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics does not replace nor exclude diagnostic capacity for other respiratory viruses. Moreover, it explicitly does not disregard the importance of other seasonal respiratory pathogens for public and patient health. This is clearly illustrated by the authors themselves, who indicate that they have tested thousands of samples of patients suspected of respiratory viral disease not only for common respiratory pathogens but also for SARS-CoV-2. The fact that Colson et al. found a wide range of seasonal respiratory viruses indeed underlines the impact of such pathogens. Furthermore, it clearly shows that diagnosis of respiratory viruses cannot be done syndrome-based and supports the need for the availability of diagnostics for a panel of pathogens including SARS-CoV-2.","Creating an health environment by the implementation of bundle care for prevention of catheter-associated urinary tract infections at a medical center Hsin-Hsin Chang 1 , Jann-Tay Wang 1,2 , Yee-Chun Chen 1,2 , Wang-Huei Sheng 1,2 . 1 Center for Infection Control, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan, 2 Department of Internal Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital Background: According to the 2006-2016 Taiwan Nosocomial Infections Surveillance System (TNIS), the most common HAI is catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTIs). CAUTIs result in significant morbidity, mortality, and medical cost. This prompted us to investigate the impact of infection control measures, such as CAUTI bundle care. Bundle care has been proven to effectively reduce CAUTI in many literatures. Well-structured infection control programs are imperative in order to the prevent CAUTI. Methods: Prospective surveillance was performed on all patients admitted to the National Taiwan University Hospital (NTUH). All patients developing healthcare-associated uninary tract infection (HAUTI), including CAUTI while their staying at NTUH during 2008 to 2016 were enrolled for analysis. A CAUTI bundle care was implemented in the entire hospital, particular focus on ICUs, since 2010. The bundle care emphasized 4C elements: clean practice, clean products, clean equipment, and clean environment. A comprehensive educational program including optimization of the catheterization process, demonstrating by teaching videos for learning purposes, clinical audit, Objective Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE) for nurses and interns, and competitions to test the operators' practical knowledge and skills was also conducted at the same time. A computer-based infection surveillance system and checklist was also developed to monitor the adherence to the CAUTI bundle care. The outcomes were analyzed on Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test. A p value less than 0.05 was considered as statistically significantly. Results: During the study period, there were 6557,971 patient-days with a total of 9845 episodes of HAUTIs in the entire hospital identified. CAUTIs accounts for about 56.7% of HAUTIs. Among them, 1922 episodes of CAUTIs were assessed in 620,019 patientdays over 353,609 catheter-days in adult ICU. Comparing the incidence density of CAUTI in adult ICU patients before and after the implementation of bundle interventions, CAUTI incidence density remarkably decreased from 7.9 to 4.8 per 1000 patient-days ( p = 0.02). Foley utilization was seen significantly decreased, from 1148.5 catheter-days to 956.1 catheter-days ( p = 0.028) monthly between the pre-CAUTI and post-CAUTI bundle care. Conclusion: CAUTI incidence density decreased in response to the implementation of an effective bundle care intervention. Multidisciplinary teamwork, education, a comprehensive checklist and from time to time audit feedback to improve healthcare workers' compliance are the keys to success.","The emergency pathogens could be counteracted by opting immediate and timely international collaborative efforts, cooperative efforts between human and animal health sectors. Other effective measures include One health approach, implementation of effective prevention and control strategies, rapid communication and networking, and exploring advances in science and technology for developing rapid and confirmatory diagnostics, enhancing disease surveillance and monitoring, implementation of strict biosecurity measures, and timely efforts toward designing appropriate and effective vaccines and therapeutics (Cheng et al. 2020; Cohen 2020; Cyranoski 2020; Lu 2020; Munjal et al. 2017; Singh et al. 2017).","Several specific actions can mitigate future threats to the health of the global population. First, we need to fully implement the International Health Regulations (IHR) in countries of all income levels. Reports from WHO and the Global Preparedness Monitoring Board have shown that responses to urgent crises have improved under the IHR (2005), but important deficiencies in coverage still exist. 3, 4 We must scale up laboratory capacity and other surveillance capabilities, augment the readiness of health systems to care for large numbers of seriously ill patients while safe guarding the health-care workforce, and improve communication and coordination strategies and implementation. 5 Procurement and supply chain management must also be enhanced to ensure adequate stocks of personal protective equipment and essential medications and to enable equitable access to new diagnostics, therapeutics, and vaccines during health emergencies. 6 Second, we need to accelerate progress towards achieving the priorities and targets of the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction, 7 which was adopted by UN member nations in 2015. The Sendai Framework applies an all-hazards approach to increasing international, regional, national, and local resilience to withstand a broad spectrum of disasters, including epidemics, pandemics, and epizootics. Preparedness for emerging infectious diseases requires strengthening health systems and developing response plans that account for the social, environmental, political, and institutional factors that can either support or disrupt emergency management efforts. 8 The Sendai Framework complements the IHR by integrating infrastructure, climate change, and economic considerations into disaster management plans and promoting inclusive policies that protect vulnerable populations during all phases of mitigation, preparedness, response, and recovery. 7 Third, plans for preventing, detecting, and controlling outbreaks of emerging infectious diseases need to be built on a One Health foundation that emphasises the interconnectedness of humans, animals, and ecosystems. 9 Transdisciplinary, multisectoral strategies are necessary when seeking to solve complex problems that threaten global public health and safety. 10 More specifically in relation to diseases such as COVID-19, One Health focuses on the danger existing at the human-wildlife interface. The ability to detect viruses in livestock and wildlife is a crucial component of early warning systems for human pandemics. 11 ","In this context, the proposed algorithm can be applied to enforce the gradual implementation of the pharmaceutical quality systems for MAHs most vulnerable to shortage risks. As shown in Fig. 3 , the obligations for MAHs are determined based on the shortage impact score. For products with a high shortage impact, the establishment of a shortage prevention plan seemed essential to ensure an appropriate and continued supply to fulfil patients' needs. For such products, manufacturer's resilience should be improved by more onerous provisions, such as the obligation for MAHs to qualify at least two suppliers of drug substance, the stockpiles' expansion and the implementation of the manufacturing technologies and risk assessment tools. In this context, the establishment of ad hoc agreements between European countries and MAH to conduct exceptional manufacturing activities in specific National sites can also be pursued. As an example, in Italy, National military manufacturing site has been involved in such activities to mitigate the impact of severe shortage, especially in the case of old and low-cost medicinal products (Di Giorgio et al., 2019) . On the other side, if the shortage impact of medicinal products on the public health is low, it is not reasonable to charge the MAHs with additional costs and, therefore, affect the economic sustainability for the implementation of quality assurance systems that may have a limited positive impact on the continuity of care.","Paper analytical devices have emerged as powerful tools for the rapid diagnosis of pathogens and determination of infection transmission.3 The paper-based device is a small analytical tool with different functional areas printed with a wax printer that integrates all processes (extraction, enrichment, purification, elution, amplification, and visual detection) required for nucleic acid testing into an inexpensive paper material. The whole testing process can be completed through simple folding of a paper-based device in different ways in different steps without a pump or power supply, which overcomes the limitation of PCR and avoids multiple processes. Paper analytical devices enable multiplexed, sensitive assays that rival PCR laboratory assays and provide high-quality, fast precision diagnostics for pathogens. For example, a recent work has demonstrated that the multiplexed determination of malaria from whole blood using a paper-based device in rural Uganda.4 The test could sensitively analyze multiplexed nucleic acid sequences of pathogens within 50 min, which gave a higher-quality and faster precision diagnosis for malaria than PCR.","A medicine shortage may be caused by a blockage of the production for different causes (e.g., the unavailability of raw materials, qualityfailures, GMP no-compliance, quality defects). In this context, considerable efforts have been made from Regulatory Authorities and professional associations to improve the quality in the pharmaceutical processes to minimize the risk for the patients and improve the effectiveness of the manufacturing processes (ISPE, 2014; PDA, 2014; EMA, 2019c; Various Associations, 2019b) . For example, a nine-fold increase in the EMA quality guidelines was observed between 2005 and 2015.","Alternatively, the emerging additive manufacturing technology can also be used to create such ultra-high aspect ratio microstructures as an efficient target capture platform. 27, 28 One of the main advantages of the IMPACT chip compared to traditional CRISPR assays is its ability to limit the background caused by dye-quencher probes, which is typically seen in CRISPR detection in the liquid state and needs to be designed around to lower the detection limit. 29, 30 Our device utilizing solid-phase CRISPR does not need to tether a quencher on the probe. The cleaved CRISPR products are sent to a separate reservoir for detection thus completely avoiding the fluorescence background caused by the tradition \"onepot\" detection. As shown in Fig. 5 , without the presence of ASFV target DNA, no fluorescence background signal was detected, demonstrating this powerful backgroundfree detection. This is an important improvement for molecular diagnostics, especially in low light settings in which the amount of background fluorescence present can significantly affect the detection limit . 31,32 Leveraging this advantage with increasing the aspect ratio either with PDMS or a silicon substrate will be able to further increase the accuracy and robustness of the device and improve the limit of detection.","For any outbreak, the faster the identification, the faster and more robust the response. BARDA is supporting work to improve diagnostics with the goal of recognizing illness before any symptoms develop. This may include wearable diagnostics or biosensors. The high mortality associated with human infections with novel coronaviruses MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV and avian influenza strains (influenza A(H5N1) and A(H7N9)) have raised questions about the possible role of a dysregulated immune response, a so called \"cytokine storm\", in the pathogenesis of severe respiratory disease. As some patients may not respond to typical anti-pathogen therapeutics (e.g. antivirals), BARDA is pursuing therapeutics which target the host in order to modify the immune/host response. More work needs to be done to identify these host targets and develop therapeutics towards the dysregulated immune response. The field also needs better diagnostics to guide treatment as over-suppression of the immune response can be just as dangerous as over-stimulation.","The current mIoT is not mature; there are numerous urgent problems to be resolved. However, it is expected to contribute considerably to the prevention and treatment of SARIs. This technology completely complies with the national control of diseases, the ''prevention and control of the forward, focus on sinking\" requirements. The issues related to ''borrowing\" the IoT technology are: (1) faster leaning and ensuring a high-quality implementation guideline; (2) better managing suspected patients; (3) effectively dealing with difficult patient consultations and improving the success rate of rescue; and (4) commanding and ensuring effective quality control. Moreover, the development and diffusion of the mIoT must address the following unresolved issues: (1) improve interoperability: the adoption of open standards must ensure that products from different manufacturers can communicate with each other; (2) ensure that there is no leakage; and (3) enhance the distribution network: sensors must communicate with services such as the Internet and wireless networks such that information can be relayed to remote health workers. 27 To solve these problems, there is an urgent requirement to develop a modern medical model -mIoT and to use this to improve the current telemedicine, coupled with mobile phones and other popular user terminals. This should be more conducive to achieving: ''easy to prevent, easy to diagnose, easy to treat diseases, and to easily communicate with experienced doctors.\" Community physicians can be advised in real-time by medical center experts through the cloud-plus terminal mIoT technology to achieve early diagnosis and optimal co-management of SARI patients.","Didier Pittet works with WHO in the context of the WHO initiative 'Private Organizations for Patient Safety -Hand Hygiene'. The aim of this WHO initiative is to harness industry strengths to align and improve implementation of WHO recommendations for hand hygiene in health care indifferent parts of the world, including in least developed countries. In this instance, companies/industry with a focus on hand hygiene and infection control related advancement have the specific aim of improving access to affordable hand hygiene products as well as through education and research. All listed authors declare no financial support, grants, financial interests or consultancy that could lead to conflicts of interest.","Research carried out in the field of natural bioactive compounds is increasing our understanding of healthy compounds that are naturally available in food, in particular in fruit. This will permit their increased use in foods (instead of artificial drugs), which will in turn increase their quality and added value. New methodologies for the extraction, purification, identification, and quantification of biomolecules using ecofriendly analytical techniques will need to be developed to improve the extraction yields (Chemat et al., 2012; Oroian and Escriche, 2015) . With the advent of high-throughput technologies and their applications in food science, the food and beverage industries have been taking steps to transform their traditional R&amp;D and product development processes. The food and beverage industries are now faced with a situation in which they should quickly adapt to new market demands and regulatory updates and be prepared to make expensive and risky decisions as to whether they should proceed with significant investments in the development of functional products (Younesi and Ayseli, 2015) .","As such, small deviations in the manufacturing process can have a major impact on the potency and/or purity of these products. Thus, FDA production facility requirements are rigorous, and these stringent regulatory hurdles add to the production costs of vaccines. Because new vaccines generally are more complex than older products, vaccine suppliers face increasingly stringent regulation of manufacturing facilities even after a vaccine is approved. Suppliers undergo frequent inspections of their production facilities by each country in which the vaccine product is licensed and by FDA. Individual product batches require separate approval for release, and slight modifications Reviews VACCINE POLICY to production processes or the packaging of products may trigger expensive and time-consuming product reviews. 33 FDA also requires frequent upgrades of vaccine production facilities to reflect state-of-the-art manufacturing processes. Recently, FDA quality control inspections led to Merck's recall of 1.2 million doses of childhood vaccines to protect against meningitis, pneumonia, and hepatitis B because of contaminated manufacturing equipment. 21, 34 The recall involved 11 lots of the Hib vaccine Pedvaxhib and two lots of a combination vaccine for both Hib and hepatitis B sold under the brand name Comvax. 34 ","To mitigate the risk of quality-failures, the EMA promoted the application of the quality-by-design and quality risk assessment principles to the manufacturing of medicinal products (EMA, 2015a (EMA, ,b, 2017 . The rationalization of pharmaceutical manufacturing and the control strategies can be derived from a better knowledge of the product and process. The traditional quality control process has been generally based on the testing of most critical parameters and manufacturing steps can impact on the quality of the intermediates or the final medicinal product. The control setpoints and operating ranges are, therefore, fixed based on the experiments carried out in the pharmaceutical development, and their change should be notified/authorized by a Regulatory Authority as post-approval change. The application of a modern pharmaceutical quality system promotes a systematic and continuous evaluation, understanding and refining of the formulation and the manufacturing process by the identification of the critical material attributes and process parameters and by the determination of the existing functional relationship between such factors and the responses (i.e. quality profile of the products). However, effective pharmaceutical quality systems require close collaboration between the MAH and their suppliers of raw materials to promote a more rational definition of the critical quality attributes of the drug product and to improve the production resilience. The implementation of the quality risk management plan, including shortage-specific prevention and management plan, was proposed to enhance the resilience of manufacturers to shortages, (ISPE, 2014; PDA, 2014; Panzitta et al., 2017) . For example, Panzitta and co-workers proposed a qualitative risk assessment based on a classification of different risk factors, causing a shortage in the manufacturing process (Panzitta et al., 2017) . Based on the resulting risk ranking, the manufacturer can define proper strategies to prevent shortage (e.g., increase of the raw material suppliers, expansion of the material stocks). However, some measures may not apply to all the situation since their high impact on economic sustainability. For example, the maintenance of large material stockpiles or the expansion of the suppliers' number, with the relative increase of inspections and audits, might be not sustainable for manufacturers of the low-price drug products. For these considerations, the adoption of the preventing tools proposed by the stakeholders' associations (PDA, 2014; ISPE, 2014) could be carried out gradually by the MAHs based on both the shortage impact of a product on the treated patients and the economic sustainability for the MAHs production.","Three of 38 laboratories that had implemented diagnostics did the implementation without a positive control. Indicated sources for positive controls were the European Virus Archive (EVAg) (synthetic 2019-nCoV E-gene, SARS-CoV RNA) (n = 23) [9], or own stocks, i.e. SARS-HCoV RNA and/or synthetic RNA (n = 15).","First, we evaluated whether group testing might improve upon existing individual-test methodologies. Testing three pooling strategies -four-well pooling (pooling four adjacent wells in a single dimension), 96-well (8x12) plate column and row pooling, and 384-well (16x24) plate column and row pooling -we found that all improve significantly upon naive testing, and that each performed better for a particular prevalence, as expected ( Figure 2 ). All three required fewer tests than the naive method at prevalence less than 10%. We have implemented these simulations in an R package that is available at https:// gitlab.com/technopolymath/pooled-diagnostics, and an interactive web visualization is available at https://technopolymath.shinyapps.io/pooled_covid_testing/.","This rapid assessment of the readiness of EU/EEA laboratories for molecular detection of 2019-nCoV demonstrated a fast implementation of molecular diagnostics by the European specialised laboratory networks with a good geographical coverage for testing. Among both laboratory networks in this study, protocols were shared rapidly and there was an early availability of positive controls and CoV specificity panels via EVAg. Furthermore, the survey indicated a great willingness of laboratories to provide international diagnostic support [10] and to share sequences to contribute to the monitoring of virus evolution and trace transmission chains.","The clinical sensitivities of the kits were all 100% (Table 2). Because the sensitivity test panel comprised various positive specimens with a wide range of Ct values, this high sensitivity validated their diagnostic performance for MERS-CoV infection, particularly from sputum specimens, although the number of positive specimens was small. One of the strengths in the present study was determining the effects of PCR inhibition on clinical sensitivity and the importance of internal controls (Table 3). The internal controls of the PowerChek kit were not affected by the inhibition. This could be because the PowerChek kit uses a less sensitive internal control that is intrinsic to human cells, although the PCR efficiency of this kit itself was also less affected. The positivity rates for kits when testing the high inhibition panel correlated with their analytical sensitivities, as only PowerChek detected 50% of known-positive specimens. Based on these findings, it is clear that clinical sensitivity can be significantly affected by the presence of PCR inhibitors, and analytical sensitivity may be affected by PCR inhibition-prone specimens such as sputum specimens. Therefore, optimization of the pretreatment and RNA extraction procedures is necessary to improve the sensitivity of MERS-CoV molecular diagnostics, especially for testing sputum specimens.","Advances in molecular diagnostics have been applied to simultaneous detection of pathogens and their antibiotic resistance from one sputum sample. The absence of rapid accurate diagnostic tests for pulmonary tuberculosis was further compounded by the widespread inability to screen for drug-resistant bacteria. The introduction of the GeneXpert MTB/RIF Assay, which detects Mycobacterium tuberculosis DNA and rifampicin resistance from sputum samples in 2 h, could revolutionise tuber culosis diagnostics. 10 A lateral fl ow immunoassay for detection of meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus in sputum is also now available. 11 Although several new rapid molecular diagnostic plat forms capable of simultaneously identifying both pathogens and the genetic determinants of anti microbial resistance are emerging, 12 they do not seem to be well suited to clinical presentations or downstream manage ment strategies for patients with RTIs. Furthermore, none can identify new emerging organisms for which genetic sequences are unavailable. However, rapid sequencing technologies linked to bio informatics have provided proof of diagnostic principle in a short time. 13 Until new diagnostics are developed to serve clinical need, the mainstay of clinical management for any RTI will remain dependent on imperfect diagnostics and linked to empirical broad-spectrum antibiotics. Thus, clinicians have to maintain clinical awareness of other possible causes of RTIs, whether they are opportunistic or not.","can detect variations directly from clinical samples. Whereas the detection throughput of NTS is not 274 high at present, the NTS method can be integrated into widely used automated or semi-automated 275 platforms to improve the detection throughput in the future 21-23 . In addition, because PCR is 276 included in NTS, processes involving opening the lid of the PCR tubes may cause mutual 277 contamination between samples 24, 25 . However, this situation also is inevitable in current nucleic 278 acid detection methods (e.g., qPCR) or other nucleic acid detection schemes (e.g., SHERLOCK 11, 12 279 or toehold switch biosensor 9, 10 ) that also involve PCR. The introduction of integration systems or 280 sealed devices such as microfluidics may avoid this situation 26, 27 . At present, our processes of 281 sequencing data analysis and interpretation of results are not mature; nevertheless, as the number of 282 test samples increases, additional test results will be collected and the process continuously 283 optimized to obtain more accurate results. 284","Background: The hospital has a Western restaurant and Chi Mei coffee food sales, all use self-made edible ice. October 2014 to January 2016 Chi Mei coffee homemade edible ice number of bacteria were more than the standard test, in addition to the temporary suspension of the use of the number of additional raw bacteria to meet the ice, but also continue to explore the reasons, but the improvement measures are invalid. Methods: March 2016 by the nutrition department, infection control center, safety and health room, public affairs room, jade meal company to improve the project team, through the \"characteristics of the map\" and \"true verification\" and other quality management practices and tools, establish five issues and set the target pass rate of 100%, and to develop improvement measures (1) the development of equipment, equipment, cleaning and disinfection norms, check the mechanism and training methods, (2) formulate the standard of inspection and operation standards, check the mechanism and training methods, (3) formulate inspection standard operating rules, check the mechanism and training methods, 4. update of water quality filtration equipment, through the above four measures to improve. Results: Since March 2016 intervention to improve, until September 2016 pass rate of 0%. But completed the development of three standard operating manual, and continued in accordance with the standard implementation of the implementation process, October 2016 to November 2016 to achieve self-made consumption of ice 100% pass rate target. But, From December 2016 to January 2017, the number of bacteria and more than the standard(100 cfu/ mL), may be due to lack of ice machine pipeline sterilization equipment and ice machine surrounding environment pollution. So the development of countermeasures: (1) Regular cleaning of the ice machine's surroundings (once a month) and (2) ice machine lines use ozone (once a month) and disinfectant (once a quarter) sterilization, Finally, in February 2017 to April 2017 monitoring results pass rate of 100%.","Three simplified approaches without NA purification were performed before RT-qPCR for SARS-CoV-2: 1) Direct: the saline/transport solution from the throat-swap, 2) PBS diluted: the saline/transport solution was further diluted 1:1 with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and 3) Heat-processed: We tested four different heat-processes: an aliquote of the saline/transport solution was heat-processed for a) 5 min. at 95\u02daC; b) 10 min. at 95\u02daC; c) 5 min. at 98\u02daC; and d) 10 min. at 98\u02daC, respectively. All heat-processed clinical samples were cooled for 2 min. at 4\u02daC before being used in the RT-qPCR reaction. Two SARS-CoV-2 RT-qPCR assays were used; I) The published and widely used RT-qPCR assay for the E-gene [4, 5] combined with the SensiFAST TM Probe No-ROX One-Step Real-time PCR kit (Bioline\u00ae), and II) the commercial RealStar\u00ae SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR kit 1.0 (Altona diagnostics, Hamburg, Germany). The RT-qPCR results (number of positives and Ct values) from the different approaches were compared to the RT-qPCR results from MagNA Pure purified samples. During this experiment the gravity of the limited supply for the MagNA Pure 96 system highlighted itself as our routine diagnostic laboratory became critically low on processing cartridges to the MagNA Pure 96 system, and we therefore had to .

Many important questions remain unanswered, including its origin, extent, and duration of transmission in humans, ability to infect other animal hosts, and the spectrum and pathogenesis of human infections. Characterising viral isolates from successive generations of human infections will be key to updating diagnostics and assessing viral evolution. Beyond supportive care, 17 no specific coronavirus antivirals or vaccines of proven efficacy in humans exist, although clinical trials of both are ongoing for MERS-CoV and one controlled trial of ritonavir-boosted lopinavir monotherapy has been launched for 2019-nCoV (ChiCTR2000029308). Future animal model and clinical studies should focus on assessing the effectiveness and safety of promising antiviral drugs, monoclonal and polyclonal neutralising anti body products, and therapeutics directed against immunopathologic host responses.","A questionnaire was designed to assess the capacity, quality and operational specifics related to 2019-nCoV diagnostics, as well as barriers against their implementation in laboratories that are part of the European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC)-associated European expert laboratory network for emerging viral diseases (EVD-LabNet) and/or the European Reference Laboratory Network for Human Influenza (ERLI-Net). The survey was sent on 22 January 2020 to the Operational Contact Points representing 81 laboratories in, among others, 30 EU/EEA countries. The survey subsequently closed on 29 January 2020 (Figure 1). Where indicated, data were validated by individual email exchange with the laboratories to include one entry per laboratory. Entries from laboratories outside the EU/EEA and veterinary laboratories were omitted from analysis for this report. In total, the data provided by 47 laboratories in 30 EU/EEA countries were taken into account in this study. ","(1) Coordination. Coordination in this context refers to the organization of the medical team and resources needed to combat the epidemic, with government as the lead actor. Following formal confirmation of the gravity of COVID-19 and its deleterious health impacts on January 20th, 2020, the Chinese government implemented a coordinated topdown organization system to allocate and manage critical resources (http://cpc.people.com.cn/n1/2020/0223/c64094-31600380.html). For example, to improve the recovery rate and reduce mortality in Hubei Province, the central government immediately coordinated a number of different agencies, and quickly operationalized several specialized treatment hospitals within a very short period, including the construction of completely new Huoshenshan and Leishenshan hospitals. Meanwhile, until February 23rd 2020, more than 330 medical teams, comprising 41,600 medical staff from 29 provinces, including military health personnel, were temporarily assigned to Hubei Province to contribute to the treatment of patients (http://news. cctv.com/2020/03/01/ARTIyFaDgjnVVFUmkVuatpaz200301. shtml). The central government also established a ''green channel\" transportation for medical supplies and other material resources after the shutdown of the regular transport system in Wuhan. (2) Classification. Classification is employed to divide the outbreak areas and their associated risk factors into different levels, which consider the number of confirmed cases and the factors closely related to disease transmission, including population characteristics and the living environment. After the confirmation of Human-to-human transmission [10] , in response to the proliferation of the epidemic, differential prevention and control measures were adopted informed by a risk level detailed at the county scale. The central government, from January 23rd 2020, implemented a ''closed management\" policy in Wuhan [11] and six other cities in Hubei Province through closure of train stations, airports and highways that strictly controlled population mobility. Localities in cities that would typically have been crowded were closed to prevent asymptomatic patients from transmitting the virus. On February 17th 2020, to ensure an orderly return to work after the Spring Festival holiday during the containing COVID-19 process, the Chinese government issued a document stating that all provinces (except Hubei and Beijing) should declare the epidemic risk level for their counties based on the number of confirmed cases, evaluated as ''low\", ''medium\" and ''high\" risk levels Through the coordination, classification, and collaboration (3C) systematic approach, China has been able to curb the spread of the COVID-19 nationally. It is notable that these three processes are not independent but interrelated. For example, classification requires collaboration between different government agencies at different administrative levels, which in turn helps to strengthen management coordination. In addition, effective implementation of policies is inseparable from collaboration between different departments. Moreover, spontaneous collaboration behaviors among the general public (bottom-up) requires appropriate guidance from the government (top-down). In order to deal with the huge challenges of human-environmental systems, the systematic approach needs to fully consider the interaction between different agencies and actors.","Improvement of ventilator-associated pneumonia bundle care through teamwork in an intensive care unit Yu-Hsia Wang*, Li-Hsueh Chen, Nai-Zhen Hou. Department of Nursing, Tainan Municipal Hospital Background: With a mortality rate approaching 35-90%, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) accounts for 13-18% of health care-associated infections (HCAIs). Patients receiving mechanically assisted ventilation have more risks for acquiring pneumonia compared with patients not receiving ventilatory support and the risk for acquiring pneumonia increased 1% per day. Prevention is better than cure. Therefore, caring for patients on mechanical ventilators is especially important. It's expected that implementation care bundles improved HCAIs rates and ensure high care quality. Methods: Care bundles including care of ventilator circuit, daily assessment of sedation, oral hygiene, head of the bed elevation to 30-45\u00b0, intermittent subglottic secretion drainage, and drain from ventilator circuit was implemented from January, 2015. The incidence of VAP was higher than other hospitals during initial implementation stage and the causes were lack of knowledge of care bundle strategies, low implementation rate, lack of unified mouthwash ingredients, lack of standards and auditing practice, low correction rate (50%) in care practice. For strengthening implementation of infection control measures, the changes in institutions, management, and human behavior were needed, hence the measures included education programs, evidence-based research, innovative approach, VAP guideline and audits through multidisciplinary team work. Results: Care quality improved. In addition, staff's knowledge about VAP increased from 70% to 100% and accuracy and implementation of care achieving 100% via audit. The analysis of control chart for monitoring rate of VAP indicated that the process was under control with dramatic improvement by comparison with other hospitals. The other benefits included higher rate of ventilator weaning and lowered infection rate. Conclusion: The use of teamwork builds safety culture and contributes to further promote compliance with care bundles. The changes in institute, management and staff's behavior not only improve quality of health care but also assure patient safety, and benefits of hospitals, health workers and government.","Finally, these activities need to be supported with investment. In order to successfully shift to a One Health approach investments are required in two key areas: research and implementation. Further research is required into novel surveillance approaches for identifying and addressing EID events [19]. Findings, however, also need to be translated to action, policy and practice. It is acknowledged, the successful implementation of a One Health system will require marked changes in the status quo, and significant investment. However, this shift has the potential to significantly improve EID surveillance and response in China and beyond."," A 45-year-old, previously healthy, Qatari male was admitted to a local hospital in Qatar with high-grade fever, shortness of breath, tachypnoea and tachycardia on 13 October 2012. Additional clinical symptoms included cough, malaise and pronounced tiredness. These symptoms had suddenly appeared 1 week prior to admission. The patient denied past history of chronic diseases. However, he reported a long-term smoking habit of two to three packs of cigarettes a day for the past 30 years. Pulmonary auscultation revealed diffuse predominantly right-sided crackles. This finding was completely in agreement with chest radiography (CXR) findings of diffuse bilateral pulmonary infiltration, most pronounced on the right lower lobe. A severe community-acquired pneumonia was suspected and treatment with ceftriaxone and oseltamivir commenced. Despite the antibiotic treatment patient\u2019s respiratory status deteriorated so that 24 h later he required intubation for mechanical ventilation. The antibiotic therapy was changed to broad-spectrum antibiotics including piperacillin/tazobactam and azithromycin. The course of oseltamivir was sustained. None of the microbiological and virological diagnostics initiated during that time yielded clues to any pathogen. Regardless of remedial measures high-grade fever persisted and the patient\u2019s condition failed to improve. In the following days his respiratory status deteriorated further and an acute kidney injury additionally complicated his clinical course.","Economists have reported that this increased life expectancy has made a considerable contribution to economic growth. 9, 10 In fact, it has been argued that more than one-half of the growth in real income in the first half of the 20th century is attributable to the declining mortality associated with the discovery of vaccines. 11, 12 Mass immunization programs have resulted in 100% eradication of smallpox from the world, elimination of diphtheria and polio, and 99% eradication of measles, mumps, and rubella in the United States. 1 Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) vaccines have been successful in reducing childhood mortality. 13 In addition, vaccination of healthy adults has resulted in decreased work absenteeism and decreased use of health care resources, including less use of antibiotics. 14, 15 Nevertheless, this success of vaccines is threatened because of several factors. Problems related to vaccine research and development (R&amp;D), manufacturing complexities, supply and distribution, safety issues, and financing have become areas of major concern. Symptoms of this crisis include a decline in the number of vaccine producers from 26 in 1967 to 5 in 2004 16 and a decline in the number of licensed vaccine products from 380 in 1967 to 51 in 2005. (Some of these are combination products.) 16, 17 Eight of these vaccine products are currently produced by five major companies: Sanofi Pasteur, Chiron (a business unit of Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics), GlaxoSmithKline, Merck Vaccines &amp; Infectious Diseases, and Wyeth Vaccines. 18 Should any one of these suppliers cease production, it could take years for a replacement vaccine to be licensed and become available publicly.","Health care-associated infection affects hundreds of millions of people worldwide in developed, transitional, and developing countries and is a major, global issue for patient safety. The World Health Organization (WHO) supported the creation of an international alliance to improve patient safety as a global initiative and the World Alliance for Patient Safety was It embraces existing WHO strategies to reduce health care-associated infection and also creates the momentum for new actions to improve hand hygiene during patient care. The major objectives of ''Clean Care is Safer Care'' are: to raise awareness of the impact of health careassociated infection on patient safety and promote preventive strategies within countries; to build commitment from countries to prioritise reducing health care-associated infection; and to test the implementation of the new WHO Guidelines on Hand Hygiene in Health Care in specific districts worldwide as part of an integrated package of actions derived from existing WHO strategies in the fields of blood safety, injection and immunisation safety, clinical procedure safety, and water, basic sanitation and waste management.","For each of the parasites, improvements in diagnostics and treatment are likely to improve the clinical situation at the individual patient level, and this is particularly so for those parasites for which lack of identification may result in devastating long-term or chronic diseases, such as AE due to infection with E. multilocularis, Chagas disease for T. cruzi, various prolonged gastrointestinal problems with anisakiasis, or CCA for Opisthorchis spp. Indeed, even for cryptosporidiosis, the potential for long-term sequelae has been reported (Osman et al., 2017; Rehn et al., 2015; Stiff, Davies, Mason, Hutchings, &amp; Chalmers, 2017) ; although for most people infected it is more likely to manifest as an acute, but short-lived, self-limiting episode of diarrhea. However, for most of the parasites described here, such improvements are unlikely to have a significant direct impact on transmission at the community or population level, particularly for E. multilocularis and Anisakis spp., for which humans are a dead-end host, and therefore further transmission will not occur.","The threat of pandemic influenza is persistent, and PCPs, which will be at the front line of any responses to pandemic influenza, need to properly prepare for pandemic influenza. This research provides information about pandemic preparedness and response of PCPs in Okinawa Prefecture, Japan. We assessed whether the institutional setting is associated with preparedness. PCPs, especially clinic-based PCPs, were inadequately prepared with regard to PPE. Results from this study suggest that pandemic preparedness plan awareness is likely to promote the implementation of BCPs by PCPs. Increased efforts to improve PCP familiarity with the plan, and improve PPE preparedness, are needed.","In ARDS, corticosteroids are believed to antagonize certain pathophysiological processes, including hyperinflammation, excessive cell proliferation, and aberrant collagen deposition. [1] However, evidence-based clinical research gives us other insights. As for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), a retrospective study revealed that patients receiving corticosteroids treatment had poorer outcomes, such as higher risk of intensive care unit admission and higher mortality, even though they were younger and had fewer underlying diseases. [2] Furthermore, it was found that corticosteroids did not improve mortality and could delay viral nucleic acid clearance in Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), which is also caused by a coronavirus. [3] A large meta-analysis which included 16 studies on influenza A virus subtype H1N1 infection showed that corticosteroids increased mortality. [4] In contrast, other studies reported that short-term treatment with corticosteroids may decrease the risk of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and shorten the length of the disease in patients with severe community-acquired pneumonia. [5] In addition, the use of corticosteroids in ARDS caused by Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia has obtained widespread acceptance, as it can improve oxygenation and patients' outcomes. [6] At present, the World Health Organization does not recommend routinely applying systemic corticosteroids for the treatment of viral pneumonia or ARDS, except in clinical trials. [7] However, the 5th edition of \"Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia Diagnosis and Treatment Protocol\" recommended short-term (3-5 days) treatment with corticosteroids for severe and critical cases should be based on the comprehensive assessment of patients' dyspnea level and the progression observed on chest imaging, with the dose not exceeding a methylprednisolone equivalent dose of 1-2 mg/kg per day. [8] Currently, there is insufficient evidence of the value of corticosteroids in the treatment of novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP), and further high-quality randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are warranted.","This important amount of work conducted by researchers is encouraging for the therapeutic research for this new disease. However, care should be taken when designing a clinical trial in this complicated context as robust results are needed in order to be able to find the appropriate treatment. Finding the best agents for rapid implementation in clinical trials for a new outbreak is challenging. Our study underlines the need to register as much details as possible on clinical trials registries during outbreaks in order to inform the development of future trials. The scientific background supporting the use of a treatment should be clear and detailed as much as possible. The dose and duration of drugs evaluated, as well as details on the study design, the population of interest and the primary outcome, are crucial elements that have to be shared in the context of the epidemic response. Reporting as much details as possible is key to have consistent clinical trials and to enhance the reproducibility of the results, especially as studies are more often associated with a low number of planned inclusions and composite or weak outcomes that can limit the efficacy assessment of the treatments. That is why transparency and consistency are crucial when reporting clinical trials in order to improve statistical power by conducting, for example, meta-analyses.","When combined with prior discoveries,7 these observations from industry helped propel the case for chlorine-based disinfection and led to widespread implementation of water chlorination processes with significant reductions in mortality rates.8,9 Additional rapid research and technological discoveries led to new preparation methods for NaOCl,10 and the commercial production of chlorine containing solutions as disinfectants.11 Subsequent improvements included advanced electrolytic cells for chlorine production,12 and production of disinfectant and bactericide N-chloramines with fewer drawbacks than Cl2.13,14 Throughout, process safety has continually increased with time.15,16","These data provide additional evidence for a possibly significant role of HCoV in NRVI occurring in hospitalised preterm neonates. Routine detection of HCoV in light of clinical worsening should be proposed to improve clinical management of neonates in the PNICU, thereby limiting unnecessary antibiotic use. Staff members may be involved in transmission of these viral infections. Since the infection may be asymptomatic in staff members, implementation of strict preventive measures against the spread of infection is more difficult, but nevertheless very important to protect the health of these infants.","Participation in the study was strictly voluntary. Study staff reviewed the information sheet with potential participants and explained the details of the study. This included the voluntary nature of participation, inclusion and exclusion criteria, study implementation processes (e.g. that the interview would be audio-recorded), potential risks and benefits of participation, results sharing and that they could withdraw their participation at any time. It was also explained that an item as a token would be given as appreciation for their participation, which was identified by the study team and appropriate for the context of the study sites.","J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Background New coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19) is a health emergency due to its high infectiousness [1] and high case fatality in critically ill patients. The pathological and physiological processes and diagnostic methods of COVID-19 are still in the exploratory stage. Clinical monitoring and appropriate treatment strategies were essential to improve case fatality. CT scan played an important role in assessing the disease [2] . Other sensitive indicators able to reflect lung lesion changes and disease severity had to be explored. C-reactive protein (CRP) levels can be used in the early diagnosis of pneumonia [3] , and patients presenting with severe pneumonia had high CRP levels. We assessed the correlation between CRP levels, lung lesions, and disease severity to provide reference for clinical treatment.","A range of analyses of various disease emergences through a social\u2013ecological lens, from E. coli (Ali, 2004), to leptospirosis (Barcellos and Sabroza, 2001), schistosomiasis (Clennon et al., 2004) and cholera (Foll\u00e9r, 2001; Collins, 2004), already exists. Key themes emerging from such analyses are that nonlinear processes frequently operate across variable scales (Turner et al., 2003; Foley et al., 2005; Wilcox and Colwell, 2005), that improved surveillance and intervention are necessary across the socio-behavioral and ecological spectra, and that new hypotheses about disease emergences can be generated when researchers are not limited by disciplinary constraints in research design and implementation.","In the USA, attention to and action against emerging infections and infectious diseases greatly increased after a 1992 landmark report by the Institute of Medicine (Emerging infections: microbial threats to health in the United States). 2, 3 The report clearly outlined the increased risk of emerging infections in a highly connected world, highlighted the nation's crumbling public health infrastructure, and called for substantial improvements in the USA's capacity to address these mounting challenges. In response to this report, both the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) developed research and prevention strategies to reduce emerging infectious diseases 4, 5 and improve preparedness for outbreaks. At CDC, this plan led to the development and implementation of many new programmes designed to improve epidemiology and laboratory capacity at the national, state, and local levels. In the 1990s and early 2000s, substantial complementary investments were made to build similar, multilevel capacity against bioterrorism threats. During the past two decades, these networks, systems, and programmes have helped to forge strong links between clinical, research, and public health communities and strengthened US capacity to detect and respond to national and international outbreaks.","The emerging picture from this study implicates a central role for the immune response in the pathobiology of a SARS infection. While detailed in vivo studies of the host response are now required, the in vitro model described here will allow responses to specific modulators (such as therapeutics) to be investigated. In future developments of the model, it will be interesting to compare the host response to different SARS-CoV isolates with inactivated preparations of the virus. In other diseases, in vitro models have revealed a number of key processes relevant to the clinical diseases [9,12,13] and it is likely that the responses identified here will prove to be equally important. Although some clinical parameters have now been used as prognostic markers [40-42], further study of the regulatory mechanisms for chemokine-cytokine production will likely improve their accuracy and perhaps allow development of new treatment protocols.","The SARS-CoV-2 assay from Corman et al. [7] could be used rapidly with the published SuperScript III system, but further optimisation especially of the E gene assay may enhance the sensitivity. The RealStar kit outperformed the two other tested one-step PCR systems in sensitivity and by absence of unspecific signals with the used primer set and the RealStar workflow enhanced laboratory efficiency combining two coronavirus assays (lineage B CoV and specific SARS-CoV-2) with an IC in a triplex PCR. Overall, fast assay development and publication of protocols by expert laboratories allowed public health laboratories to establish diagnostics quickly and act fast. Assay optimisation will further speed up and improve the management of this ongoing outbreak.","The ability of virulent salmonellae to cause diarrhea appears to be associated most closely with the ability to invade enterocytes and to trigger an inflammatory reaction in the intestinal tissue. 20, 36 Gene products injected into enterocyte cytosol by the type III secretory system of invading salmonellae stimulate chloride and fluid secretion. 27 Salmonella invasion of enterocytes is also a potent activator of inflammatory chemokine and cytokine production, resulting in the recruitment of leukocytes, particularly neutrophils, and activation of resident macrophages and mast cells. Products of these activated leukocytes, including prostaglandins, leukotrienes, reactive oxygen metabolites, and histamine, are potent stimulators of chloride secretion in the colon of many species. 16, [37] [38] [39] The enteric nervous system integrates the diverse processes of pathogen recognition, triggering of the inflammatory response, and induction of enterocyte fluid secretion. 39 Many of the inflammatory mediators studied stimulate colonic secretion by prostaglandin-dependent mechanisms, resulting in increased intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate or calcium concentrations or both in mucosal cells. 37 In addition, these mediators and the enteric nervous system may stimulate secretion by prostaglandin-independent mechanisms, inhibit sodium and water absorption, cause motility disturbances, and potentiate tissue injury, all of which enhance the pathogenicity and dissemination of Salmonella and contribute to the pathogenesis of diarrhea. 37, 39 Neutrophils recruited to the mucosa by signals generated by the infected enterocytes physically contribute to mucosal injury by producing a variety of products that are lethal to pathogens but are also toxic to host cells. 40, 41 Moreover, neutrophils attracted to infected epithelial cells accumulate beneath the monolayer, lifting it off the basement membrane in sheets. Neutrophils also migrate across the epithelial monolayer in potentially massive numbers. Transepithelial migration of neutrophils increases the permeability to macromolecules, bacterial products, and even bacteria. 41 Potentially massive losses of electrolytes, water, and protein can occur depending on bacterial and host factors. Perhaps most devastatingly, mucosal injury and altered permeability allow systemic absorption of bacterial products and dissemination of bacteria, resulting in systemic inflammatory responses such as occur with endotoxemia and septicemia.","In an effort to develop low-molecular weight peptidic anti-SARS agents, we designed, synthesized, and evaluated a series of dipeptide-type inhibitors in which the P3 valine unit in our potent tripeptidomimetic lead compound 8 was replaced with a number of distinct functionalities. In a preliminary study, the compound 25c, bearing a benzyloxycarbonyl (Cbz) P3 moiety, was identified as a lead compound. The P3 moiety in 25c was systematically modified with a view to improve the biological activity. This study led to the identification of a compound bearing an N-arylglycyl as a P3 moiety as having higher inhibitory activity due to the presence of a hydrogen bond with the backbone amino acid residue Glu166 of 3CL pro . Leucine and benzothiazole units were identified as appropriate P2 and P1 0 moieties, respectively, in 25c. Accordingly, compounds 26m and 26n were recognized as potent inhibitors in the present study. These potent dipeptidic inhibitors provide attractive leads, which are undergoing further structural modifications in an effort to improve the pharmaceutical profiles. These processes are underway and will be reported in the near future."],"title":["Poster Sessions","Abstracts accepted for publication only","What is ahead for health policy and technology in the
