The FDA Medical Countermeasures Initiative previously funded a study of HP vapor decontamination of respirators using a Clarus C system (Bioquell, Horsham, PA) which normally is used to fumigate hospital rooms. The process preserved respirator function, but it is unknown if HP vapor would be virucidal since respirators have porous fabric that may harbor virus. We evaluated the virucidal activity of HP vapor using a BQ-50 system (Bioquell, Horsham, PA) after inoculating 3M 1870 N95 respirators (3M, St. Paul, MN) with 3 aerosolized bacteriophage that are a reasonable proxy for SARS-CoV-2. Inoculation resulted in contamination of the respirator with 9.87e4 plaque forming units (PFU) of phage phi-6, 4.17e7 PFU of phage T7 and 1.35e7 PFU of phage T1. Respirators were reprocessed with BQ-50 with a long aeration phase to reduce ...","Personal protective equipment (PPE), including surgical masks and N95 respirators, is crucially important to the safety of both patients and medical personnel, particularly in the event of infectious pandemics. As the incidence of Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) is increasing exponentially in the United States and worldwide, healthcare provider demand for these necessities is currently outpacing supply. As such, strategies to safely expand the lifespan of the supply of medical equipment are critically important. In the recent days, weeks, and months, in the midst of the current pandemic, there has been a concerted effort to identify viable ways to conserve Personal Protective Equipment, including sterilization after use. Some hospitals have already begun using UV-C light to sterilize N95 respirators, but many lack the space or equipment to implement existing protocols. In this study, we outline a procedure by which N95 respirators may be sterilized using ultraviolet (UV) radiation in bi...","BACKGROUND: Viral epidemics or pandemics of acute respiratory infections like influenza or severe acute respiratory syndrome pose a global threat. Antiviral drugs and vaccinations may be insufficient to prevent their spread. OBJECTIVES: To review the effectiveness of physical interventions to interrupt or reduce the spread of respiratory viruses. SEARCH METHODS: We searched The Cochrane Library, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2010, Issue 3), which includes the Acute Respiratory Infections Group's Specialised Register, MEDLINE (1966 to October 2010), OLDMEDLINE (1950 to 1965), EMBASE (1990 to October 2010), CINAHL (1982 to October 2010), LILACS (2008 to October 2010), Indian MEDLARS (2008 to October 2010) and IMSEAR (2008 to October 2010). SELECTION CRITERIA: In this update, two review authors independently applied the inclusion criteria to all identified and retrieved articles and extracted data. We scanned 3775 titles, excluded 3560 and retrieved full pape...","Summary Use of a fit-tested N95 or FFP2 mask is recommended to protect against transmission of airborne pathogens. This poses considerable logistic problems when preparing for, or dealing with, an epidemic. Some of these problems might be overcome by use of a compact reusable high-efficiency particulate air filtering mask that can be cut to size. We carried out a randomised controlled cross-over study to compare the efficacy of such a mask (Totobobo, Dream Lab One Pte Ltd, Singapore) with fit-tested N95 masks (1860 or 1860s or 1862; 3M, St Paul, MN, USA) in 22 healthy volunteers. The median (interquartile range) reduction in airborne particle counts was significantly higher [193-fold (145\u2013200)] for N95 masks than for Totobobo masks [135-fold (83\u2013184)] (P &lt;0.05). There was no statistically significant difference between the proportion of subjects achieving a reduction of \u2265100-fold between N95 (19/22) and Totobobo (16/22) masks. We conclude that use of the Totobobo mask without fit testi...","The current COVID-19 pandemic has led to a dramatic shortage of masks and other personal protective equipment (PPE) in hospitals around the globe. One component of PPE that is in particular demand are disposable N95 face masks. To alleviate this, many methods of N95 mask sterilization have been studied and proposed with the hope of being able to safely reuse masks. Two major considerations must be made when re-sterilizing masks: (1) the sterilization method effectively kills pathogens, penetrating into the fibers of the mask, and (2) the method does not degrade the operational integrity of the N95 filters. We studied Cobalt-60 gamma irradiation as a method of effective sterilization without inducing mask degradation. Significant literature exists supporting the use of gamma radiation as a sterilization method, with viral inactivation of SARS-CoV reported at doses of at most 10 kGy, with other studies supporting 5 kGy for many types of viruses. However, concerns have been raised about t...","2019-nCoV had caused pneumonia outbreak in Wuhan. Existing evidence have confirmed the human-to-human transmission of 2019-nCoV. We retrospectively collected infection data from 2 January to 22 January at six departments from Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University. In our study, we found N95 respirators, disinfection and hand washing can help to reduce the risk of 2019-nCoV infection in medical staffs. Our results call for re-emphasizing strict occupational protection code in battling this novel contagious disease. The risk of 2019-nCoV infection was higher in the open area than in the quarantined area. N95 may be more effective for 2019-nCoV infections.","BACKGROUND: There is an ongoing debate regarding the type of respiratory protection that should be recommended for use for healthcare workers. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was conducted in three countries: China, Pakistan and Vietnam. RESULTS: In China and Pakistan, the infection control guidelines were developed to be in line with the recommendations from the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, while in the Vietnamese guidelines the recommendations correspond with the WHO suggestions only. The guidelines from all three countries document the need for training and fit testing; however there is no system to monitor the training and fit testing programs. Across the three countries, there was some inconsistency with regard to the types of products (i.e. masks vs. respirators) recommended for influenza, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and tuberculosis. CONCLUSIONS: Available evidence should be examined and a compre...","The use of viral agents for biological warfare has a long history, which predates their recognition and isolation by culture. Advances in viral culture and virus stabilization made during the second half of the twentieth century raised the level of concern by facilitating the large-scale production of viral agents for aerosol dissemination. Furthermore, the nucleic acid of many viruses, including some that are currently not threats, can be manipulated in the laboratory. Thus, the potential for genetic engineering and misuse of biotechnology is a serious threat. An effective defense against viral agents requires a comprehensive approach including restricting access to viral stocks, detecting deliberately induced disease outbreaks, rapid laboratory identification of viral agents in clinical specimens, preventing person-to-person transmission, using reliable decontamination procedures, and developing effective vaccines and antiviral drugs.","Abstract In December 2019, the outbreak of the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in China spread worldwide, becoming an emergency of major international concern. SARS-CoV-2 infection causes clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus. Human-to-human transmission has been described with incubation times between 2-14 days, facilitating its spread via droplets, contaminated hands or surfaces. Early diagnosis, quarantine, and supportive treatments are essential to cure patients. We therefore reviewed the literature on all available information about the epidemiology, diagnosis, isolation and treatments of COVID-19. Treatments, including antiviral agents, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, corticosteroids, antibodies, convalescent plasma transfusion and vaccines, will be discussed in this article. Additionally, registered trials about treatment were listed to develop approaches for the current urgent demand for therapy.","Abstract A series of trifluoromethyl, benzothiazolyl or thiazolyl ketone-containing peptidic compounds as SARS-CoV 3CL protease inhibitors were developed and their potency was evaluated by in vitro protease inhibitory assays. Three candidates had encouraging results for the development of new anti-SARS compounds.","Abstract A series of 2-(benzylthio)-6-oxo-4-phenyl-1,6-dihydropyrimidine as SARS-CoV 3CL protease inhibitors were developed and their potency was evaluated by in vitro protease inhibitory assays. Two candidates had encouraging results for the development of new anti-SARS compounds.","BACKGROUND: Cases of emerging infectious diseases, including H5N1 influenza, H7N9 influenza, and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, have been reported in recent years, and the threat of pandemic outbreaks persists. In Japan, primary care is the frontline against emerging infectious diseases in communities. Although the importance of pandemic preparedness in primary care has been highlighted previously, few studies have thus far investigated the preparedness among primary care practices (PCPs) or differences in the preparedness of different institutional settings. We examined PCP preparedness and response to the 2009 influenza pandemic in Japan, and explored the role of a pandemic preparedness plan during the pandemic. METHODS: We used a survey questionnaire to assess how well individual PCPs in Okinawa, Japan, were prepared for the 2009 influenza pandemic. The questionnaire was mailed to all eligible PCPs (N = 465) in Okinawa, regardless of their institutional setting. In addition, we a...","Abstract Recently, a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), officially known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), emerged in China. Despite drastic containment measures, the spread of this virus is ongoing. SARS-CoV-2 is the aetiological agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) characterised by pulmonary infection in humans. The efforts of international health authorities have since focused on rapid diagnosis and isolation of patients as well as the search for therapies able to counter the most severe effects of the disease. In the absence of a known efficient therapy and because of the situation of a public-health emergency, it made sense to investigate the possible effect of chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine against SARS-CoV-2 since this molecule was previously described as a potent inhibitor of most coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-1. Preliminary trials of chloroquine repurposing in the treatment of COVID-19 in China have been encouraging, leading to several ne...","First, although COVID-19 is spread by the airborne route, air disinfection of cities and communities is not known to be effective for disease control and needs to be stopped. The widespread practice of spraying disinfectant and alcohol in the sky, on roads, vehicles, and personnel has no value; moreover, large quantities of alcohol and disinfectant are potentially harmful to humans and should be avoided.3 , 4 Second, in the use of personal protective equipment, we should try to distinguish different risk factors, adopt different epidemic prevention measures, and reduce the waste of personal protective equipment, as these resources are already in short supply. Although surgical masks are in widespread use by the general population, there is no evidence that these masks prevent the acquisition of COVID-19, although they might slightly reduce the spread from an infected patient. High-filtration masks such as N95 masks and protective clothing (goggles and gowns) should be used in hospitals...","AbstractThe fast and untraceable virus mutations take lives of thousands of people before the immune system can produce the inhibitory antibody. Recent outbreak of novel coronavirus infected and killed thousands of people in the world. Rapid methods in finding peptides or antibody sequences that can inhibit the viral epitopes of COVID-19 will save the life of thousands. In this paper, we devised a machine learning (ML) model to predict the possible inhibitory synthetic antibodies for Corona virus. We collected 1933 virus-antibody sequences and their clinical patient neutralization response and trained an ML model to predict the antibody response. Using graph featurization with variety of ML methods, we screened thousands of hypothetical antibody sequences and found 8 stable antibodies that potentially inhibit COVID-19. We combined bioinformatics, structural biology, and Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations to verify the stability of the candidate antibodies that can inhibit the Corona v...","Doubling Time (DT) is typically calculated for growth curves that show exponential growth, such as the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases day by day. DT represents the time it takes before the number of COVID-19 cases, in a certain country or area, doubles. Throughout the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak, DT values are continually changing. These changes are influenced by the measures that are recommended by the health authorities and implemented by governments. After the governmental shutdowns of Nordic Countries that were announced around the 12th of March 2020, I followed the development of the DT in the region. Governments put in place measure never before experienced during peace time; home working, closed schools and kindergartens, travel bans and social distancing. But does it work? The initial set of results following the shutdown are encouraging, demonstrating a trend towards slower growth; however, this could be reversed if the measures that are in place now are abandoned too early...","The legal behaviors in using medical masks in public have been finally promulgated by the Vietnamese Government after 47 days since the WHO declared the Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) due to the COVID-19 pandemic. From a sample of 345 Vietnamese respondents aged from 15 to 47 years, this brief note found that the risk perception of COVID-19 danger significantly increases the likelihood of wearing the medical masks. In addition, there is a weak evidence about the differences in age under the COVID-19 outbreaks. More noticeably, those who use masks before COVID-19 pandemic tend to maintain their behaviors. Our results offer the insightful into Vietnamese citizens responses in terms of using medical masks; even the uses of this method are still controversial. Our results are robust by performing Exploratory Factor Analysis for five features and further regressions.","COVID-19 has spread with unequal efficiency in various parts of the world. In several European countries including Italy, the increase in the number of COVID-19 cases has followed a consistent, exponential pattern of spread. However, some countries, notably Taiwan and Hong Kong, have achieved a different outcome and have managed to bring the COVID-19 outbreak in their countries rapidly under control, without entering the exponential pattern and with very few cases. They have used several different approaches to COVID-19 outbreak control, including the innovative use of smartphone technology and the widespread use of surgical face masks. We show through our models, that Canada has followed the same, consistent COVID-19 exponential growth pattern that is seen in Italy. Both nationally and in its most heavily affected provinces, there is exponential growth of COVID-19 cases, making it possible to make predictions for the future, if no further interventions are made in public health policy...","The emergence of new pathogens, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and Ebola virus, poses serious challenges to global public health and highlights the urgent need for novel antiviral approaches. Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) have been successfully used to treat various diseases, particularly cancer and immunological disorders. Antigen-specific mAbs have been isolated using several different approaches, including hybridoma, transgenic mice, phage display, yeast display, and single B-cell isolation. Consequently, an increasing number of mAbs, which exhibit high potency against emerging viruses in vitro and in animal models of infection, have been developed. In this paper, we summarize historical trends and recent developments in mAb discovery, compare the advantages and disadvantages of various approaches to mAb production, and discuss the potential use of such strategies for the development of antivi...","AbstractThe outbreak of the 2019 novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has infected thousands of people with a large number of deaths across 26 countries. The sudden appearance of the virus leads to the limited existing therapies for SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, vaccines and antiviral medicines are in desperate need. This study took immune-informatics approaches to identify B- and T-cell epitopes for surface glycoprotein (S) of SARS-CoV-2, followed by estimating their antigenicity and interactions with the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) alleles. We identified four B cell epitopes, two MHC class-I and nine MHC class-II binding T-cell epitopes, which showed highly antigenic features. Allergenicity, toxicity and physiochemical properties analysis confirmed the specificity and selectivity of epitopes. The stability and safety of epitopes were confirmed by digestion analysis. No mutations were observed in all the selected B- and T-cell epitopes across all isolates from different locations worldwide. Epit...","AIM: FilmArray Respiratory Panel (FilmArray RP) test is an emerging diagnostic method in fast detecting multiple respiratory pathogens; the methodology and clinical significance of FilmArray RP in community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) diagnosis were evaluated in this study. METHODS: Specimens from 74 patients with CAP were analyzed and compared using FilmArray RP, traditional multiple PCR assay, bacterial (or fungal) culture, and serological detection. RESULTS: FilmArray RP and multiplex PCR showed 100% coincidence rate in detecting coronaviruses 229E, OC43, HKU1, and NL63, human metapneumovirus, influenza A and B, and parainfluenza viruses (PIV1, PIV2, and PIV4). There were 15 viral specimens tested as disagreement positive results. FilmArray RP had higher detection rate in detecting dual viral and Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection. The positive bacteria (or fungi) were found in 25 specimens. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated the capability of FilmArray RP for simultaneous detection of ...","AbstractThe ongoing outbreak of viral pneumonia in China and beyond is associated with a novel coronavirus, provisionally termed 2019-nCoV. This outbreak has been tentatively associated with a seafood market in Wuhan, China, where the sale of wild animals may be the source of zoonotic infection. Although bats are likely reservoir hosts for 2019-nCoV, the identity of any intermediate host facilitating transfer to humans is unknown. Here, we report the identification of 2019-nCoV related coronaviruses in pangolins (Manis javanica) seized in anti-smuggling operations in southern China. Metagenomic sequencing identified pangolin associated CoVs that belong to two sub-lineages of 2019-nCoV related coronaviruses, including one very closely related to 2019-nCoV in the receptor-binding domain. The discovery of multiple lineages of pangolin coronavirus and their similarity to 2019-nCoV suggests that pangolins should be considered as possible intermediate hosts for this novel human virus and sho...","Abstract The outbreak of the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has caused more than 100,000 people infected and thousands of deaths. Currently, the number of infections and deaths is still increasing rapidly. COVID-19 seriously threatens human health, production, life, social functioning and international relations. In the fight against COVID-19, Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and big data technologies have played an important role in many aspects, including the rapid aggregation of multi-source big data, rapid visualization of epidemic information, spatial tracking of confirmed cases, prediction of regional transmission, spatial segmentation of the epidemic risk and prevention level, balancing and management of the supply and demand of material resources, and social-emotional guidance and panic elimination, which provided solid spatial information support for decision-making, measures formulation, and effectiveness assessment of COVID-19 prevention and control. GIS has d...","Abstract Lim PA, Ng YS, Tay BK. Impact of a viral respiratory epidemic on the practice of medicine and rehabilitation: severe acute respiratory syndrome. Arch Phys Med Rehabil 2004;85:1365\u201370. Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a new respiratory viral epidemic that originated in China but has affected many parts of the world, with devastating impact on economies and the practice of medicine and rehabilitation. A novel coronavirus has been implicated, with transmission through respiratory droplets. Rehabilitation was significantly affected by SARS, because strict infection control measures run counter to principles such as multidisciplinary interactions, patients encouraging and learning from each other, and close physical contact during therapy. Immunocompromised patients who may silently carry SARS are common in rehabilitation and include those with renal failure, diabetes, and cancer. Routine procedures such as management of feces and respiratory secretions (eg, airway sucti...","Abstract A novel coronavirus designated as 2019-nCoV first appeared in Wuhan, China in late December 2019. Dozens of people died in China, and thousands of people infected as 2019-nCoV continues to spread around the world. We have described the discovery, emergence, genomic characteristics, and clinical diagnostics of 2019-nCoV.","A novel coronavirus has caused thousands of human infections in China since December 2019, raising a global public health concern. Recent studies (Huang et al ., Chan et al ., and Zhou et al .) have provided timely insights into its origin and ability to spread among humans, informing infection prevention and control practices.","","ABSTRACT Background Up-to-date studies are needed on the protection provided by face masks used by dentists. We assessed the relative filtering efficacy of two currently used surgical face masks (one a molded mask, the other a tie-on mask) and a certified personal particulate respirator, all made by a single manufacturer. Methods The authors sprayed bicarbonate particulate against a porcelain surface (representing the patient's mouth) and collected it via a mannequin head (representing the dentist's head) placed 40 centimeters away and a tube with two airflow rates (0.5 cubic meters per hour and 9 m3/hour). They calculated the dry residue weight. They performed three separate runs for each mask and three runs with no mask at the two airflow rates with and without aerosol. Results With no mask (control), the authors recorded significant weight gains at both airflow rates with and without vaporization. With vaporization, the three masks were associated with different dry residue weights ...","Summary Currently, the emergence of a novel human coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, has become a global health concern causing severe respiratory tract infections in humans. Human-to-human transmissions have been described with incubation times between 2-10 days, facilitating its spread via droplets, contaminated hands or surfaces. We therefore reviewed the literature on all available information about the persistence of human and veterinary coronaviruses on inanimate surfaces as well as inactivation strategies with biocidal agents used for chemical disinfection, e.g. in healthcare facilities. The analysis of 22 studies reveals that human coronaviruses such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) coronavirus, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) coronavirus or endemic human coronaviruses (HCoV) can persist on inanimate surfaces like metal, glass or plastic for up to 9 days, but can be efficiently inactivated by surface disinfection procedures with 62\u201371% ethanol, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide o...","We estimate the number of COVID-19 cases from newly reported deaths in a population without previous reports. Our results suggest that by the time a single death occurs, hundreds to thousands of cases are likely to be present in that population. This suggests containment via contact tracing will be challenging at this point, and other response strategies should be considered. Our approach is implemented in a publicly available, user-friendly, online tool.","Sepsis, acute lung injury, and ARDS contribute substantially to the expanding burden of critical illness within our ICUs. Each of these processes is characterized by a myriad of injurious events, including apoptosis, microvascular dysfunction, abnormal coagulation, and dysregulated host immunity. Only recently have platelets\u2014long considered merely effectors of thrombosis\u2014been implicated in inflammatory conditions and the pathobiology of these disease processes. A growing body of evidence suggests a prominent role for maladaptive platelet activation and aggregation during sepsis and ARDS and has begun to underscore the pluripotential influence of platelets on outcomes in critical illness. Not only do platelets enhance vascular injury through thrombotic mechanisms but also appear to help orchestrate pathologic immune responses and are pivotal players in facilitating leukocyte recruitment to vulnerable tissue. These events contribute to the organ damage and poor patient outcomes that stil...","Understanding the molecular features that made SARS-CoV-2 a highly infectious virus is crucial for the development of targeted therapies and an effective vaccine. Following the recent report of a furin-like cleavage site1, unique to SARS-CoV-2, we characterized several additional residues positioned within the crown of the S glycoprotein under positive/diversifying selection along the ancestral lineage of current pandemic strains. Residue V483 in near proximity to the ACE2 binding domain, which may indeed affect the enhanced ability of currently circulating strains to infect host cells. Molecular dynamic simulations revealed long-range covariant movements with furin cleavage, correlated with pre-fusion conformation of SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein monomer. Residue T333 is hinge of this movement that gives further advantage to bind cell receptors facilitating fusion and entry. Evolutionary analysis revealed that current lineage is likely to have emerged from the reservoir after a recombinat...","Ever since the development of the first vaccine more than 200 years ago, vaccinations have greatly decreased the burden of infectious diseases worldwide, famously leading to the eradication of small pox and allowing the restriction of diseases such as polio, tetanus, diphtheria, and measles. A multitude of research efforts focuses on the improvement of established and the discovery of new vaccines such as the HPV (human papilloma virus) vaccine in 2006. However, radical changes in the density, age distribution and traveling habits of the population worldwide as well as the changing climate favor the emergence of old and new pathogens that bear the risk of becoming pandemic threats. In recent years, the rapid spread of severe infections such as HIV, SARS, Ebola, and Zika have highlighted the dire need for global preparedness for pandemics, which necessitates the extremely rapid development and comprehensive distribution of vaccines against potentially previously unknown pathogens. What ...","Abstract Concept of \u201crisk analysis\u201d in food safety management needs to be understood to assess, manage, and communicate risks for proper implementation of food safety policies, food laws, and standards, in a country. Science-based approaches, which are an integral part of risk analysis to improve modern food safety systems, are intimately linked to processes such as good quality practices. Risk analysis strengthens the ability of traditional food safety systems to meet current challenges. Risk analysis is just one part of an effective food safety system. Other components of food safety system like food safety policies, food legislation, food inspection, laboratory analysis, epidemiological surveillance of food-borne diseases, monitoring systems for chemical and microbiological contamination in foods, and information, education and communication, also need to be improved continuously. \u201cFood safety controls\u201d are now being replaced by \u201crisk-based controls\u201d in all stages of food production...","The recently emerged coronavirus in Wuhan, China has claimed at least six lives as of January 22 and infected hundreds if not thousands of individuals. The situation has drawn international attention, including from the virology community. We applaud the rapid release to the public of the genome sequence of the new virus by Chinese virologists, but we also believe that increased transparency on disease reporting and data sharing with international colleagues are crucial for curbing the spread of this newly emerging virus to other parts of the world.","Abstract An important effort has been performed after the emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic in 2003 to diagnose and prevent virus spreading. Several types of vaccines have been developed including inactivated viruses, subunit vaccines, virus-like particles (VLPs), DNA vaccines, heterologous expression systems, and vaccines derived from SARS-CoV genome by reverse genetics. This review describes several aspects essential to develop SARS-CoV vaccines, such as the correlates of protection, virus serotypes, vaccination side effects, and bio-safeguards that can be engineered into recombinant vaccine approaches based on the SARS-CoV genome. The production of effective and safe vaccines to prevent SARS has led to the development of promising vaccine candidates, in contrast to the design of vaccines for other coronaviruses, that in general has been less successful. After preclinical trials in animal models, efficacy and safety evaluation of the most promising vaccin...","What has happened in China shows that quarantine, social distancing, and isolation of infected populations can contain the epidemic.1 This impact of the COVID-19 response in China is encouraging for the many countries where COVID-19 is beginning to spread. However, it is unclear whether other countries can implement the stringent measures China eventually adopted. Singapore and Hong Kong, both of which had severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemics in 2002\u201303, provide hope and many lessons to other countries. In both places, COVID-19 has been managed well to date, despite early cases, by early government action and through social distancing measures taken by individuals. The course of an epidemic is defined by a series of key factors, some of which are poorly understood at present for COVID-19. The basic reproduction number (R0), which defines the mean number of secondary cases generated by one primary case when the population is largely susceptible to infection, determines the...","A cluster of pneumonia cases linked to a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) was reported by China in late December 2019. Reported case incidence has now reached the hundreds, but this is likely an underestimate. As of 24 January 2020, with reports of thirteen exportation events, we estimate the cumulative incidence in China at 5502 cases (95% confidence interval: 3027, 9057). The most plausible number of infections is in the order of thousands, rather than hundreds, and there is a strong indication that untraced exposures other than the one in the epidemiologically linked seafood market in Wuhan have occurred.","Abstract Among thousands of homo-oligomeric protein structures, there is a small but growing subset of \u2018domain-swapped\u2019 proteins. The term \u2018domain swapping,\u2019 originally coined by D. Eisenberg, describes a scenario in which two or more polypeptide chains exchange identical units for oligomerization. This type of assembly could play a role in disease-related aggregation and amyloid formation or as a specific mechanism for regulating function. This chapter introduces terms and features concerning domain swapping, summarizes ideas about its putative mechanisms, reports on domain-swapped structures collected from the literature, and describes a few notable examples in detail.","AbstractBackgroundNew endemic disease has been spread across Wuhan City, China on December 2019. Within few weeks, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced a novel coronavirus designated as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). In late January 2020, WHO declared the outbreak of a \u201cpublic-health emergency of international concern\u201d due to the rapid and increasing spread of the disease worldwide. Currently, there is no vaccine or approved treatment for this emerging infection; thus the objective of this study is to design a multi epitope peptide vaccine against COVID-19 using immunoinformatics approach.MethodSeveral techniques facilitating the combination of immunoinformatics approach and comparative genomic approach were used in order to determine the potential peptides for designing the T cell epitopes-based peptide vaccine using the envelope protein of 2019-nCoV as a target.ResultsExtensive mutations, insertion and deletion were discovered with comparative sequencing in COVID-19 st...","Abstract Objective An emerging outbreak of COVID-19 has been detected in at least 26 countries worldwide. Given this pandemic situation, robust risk communication is urgently needed particularly in affected countries. Therefore, this study explored the potential use of Google Trends (GT) to monitor public restlessness toward COVID-19 epidemic infection in Taiwan. Methods We retrieved GT data for the specific locations of Taiwan nationwide and subregions using defined search terms related to coronavirus, handwashing, and face masks. Results Searches related to COVID-19 and face masks in Taiwan increased rapidly, following the announcements of Taiwan\u2019 first imported case and reached its peak as local cases were reported. However, searches for handwashing were gradually increased in period of face masks shortage. Moreover, high to moderate correlations between Google relative search volume (RSV) and COVID-19 cases were found in Taipei (lag-3), New Taipei (lag-2), Taoyuan (lag-2), Tainan (...","BACKGROUND: Wild birds are an important but to some extent under-studied reservoir for emerging pathogens. We used unbiased sequencing methods for virus discovery in shorebird samples from the Delaware Bay, USA; an important feeding ground for thousands of migratory birds. FINDINGS: Analysis of shorebird fecal samples indicated the presence of a novel astrovirus and coronavirus. A sanderling sample yielded sequences with distant homology to avian nephritis virus 1, an astrovirus associated with acute nephritis in poultry. A ruddy turnstone sample yielded sequences with homology to deltacoronaviruses. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings highlight shorebirds as a virus reservoir and the need to closely monitor wild bird populations for the emergence of novel virus variants.","AbstractWuhan Novel Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak has become a global outbreak which has raised the concern of scientific community to design and discover a definitive cure against this deadly virus which has caused deaths of numerous infected people upon infection and spreading. To date, no antiviral therapy or vaccine is available which can effectively combat the infection caused by this virus. This study was conducted to design possible epitope-based subunit vaccines against the SARS-CoV-2 virus using the approaches of reverse vaccinology and immunoinformatics. Upon continual computational experimentation three possible vaccine constructs were designed and one vaccine construct was selected as the best vaccine based on molecular docking study which is supposed to effectively act against SARS-CoV-2. Later, molecular dynamics simulation and in silico codon adaptation experiments were carried out in order to check biological stability and find effective mass production strate...","AbstractCoronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-related coronaviruses (e.g., 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV) are phylogenetically distantly related, but both are capable of infecting human hosts via the same receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, and cause similar clinical and pathological features, suggesting their phenotypic convergence. Yet, the molecular basis that underlies their phenotypic convergence remains unknown. Here, we used a recently developed molecular phyloecological approach to examine the molecular basis leading to their phenotypic convergence. Our genome-level analyses show that the spike protein, which is responsible for receptor binding, has undergone significant Darwinian selection along the branches related to 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV. Further examination shows an unusually high proportion of evolutionary convergent amino acid sites in the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein between COVID-19 and SARS-related CoV ...","","","","Countries across the world observed dramatic rises in COVID-19 cases and deaths in March 2020. In the United States, delays in the availability of diagnostic testing have prompted questions about the extent of unobserved community transmission. Using a simulation model informed by reported cases and deaths, we estimated that tens of thousands of people (median: \u200b22,876, 95% posterior predictive interval: 7,451 - 53,044) were infected by the time a national emergency was declared. Our results also indicate that fewer than 10% of locally acquired, symptomatic infections in the US were detected throughout much of late February. These results point to the need for immediate, large-scale efforts to mitigate the impacts of SARS-CoV-2 on the US.","The increasing burden of emerging infectious diseases worldwide confronts us with numerous challenges, including the imperative to design research and responses that are commensurate to understanding the complex social and ecological contexts in which infectious diseases occur. A diverse group of scientists met in Hawaii in March 2005 to discuss the linked social and ecological contexts in which infectious diseases emerge. A subset of the meeting was a group that focused on \u201ctransdisciplinary approaches\u201d to integrating knowledge across and beyond academic disciplines in order to improve prevention and control of emerging infections. This article is based on the discussions of that group. Here, we outline the epidemiological legacy that has dominated infectious disease research and control up until now, and introduce the role of new, transdisciplinary and systems-based approaches to emerging infectious diseases. We describe four cases of transboundary health issues and use them to discu...","BACKGROUND: Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a febrile respiratory illness. The disease has been etiologically linked to a novel coronavirus that has been named the SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV), whose genome was recently sequenced. Since it is a member of the Coronaviridae, its spike protein (S2) is believed to play a central role in viral entry by facilitating fusion between the viral and host cell membranes. The protein responsible for viral-induced membrane fusion of HIV-1 (gp41) differs in length, and has no sequence homology with S2. RESULTS: Sequence analysis reveals that the two viral proteins share the sequence motifs that construct their active conformation. These include (1) an N-terminal leucine/isoleucine zipper-like sequence, and (2) a C-terminal heptad repeat located upstream of (3) an aromatic residue-rich region juxtaposed to the (4) transmembrane segment.

In case of shortages, alternatives to respirators should be considered, including other classes of FFP respirators, elastomeric half-mask, and full face-piece air-purifying respirators.","Surgical masks (also known as medical masks) are used often for droplet precautions, as they are designed to block large particles, but are less effective in blocking smaller particle aerosols (&lt;5 \u03bcm). Unlike surgical masks, respirator masks are designed to block aerosols. Respiratory protection in health care for airborne precautions commonly follows two filtering device paths, N95 mask respirators and powered air-purifying respirators (PAPRs). The N95 masks filter at least 95% of aerosols (&lt;5 \u03bcm) and dropletsize (5 \u03bcm to 50 \u03bcm) particles and are not resistant to oil. Light-weight, no-hose, powered air-purifying respirators (PAPR) are a highly effective alternative to face masks. Air is forced through a large, multi-layer filter housed in the helmet and provide positive pressure within the face-shield compartment. These devices are approved by US National Institute for Occupational Safety and Hazard (NIOSH) and can provide high level protection from common airborne viruses that exceed N95 face masks without the need for \"fit-testing\" and have been used in a variety of settings. 56 PAPR also has the advantage of providing head and neck protection. See Figures 1 and 2 .","Surgical masks have been in use for over 100 years as barriers against the development of infection via large droplets produced during surgery. N95 filtering facepiece respirators (N95 respirators) were introduced in 1995 as part of the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) 42 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 84 on non-powered air-purifying respirators (www.cdc. gov/niosh/npptl/topics/respirators/ pt84abs2.html). Currently, surgical masks and N95 respirators are the two main intervention measures for personal respiratory protection. Nonetheless, technical challenges exist, some of which are shared by both devices: (i) filtration efficiency, (ii) cross[ 1 0 9 _ T D $ D I F F ] -infection, (iii) recyclability, and (iv) faceseal.","The COVID-19 pandemic has led to unprecedented utilization of healthcare resources. There are global shortages of personal protective equipment (PPE), including N95 respirators. 1 The CDC has modified PPE recommendations and provided \"crisis alternate strategies\" if the respirator supply is exhausted, including use of masks which are not approved by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) and homemade masks as a last resort. 2,3 Non-NIOSH and improvised fabric masks provide only marginal protection and are inferior to N95 respirators, a particular concern during the COVID-19 pandemic which has a high rate of healthcare worker infection. 4, 5 Reused respirators may become a reservoir for pathogens, presenting a potential risk. 6, 7 Reprocessing of used N95 respirators may ameliorate supply chain constraints and provide a higher filtration crisis alternative, but it is unknown if effective sterilization can be achieved for a virus without impairing respirator function.","Recommendations on face masks vary across countries and we have seen that the use of masks increases substantially once local epidemics begin, including the use of N95 respirators (without any other protective equipment) in community settings. This increase in use of face masks by the general public exacerbates the global supply shortage of face masks, with prices soaring, 9 and risks supply constraints to frontline healthcare professionals. As a response, a few countries (eg, Germany and South Korea) banned exportation of face masks to prioritise local demand. 10 WHO called for a 40% increase in the production of protective equipment, including face masks. 9 Meanwhile, health authorities should optimise face mask distribution to prioritise the needs of frontline health-care workers and the most vulnerable populations in communities who are more susceptible to infection and mortality if infected, including older adults (particularly those older than 65 years) and people with underlying health conditions. People in some regions (eg, Thailand, China, and Japan) opted for makeshift alternatives or repeated usage of disposable surgical masks. Notably, improper use of face masks, such as not changing disposable masks, could jeopardise the protective effect and even increase the risk of infection.","In terms of comfort, 65% (CI: 44-85%) of subjects preferred the Totobobo mask to the N95 mask (1860, 1860s; 3M). Although the CI straddles 50%, this may be due to our small sample size. Comfort is an important issue when masks need to be worn for long periods of time. 9 Greater comfort may translate into greater compliance with proper use of the mask and hence greater protection in clinical use. The experience of our intensive care unit during the severe acute respiratory syndrome epidemic suggests that compliance is an important factor in determining the risk of occupational infection. 10 In theory, all subjects should have achieved a filtration factor 100 with the N95 mask, as they had previously passed a fit test with the same model of N95 mask. The lower than expected pass rate may reflect the fact that subjects did not undergo a regular fittesting programme. The US Occupational Safety and Health Administration, Centers for Disease Control and Protection recommends that workers using N95 respirators should have repeated fit-testing on a regular basis. Although this imposes a considerable logistic and financial burden and is controversial, our data suggest that a significant proportion of subjects may not be adequately protected without regular testing. 11 The results of a recent randomised controlled trial conducted in emergency departments and medical and paediatric wards suggest that surgical masks provide a similar level of protection to N95 masks against transmission of seasonal influenza. 12 However, we would be cautious concerning extrapolation of these data to all healthcare environments and to patients with influenza A H1N1 (2009) infection. The risk of healthcare worker infection relates to a number of factors including number of infectious particles produced by patients and the number of organisms that constitutes an infectious dose. 13 If the infectious dose is very small or the number of infectious particles produced is very high, then the benefit of the much higher filtration efficacy of N95 respirators should be greater. 14 These values vary with the organism and are currently unknown for influenza A H1N1. Furthermore, in certain areas, such as intensive care units, the frequent use of aerosolgenerating procedures will increase the number of infectious particles produced and therefore the likely benefit of N95 respirators.","During the ophthalmic exam, the face-to-face proximity of the slit lamp biomicroscopic examination may place the ophthalmologist at a higher risk of aerosolized particles. Of the health care workers who died from COVID-19 in Wuhan, three were Chinese ophthalmologists who worked in the same unit including Li Wenliang, who believed that he had been infected while treating an asymptomatic glaucoma patient. 9, 10 The route of transmission in these cases is unknown, but the upper respiratory system and nasopharynx are a major site of viral infection, and likely present a higher risk to the ophthalmologist than exposure to tear film harbouring SARS-CoV2. Recent studies have shown that viral RNA may be observed in association with the small minority of patients who display conjunctivitis (i.e. &lt; 1% of patients with COVID-19 presented with conjunctivitis). Viral RNA has not been identified in the tear film of COVID-19 patients without conjunctivitis to-date, but data representing sampling performed early in disease when viral load is highest are lacking. 11, 12, 13 The World Health Organization (WHO) and United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have recommended the use of full PPE for the examination of PUIs and COVID-19 patients. The face masks can be divided into N95 respirators and surgical masks, and both have different uses. The N95 respirator is designed with filtration requirements to prevent inhalation of small airborne particles and minimize leakage from the facial seal. 14 As such, it protects the wearer from the inhalation of viral particles. Surgical masks are often fitted loosely but can prevent respiratory droplet transmission and prevent hand-to-face contact. They are considered to be more effective in preventing spread from an infected person wearing the mask to another than in protecting the wearer from infection. In a randomized clinical trial, the use of N95 respirators and surgical masks were found to have comparable outcomes in protection from influenza virus in outpatient settings 14 ; however, N95 respirators are the preferred option when dealing with PUIs or COVID-19 patients.","The lack of agreement on the selection and use of masks (medical or surgical facemasks) and respirators (N95/P2/FFP2 or equivalent) is reflected in inconsistent and conflicting policies worldwide Chughtai et al., 2013 ) . Masks and respirators are commonly used to protect healthcare workers from respiratory infections, particularly during the initial periods of outbreaks/ pandemics when other control measures not yet available ( Aiello et al., 2010 a; Aledort et al., 2007 ) . In this paper we examined existing policies of selected health organization and countries on the use of masks and respirators to protect hospital health workers from COVID-19.","Recommendation 1: In health care workers performing upper GI procedures, regardless of COVID-19 status*, the AGA recommends use of N95 (or N99, or PAPR) masks instead of surgical masks, as part of appropriate personal protective equipment (Strong recommendation, moderate certainty of evidence) Recommendation 2: In health care workers performing lower GI procedures, regardless of COVID-19 status*, the AGA recommends the use of N95 (or N99 or PAPR) masks instead of surgical masks as part of appropriate personal protective equipment. (Strong recommendation, low certainty of evidence) Recommendation 3: In health care workers performing any GI procedure, in known or presumptive COVID-19 patients, the AGA recommends against the use of surgical masks only, as part of adequate personal protective equipment (Strong recommendation, low certainty of evidence) *These recommendations assume the absence of widespread reliable and accurate rapid testing for the diagnosis of COVID-19 infection or immunity Summary of the Evidence Our systematic literature search did not identify any studies that provided direct evidence to inform our clinical questions for PPE in COVID-19. However, several studies from the SARS outbreak were identified that provide indirect evidence. The SARS outbreak reinforced the vital role of PPE in protecting health care workers from occupationally acquired infection. We used data from two existing systematic reviews by Offeddu 2017 and Tran 2012 to inform our recommendations. 58, 59 First, the systematic reviews by Offeddu et al included a meta-analysis of 3 observational studies that showed a benefit in using N95 respirators over standard masks in protecting health care workers from SARS (OR = 0.86; 95% CI: 0. 22 Table 4B ). Second, a systematic review from Tran et al revealed an increased risk of viral transmission in health care workers performing aerosol-generating procedures (mostly bronchoscopy or tracheal intubation). 59 (Supplemental Figure 3 ). Zamora and colleagues investigated the amount of contamination on the neck and face from individuals using a PAPR mask (in combination with N95) compared with a N95 mask alone 60 ; Individuals who used the PAPR-based strategy experienced a lower risk of face and neck contamination compared to N95 mask alone (RR = 0.08; 95% CI: 0.03-0.19). See Evidence Profile Table 5 , Supplemental Figure 4 . Limitations of these studies include small numbers of health care workers, and data on tracheal intubation or bronchoscopy, not GI endoscopy.","Extended use and reuse of masks and respirators was a common practice during past epidemics and pandemics due to shortage of products ( Chughtai et al., 2015 ; Beckman et al., 2013 ; Lautenbach et al., 2010 ; Rebmann and Wagner, 2009 ). According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, extended use refers to \"the practice of wearing the same N95 respirator for repeated close contact encounters with several patients, without removing the respirator between patient encounters\" ( Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) 2014 a). The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention defines re-use as \"the practice of using the same N95 respirator for multiple encounters with patients but removing it ('doffing') after each encounter\" ( Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) 2014 a). Shortages of respirators were reported in many hospitals in US and Japan during the 2009 influenza H1N1 pandemic and staff had to use medical masks ( Lautenbach et al., 2010 ; Rebmann and Wagner, 2009 ; Tomizuka et al., 2013 ) .","Furthermore, aerosols penetrate through loose-fitting masks/respirators, based on wearer facial features, movement, proper and timely fit testing/check, aerosol size, and mask shape. Particles &lt;10 mm enter through faceleaks 5-6-fold and up to 10fold more than through the filter of surgical masks and N95 respirators, respectively [8] . Thus, although improving filtration efficiency is necessary, better fitting should be a primary objective to fully address aerosol penetration.","Any RCF staff member providing direct care to a resident with an ILI or influenza should wear a surgical mask. Surgical face masks must meet Australian Standards 18 and be fluid resistant, protecting the wearer from droplet contamination of the nasal or oral mucosa (refer to Appendix 1). All staff and visitors entering the room of a person with a respiratory illness should wear a single-use surgical face mask for close contact (less than (&lt;)1 metre). Note. Single-use surgical face masks protect the user against droplets. However, P2 respirators (known as N95 respirators or facemasks (USA equivalent rating)) protect the user against aerosols as well as droplets. Insufficient evidence exists to support the use of P2 respirators to further reduce the risk of infections transmitted by the droplet route.","Like other coronavirus diseases (e.g. SARS and MERS), COVID-19 is believed to be transmitted through droplet and contact modes however other transmission modes, such as airborne, are likely given the virus is found in higher concentrations in the lungs than the upper respiratory tract ( World Health Organisation (WHO) 2020 ). There had been evidence of airborne transmission of SARS as well, therefore respirators were recommended for SARS during 2002-03 outbreak ( McKinney et al., 2006 ) . In Canada, initially masks were recommended, but this recommendation was later changed to respirators due to the deaths of health workers. A recent study demonstrated the presence of coronavirus in anal swabs from infected patients and possibility of transmission through faecal-oral route ( Zhang et al., 2020 ) . Transmission dynamics for COVID-19 are still unclear and pharmaceutical control measures are not yet available, therefore N95 or higher respirators should be offered to health workers who are working at the frontline ( MacIntyre et al., 2014 a; MacIntyre et al., 2014 b). Health workers and other first responders in high coronavirus transmission areas (e.g. Wuhan) should use respirators during routine care of coronavirus cases. Health workers and first responders in low risk countries should use a respirator when encountering a suspected or confirmed case of coronavirus. If respirators are not available, then masks should be used.","While there is a high level of agreement amongst key agencies that masks and respirators play a role in the protection of health workers, there are currently discrepancies between these agencies regarding how and when the different products are used. The World Health Organization (WHO), the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and other leading health organisations have different recommendations for the selection of respiratory protec-tion. For example, the WHO recommends using masks to protect health workers from COVID-19 during routine care and respirators during aerosol generating procedures ( World Health Organisation (WHO) 2020 ). In contrast, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) 2020 ) and the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control ( European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) 2020 ) recommend using respirators during both routine care of COVID19 patients and high risk situations. Individual countries also have different policies; some are in line with the WHO, and others with the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. For example, the Australian ( Communicable Diseases Network Australia (CDNA) ) and Canadian guidelines ( Government of Canada ) align with the WHO, while UK ( Public Health England ) and Chinese guidelines ( Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention 2020 ) align with the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and European Center for Disease Prevention and Control. While all organisations recommend using N95/ P2/FFP2 or equivalent respirators, Public Health England (UK) recommends using filtering facepiece 3 (FFP3) respirators for all cases and the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control recommends using FFP3 during aerosol generating procedures. Australian guidelines also recommend powered air purifying respirators while performing aerosol generating procedures on multiple patients. Although US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines also discuss powered air purifying respirators indication of their use is not clear.","The best evidence currently available suggests that COVID-19 spreads primarily via droplet transmission and direct contact. With the appropriate precautions, nosocomial transmission can be mitigated. Health care personnel should receive training on proper donning and doffing of personal protective equipment, including fit testing of N95 masks and use of powered air-purifying respirators, as well as basic infection prevention tenets, such as hand hygiene. Hospitals should monitor rates of equipment use to ensure an adequate supply of personal protective equipment for those on the front lines and may need to engage hospital security to avoid theft or hoarding of such equipment. Extended use or limited reuse of N95 respirators may become necessary, and communication about preservation is important.","The number of infected health care workers dropped dramatically after infection control measures were put in place, such as isolation of infected patients, use of personal protective equipment (PPE) for health care workers, and strict hand-hygiene for all [25] . WHO and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have issued guidelines that recommend the use of standard, contact, and airborne protection, including respirators of N95 standard or higher in an airborne epidemic [26, 27] . Standard PPE includes N95 masks, gloves, gowns, caps, and face shields or goggles. All staff should be mask fit-tested to ensure an adequate seal. When performing highrisk procedures, such as intubation, bag-mask ventilation, or bronchoscopy, protection should be enhanced with powered air-purifying respirators.","The WHO also issued detailed guidelines on the use of face masks in the community, during care at home, and in the health care settings of COVID-19 [56]. In this document, health care workers are recommended to use particulate respirators such as those certified N95 or FFP2 when performing aerosol-generating procedures and to use medical masks while providing any care to suspected or confirmed cases. According to this guideline, individuals with respiratory symptoms are advised to use medical masks both in health care and home care settings properly following the infection prevention guidelines. According to this guideline, an individual without respiratory symptoms is not required to wear a medical mask when in public. Proper use and disposal of masks is important to avoid any increase in risk of transmission [56].","A primary issue concerning the efficacy of surgical masks against airborne pathogens is low filtration efficiency. Although performance can vary drastically among models, inconsistent reports on surgical mask efficacy are probably associated with improper application, resulting in performance mismatch. Another crucial issue is cross[ 1 0 9 _ T D $ D I F F ] -infection/transmission. Because viruses and microorganisms can survive for at least a few hours to several days [4] , masks and respirators become a source of infection for the wearer and others, thus limiting them to single use. Infectious aerosols on filters can also be re-released into the environment (i.e., reaerosolization), for example through accidents. With a particle diameter of 1.15 mm, re-aerosolization from N95 respirators as a result of a fall (drop height, 0.76 m) was between 0.002% and 0.012% [5] .","We evaluated the virucidal activity of HP vapor using a BQ-50 system (Bioquell, Horsham, PA) after inoculating 3M 1870 N95 respirators (3M, St. Paul, MN) with 3 aerosolized bacteriophage that are a reasonable proxy for SARS-CoV-2. Inoculation resulted in contamination of the respirator with 9.87e4 plaque forming units (PFU) of phage phi-6, 4.17e7 PFU of phage T7 and 1.35e7 PFU of phage T1. Respirators were reprocessed with BQ-50 with a long aeration phase to reduce HP vapors. Virucidal activity was measured by a standard plaquing assay prior to and after sterilization. A single HP vapor cycle resulted in complete eradication of phage from masks (limit of detection 10 PFU, lower than the infectious dose of the majority of respiratory viral pathogens). After 5 cycles, the respirators appeared similar to new with no deformity.","Filtration efficiency: whereas N95 respirators have a certified filtration efficiency of 95%, surgical masks have low performance. Several major parameters can be controlled to decrease particle penetration, (i) Decreasing the diameter of fibers.","FFP3 masks or N95 respirators are currently considered best for preventing inhalation of aerosols and in case of splashes during the body handling process to protect the face, eyes, nose, and mouth (Table 1 ).","RCTs comparing N95 respirators to medical masks in health care personnel working in outpatient and ward settings have not shown significant differences in protection from laboratory-confirmed influenza or other RVIs [72, 73]. The relevance of these observations to the ICU setting is uncertain, given the frequent use of aerosol-generating procedures in critically ill patients. Cloth masks are clearly inferior to medical masks in protecting HCWs from RVIs [74]. Other aspects of prevention strategies to prevent transmission when caring for patients with severe RVIs include annual influenza vaccination of healthcare workers, adherence to standard precautions, including hand hygiene, during the care of any patient and appropriate management of ill healthcare workers (please refer to Table 2 footnote for CDC references). Recently, antiseptic hand rubbing using ethanol-based disinfectants (EBDs) was found to be less effective than hand washing with running water in inactivating influenza virus in undried mucus under experimental conditions; [75] also nonenveloped viruses like adenovirus which are not easily inactivated by EBDs. The implications of these observations for clinical practice remain to be determined but hand washing with soap and water or hand rubbing with EBD for longer than 30 s may be warranted.","Ideally, a new mask or respirator would be used for each individual to minimize the transmission of infectious diseases that are airborne or transmitted via respiratory droplets. However, crises such as the current COVID-19 pandemic can create shortages that necessitate measures to conserve PPE. Among potential methods for decontamination, previous work has suggested UVGI results in less physical deformation then bleach, microwave irradiation, and vaporized hydrogen peroxide. 5 Additionally, this and other investigations of UVGI for the purpose of N95 respirator decontamination was motivated by the ubiquity of UV lamp equipped biosafety cabinets, especially at large biomedical research institutions. Various groups have therefore begun sterilizing respiratory protective equipment themselves using UVGI and \"homebrew\" setups. For example, enterprising clinicians at the University of Nebraska Medical Center are stringing N95 respirators between two towers of UVGI bulbs placed on either side of a room in order to inactivate potential SARS-CoV-2 viral contaminants on the masks. 12 From our measurements, normalized to the technical specifications of the manufacturer using a typical BSC, we conservatively estimate the time to sterilize N95 respirators using similar models is 20 min per side. This recommendation represents the time required to deliver a UV dose that is \u224830 times higher than the previously reported dose to inactivate 90% of single-stranded RNA viruses. 2 To scale this protocol to any BSC, we propose that a conservative scaling factor of 1.98 for spatial heterogeneity is likely conserved across BSCs, but the amount of power delivered to the BSC surface likely varies significantly between manufacturers. Note that given the variance between the two BSCs we measured, the true worst-case scaling factor is likely slightly worse than what we measured, as there almost certainly exist BSCs with greater variation in UV radiation intensity. We invite other scientists to add measurements from their own BSCs to our github repository to allow continued updating of this recommendation. 17 Therefore, to calculate a time for an arbitrary BSC model, we recommend using Equation 4:","The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.18.20021881 doi: medRxiv preprint Cases of a novel type of contagious pneumonia were first discovered a month ago in Wuhan. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and Chinese health authorities have determined and announced that a novel coronavirus (CoV), denoted as 2019-nCoV, had caused this pneumonia outbreak. 1,2 Existing evidence have confirmed the human-to-human transmission of 2019-nCoV. 3 We retrospectively collected infection data from 2 January to 22 January at six departments (Respiratory, ICU, Infectious Disease, Hepatobiliary Pancreatic Surgery, Trauma and Microsurgery, and Urology) from Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University. Medical staffs in these department follow differential routines of occupational protection: the medical staff in departments of Respiratory, ICU, and Infectious Disease wore N95 respirators, disinfected and clean hands frequently (N95 group); due to people were not enough for the knowledge of the 2019-nCoV in these early days of the pneumonia outbreak, the medical staff in the other three departments wore no medical masks, disinfected and clean hands occasionally (no-mask group). author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.","To strengthen response preparedness and ensure coordination of different government agencies, we listed COVID-19 as a notifiable disease, named \"Severe pneumonia with Novel Pathogen\", on January 15 and activated the Central Epidemic Command Center (CECC) on January 20. 5 CECC then announced several policies in response to the worsening outbreak in China, including border control and home quarantine requirement for travelers from affected countries and areas; export ban of surgical masks and N95 respirators to secure the domestic use; strengthening the preparedness of Communicable Disease Control Medical Network for patient isolation and clinical management; and risk communication with the public through daily press and social media such as Line app and Facebook.","Health care providers are advised to wear a minimum of an N95 particulate respirator when caring for a suspected SARS patient. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) covers health care providers in the United States. OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.134 requires \"written procedures for selecting respirators, medical evaluations, fit testing, use of respirators, maintaining respirators, training, and periodically evaluating the effectiveness of the program.\" This discussion will focus on selection, medical evaluation, and fit-testing. Readers are referred to the OSHA Web site for complete information. 4 Health care providers are advised to wear a minimum of N95 particulate respirator when caring for a suspected SARS patient.","The inevitable presentation of a COVID-19 positive patient to a radiation oncology clinic promises to pose significant challenges to the staff, administration, and physician who are charged with not only that patient's care and well-being, but also the care and well-being of other patients (and staff) in the department. Figure 1 is a diagram depicting a hypothetical triage decision tree for a patient presenting to a radiation oncology clinic with a recent positive test for the COVID-19 virus, informed by attentions to the CDC outpatient guidelines and the Bass &amp; Washington radiation facility infection control textbook chapter. 11, 27 ASTRO recommends encouraging staff who interface with a high volume of patients, such as therapists, wear non-N95 masks, if available. Droplet precautions are essential for any patient with positive or suspected COVID-10. 28 The clinical landscape with respect to the management of COVID-19 patients continues to evolve at a galloping pace and professional societies, including American Society of Radiation Oncology (ASTRO), continue to work to develop useful and evidence-based guidelines for the management and care of patients as that landscape progresses. We encourage clinicians to look to these updated guidelines as they are released for the most up-to-date and informed management information.","As a result of the transmission of SARS to healthcare workers, N95 (or equivalent) masks are currently mandatory in Toronto for all medical personnel. They ful\u00ael the \u00aeltering ef\u00aeciency criteria of the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) N95 standard by protecting against droplet and airborne transmission of 95% of particles greater than 0.3 microns in size. 21 These masks will offer a high degree of protection against the contact and droplet spread of the coronavirus. The N95 masks should be \u00aet tested using an appropriate`\u00aet test kit' according to the manufacturer's instructions. 22 The PCM 2000 Tuberculosis masks meet the N95 \u00aeltration criteria and \u00aet the majority of wearers adequately. They do not require routine \u00aet testing. N95 masks can be worn continuously for 8 h whereas PCM 2000 masks can only be worn continuously for 4 h. All of these masks are uncomfortable and increase the work of breathing; staff compliance therefore requires motivation and encouragement. Masks must not be touched or taken down and then re-used as this greatly increases the risk of contamination.","Currently, the single use of medical mask and FFP respirators is recommended, but this is not always feasible. During a pandemic or extended outbreak, medical masks and FFP respirators may not be available for everyone. Therefore the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and other health organisations have previously considered the extended use and re-use of medical masks and respirators during outbreaks, pandemics and other high demand situations (( Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) 2014 a; Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) 2009 ; Institute of Medicine (IOM) National Academy of Sciences 2006 )). During recent COVID-19 epidemics the shortage of masks and respirators have been reported from many countries. However, the outer surface of medical masks or respirators may be contaminated and may be a source of infection (( Institute of Medicine (IOM) National Academy of Sciences 2010 ; Viscusi et al., 2009 ) ). A recent study showed that pathogens may be present on the outer surface of around 10% masks and risks increase with prolonged mask use ( Chughtai et al., 2019 ) . The number of viral particles and length of survival are important factors to consider in case re-use is deemed essential ( Institute of Medicine (IOM) National Academy of Sciences 2010 ).","These patients were subsequently managed in two general wards and a high-dependency ward, and isolated from the rest of the dedicated SARS hospital. The patients were triaged on admission to the wards. Those requiring close hourly monitoring, invasive central venous pressure monitoring and tracheostomy care were admitted to the highdependency ward (ward C). The less seriously ill were admitted to the general wards. These patients were triaged accordingly: ward A, those who had a current fever or a recent history of fever related to a surgical cause (e.g. surgical infections and postoperative complications); and ward B, those who had no history of fever in their admission before transfer and included patients with chronic surgical problems. The wards were of an open design and patients were subject to cohorting. Limited numbers of isolation rooms were available on the general wards and in the high-dependency ward. No visitors were allowed and there was no interaction of patients between wards. Patients were discouraged from interacting with one another within the ward, but as their condition improved, many, in fact, did so. They shared facilities within the ward such as the toilets and bathing facilities. The HCWs looking after them wore full personal protective equipment (PPE) at all times using precautions for airborne, droplet and contact transmission. The PPE included 3M (1860/1860S) N95 particulate respirator masks, long-sleeved disposable gowns, goggles or visors, hair covers and gloves. The technique of applying and removing the PPE was standardized for all HCWs. The N95 masks were test fitted for all HCWs before patient contact. Gowns and gloves were discarded after each patient contact and strict handwashing was observed. Contaminated goggles and stethoscopes were cleaned with 70% alcohol before re-use as was other equipment necessary for routine physical examination. The use of PAPR (powered airway pressure respirators, 3M Jupiter) was indicated for procedures involving aerosolization such as suctioning and chest physiotherapy. The use of nebulizers in the general ward was prohibited. Surgical procedures were carried out in a specially designated operating theatre.","In the event of overwhelming circumstances due to patient numbers, and staff, bed, and resource scarcity, we need to fall back to trauma training and the scenarios of mass casualty. Recovery rooms may be used for patient bedding, pre-operative areas can be used for staff berthing, and each OR, equipped with its own medical gas, suction, and ventilator, is a potential ICU bed. Many types of PPE, particularly N95 respirators and surgical masks, can and should be worn for the duration of your shift and reused after appropriate cleaning for multiple days, if not overtly soiled. (3) Critical to avoiding being overwhelmed is proper triage. Patients who can go home should never be admitted. Under dire circumstances, the most difficult decision may be labeling a living patient (likely critically ill or with major comorbidities) moribund, and moving on to the next patient with a greater chance of survival.","The first line of defense that could be used to lower the risk of infection is through wearing face masks; both the use of surgical masks and N95 respirator masks (series # 1860s) helps control the spread of viruses 116. Surgical face masks prevent liquid droplets from a potentially infected individual from traveling through the air or sticking onto surfaces of materials, where they could be passed on to others 117. However, only N95 (series # 1860s) masks can protect against the inhalation of virions as small as 10 to 80 nm, with only 5% of the virions being able to penetrate completely; SARS-CoV-2 is similar to SARS-CoV in size and both are approximately 85 nm 117. Since particles can penetrate even five surgical masks stacked together, health-care providers in direct contact with patients must wear N95 (series # 1860s) masks but not surgical masks 118.","These conflicting policies may cause confusion for hospital managers, nurses and other health workers. Conflicting guidelines have resulted in a large amount of online debate between infectious disease providers and infection prevention control experts about what approaches should be adopted. History is repeating itself with the same controversies around powered air purifying respirators during the The only similarity is that all health organisations and countries generally recommend the use of masks by suspected or infected cases of COVID-19 (i.e. source control) to prevent spread of infections. They simultaneously state that community use of masks has no benefit. Yet there are more randomised controlled clinical https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijnurstu.2020.103567 0020-7489/\u00a9 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. trials (RCTs) supporting the use of masks in the community than for source control. The community trials show a benefit of face masks with or without hand hygiene, conditional on compliance ( Simmerman et al., 2011 ; Aiello et al., 2012 ; Aiello et al., 2010 b; Suess et al., 2012 ; MacIntyre et al., 2009 ; Cowling et al., 2009 ). There are only two RCTs of clinical efficacy of source control ( Canini et al., 2010 ; MacIntyre et al., 2016 ) , and one small experimental RCT of 9 subjects ( Johnson et al., 2009 ). These suggest a benefit, but larger trials are needed.","Reprocessing of used N95 respirators may ameliorate supply chain constraints during the COVID-19 pandemic and provide a higher filtration crisis alternative. The FDA Medical Countermeasures Initiative previously funded a study of HP vapor decontamination of respirators using a Clarus C system (Bioquell, Horsham, PA) which normally is used to fumigate hospital rooms. The process preserved respirator function, but it is unknown if HP vapor would be virucidal since respirators have porous fabric that may harbor virus.","1 0 productivity, import, storage, and need. Relevant information was limited at the time when the analyses were performed (during the outbreak). Second, we did not take into account the logistics cost that could restrict the supplies on the markets. Thus, our analysis is likely to underestimate the severity of the facemask shortage experiencing by the healthcare workers and the general population. Third, we didn't consider the types of facemasks that should be used by individuals at different risk levels 29 . The situation of facemasks shortage might be more severe when considering the demand for different types of facemasks from healthcare workers (most required KN95/N95 respirators and medical protective masks) and the general population 29 . Fourth, our prediction ended in late-April considering the epidemic was predicted to fade out at about the same time 30 . However, if the transmissibility of the epidemic could be reduced, the peak and the end would be delayed 31 , the daily incidence and the demand for facemasks and other medical supplies would also decrease. Nevertheless, the anxiety in the population may result in constant demand for facemasks even when the epidemic is under controlled.","Although there is no current consensus on the amount of UV radiation required to inactivate SARS-CoV-2, the single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) virus that causes COVID-19, the UV dose required to inactivate 90% of ssRNA viruses is an estimated 1.32 \u2212 3.20 mJ cm \u22122 . 2 Similar methods using 254 nm UV-C light have been investigated with SARS-CoV-1. 11 A group at the University of Nebraska Medical Center recently developed a protocol to sterilize N95 respirators using UVGI. 12 Specifically, they subjected used N95s to 60 mJ cm \u22122 of UV-C radiation (254 nm)-which exceeded the estimated sterilization dose of 2-5 mJ cm \u22122 for single-stranded RNA by several-fold-by stringing them across a room containing two UVGI towers on either side. The UVGI doses were remotely monitored using a UV meter to ensure proper sterilization. 12 Unfortunately, not all hospitals are equipped to set up dedicated rooms for decontamination or possess the specialized UVGI towers that are outlined by Lowe et al. 12 On the other hand, many university-affiliated hospitals and higher academic laboratories have access to biosafety cabinets (BSCs) that are regularly used in research to sterilize laboratory equipment via UV-C light. Due to current social distancing and quarantine measures, there likely exist a substantial number of BSCs that are not currently in use and therefore may be available to be temporarily repurposed for N95 respirator, or other PPE decontamination. A previous study found that UVGI treatment of FFRs in BSCs had no effect on the filter aerosol penetration, filter airflow resistance, or physical appearance of the masks. 5 Additionally, the efficacy of BSC UVGI for achieving complete decontamination of FFRs has previously been validated for influenza virus. 13 ","Various sterilization methods (e.g., ethylene oxide, formalin, UV, bleach, hydrogen peroxide) have been tested to recycle respirators. However, the drawbacks of each method, such as performance deterioration and generation of toxic residues, have restricted their application. As an example, decontamination of N95 respirators by autoclave, 160 C dry heat, 70% isopropanol, and soap and water lowered the filtration efficiency [6] . Ethylene oxide treatment of respirators caused deposition of hazardous residues of 2-hydroxyethyl acetate on the straps, and bleach, oxidants, or dimethyldioxirane raised issues of sharp odor and incompatibility with staples/nosepiece [7] . Despite the need for further research, with safety as a preponderant concern, mask recyclability would be beneficial because it would reduce the amount of biohazardous waste and derived risks. In addition, reusability would naturally address a shortage of respirators during pandemics.","Patients with confirmed or suspected MERS-CoV infection should be cared under contact and droplet precautions until testing results. In accordance with WHO guidelines, a high protection mask (eg, N95 respirator) along with eye goggles, gowns, and gloves should be used during aerosol-generating procedures; the latter should be performed in an adequately ventilated room (minimum of 6-12 air changes per hour) (airborne infection isolation room). 37 For consistency with the recommendations during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, the United States CDC recommends the use of N95 respirators in all contacts with a laboratory-confirmed or suspected MERS-CoV infected case. 38 The rationale for this recommendation relies on the gaps of knowledge about the potential for airborne transmission of the novel coronavirus. However, N95 respirators are less tolerated by HCWs and are more expensive. 39 The United States CDC also recommends that patients with confirmed or suspected MERS-CoV infection are placed in an airborne infection isolation room. 38 HCWs with MERS-CoV infection should be strictly excluded from patient care, even with mild symptoms. The role of asymptomatic HCWs is under question. Overall, there is a need to increase infection control capacity in affected areas and areas at increased risk of being affected to prevent transmission in health care settings.","(iv) Difficulty in communicating. device-independent. In the case of a pandemic outbreak, time-consuming production and cost would be major limitations to respirator use. Although a certified respirator is recommended, considering the heavy use of surgical masks and scarcity of respirators, the technology should be easily extendable to masks and other existing infection control measures. Therefore, the aforementioned factors outline the considerations that can enhance respiratory protection for a timely emergency response.","Subsequently, the patient to be transferred back to an isolated room as an inpatient. During treatment, the patient and involved staff will need to don appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE). These may include N95 respirators, surgical masks and gloves depending on institutional policy, available resources and procedural risks. Appropriate high dusting cleaning of the linac room is done on completion of treatment. (Table 1) 1. Be proactive in anticipating and planning for the impact of COVID-19 2. Engage and coordinate with the parent institution in formulating policies for identifying patients at risk or who are already infected and contextualizing these to the department during implementation 3. Reduce clinical load where possible in anticipation of depletion of resources. This may involve temporarily reducing frequency of follow-up appointments, reducing fractionation schedules where possible, and considering alternative treatment modalities apart from radiotherapy that achieves the same therapeutic goals. 4. Employ staff segregation either spatially or temporally to reduce risk of the entire service succumbing to infection or quarantine. Special attention needs to be paid to \"bottleneck\" personnel (e.g. physicists) where redundancy cannot be built in. 5. Prepare for the possibility of a COVID-19 patient requiring treatment. Plan in advance which indications warrant emergency radiotherapy treatment when proven infectious or merely suspected, what personal protective equipment is required, and how to decontaminate the facility after treatment.","Even though the SARS outbreak is contained, we still use a \"fever tent\" with a self-contained radiographic unit in front of the ambulatory area, which is divided into a \"red\" area for febrile patients who have had contact with an infected person or a history of travel to SARS-affected areas and a \"green\" area for other patients. Staff at the hospital still use full personal protective equipment. Powered air-purifying respirators are still used for all intubations. One emergency department staff member had a mild seroconversion illness, but there were no clinical cases of SARS, confirming the observations of others that infection control can protect staff effectively (12, 13) . We initially had a no-visitor rule to the emergency department to prevent the spread of SARS to the community. This rule is currently limited to the critical and intermediate care areas; the few visitors to these areas are required to wear disposable gowns, N95 masks, and gloves. We also have an electronic surveillance system for all staff, patients, and visitors for contact tracing. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have issued new guidelines for responding to SARS, which are supported by our experience (14) . Emergency departments should design their own protocols for promptly isolating all patients with fever or respiratory tract symptoms during an epidemic. Concerns about a resurgence of SARS have let to continued screening and enhanced infection control precautions in previously affected areas, such as Singapore.","\uf0b7 Droplet/contact precautions should be used, including wearing a surgical mask with eye protection, a gown, and gloves. \uf0b7 Use of N95 respirators should be reserved for aerosol-generating procedures (e.g., intubation). \uf0b7 Unnecessary health care personnel in the room should be minimized. \uf0b7 It is advisable to limit the presence of symptomatic family and household contacts in the delivery suite and visitation should be permitted in accordance with locally developed infection prevention and control protocols. \uf0b7 Intrapartum fetal monitoring in the form of EFM should be considered given evidence showing fetal distress during labour. \uf0b7 Cesarean delivery should be reserved for obstetrical indications. \uf0b7 There is no data to indicate that the second stage of labour generates aerosols and, as such, droplet/contact precautions are sufficient for vaginal delivery. \uf0b7 Given that intubation is considered an aerosol-generating procedure, the surgical team should wear N95 respirators for cesarean delivery in case there is a need to convert from neuraxial to general anesthesia. \uf0b7 There is no evidence to avoid delayed cord clamping or to encourage early cleansing of the infant.","The main difference in masks and respirators is their intended use. Masks were originally designed to prevent spread of infections from wearers to other people around them, referred to as \"source control\". They are also used to protect from infections transmitted through the droplet mode and splashes or sprays of blood or body fluids. Disposable medical or surgical masks are common types of face masks used by both health workers and general public. In contrast to this, respirators are designed for respiratory protection. A medical or surgical mask may be enough to prevent droplet transfer, while a respirator is required for airborne infection. In terms of mask use, the physical barrier may also prevent contact transmission such as hand to face/mouth/nose. A respirator may provide protection against multiple modes of transmission, including droplet, airborne and hand-to-mouth/nose transmission. Whilst the relative contribution of each mode is difficult to quantify, clinically, the debate about the modes of transmission is academic if an intervention is shown to prevent infection.","1. Ensure performance of fit testing for N95 respiratory masks for all HCP. During the course of the outbreak, some masks may run out of stock and HCP will need to plan for alternatives. Protection, however, may be achievable even without N95 through the use of medical masks. 17 Note that as an AGP, endoscopy of PUI/COVID patients requires the use of respiratory protection. The powered air purifying respirator (PAPR) is a desirable alternative that does not require fit testing and can be used by employees with facial hair who would otherwise not achieve a good seal with the N95. Most units, however, are not stocked to have an adequate supply of PAPR.","Even in the current age, those performing and attending autopsies are at increased risk for tuberculous infection via aerosols produced during the procedure on a patient with tuberculosis. 14, [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] Other infections, including rabies, plague, legionellosis, meningococcemia, rickettsioses, coccidiomycosis, and anthrax, may also be acquired by aerosols such as those generated during an autopsy. 23 Thus it is clear that the utmost care must be taken to provide adequate protection against infective aerosols. For protection against diseases transmissible by aerosols, such as tuberculosis, N95 particulate masks (masks able to filter 1-\u00b5m particles in the unloaded state with a filter efficiency of 95%, given flow rates up to 50 L/min) or containment hoods or suits equipped with powered, airpurifying respirators with HEPA filters are used. Collecting body cavity fluids with a ladle or bulb syringe generates less aerosol than a hose aspirator connected to a sink faucet. Placing plastic bags over the head of the decedent during removal of the calvarium with a Stryker saw or saws equipped with HEPA filters within the vacuum system can also reduce the amount of aerosolization. Towfighi and colleagues designed a relatively simple tent-like experienced the milder irritative disorders following acute limited formaldehyde exposure, the incidence of most of the more severe reactions is extremely low. Nonetheless, the sensitivity of individuals is highly variable. Exposure studies performed in rats have shown that formaldehyde may induce nasal squamous cell carcinomas 27, 28 ; however, implications for humans are equivocal. Studies relating the rat and human data indicate that the carcinogenic risk for humans at relevant levels of formaldehyde exposure is minimal; further, it is likely that precautions effective against noncarcinogenic toxic effects of the chemical are sufficient to protect against its carcinogenic effects. 29 The autopsy suite should have sufficient ventilation and effective chemical fume hoods to reduce employee exposure to formaldehyde vapor. As mandated by the Occupational Health and Safety Administration (OSHA), employers must monitor formaldehyde levels in the workplace and maintain employee exposures below the legal safe limits. Institutions should provide a mandatory training program for all employees exposed to formaldehyde at or above 0.1 ppm on an 8-hour time-weighted average. Box 3-7 lists some important components of a safety training program for employees exposed to formaldehyde.","Given the ease of access to N95 masks during normal times, much remains unknown about the efficacy of various sterilization mechanisms on disposable masks since there is little impetus to reuse these masks outside of major disaster and pandemic events. Several methods of sterilizing N95 masks between uses are currently being studied across the world. The advantages of these methods and concerns regarding their use are summarized in Table 1 . Vaporized hydrogen peroxide and EtO treatments in particular are described in detail by Viscusi et al (2009) [2] ; UV treatment procedures are described in Darnell &amp; Taylor (2006) and Kumar et al (2015) [10] .","Fit-testing for respirator. Once medical clearance to wear a respirator is obtained, the employee may be fittested. Each employee is fit-tested for the appropriate respirator size and is provided training on how to put on, take off and how to clean the respirator. The effectiveness of a respirator will depend on a good mask-to-face seal, and OSHA requires that respirators be checked annually to determine that the fit remains acceptable. During the fitting session, employees are given several respirator options and are allowed to choose the option they prefer on the basis of comfort and adequacy of fit. Room for eye protection, to talk, and the position of the mask on the nose, face, and cheeks determine comfort. The fit of the respirator is determined by proper chin placement, adequate strap tension, fit across the bridge of the nose, ability to cover the distance from nose to chin, tendency to slip, and a seal check. 5 Not all employees will be able to wear the N95 particulate disposable respirator; therefore, they may need to be fitted with a powered air-purifying respirator. Employees may only wear the respirators for which they have been medically cleared and fit-tested. The N95 disposable particulate filter respirator should be disposed of after use.","Another concern of reusing N95 respirators is the UV-mediated degradation of polymers within the respirator.","We found that Bioquell HP vapor has high virucidal activity for N95 respirators inoculated with aerosolized virus.","9. Patients were required to wear surgical masks or N95 masks throughout the hemodialysis treatment. No visitors were allowed. The staff members who conducted the dialysis treatments wore face shields, N95 face masks, eye shields, disposable gowns, caps, and gloves. In addition, chlorine disinfectants were used daily by staff to disinfect items and floors in the dialysis center. The circulating air UV air sterilizer disinfects 4 times a day for 2 hours each time."],"title":["Coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak: what the department of endoscopy should know","AGA Institute Rapid Recommendations for Gastrointestinal Procedures During the COVID-19 Pandemic","Respiratory Protection against Pandemic and Epidemic Diseases","Hydrogen Peroxide Vapor sterilization of N95 respirators for reuse","Rational use of face masks in the COVID-19 pandemic","A randomised controlled pilot study to compare filtration factor of a novel non-fit-tested high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filtering facemask with a fit-tested N95 mask","Preparedness among Ophthalmologists: During and Beyond the COVID-19 Pandemic","Policies on the use of respiratory protection for hospital health workers to protect from coronavirus disease (COVID-19)","AGA Institute Rapid Recommendations for Gastrointestinal Procedures During the COVID-19 Pandemic","Policies on the use of respiratory protection for hospital health workers to protect from coronavirus disease (COVID-19)","Respiratory Protection against Pandemic and Epidemic Diseases","Guidelines for preventing respiratory illness in older adults aged 60 years and above living in long-term care: A rapid review of clinical practice guidelines","Policies on the use of respiratory protection for hospital health workers to protect from coronavirus disease (COVID-19)","Policies on the use of respiratory protection for hospital health workers to protect from coronavirus disease (COVID-19)","How Should U.S. Hospitals Prepare for Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)?","Mechanical Ventilation in an Airborne Epidemic","Epidemiology, causes, clinical manifestation and diagnosis, prevention and control of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) during the early outbreak period: a scoping review","Respiratory Protection against Pandemic and Epidemic Diseases","Hydrogen Peroxide Vapor sterilization of N95 respirators for reuse","Respiratory Protection against Pandemic and Epidemic Diseases","International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC): General Guidance for the Management of the Dead Related to COVID-19","Critical care management of adults with community-acquired severe respiratory viral infection","UV Sterilization of Personal Protective Equipment with Idle Laboratory Biosafety Cabinets During the Covid-19 Pandemic","Association between 2019-nCoV transmission and N95 respirator use","Initial rapid and proactive response for the COVID-19 outbreak \u2014 Taiwan's experience","Respiratory protection for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)","The Impact of COVID-19 on Radiation Oncology Clinics and Cancer Patients in the U.S.","I.
