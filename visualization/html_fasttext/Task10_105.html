The HBM was originally developed to study why patients may not seek screening for tuberculosis, 7 and is one of the most prominent public health frameworks for understanding why individuals may or may not act in the face of a threat to personal or community health. The HBM has been used for decades to study vaccination, medication adherence, diabetes self-care, condom use, and other behaviors that require modification of a patient's actions to mitigate a threat to health. 8, 9 Like many public health behavior models, the HBM studies behavior at an individual and community level by conceptualizing the determinants of behavior into several contributing factors called constructs. The HBM has evolved over time and many modified forms are present in literature; this article will operationalize the HBM as pictured in Figure 1 , adapted from Champion and Skinner. 7 Broadly, the HBM suggests that individual beliefs and direct cues to action inform behavior.In turn, beliefs are informed by one's background and are comprised ofone's impression of the perceived threat, the perceived benefits to taking action, the perceived barriers to taking action, and one's perceived ability to take action (i.e., perceived self-efficacy). The purpose of this article is to explain how community pharmacist can use the constructs of the HBM as a communication guide to move patients toward behaviors that will limit the spread of COVID-19.","WHO is monitoring the fast-evolving situation of the COVID-19 epidemic and needs to advise the countries in the malaria-endemic regions on how to establish and effectively execute public health policies. Preventive measures for COVID-19, including case and contact tracing, quarantine and screening, as well as education to encourage good hand hygiene practices, should be in place. Additional and pre-emptive measures must be taken for malaria control in these countries, anticipating the potential challenge that would be faced by the public health system during an outbreak of COVID-19. In the case of Ebola, it was estimated that malaria cases in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone could have increased by up to 1 million in 2014 as a result of a cessation of distribution of insecticide-treated bednets (ITNs). 10 Governments and health leaders in malaria-endemic regions must ensure that such stresses to medical infrastructure are minimised in the event of an outbreak of COVID-19. Resource allocation should be optimised whenever possible to ensure minimal disruption to malaria control should COVID-19 management become necessary. Management of medical supplies and stockpiling of surgical masks and other protective equipment should be done in advance and medical staff should be adequately trained in their use. In cases of emergency, mass drug administration and the distribution of ITNs might be considered for short-term malaria relief in hyperendemic areas. Such measures would also aid efforts in COVID-19 management by reducing the strain on medical resources and minimising confounding factors in diagnosis. Previous successful implementation of such measures occurred during Ebola outbreaks in Sierra Leone in 2014-15 and in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in 2018, in accordance with WHO guidelines. 11, 12 In malaria-endemic regions, malaria diagnostics should be systematically added to fever management, including for suspected cases of COVID-19, and health-care facilities should be well stocked with artemisinin combination therapy drugs. Infection management protocols, such as social distancing, mask-wearing, and prompt seeking of diagnostic testing and necessary treatment, should be communicated in advance. These measures will require collective political will and unity in a coordinated effort by African countries.","The first challenge is that incentives across the analytical pipeline are misaligned. 2 Academics are largely incentivised to write scientific articles and to fund their work through individually led grants. These activities are not conducive to the rapid response to a crisis (although many academics do respond), or to sustained engagement and training of corporate and government teams. Companies are incentivised by profit, and are rightly beholden to national regulatory frameworks and the public with respect to the data they collect. Ministries of health have complex relationships with both the companies that have access to personal data and with the public. They face many competing health priorities and complex political choices when it comes to open sharing of epidemiological data. Disease control programmes are often hampered by limited capacity and high turnover of personnel, and health workers on the ground during an epidemic have their hands full responding to the immediate crisis and might not be trained or incentivised to report epidemiological data accurately. Taken together, these incentive structures create multiple barriers to rapid data generation and the development of streamlined epidemic forecasting systems that use these new data types.","quarantine (13.8%, n = 550) expressed an unwillingness to seek hospital treatment. 25 Similarly, being under quarantine (OR = 2.36, 95% CI 1.80 to 3.09) and having a high 26 institutional trust score (OR = 2.20, 95% CI 1.96 to 2.49) were two strong significant 27 determinants of hospital treatment-seeking. 28 Interpretation The results of this study suggest that institutional trust is an important 29 factor influencing adequate preventive behavior and seeking formal medical care 30 during an outbreak. In view of the 2019-nCoV being highly pathogenic and extremely 31 contagious, our findings also underscore the importance of public health intervention 32 to reach individuals with poor adherence to preventive measures and who are reluctant 33 to seek treatment at formal health services. We searched PubMed on January 28, 2020, for articles that describe the trust, 48 preventive practices and health-seeking behaviors related to the 2019 novel coronavirus 49 (2019-nCoV) in China, using the search terms \"novel coronavirus,\" \"institutional trust,\" 50 \"behavioral change,\" \"protective behaviors,\" and \"treatment-seeking\" with no The questionnaire was developed in English and translated into Chinese.

Smith et al., Lempel, Epstein, and Hammond, and Adda analyze the economic impacts of school closures. 1, 6, 7 Schooling is one of the most important investments we make in our children's futures, and we do not have good estimates of how prolonged school closures influence drop-out rates and future earnings. This uncertainty makes a holistic assessment of tradeoffs challenging.","Although we also coded implementation dates for each of these policies, our focus is on the dates policies were announced, for two reasons. First, we expect much of the effect of these emergency measures on social behavior to be immediate. The state's power to compel socially responsible behavior is often said to act through \"quasi-voluntary compliance,\" in which most citizens choose pro-social behaviors given a cue from the state that is backed with the threat of sanction. (21) This effect should be all the stronger to the extent people treat costly social distancing measures as a credible signal of the viral threat. Second, our focus is on predicting the timing of governor's actions, which naturally points to announcement dates, rather than implementation dates which may be delayed (in the case of school closures, for example), by weekends and spring breaks. Figure 1 displays the timing of different states' adoptions of these five social distancing policies over the four-week study period. No state acted before 10 March, a full thirteen days after the first report of community transmission, yet by 15 March, uptake was rapid across states. In general, states typically started social distancing through recommendations or restrictions on public gatherings, then turned to restrictions on schools 2 We include recommendations in this category for two reasons: first, this was often the first action states took, and early actors did not always revisit these policies with a restrictive mandate; second, the target of these measures was typically large events that would be unlikely to maintain viable attendance under the cloud of a state recommendation to cancel events.","Our findings suggest that effective isolation measures as early as possible are crucial for affected regions. Based on our model, the future trend of the epidemic highly depends on when and how the measures will be adopted. Effective interventions include limiting population mobility (e.g. cancellation of mass gathering, school closures and work-from-home arrangements) and public education (e.g. use of face masks and improved personal hygiene) (1).","COVID-19 presents a unique challenge to public health. Effective mitigation of the disease will require nontrivial efforts from a significant fraction of the world population, including social distancing and avoiding unnecessary interactions with others. No matter how stringently these measures are recommended, a fraction of people may not believe that they can or should act in ways that will limit the threat. The HBM is a model that has been used to study behaviors related to preventing or mitigating disease. It conceptualizes beliefs about disease as being comprised of the perception of the threat as severe and relevant, the perception of benefits of and barriers to acting, and the perception of one's intrinsic ability to act. As trusted, community-facing healthcare professionals, pharmacists are uniquely suited to bring about change in patient behaviors.Community pharmacists using HBM to reinforce COVID-19 mitigation behaviors should appropriately emphasize the severity and susceptibility of the threat, emphasize barriers to acting, help patients identify ways to overcome barriers to acting, and reinforce self-efficacy beliefs.","Human health cross-cuts all the global frameworks. The SFDRR explicitly includes epidemics and pandemics among biological hazards (UNISDR, 2015) [1] [2] [3] . Moreover, SDG 3 is devoted to \"good health and well-being\", with an emphasis on \"early warning, risk reduction and management of national and global health risks\" (UN, 2015) . For its part, the Paris Agreement and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Assessment Report highlights that climate change exacerbates health risks including pandemics (see e.g. [4, 5] ). The recently edited book by Chan and Shaw [6] on Public Health and Disasters is timely since it highlights the progress and importance of the Health-EDRM framework adopted by the WHO in 2019. Health-EDRM refers to the \"systematic analysis and management of health risks, posed by emergencies and disasters, through a combination of (1) hazard and vulnerability reduction to prevent and mitigate risks, (2) preparedness, (3) response and (4) recovery measures\" (WHO 2019). Health-EDRM is thus an umbrella term, which the WHO uses to refer to the broad intersection of health and disaster risk management (DRM). It also comprises such areas as emergency and disaster medicine, bolstered health systems and resilience, disaster risk reduction, humanitarian response, and community health resilience [7] .","We evaluated the risk of MERS exportation worldwide integrating seasonal air traffic flows and time-varying incidence of cases in the affected area, and accounting for under-reporting of cases. We conducted a comprehensive analysis of all reported MERS imported cases to validate modelled importation risk and assess onward transmission. Our findings confirm the critical role of air travel in the risk of international dissemination. In case of MERS introduction, prompt identification of the infection in patients seeking medical attention, strict infection control measures, and effective isolation of the patient in the nosocomial setting are key to efficient prevention and control of the outbreak. Increasing awareness at collective and public health levels worldwide is found to be associated with higher local preparedness, prompter and strengthened precautionary measures and isolation procedures to prevent further spread. Our findings provide a quantitative assessment for public heath authorities to face the variability associated to importation risk and potential for local transmission, to inform preparedness plans, and identify the critical measures that should be considered to reduce the likelihood of future outbreaks.","As the situation continues to develop over days and weeks instead of months and years, community pharmacists are unlikely to have a ready-made and field-testedcommunication toolkit regarding COVID-19 until after the time to act has passed. In situations such as these, evidence-based public health frameworks can provide a useful temporary measure in much the same way that prescribers may rely on data from small, open label trials until data from higher-quality trials are available. These public health frameworks can act as a \"checklist\" that pharmacists and other healthcare professionals can use to guide their communication and reinforce healthy behaviors.","Increased news coverage and awareness of the virus in the general population have already likely prompted increased rates of seeking medical care for respiratory symptoms. In addition, awareness among healthcare providers, public health officials and the availability of viral identification assays suggest that capacity for identifying previously missed infections has increased. Further, general population and government response efforts have increased the use of face masks, restricted travel, delayed school reopening and isolated suspected persons, all of which could additionally slow the spread of COVID-19.","Notwithstanding the availability of evidence to support many public health measures, it should be remembered that many are intuitive for governments to apply although, with the exception of respiratory hygiene and hand washing, few are without substantial economic costs or consequences [26 ] . These secondary effects can be considerable, for example in the case of severe international travel restrictions (leading to economic losses) and school closures (leading to increased parental workplace absenteeism). The emerging thinking after the 2009-10 pandemic has therefore tended to be about recognising the proportionality of public health measures in relation to the severity of the threat. Put simply, severe public health measures would be more justifiable and better understood by the public for an A(H5N1) or SARS-CoV scenario than for a mild A(H1N1)pdm09-like one.","This study is the first to investigate the use of isolation for individuals with COVID-19 and quarantine of family members, school closures, and workplace distancing as interventions for the immediate control of COVID-19 in the event of secondary local transmission using a simulation model. We found that a combined approach (incorporating quarantine, school closures, and workplace distancing) could prevent a national outbreak at low levels of infectivity and reduce the number of total infections considerably at higher levels of infectivity. Such control measures should be deployed in countries outside of China with evidence of imported cases and evidence of local transmission.","Discrete-choice experiments can inform policy makers as to how much support there would be for potentially disruptive measures such as quarantine, isolation and school closures, and what kind of public health information might garner support from those otherwise not in favour. In Singapore, given our findings, this might involve stressing the necessity of such measures to reduce mortality, to co-opt the mortality-averse group, and to minimise the economic impact, to gain support from the sizeable tax-averse group. Studies such as this one can also identify misperceptions among the public that may hinder support for effective control. Two such examples surfaced in our study: (1) temperature screening island-wide received considerable support by our survey participants, although temperature screening at the country\u2019s main airport was estimated only to pick up around one imported case in four in 2009,28 and was increasingly ineffective as the infection became more widespread,57 and (2) the predicted risk of infectious disease outbreaks was considerably underestimated: 2013 saw \u223c 20 000 dengue infections in Singapore, but the mean forecast risk of an outbreak infecting at least 200 people was a mere 29%. Future studies might evaluate the effect of priming respondents with accurate public health information before eliciting their preferences. We included interventions that would be considered for use in response to an emerging infectious disease, and so did not consider vaccination given the lead time needed to develop a vaccine. For many vaccine-preventable infections, however, decisions about whether to be vaccinated are made by the individual, rather than by the government, and so alternative study designs might be better suited to determining features that lead to vaccine uptake and support, such as standard cross-sectional surveys.58 Ethical issues regarding loss of liberty during an outbreak were not covered in our experiment, and should be explored in future studies, together with more contextual information on why policies were favoured or not.59 ","A principal lesson learned from the Beijing experience is the importance of rapid response to SARS. Early detection of patients and prompt isolation can limit transmission, and adherence to personal and administrative infection control measures can reduce opportunities for transmission within healthcare facilities. The resources needed to respond to simultaneous outbreaks in multiple hospitals and address community transmission are much greater than those required for individual case investigation or management. Communities seeking to prepare for SARS must be alert to the speed with which one imported case can lead to dozens or hundreds of transmission chains. Thus a strong system of early detection and open communication will facilitate prompt recognition of possible problems and immediate response measures. Addressing community concerns, including fear of attending fever clinics or stigma associated with having one\u2019s neighborhood quarantined, should be an important component of planning efforts.","Excessive prevention and control will inevitably bring negative effects. Severe traffic control completely blocked the flow of people and materials, which to some extent made it difficult for the timely replenishment of basic living needs. Social distancing measures such as closing communities and public places inevitably exacerbated the panic among the people and adversely affected the development of their mental health. Therefore, when actively taking prevention and control measures, we must also fully consider the possible negative impacts, reasonably grasp the implementation of the measures, and take supporting remedial measures to minimize the side effects of epidemic prevention and control.","Nonetheless, public access to timely and authentic information concerning health emergency situations like the COVID-19 outbreak is vital. Otherwise, people may be misled by a plethora of false information being disseminated through different channels, possibly leading to fear and distress. There are signs of public panic such as the bulk buying of face masks and hand sanitisers leading to empty shelves in supermarkets in some towns and cities. Restoring the confidence of the general public in public health measures is crucial, otherwise public fear and apprehension might limit the local, national, regional and international efforts and measures aimed at tackling the COVID-19 outbreak.","Since the IHR came into force in 2007, countries have made substantial efforts to strengthen their capacities to prevent, detect, and respond to public health emergencies. 8 Countries have been enhancing preparedness through the implementation and regular assessment of IHR national capacities to mitigate the effect of public health emergencies, including the emer gence of a novel pathogen. 9, 10 Increased understanding of the capacities that countries have to prevent, detect, and respond to public health events has been made possible through the introduction of the WHO IHR monitoring and evaluation framework and application of the framework's components including the State Party annual reporting (SPAR) process and voluntary external evaluation using the Joint External Evaluation tools, after-action reviews, and simulation exercises. 11 The results of these assessments are used to develop national action plans to strengthen IHR capacities for health security. WHO bench marks for IHR capacities include corresponding actions that can increase a country's emergency preparedness, and are used to strengthen a country's emergency preparedness and health security. 12 We analysed the 2018 SPAR submissions of 182 countries to review health security capacities in light of the COVID-19 outbreak and iden tified opportunities for further strengthening of IHR implementation. 13, 14 ","COVID-19 is emerging all over the world and spreading at an unprecedented rate, resulting in significant impacts on global economies and public health. The present study successfully and systematically evaluated the prognostic predictors of COVID-19 by collecting published information on risk factors of the outcomes related to SARS-CoV-2","The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is Second, our results suggest that more responsive behavioral changes observed in this study were associated with the strong involvement from the Chinese government during the control and prevention of coronavirus than voluntary avoidance behaviors reported previously. 5,9,26,27, Measures such as temporary closing down public transportation in Wuhan and imposing punishment for passengers not wearing a face mask on metro in Shanghai have fueled the high compliance rates with government recommendations (Table S1 ) and perceived efficacy of these behaviors (Table S4 ). These polices are also responsible for the limited observed heterogeneity in uptake and changes of precautionary behaviors. For example, we find that no perception variables exerted a statistically meaningful effect on increased face mask wearing frequency (Table S3) .","To deal with the 2019-nCoV epidemic, the central and local governments of China took a series of drastic measures. First of all, Chinese health authorities conducted an immediate investigation to characterize and control the disease, including isolation of suspected patients, monitoring of contact clinical status of patients, and developing diagnostic and treatment procedures [5] . In addition, on January 23, 2020, the local government of Wuhan announced the suspension of public transportation, closing airports, railway stations, and highways in the city, in order to prevent further disease transmission [10] . Subsequently, most provinces in China claimed \"Level I Emergency Response\" by taking a series of measures such as suspending public transportation and setting up community quarantines. Particularly, the list of the first-level designated hospitals was announced, and epidemic prevention training for primary medical staff was started. Since fever is one of typical clinical symptoms of the infection, temperature detection of incoming and outgoing personnel was implemented comprehensively in railway stations, passenger stations and other public places, in order to screen suspected cases as early as possible. In addition, many other compulsory measures limiting population mobility, such as cancellation of mass gatherings, school closures, work-from-home arrangements, was taken to reduce withinpopulation contact rates.","Further research should investigate whether child care subsidies for healthcare workers would reduce absenteeism in the event of school closures from a pandemic. Additionally, research efforts should identify how school closures in pandemics impact more vulnerable populations for whom robust data does not currently exist. Further research efforts should also be placed to determine the effect of school closures on the absenteeism of other kinds of essential workers, instead of just healthcare workers.","Children have special needs and vulnerabilities that should be considered when preparing for travel abroad, and all children should have a pretravel health assessment performed. Depending on the destination and the vaccinations needed, this assessment should be conducted up to 6 months before travel. The pretravel assessment should include an evaluation of the child's medical history and immunization status, as well as a detailed review of the trip itinerary, including travel destinations, planned activities, type of accommodations (eg, hotel chains, residing with local families, camping), extent of contact with the local populations, and exposure to animals. Special consideration should be given to children who have chronic diseases, such as diabetes, cardiac abnormalities, or immunocompromising conditions, in terms of vaccine recommendations and travel risks and precautions. Parents should be advised to carry a summary of their child's medical history, treatment record, and all required prescription medications. During the assessment, the caregiver should ensure the following: 1) the child has received up-to-date and appropriate vaccinations (both routine and special travel-related vaccines); 2) the child has received appropriate malaria and other chemoprophylaxis regimens tailored for use in pediatric travelers; 3) prevention counseling, particularly in the areas of insect barriers, food and water safety, and injury avoidance, has been given; and 4) anticipatory guidance for managing potential illnesses (eg, diarrhea and dehydration) and seeking medical resources overseas has been provided.","Evidence before this study Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in Wuhan, China in late 2019. In mid-January, 2020, schools and workplaces closed as part of the Lunar New Year holidays. These closures were then extended to prevent SARS-CoV-2 spread. The intended effect of such physical distancing measures was to reduce person-to-person contact, which spreads infectious diseases. Epidemic parameters, such as time-dependent reproduction numbers governing SARS-CoV-2 transmission in Wuhan, have been estimated based on local and internationally exported cases. The frequency of contacts in different age groups and locations (schools, workplaces, households, and others) in China has also been previously estimated. We searched PubMed and medRxiv for studies published in English up to March 7, 2020, with the terms \"coronavirus AND (school OR work) AND (Wuhan OR Hubei)\" and identified 108 and 130 results, respectively. However, to our knowledge, no published article has reported use of location-specific transmission models that consider the impacts of school or workplace closures to study the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in Wuhan.","Patients with COVID-19 were interviewed by public health officials to collect information on demographics, exposures, travel history, and symptoms, including signs or symptoms before presentation. For all twelve patients, available medical records were reviewed. For hospitalized patients, clinicians systematically abstracted clinical data from the medical record.","Rapid emergence Unpredictability of timing and duration Unpredictability of epicentre Rapid global spread, once person-to-person transmission is established Impact on health systems Wider impacts on society if severe in nature In the broadest sense and from a public health perspective, 'intervention' strategies therefore encompass measures aimed at early detection as well as treatment and prevention","Surgical masks have been in use for over 100 years as barriers against the development of infection via large droplets produced during surgery. N95 filtering facepiece respirators (N95 respirators) were introduced in 1995 as part of the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) 42 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 84 on non-powered air-purifying respirators (www.cdc. gov/niosh/npptl/topics/respirators/ pt84abs2.html). Currently, surgical masks and N95 respirators are the two main intervention measures for personal respiratory protection. Nonetheless, technical challenges exist, some of which are shared by both devices: (i) filtration efficiency, (ii) cross[ 1 0 9 _ T D $ D I F F ] -infection, (iii) recyclability, and (iv) faceseal.","An inclusive approach to refugee and migrant health that leaves no one behind during the COVID-19 pandemic should guide our public health efforts. As governments tighten border controls and implement other measures in response to COVID-19, they need to consider the impacts on refugees and migrants and ensure that such actions do not prevent people from accessing safety, health-care services, and information.","Finally, control strategies need to be evaluated for their effectiveness. For example, the effectiveness of the control strategy is a critical issue in evaluating ways to curb the HIV epidemic in the absence of vaccination. Evaluation of educational programs on preventing HIV infection or of HIV counseling and testing programs is essential in assessing the effectiveness of currently available strategies. Costeffectiveness models are often used in making recommendations for population-based vaccination programs. 122, 123 Primary, Secondary, and Tertiary Prevention Prevention strategies for infectious diseases can be characterized by the traditional concepts of primary, secondary, or tertiary prevention. 1 Primary prevention can be defined as the prevention of infection by personal and community-wide efforts. Secondary prevention includes measures available to individuals and the population for detection of early infection and effective intervention. Tertiary prevention consists of measures available to reduce or eliminate the long-term impairment and disabilities caused by infectious diseases.","Since the SARS outbreak, the WHO has declared five PHEIC. As a result of these events, significant investments have been made into public health and infection prevention programmes in many jurisdictions. Public health programmes coordinate rapid case finding, tracing of contacts of cases, and isolation measures to mitigate spread, and guide decision-making on broad public health measures, such as social distancing when required. Hospital infection prevention and control programmes aid with case identification through screening and testing, and they execute isolation infection prevention measures to ensure healthcare settings are safe from infection transmission. The latter is of utmost importance, as both the SARS and MERS viruses have disproportionately infected healthcare providers and healthcare settings have been hotspots of infection transmission.","Nineteen papers were included, eighteen of which used a cross-sectional design using questionnaires to assess difficulties during the school closures, activities outside the home during the closures and/or who provided childcare during the closures. The remaining paper used a qualitative design. The majority (n=10) were from the USA; four papers were from Australia, and the remaining papers from Argentina, Japan, Russia, Taiwan and the UK (one for each country). Most papers reported on school closures due to the H1N1 pandemic (n=11) or other influenza or influenza-like outbreaks (n=7); one paper reported on a school closed in preparation for a hurricane. The duration of school closures ranged from one day to two weeks. The size of the quantitative studies ranged from 35 households (representing 67 children) to 2,229 households (representing 4,171 children). Table 1 provides a summary of   activities outside the home found in the reviewed studies, while Table 2 summarises .

While extrinsic organizational, infrastructural and procedural conditions are enablers that can be put in place, the intrinsic state and well-being of the healthcare worker must also be addressed in order for him or her not to be the weakest link.","Person-to-person transmission is mostly driven by who interacts with whom, 9, 10 which can vary by age and location of the contact (ie, school, work, home, and community). Under the context of a large-scale ongoing outbreak, contact patterns would drastically shift from their baseline conditions. In the COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan, physical distancing measures, including but not limited to school and workplace closures and health promotions that encourage the general public to avoid crowded places, are designed to drastically shift social mixing patterns and are often used in epidemic settings. 4 Although contact patterns can be inferred from reported social contact data that include information on which setting the contact took place in, such studies are often focused on high-income countries, 11 or particular highdensity areas. 12 This limitation can be addressed by quantifying contact patterns in the home, school, work, and other locations across a range of countries based on available information from household-level data and local population demographic structures. 13 To examine how these changes in population mixing have affected the outbreak progression, we used synthetic location-specific contact patterns in Wuhan and adapted these in the presence of school closures, extended workplace closures, and reduction in mixing in the general community. Using these matrices and the latest estimates of the epidemiological parameters of the Wuhan outbreak, 1, 9, [14] [15] [16] we simulated the ongoing trajectory of an outbreak in Wuhan using an age-structured susceptibleexposed-infected-removed (SEIR) model 17, 18 for several physical distancing measures.","This study describes a mathematical model that quantifies the potential impacts of physical distancing policies, relying on Wuhan as a case study. Epidemiological investigations during the WHO-China Joint Mission on COVID-19 found many infections clustered around households. 34 Extreme physical distancing measures, including school closures, workplace closures, and avoidance of any public gatherings all at once can push the transmission to households, leading to increased clustering of household cases. 5 As households are not explicitly included in the model, we did not consider heterogeneity and clustering of household transmission. Distinguishing between repeated and new contacts is important for disease propagation in contact network models; 35,36 more sophisticated methods that account for temporal presence within the household 37 would be needed to characterise higher degrees of contact. Looking at limitations of our study, our compartmental model does not capture individual-level heterogeneity in contacts, which could be important in super-spreading events, particularly early in an epidemic. Combined with nosocomial infections, the risk of COVID-19 infection is potentially amplified with close contact between confirmed cases and health-care workers. However, the compartmental model we present is not equipped to explicitly consider transmission within health-care institutions and households. More complex models, such as individual-based models with familial and health-care structures, should be explored. No socomial infection risk among health-care workers and patients has been identified as a research gap to be prioritised in the next few months by WHO.","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has rapidly spread around the world [1] , posing enormous health, economic, and social challenges to societies. As there are no proven drug and vaccine treatments [2] , non-pharmaceutical measures are essential to slow the spread of the epidemic [3] . Social distancing (e.g., cancellation of large gathering, school closures) is an essential part of public health measure for infection control [3] . In line with this, many social events and activities have been cancelled or scaled-down in many countries including Japan, wherein there is already a high number of reported COVID-19 cases [1] .","Although the World Health Organization recommends that only positively-confirmed patients should wear medical masks to mitigate COVID-19 transmission, Vietnam is the first country to legalize the behaviors of using medical masks in public. It is not an optional choice anymore. Since this regulation becomes effective, the Vietnamese citizens have to self-protect by wearing medical masks in the public area. However, the use of medical masks as one of the prevention methods is still debatable. For example, Leung et al. (2020) suggested that there should have guidance for mass masking. However, WHO recommends that there exists a lack of evidence (WHO, 2020). Up to date, health authorities suggest social distancing, hand-washing, and so forth.","During rapidly evolving outbreaks, a lack of access to reliable local data can often limit response efforts. By combining travel surveillance with genomic epidemiology, we were able to reconstruct infectious disease outbreaks when local reporting was insufficient. This framework can be applied more generally to detect hidden outbreaks, and future applications may include the integration of empirical data on vector abundance and population immunity. By combining data and resources across multiple scales, we can thus develop surveillance frameworks to uncover epidemiological dynamics of emerging, re-emerging, and endemic infectious diseases across the world.","Contact tracing has been shown to be an efficient control measure when imported cases can be detected early on (14), in addition to permitting the estimation of key epidemiological parameters (11) . When the first cases reported in a new location are mostly deaths, however, our results suggest that the underlying size of the epidemic would make control via contact tracing extremely challenging. In such situations, efforts focusing on social distancing measures such as school closures and self-isolation may be more likely to mitigate epidemic spread.","The emergency pathogens could be counteracted by opting immediate and timely international collaborative efforts, cooperative efforts between human and animal health sectors. Other effective measures include One health approach, implementation of effective prevention and control strategies, rapid communication and networking, and exploring advances in science and technology for developing rapid and confirmatory diagnostics, enhancing disease surveillance and monitoring, implementation of strict biosecurity measures, and timely efforts toward designing appropriate and effective vaccines and therapeutics (Cheng et al. 2020; Cohen 2020; Cyranoski 2020; Lu 2020; Munjal et al. 2017; Singh et al. 2017).","Seven priority proposals can be outlined as follows: encourage research on the prediction, screening and early detection of new risks of infection; develop research and surveillance concerning transmission of pathogens between animals and humans, with their reinforcement in particular in intertropical areas (''hot-spots'') thanks to public support; pursue aid development and support in these areas of prevention and training for local health personnel, and to foster risk awareness in the population; ensure adapted patient care in order to promote adherence to treatment and to epidemic propagation reduction measures; develop greater sensitization and training among politicians and healthcare providers, in order to better prepare them to respond to new types of crises; modify the logic of governance, drawing from all available modes of communication and incorporating new information-sharing tools; develop economic research on the fight against EIDs, taking into account specific determining factors in order to create a balance between preventive and treatment approaches.","In the case of COVID-19 prevention behaviors, perceived barriers are likely to be profound in many cases. Manycultures are not configured to operate with minimal contact outside of the home for extended periods. In most industrial and post-industrialeconomies, people will likely need income to afford housing, food, and other essentials. Because of population density, people living in urban areas may find it difficult to practice effective social distancing when they must leave their residences. Additionally, some individuals may find the psychological distress that comes with spending more time away from others or the fear of the disease to be a barrier in its own right. Other individual factors may present special barriers, such as having to find appropriate childcare following school closings. Many of these barriers may be beyond the capacity of a community pharmacist to resolve in a brief encounter, but the pharmacist should be willing to work with and appropriately reassure a concerned patient as time constraints allow.","Although most secondary prevention strategies involve chemoprophylaxis (and, rarely, immunoprophylaxis), the concept can be broadened to other prevention efforts aimed at intervention and correction of a recognized specific health hazard. Most such efforts occur at the community level. Examples of community-based secondary prevention efforts include the early identification of contaminated products through outbreak investigations and subsequent removal of such products from the market to prevent additional illnesses and restore \"the community's health. \" A boil-water order for a waterborne disease outbreak of cryptosporidiosis is another example of a secondary prevention strategy aimed at correcting an existing community-wide problem.","The extension of non-medical prescribing rights to pharmacists is intended to enhance patient care in various ways, such as improving access to timely care and maximising use of health professionals' knowledge and skills, thereby improving the efficiency of healthcare delivery. 11, 21, 22 There is evidence to show that non-medical prescribers, such as pharmacists, are as effective as medical prescribers and can achieve comparable outcomes across a range of clinical measures (e.g. blood pressure control), medication adherence, health-related quality of life and patient satisfaction. 23 In countries where community pharmacists do not currently have prescribing rights, there are numerous challenges to overcome in expanding the scope of their current practice, including socio-political barriers and resourcing issues. 21 In such cases, extending prescribing rights for pharmacists may not be realistic or actionable in the midst of the current pandemic. However, there are other related activities that may be amenable to more immediate modifications in pharmacists' current working practices and help to reduce the burden on general practice. These include the dispensing of repeat prescriptions and emergency supplies of medications at the request of patients.","The connection between dam construction and schistosomiasis, a debilitating infection caused by a trematode parasite and hosted by several snail species, is well-documented (Hunter et al., 1993; Jobin, 1999). Ertan\u2019s completion was threatened when a live snail of a species known to carry schistosomiasis was discovered in the reservoir area 4 years before it was to be flooded. Three years later, after expensive efforts to survey vulnerable upstream areas, spray molluscicides, engineer snail-resistant water channels, and improve management of human and animal waste, the area was recertified snail-free. No outbreak of schistosomiasis has occurred to date (Gu et al., 2001), but other infections (such as HIV and other infectious diseases resulting from high-risk behaviors and vulnerability of populations affected by the dams), and general health effects (endemic diseases of poverty, despair, inadequate water supplies, poor sanitation, and malnutrition) remain undocumented and unaddressed (Sleigh and Jackson, 2001). The Ertan case exemplifies the limitations of studying through a single lens complex issues that, by their nature, transcend single disciplines, sectors, and/or diseases. The case provides an excellent opportunity to consider how a more holistic, more integrated health assessment could have been conducted\u2014one that would have recognized the social and ecological impacts of dams as drivers of EIDs and related determinants of health.","We have coded various policies that cancel events and large gatherings as such: any cancellations of professional sporting and other specific pre-scheduled events as the policy variable \" event_cancel .\" The \" no_gathering \" policy variable represents policy measures that banned all events or mass gatherings of a certain size, e.g. no gatherings of over 1,000 people. The \" social_distance \" policy variable includes measures preventing visits to elder care establishments, closures of public pools and tourist attractions, and teleworking plans for workers.","The SARS-CoV-2, a novel coronavirus, emerged in the City of Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, in early Person-to-person transmission is mostly driven by \"who interacts with whom\", 9,10 which can vary by age and location of the contact i.e., school, work, home, and community. Under the context of a largescale on-going outbreak, contact patterns would drastically shift from their baseline conditions. In the COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan, social distancing measures including but not limited to school and workplace closures and health promotions that encourage the general public to avoid crowded places are designed to drastically shift social mixing patterns and are often used in epidemic settings. 4 While contact patterns can be inferred from reported social contact data that include the information in which setting the contact took place, such studies are often focused on high-income countries, 11 or particular high-density areas. 12 Prem and colleagues 13 address that limitation by quantifying contact patterns in the home, school, work and other locations across a range of countries based on available information from household-level data and local population demographic structure.","Clinicians should be trained about how to prevent and treat respiratory infectious diseases. Due to the lack of protective equipment and awareness at the beginning of the epidemic, doctors were accidentally infected in Wuhan at the outset of the epidemic. Medical institutions should standardize the process of disinfection, isolation, and protection, reserve qualified and sufficient protective materials, such as disinfection products, medical surgical masks, medical protective masks, isolation gowns, and eye masks, to ensure the personal protection of medical personnel. Based on the strict implementation of standard prevention, medical institutions should strengthen measures to prevent and control viral transmission through contact, infected droplets, and airborne transmission. Wearing of masks and hand hygiene are key measures for infection prevention and control. 21","Our results provide detailed estimates that could help local communities prepare for the event of school closures during the COVID-19 pandemic, and potentially for future pandemics. Such preparations could help reduce preventable harm resulting from school closures.","Individual-, Institutional-, Community-, and Global-Based Strategies Disease prevention and control activities for infectious agents occur at four levels. The first level is targeted to the individual and is predominantly the domain of the clinician. A variety of prevention activities can be targeted to individuals through their primary care provider. Use of chemoprophylaxis to prevent surgical wound infections is an example of a control measure targeted to the individual. The second level is that of the institution, which is predominantly the domain of the infection-control practitioner or the school health official. This level includes health care facilities, nursing homes, other residential facilities, and schools. Programs to prevent the spread of bloodborne pathogens or tuberculosis to health care workers in hospitals are examples of control strategies targeted at the institutional level. The third level is targeted to the community in general and is predominantly the domain of public health agencies (at the local, state, and national levels). Removal of a contaminated food product from the market is an example of a control measure targeted to the community. The fourth level is related to global strategies. For a number of important pathogens, it has become clear that global control strategies are critical to have an impact on disease occurrence within the United States. The growing proportion of tuberculosis cases among refugees and immigrants to the United States and ongoing episodes of importation of measles from abroad are two examples pertinent to U.S. disease control in the early 21st century."],"title":["Community pharmacists and communication in the time of COVID-19: Applying the health belief model","Preparedness is essential for malaria-endemic regions during the COVID-19 pandemic","Improving epidemic surveillance and response: big data is dead, long live big data","The role of institutional trust in preventive and treatment-seeking behaviors during the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak among residents in Hubei, China","The Impact of School Closure for COVID-19 on the US Healthcare Workforce and the Net Mortality Effects","Pandemic Politics: Timing State-Level Social Distancing Responses to COVID-19","CoVID-19 in Japan: What could happen in the future?","Community pharmacists and communication in the time of COVID-19: Applying the health belief model","Building resilience against biological hazards and pandemics: COVID-19 and its implications for the Sendai Framework","Risk of MERS importation and onward transmission: a systematic review and analysis of cases reported to WHO","Community pharmacists and communication in the time of COVID-19: Applying the health belief model","Substantial undocumented infection facilitates the rapid dissemination of novel coronavirus (COVID-19)","Intervention strategies for emerging respiratory virus infections: policy and public health considerations","Interventions to mitigate early spread of SARS-CoV-2 in Singapore: a modelling study","Public preferences for interventions to prevent emerging infectious disease threats: a discrete choice experiment","Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, Beijing, 2003","Which Measures are Effective in Containing COVID-19?

The exponential increase of the confirmed number of cases of 2019n-CoV is of great concern to the global community. The fears and panic among residents in the epicenters have prompted diverse responses, which are understudied. During such a crisis, community trust and support for the government and health authorities are important to contain the outbreak. We aimed to investigate the influence of institutional trust on public responses to the 2019-nCoV outbreak. Methods An anonymous Internet-based, cross-sectional survey was administered on January 29, 2020. The study population comprised all residents currently residing or working in the province of Hubei, where Wuhan is the capital city. The level of trust in information provision and preventive instructions, individual preventive behaviors and treatment-seeking behaviors were queried. Findings The majority of ...","Background Emergency school closures are often used as public health interventions during infectious disease outbreaks in an attempt to minimise the spread of infection. However, if children continue to mix with others outside the home during the closures, these measures are unlikely to be effective. Objectives This review aimed to summarise existing literature on children's activities and contacts made outside the home during unplanned school closures. Methods We searched four databases from inception to February 2020 for relevant literature. Main findings were extracted. Results 3,343 citations were screened and 19 included in the review. Activities and social contacts appeared to decrease during closures but contact was still common. All studies reported children leaving the house or being looked after by non-household members. There was some evidence that older child age and parental disagreement with closure were predictive of children leaving the house, and mixed evidence regardi...","Abstract We present here the proceedings of the 5th seminar on emerging infectious diseases, held in Paris on March 22nd, 2016, with seven priority proposals that can be outlined as follows: encourage research on the prediction, screening and early detection of new risks of infection; develop research and surveillance concerning transmission of pathogens between animals and humans, with their reinforcement in particular in intertropical areas (\u201chot-spots\u201d) via public support; pursue aid development and support in these areas of prevention and training for local health personnel, and foster risk awareness in the population; ensure adapted patient care in order to promote adherence to treatment and to epidemic propagation reduction measures; develop greater awareness and better education among politicians and healthcare providers, in order to ensure more adapted response to new types of crises; modify the logic of governance, drawing from all available modes of communication and incorpor...","The legal behaviors in using medical masks in public have been finally promulgated by the Vietnamese Government after 47 days since the WHO declared the Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) due to the COVID-19 pandemic. From a sample of 345 Vietnamese respondents aged from 15 to 47 years, this brief note found that the risk perception of COVID-19 danger significantly increases the likelihood of wearing the medical masks. In addition, there is a weak evidence about the differences in age under the COVID-19 outbreaks. More noticeably, those who use masks before COVID-19 pandemic tend to maintain their behaviors. Our results offer the insightful into Vietnamese citizens responses in terms of using medical masks; even the uses of this method are still controversial. Our results are robust by performing Exploratory Factor Analysis for five features and further regressions.","BACKGROUND: Viral epidemics or pandemics of acute respiratory infections like influenza or severe acute respiratory syndrome pose a global threat. Antiviral drugs and vaccinations may be insufficient to prevent their spread. OBJECTIVES: To review the effectiveness of physical interventions to interrupt or reduce the spread of respiratory viruses. SEARCH METHODS: We searched The Cochrane Library, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2010, Issue 3), which includes the Acute Respiratory Infections Group's Specialised Register, MEDLINE (1966 to October 2010), OLDMEDLINE (1950 to 1965), EMBASE (1990 to October 2010), CINAHL (1982 to October 2010), LILACS (2008 to October 2010), Indian MEDLARS (2008 to October 2010) and IMSEAR (2008 to October 2010). SELECTION CRITERIA: In this update, two review authors independently applied the inclusion criteria to all identified and retrieved articles and extracted data. We scanned 3775 titles, excluded 3560 and retrieved full pape...","The review aims to examine the emergence and reemergence of infectious diseases in Jordan, in parallel with the Syrian refugee crisis. Qualitative approach has been adopted for systematically examining the outcomes of the Syrian crisis, which resulted in emerging and reemerging infectious diseases. It has adhered that infectious diseases, including measles, tuberculosis, and cutaneous leishmaniasis, have hazardous effects on Syrian refugees along with the local population in Jordan. The threat of major infectious diseases is higher and alarming in Jordan. National health policies should be implemented to adhere the influence of infectious diseases as well as to reduce the extent of infectious diseases in Jordan. In the 21st century, Syrian conflict can be deliberated as one of the biggest humanitarian disasters. In this multifaceted emergency with devastating requirements and limitations, it has been found essential for dominant medical healthcare providers to develop medical strategie...","","School closures have been enacted as a measure of mitigation during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic due to their ability to reduce transmission. It has been shown that school closures could cause absenteeism amongst healthcare workers with dependent children, but there is a need for detailed high-resolution analysis of the relationship between school closures and healthcare worker absenteeism to inform local community preparedness. We provide national- and county-level simulations of school closures and absenteeism across the United States. At the national level, we estimate the projected absenteeism rate to range from 7.5% to 8.6%, and the effectiveness of school closures to range from 172 to 218 fewer hospital beds used per 100,000 people at peak demand. At the county-level, we find substantial variations of projected absenteeism and school closure effects, ranging from 2.0% to 18.6% absenteeism and 88 to 280 fewer hospital beds used per 100,000 people at peak demand. We also find sign...","","Various epidemic prevention and control measures aimed at reducing person-to-person contact has paid a certain cost while controlling the epidemic. So accurate evaluation of these measures helps to maximize the effectiveness of prevention and control while minimizing social costs. In this paper, we develop the model in Dirk Brockmann and Dirk Helbing (2013) to theoretically explain the impact mechanism of traffic control and social distancing measures on the spread of the epidemic, and empirically tests the effect of the two measures in China at the present stage using econometric approach. We found that both traffic control and social distancing measures have played a very good role in controlling the development of the epidemic. Nationally, social distancing measures are better than traffic control measures; the two measures are complementary and their combined action will play a better epidemic prevention effect; Traffic control and social distancing do not work everywhere. Traffic ...","Public disclosure from Chinese local Health Commissions show that male and mid-aged index patients are the major source of virus from outside to the households. This implies that two important actions should be taken in disease control. First considers the kindergarten and school closure time. Local kindergarten and primary schools should postpone their admission and regular operation, to at least not earlier than local secondary schools. Second, workplace hygiene is of particular important in the next phase of disease control. As travel restrictions within China are being gradually lifted, we suggest that workplace hygiene should be taken serious care in the next month or two.","","In response to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak, the Chinese Government has ordered a nationwide school closure as an emergency measure to prevent spreading of the infection. Public activities are discouraged. The Ministry of Education estimates that more than 220 million children and adolescents are confined to their homes; this includes 180 million primary and secondary students and 47 million preschool children).1 Thanks to the strong administrative system in China, the emergency home schooling plan has been rigorously implemented.2 Massive efforts are being made by schools and teachers at all levels to create online courses and deliver them through TV broadcasts and the internet in record time. The new virtual semester has just started in many parts of the country, and various courses are offered online in a well organised manner. These actions are helping to alleviate many parents' concerns about their children's educational attainment by ensuring that school learn...","Abstract Individuals who visit community pharmacies are regarded as customers rather than patients. The public tends to view community pharmacists as businesspeople. Several factors influence individuals' willingness to patronize and to continue visiting such pharmacies. On the supply side, community pharmacists' responsibilities and duties center on the health and well-being of society. In this chapter, an assessment of community pharmacy practices in developing countries is particularly interesting in terms of medication dispensing and extended pharmacy services that promote public wellness. Community pharmacists in developing countries, who are supposedly strategically positioned in the community to provide public health, are not taking advantage on this opportunity. Although several studies have noted the services provided by community pharmacists, in general, the practice is far from meeting expectations due to several barriers. Pharmacists need to realize their opportunities and ...","An estimated 1.9 million children travel overseas annually. Infectious disease risks associated with international travel are diverse and depend on the destination, planned activities, and baseline medical history. Children have special needs and vulnerabilities that should be addressed when preparing for travel abroad. Children should have a pretravel health assessment that includes recommendations for both routine and special travel-related vaccination; malaria chemoprophylaxis, if indicated; and prevention counseling regarding insect and animal exposures, food and water safety, and avoiding injuries. Special consideration should be given to children with chronic diseases. Families should be given anticipatory guidance for management of potential illnesses and information about the location of medical resources overseas.","Unprecedented measures have been adopted to control the rapid spread of the ongoing COVID-19 epidemic in China. People's adherence to control measures is affected by their knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) towards COVID-19. In this study, we investigated Chinese residents' KAP towards COVID-19 during the rapid rise period of the outbreak. An online sample of Chinese residents was successfully recruited via the authors' networks with residents and popular media in Hubei, China. A self-developed online KAP questionnaire was completed by the participants. The knowledge questionnaire consisted of 12 questions regarding the clinical characteristics and prevention of COVID-19. Assessments on residents' attitudes and practices towards COVID-19 included questions on confidence in winning the battle against COVID-19 and wearing masks when going out in recent days. Among the survey completers (n=6910), 65.7% were women, 63.5% held a bachelor degree or above, and 56.2% engaged in mental l...","","Summary Background In December, 2019, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a novel coronavirus, emerged in Wuhan, China. Since then, the city of Wuhan has taken unprecedented measures in response to the outbreak, including extended school and workplace closures. We aimed to estimate the effects of physical distancing measures on the progression of the COVID-19 epidemic, hoping to provide some insights for the rest of the world. Methods To examine how changes in population mixing have affected outbreak progression in Wuhan, we used synthetic location-specific contact patterns in Wuhan and adapted these in the presence of school closures, extended workplace closures, and a reduction in mixing in the general community. Using these matrices and the latest estimates of the epidemiological parameters of the Wuhan outbreak, we simulated the ongoing trajectory of an outbreak in Wuhan using an age-structured susceptible-exposed-infected-removed (SEIR) model for several ...","Abstract The outbreak of a new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) in China since December 2019 has brought serious challenges to disease prevention and public health. Severe Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients who undergo cardiovascular surgery place extremely high demands for anesthesia and face high risks of mortality and morbidity. Based on the current understanding of COVID-19 and clinical characteristics of cardiovascular surgical patients, we provide anesthesia management guidelines for cardiovascular surgery during the prevention and control of COVID-19.","Social mixing patterns are crucial in driving transmission of infectious diseases and informing public health interventions to contain their spread. Age-specific social mixing is often inferred from surveys of self-recorded contacts which by design often have a very limited number of participants. In addition, such surveys are rare, so public health interventions are often evaluated by considering only one such study. Here we report detailed population contact patterns for United Kingdom based self-reported contact data from over 36,000 volunteers that participated in the massive citizen science project BBC Pandemic. The amount of data collected allows us generate fine-scale age-specific population contact matrices by context (home, work, school, other) and type (conversational or physical) of contact that took place. These matrices are highly relevant for informing prevention and control of new outbreaks, and evaluating strategies that reduce the amount of mixing in the population (su...","COVID-19 has spread with unequal efficiency in various parts of the world. In several European countries including Italy, the increase in the number of COVID-19 cases has followed a consistent, exponential pattern of spread. However, some countries, notably Taiwan and Hong Kong, have achieved a different outcome and have managed to bring the COVID-19 outbreak in their countries rapidly under control, without entering the exponential pattern and with very few cases. They have used several different approaches to COVID-19 outbreak control, including the innovative use of smartphone technology and the widespread use of surgical face masks. We show through our models, that Canada has followed the same, consistent COVID-19 exponential growth pattern that is seen in Italy. Both nationally and in its most heavily affected provinces, there is exponential growth of COVID-19 cases, making it possible to make predictions for the future, if no further interventions are made in public health policy...","Policies and public health efforts have not addressed the gendered impacts of disease outbreaks.1 The response to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) appears no different. We are not aware of any gender analysis of the outbreak by global health institutions or governments in affected countries or in preparedness phases. Recognising the extent to which disease outbreaks affect women and men differently is a fundamental step to understanding the primary and secondary effects of a health emergency on different individuals and communities, and for creating effective, equitable policies and interventions. Although sex-disaggregated data for COVID-19 show equal numbers of cases between men and women so far, there seem to be sex differences in mortality and vulnerability to the disease.2 Emerging evidence suggests that more men than women are dying, potentially due to sex-based immunological3 or gendered differences, such as patterns and prevalence of smoking.4 However, current sex-disaggrega...","Abstract The Internet of Things (IoT) includes three core procedures: full spectrum perception, reliable transmission, and intelligent processing. It can be applied for the prevention and control of SARI (severe acute respiratory infection). By combining sensors, information technology, artificial intelligence, and available dynamic networking devices, IoT could realize long-distance communication between hospitals, patients, and medical devices, which could ultimately improve current medical conditions.","","The number of confirmed COVID-19 cases admitted in hospitals is continuously increasing in the Philippines. Frontline health care workers are faced with imminent risks of getting infected. In this study, we formulate a theoretical model to calculate the risk of being infected in health care facilities considering the following factors: the average number of encounters with a suspected COVID-19 patient per hour; interaction time for each encounter; work shift duration or exposure time; crowd density, which may depend on the amount of space available in a given location; and availability and effectiveness of protective gears and facilities provided for the frontline health care workers. Based on the simulation results, we recommend the following: (i) decrease the rate of patient encounter per frontline health care worker, e.g., maximum of three encounters per hour in a 12-hour work shift duration; (ii) decrease the interaction time between the frontline health care worker and the patient...","Abstract On the Internet, there is a lot of open access information related to infectious diseases, e.g., official announcement, media news, bulletin boards, blogs, and other social media. If proper data retrieval and screening methods were applied on these Internet-based data, it would be very useful to improve the timeliness of early detection for infectious diseases. In China, we practice early warning using Internet-based data with routine intelligence screening assessment every day, and respond to any unusual event in a timely manner. Through this mechanism, the surveillance and early warning of Internet-based data for infectious disease and public health emergency plays an important supplemental role to the traditional surveillance systems.","Abstract The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) was first diagnosed in Wuhan, China in December 2019 and has now spread throughout the world, being verified by the World Health Organization as a Pandemic on March 11th. This had led to the calling of a national emergency on March 13th in the United States. Many hospitals, healthcare networks, and specifically Departments of Surgery are asking the same questions of how to cope and plan for surge capacity, personnel attrition, novel infrastructure utilization, and resource exhaustion. Herein, we present a tiered plan for surgical department planning based on incident command levels. This includes Acute Care Surgeon deployment (given their critical care training and vertically integrated position in the hospital), recommended infrastructure and transfer utilization, triage principles, and faculty, resident and advanced care practitioner deployment.","","Abstract The emergence of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic presents an unprecedented health communications challenge. Healthcare providers should reinforce behaviors that limit the spread of the pandemic, including social distancing and remaining in the home whenever possible. Formal communications toolkits may not be prepared in a timely fashion. Community pharmacists can reinforce mitigation behaviors by applying the health belief model (HBM). This commentary provides an overview of the HBM and offers suggestions on how community pharmacists can use it as a guide to patient communication in these uncertain contexts.","Human coronaviruses continue to pose a threat to human health. The emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in December 2019 which causes coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19), an acute respiratory disease marked the third introduction of a highly pathogenic coronavirus into the human population in the twenty-first century. This recent emergence of a previously unknown coronavirus in China leads to huge impacts on humans globally. Covid-19 is a challenge to global public health. Here, we discuss the COVID-19 outbreak in a one health context, highlighting the need for the implementation of one health measures and practices to improve human health and reduce the emergence of pandemic viruses.","Accreditation is an internationally recognised process through which healthcare organisations are able to improve the safety and quality of services delivered to patients. The focus of accreditation is to help organisations understand what they are doing well and what opportunities are available for improvement. The Canadian approach to accreditation is a rigorous peer review process comprised of a self-assessment against a set of standards, an on-site survey and follow-up action on recommendations that arise from the survey. The accreditation standards can be used effectively to guide the surgical teams in the transformation of the specialty. The 17 standards that are used to evaluate surgical teams relate to the activities that represent the continuum of clinical care as well as aspects related to learning. Within the subsections and standards are opportunities for surgeons and surgical teams to use the standards to effectively deliver services and to continuously improve patient car...","Abstract The pneumonia caused by novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) in Wuhan, China in December 2019 is a highly contagious disease. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared the ongoing outbreak as a global public health emergency. Currently, the research on novel coronavirus is still in the primary stage. Based on the current published evidence, we systematically summarizes the epidemiology, clinical characteristics, diagnosis, treatment and prevention of knowledge surrounding COVID-19. This review in the hope of helping the public effectively recognize and deal with the 2019 novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), and providing a reference for future studies.","SUMMARY: In global health, critical challenges have arisen from infectious diseases, including the emergence and reemergence of old and new infectious diseases. Emergence and reemergence are accelerated by rapid human development, including numerous changes in demographics, populations, and the environment. This has also led to zoonoses in the changing human-animal ecosystem, which are impacted by a growing globalized society where pathogens do not recognize geopolitical borders. Within this context, neglected tropical infectious diseases have historically lacked adequate attention in international public health efforts, leading to insufficient prevention and treatment options. This subset of 17 infectious tropical diseases disproportionately impacts the world's poorest, represents a significant and underappreciated global disease burden, and is a major barrier to development efforts to alleviate poverty and improve human health. Neglected tropical diseases that are also categorized as...","","","First, although COVID-19 is spread by the airborne route, air disinfection of cities and communities is not known to be effective for disease control and needs to be stopped. The widespread practice of spraying disinfectant and alcohol in the sky, on roads, vehicles, and personnel has no value; moreover, large quantities of alcohol and disinfectant are potentially harmful to humans and should be avoided.3 , 4 Second, in the use of personal protective equipment, we should try to distinguish different risk factors, adopt different epidemic prevention measures, and reduce the waste of personal protective equipment, as these resources are already in short supply. Although surgical masks are in widespread use by the general population, there is no evidence that these masks prevent the acquisition of COVID-19, although they might slightly reduce the spread from an infected patient. High-filtration masks such as N95 masks and protective clothing (goggles and gowns) should be used in hospitals...","This paper examines the role of various socioeconomic factors in mediating the local and cross-city transmissions of the novel coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) in China. We implement a machine learning approach to select instrumental variables that strongly predict virus transmission among the rich exogenous weather characteristics. Our 2SLS estimates show that the stringent quarantine, massive lockdown and other public health measures imposed in late January significantly reduced the transmission rate of COVID-19. By early February, the virus spread had been contained. While many socioeconomic factors mediate the virus spread, a robust government response since late January played a determinant role in the containment of the virus. We also demonstrate that the actual population flow from the outbreak source poses a higher risk to the destination than other factors such as geographic proximity and similarity in economic conditions.

Previously these viruses were known to be important agents of respiratory and enteric infections of domestic and companion animals and to cause approximately 15% of all cases of the common cold. This Review focuses on recent advances in our understanding of the mechanisms of coronavirus replication, interactions with the host immune response and disease pathogenesis and highlights the recent identification of numerous novel coronaviruses and the propensity of this virus family to cross species barriers.","Background Traditional infection control policies have focused on engineering controls, specific protocols, and personal protective equipment (PPE). In light of the variable success in protecting health care workers (HCWs) from Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2003, organizational and individual factors related to self-protective behavior in health care settings may also play an important role. Methods A critical review of the literature was conducted, directed at understanding what organizational and individual factors are important in protecting HCWs from infectious diseases at work. Results Organizational factors, such as a positive safety climate, have been associated with increased HCW adherence to universal precautions. There is some evidence that appropriate training of HCWs could be effective in changing HCW behavior if appropriate follow-up is applied. Very little research into these factors has been conducted with regard to preventing exposures to respiratory tract...","The novel coronavirus, COVID-19, has sparked an outflow of scientific research seeking to understand the virus, its spread, and best practices in prevention and treatment. If this international research effort is going to be as swift and effective as possible, it will need to rely on a principle of open science. When researchers share data, code, and software and generally make their work as transparent as possible, it allows other researchers to verify and expand upon their work. Furthermore, it allows public officials to make informed decisions. In this study, we analyzed 535 preprint articles related to COVID-19 for eight transparency criteria and recorded study location and funding information. We found that individual researchers have lined up to help during this crisis, quickly tackling important public health questions, often without funding or support from outside organizations. However, most authors could improve their data sharing and scientific reporting practices. The contr...","SummaryBackgroundThe 2019 new coronavirus, \u201c2019-nCoV\u201d, was discovered from Wuhan Viral Pneumonia cases in December 2019, and was named by the World Health Organization on January 12, 2020. In the early stage, people knows little about the 2019-nCoV virus was not clear, and the spread period was encountering China\u2019s annual spring migration, which made the epidemic spread rapidly from Wuhan to almost all provinces in China.MethodsThis study builds a SEIRD model that considers the movement of people across regions, revealing the effects of three measures on controlling the spread of the epidemic.Based on MATLAB R2017a, computational experiments were performed to simulate the epidemic prevention and control measures.FindingsThe research results show that current prevention and control measures in China are very necessary. This study further validates the concerns of international and domestic experts regarding asymptomatic transmission (E-status).InterpretationThe results of this study ar...","ABSTRACT Background Up-to-date studies are needed on the protection provided by face masks used by dentists. We assessed the relative filtering efficacy of two currently used surgical face masks (one a molded mask, the other a tie-on mask) and a certified personal particulate respirator, all made by a single manufacturer. Methods The authors sprayed bicarbonate particulate against a porcelain surface (representing the patient's mouth) and collected it via a mannequin head (representing the dentist's head) placed 40 centimeters away and a tube with two airflow rates (0.5 cubic meters per hour and 9 m3/hour). They calculated the dry residue weight. They performed three separate runs for each mask and three runs with no mask at the two airflow rates with and without aerosol. Results With no mask (control), the authors recorded significant weight gains at both airflow rates with and without vaporization. With vaporization, the three masks were associated with different dry residue weights ...","In an era of global health threats caused by epidemics of infectious diseases and rising multidrug resistance, microbiology laboratories provide essential scientific evidence for risk assessment, prevention, and control. Microbiology has been at the core of European infectious disease surveillance networks for decades. Since 2010, these networks have been coordinated by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC). Activities delivered in these networks include harmonization of laboratory diagnostic, antimicrobial susceptibility and molecular typing methods, multicentre method validation, technical capacity mapping, training of laboratory staff, and continuing quality assessment of laboratory testing. Cooperation among the European laboratory networks in the past 7 years has proved successful in strengthening epidemic preparedness by enabling adaptive capabilities for rapid detection of emerging pathogens across Europe. In partnership with food safety authorities, inte...","Abstract AG7088 was identified as a good starting point for modification, leading to an efficient and bio-available inhibitor for the SARS coronavirus main proteinase (SARS-CoV Mpro). Synthesis of intermediate 1 and analogues proceeded via a highly diastereoselective indium-mediated allylation of \u03b1-aminoaldehydes.","","In December 2019, a new type viral pneumonia cases occurred in Wuhan, Hubei Province; and then named \u201c2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV)\u201d by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 12 January 2020. For it is a never been experienced respiratory disease before and with infection ability widely and quickly, it attracted the world\u2019s attention but without treatment and control manual. For the request from frontline clinicians and public health professionals of 2019-nCoV infected pneumonia management, an evidence-based guideline urgently needs to be developed. Therefore, we drafted this guideline according to the rapid advice guidelines methodology and general rules of WHO guideline development; we also added the first-hand management data of Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University. This guideline includes the guideline methodology, epidemiological characteristics, disease screening and population prevention, diagnosis, treatment and control (including traditional Chinese Medicine), nosocomial...","Currently, there has been an increasing socioeconomic impact of zoonotic pathogens transmitted from animals to humans worldwide. Recently, in the Arabian Peninsula, including in Saudi Arabia, epidemiological data indicated an actual increase in the number of emerging and/or reemerging cases of several viral zoonotic diseases. Data presented in this review are very relevant because Saudi Arabia is considered the largest country in the Peninsula. We believe that zoonotic pathogens in Saudi Arabia remain an important public health problem; however, more than 10 million Muslim pilgrims from around 184 Islamic countries arrive yearly at Makkah for the Hajj season and/or for the Umrah. Therefore, for health reasons, several countries recommend vaccinations for various zoonotic diseases among preventive protocols that should be complied with before traveling to Saudi Arabia. However, there is a shortage of epidemiological data focusing on the emerging and reemerging of zoonotic pathogens tran...","Abstract To overcome the limitations of the state-of-the-art influenza surveillance systems in Europe, we established in 2008 a European-wide consortium aimed at introducing an innovative information and communication technology approach for a web-based surveillance system across different European countries, called Influenzanet. The system, based on earlier efforts in The Netherlands and Portugal, works with the participation of the population in each country to collect real-time information on the distribution of influenza-like illness cases through web surveys administered to volunteers reporting their symptoms (or lack of symptoms) every week during the influenza season. Such a large European-wide web-based monitoring infrastructure is intended to rapidly identify public health emergencies, contribute to understanding global trends, inform data-driven forecast models to assess the impact on the population, optimize the allocation of resources, and help in devising mitigation and co...","Timely detection of novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection cases is crucial to interrupt the spread of this virus. We assessed the required expertise and capacity for molecular detection of 2019-nCoV in specialised laboratories in 30 European Union/European Economic Area (EU/EEA) countries. Thirty-eight laboratories in 24 EU/EEA countries had diagnostic tests available by 29 January 2020. A coverage of all EU/EEA countries was expected by mid-February. Availability of primers/probes, positive controls and personnel were main implementation barriers.","OBJECTIVES: This study examines perceptions of the operational and organisational management of a major outbreak of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) caused by a novel coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA). Perspectives were sought from key decision-makers and clinical staff about the factors perceived to promote and inhibit effective and rapid control of the outbreak.
