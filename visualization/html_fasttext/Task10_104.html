At the international level, a review of the literature in the PubMed database showed the diversity of these networks. Several transitory or virtual physician networks were then established during outbreaks, with the aim of collecting data on patients to improve the clinical response and/or to conduct real-time clinical research (SARS crisis-WHO [9] , REVA GRIPPE-SRLF [10] , (H1N1)pdm2009 -HPA [11] ). The experience of the 2003 SARS crisis and the 2009 pandemic flu suggested that patient care needed to be integrated into the response preparation. This concept was adopted at the international level for the recent MERS-CoV and EVD epidemics, with the creation of the Emerging Disease Clinical Assessment and Response Network (EDCARN) [12] in which the French SCE group participated. Here again, there was strong evidence to suggest that biological and epidemiological networking organizations should better address clinician expertise. Indeed, the main objectives and actions of healthcare system managers needed to focus on ensuring and improving timely and adjusted patient care and appropriate infection control measures [13] . Since then, several European initiatives have created multidisciplinary structures with the aim of sharing information on EBR-associated IDs to enhance preparedness and response (EUNID [14] [15] [16] ) or to establish a framework for integrating clinical research into epidemic response (collaborations named PREPARE [17] , ISARIC [18] , REACTING). Another initiative is the European Training in Infectious Disease Emergencies program (ETIDE), conducted since 2006 which aims to \"enhance European capacity to recognize and respond in a coordinated fashion to any infectious disease emergency, whether accidental or deliberate in origin\" and which was opened to multidisciplinary professionals including frontline HCWs in Europe [19] . Based on this experience, the French SCE group aimed to contribute to an international approach, keeping at its core patient's care and encouraging operational interaction between ID specialists, epidemiologists, biologists (etc.) with frontline physicians. This field-based validated expertise can be available to physicians, patients and health authority decision-making.","After the consensus version 1 was published, 14 it was warmly welcomed. However, some improvements were required while applying this consensus. Hence, we have revised the consensus based on these valuable opinions and published it in English to meet more requirements. The IoT was originally referred to as radio-frequency identification technology and equipment combined with the Internet based on the agreed communication protocol to achieve intelligent management of item information. Today, this concept has been expanded and deepened, that is, the use of communication technologies such as local networks or the Internet to connect sensors, machines, people, and things to achieve the connection between people and things, things and things, people-oriented informationization, and remote control and intelligent management. The most basic functional feature of the IoT is ''ubiquitous connectivity.\" Its three basic processes are comprehensive perception ? reliable transmission ? intelligent processing. The application of the IoT to medicine is referred to as the medical IoT (MIoT), [15] [16] [17] [18] which aims to establish a decision-oriented big data analysis model supported by information technology such as communication, electronics, biology, and medicine.","And the utility of economic statecraft has been systematically underestimated. 7 Today, it is all too common for great powers to resort to economic statecraft and social penetration to further their national interests. nuclear program. 8 The Russian Federation launched cyber warfare to destabilize Ukraine's democratic order. Moreover, Russia misinformed and polarized U.S. voters by extensive propaganda and penetration of social media platforms. 9 As a rising power, aiming at building its own order and sphere of influence, China has been engaging extensively in economic and social penetration of other countries. For instance, China banned rare earth metals exports to Japan and curtailed the import of Japanese autos due to the territory disputes regarding the Senkaku/Diaoyu Island in the East China Sea. China, as noted, also banned banana imports from the Philippines to coerce the Philippines to concede in the South China Sea dispute. 10 More important, economic globalization, the development of supply chains, and breakthroughs of network technology have jointly transformed and updated China's coercive capabilities. Some liberal scholars argue that global networks create mutual dependence that decrease states' incentives to engage in conflict or coercion. However, as political scientists Henry Farrell at George Washington University and Abraham L. Newman at Georgetown University show, global connectivity actually creates new opportunities for great powers to coerce, manipulate, and penetrate. Like Hirschman's emphasis on power asymmetry in economic interdependence, Farrell and Newman also find that modern globalization results in asymmetrical networks, in which some states are far more connected than others. Those states become the \"hubs\" of the global networks and have the capabilities to exploit \"weaponized interdependence.\" Specifically, those great powers can utilize their hub positions to gather information or cut off financial and information flows, discover and exploit vulnerabilities, compel policy change, and deter unwanted actions. 11 Sharp Power and Social Penetration. Financial power, hub positions in the global exchange networks, and information supply chains also enable authoritarian regimes to engage in comprehensive social penetration and manipulation of other societies. Christopher Walker and Jessica Ludwig of the National Endowment for Democracy analyze such phenomena through a lens of \"sharp power,\" defined as authoritarian influence efforts to \"pierce, penetrate, or perforate the information environments and societies in the targeted countries.\" To delegitimize democracies and other universal human-rights regimes, authoritarian regimes seek to incite and amplify existing divisions in democratic societies by manipulating or faking the information that reaches them. They also use financial incentives to induce media or civil societies in democracies to censor opinions that may be critical of those authoritarian regimes.","Training of all HCWs in proper IC practices should begin during the initial years of their professional training and be regularly updated. 53 All staff in a health care facility should receive routine training and reinforcement regarding IC practices as well as targeted training when required for instance in outbreak situations or after the introduction of a new policy or intervention. This will provide 'surge capacity,' as well as increased preparedness to deal with unexpected outbreaks. Attendance at regional and international training courses and meetings should be promoted in order to gain knowledge and establish links. Efforts should be made to collaborate with existing networks as well as establish and link national, regional and global networks in order to conduct research, coordinate activities, standardise practices, support educational activities and identify innovative IC measures.","Genome data classification comes under the broad field of bioinformatics, an established multidisciplinary field for over three decades, encompassing physical and life sciences, computer science and engineering.

This has been the focus of researchers for the past few decades and efforts have been put by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to establish Genbank R 2 , a genetic sequence database containing annotated collection of all publicly available DNA sequences. Ever since its inception in 1982, there has been an exponential rise in the number of sequences in Genbank. This has provided the required resources for researchers and industry people alike for delving in to the field of bioinformatics.","For example, GOARN was formally established by the WHO in 2000 as an effort to strengthen international cooperation. This network can link multiple existing networks, when necessary, to combine technical and operational resources from research institutions in its member states, medical and surveillance operations, regional technical networks, laboratory networks, UN organizations, the Red Cross, and international humanitarian nongovernmental organizations. Its mandate is to foster effective collaboration and cooperation in the gathering of data, experience and technologies for the quick identification, confirmation and response to major international outbreaks. It ensures that the international community remains vigilant against the threat of disease outbreaks and is prepared to respond.","Scientific research is of vital importance for tackling emerging infectious diseases and developing effective intervention methods. The spread of infectious diseases is affected not only by the biological characteristics of the pathogen but also by various other factors such as politics, culture, economy, and the environment. Multidisciplinary research in biomedical, social, and environmental sciences is required to achieve a deeper understanding of disease transmission and develop more effective systems for emergency response.","Whether for health protection or for food safety, we rely on microbiology laboratories to detect, identify, and characterize human pathogens of public health significance. Although health services are a national responsibility in the EU, a cost\u2013benefit analysis study by the European Commission has concluded that the benefits of maintaining EU public health reference laboratory networks were likely to outweigh the costs, both from a Member State and from an EU perspective (55). As outlined in the examples above, EU laboratory networks coordinated by ECDC as well as the European Commission over the last years have brought public health added value through fit-for-purpose harmonization and validation of laboratory methods, quality assurance and training activities as well as contribution to preparedness and response for biological threats. The EULabCap surveys concluded that the EU/EEA as a whole has a strong and improving public health microbiology system (7). Its key assets include harmonized methods for AST, extensive reference laboratory services, and laboratory inputs within national and EU surveillance networks. The use of molecular typing for surveillance and laboratory participation in outbreak response showed significant progress. In an era of rapid progress in electronic recording and transmission of health data, it is noticeable that half of the EU/EEA countries have implemented automated electronic reporting of microbiology laboratory data to their national communicable disease or antimicrobial resistance surveillance systems (7). To track the transmission of resistance genes needed for targeted control measures, ECDC has developed a protocol for genomic-based surveillance of carbapenem-resistant and/or colistin-resistant Enterobacteriaceae at the EU level (56). To deliver their full potential, these encouraging developments require sustained innovation in molecular diagnostic and typing methods and the collaborative engineering of wider connectivity between laboratory and public health information systems from the local to the global level. Collaboration between clinical and public health practitioners, government agencies, and academic institutions is key to develop integrated clinical, epidemiological, and molecular microbiological data collection, recording and exchange protocols as well as build the integrated information technology infrastructure enabling real time, molecular epidemiologic surveillance, and alert systems for infectious diseases. ECDC as convener, funding source and coordinator in close partnership with multidisciplinary experts from EU disease networks continues to act as catalyst for translating these novel approaches into practice and further strengthening the collective laboratory capability for disease control in the EU.","estherpoon/iStock formal training to facilitate the early identification of children's mental health problems by learning to discern children's normal and abnormal behaviours, recognise red flags indicating further intervention or referral are needed, and standardise the use of rapid screening tools for mental health. Furthermore, mental health professionals should establish evidence-based guidelines and easy operational strategies to cope with COVID-19 pandemic-related mental health problems in children. We also believe that children's access to mental health services can be improved through collaborative networks that are established nationwide and consist of psychiatrists, psychotherapists, researchers, and community volunteers. Additionally, the post-pandemic surveillance of mental disorders among these children should be considered. Since the global transmission of COVID-19 began, the total number of cases in countries other than China have already exceeded that in China. Following WHO's recommendation, an increasing number of countries have learned from China's experience with regard to quarantine policies. We suggest that the specific response to the mental distress of children who are quarantined should also be considered when designing psychological intervention strategies in response to COVID-19.","Network theory provides further evidence around why this may have been the case. In his study of UK think tanks, Jordan Tchilingirian suggests that policy think tanks operate on the periphery of more established networks and enjoy fluctuating levels of support and interest in their ideas. Ideas and knowledge do not simply flow within the network, given that dominant paradigms and political, social and cultural norms privilege better established knowledge communities (Tchilingirian, 2018) . This is reminiscent of Meyer's work on the boundaries that exist between \"amateurs\" and \"policy professionals\" (Meyer, 2008) . Moira Faul's research on global education policy networks proposes that far from being \"flat,\" networks can augment existing power relations and knowledge hierarchies (Faul, 2016) . This is worth considering when one observes how ERAP's supply of research knowledge and the SAGE sub-committee for anthropologists only increased the homophily of the social science sub-community, leaving it weakly connected to the core policy network (Fig. 4.) .","This article describes the approach of the scientific medical ID society to create an operational physician-based multidisciplinary network contributing to the preparation and response to an EBR situation.","The CSIRO Emerging Infectious Diseases Program located at AAHL has assembled a strong set of multidisciplinary research teams spanning the areas of virology, immunology, veterinary sciences and animal models. By understanding disease emergence and the host response to pathogens, we will inform public policy and develop innovative technologies to enable our industry partners to manufacture and deploy novel disease treatments to protect us from infectious diseases that threaten our wellbeing, economy and environment.","In order to protect HCWs from possible long-term psychiatric impact, the health authority should enhance preparedness with constant risk communication to HCWs. Psychological support of HCWs with self-coping strategies should be provided in a timely manner in order to strengthen resilience and capacity to mitigate fear, anxiety and stress. Mental health professionals should be more proactive and be considered part of the multidisciplinary team that manages SARS or other infectious disease outbreaks [12] . Finally, for pandemic planning, the likelihood of prolonged subjective distress and occupational difficulties in a substantial percentage of HCWs should be factored into surge capacity modelling during and after the pandemic [55] . Further longitudinal follow-up studies of SARS survivors should be conducted to evaluate the course of psychiatric consequences. Multicentre or even cross-country research should be actively encouraged so as to increase the power of research studies and explore cultural differences. The psychological effects of the disease outbreak on other at-risk populations (e.g., victims' families) and their correlation with the patient's psychological health should also be determined. The impact of the threat or actual loss of family members and friends due to the disease outbreak should be explored. In case of an unfortunate future massive outbreak, a prospective study with an early baseline and longitudinal assessment should also be adopted. Research networks with protocols and instruments that have been preselected and propositioned should be established well before the occurrence of a massive outbreak in order to avoid chaotic conditions that may pose various constraints to further studies.","Risk assessment Potential problems related to dental care include immunosuppression and bleeding tendency. Periapically involved teeth can become a medical emergency. Hence all HSCT candidates should be evaluated and receive dental treatment before immunosuppression to establish a rigorous oral hygiene programme, eliminate dental infections and stabilise carious lesions. This involves working as a part of the multidisciplinary team and coordinating care with the oncologists. For 6 months after HSCT, elective dental care is best deferred. If surgical treatment is needed during that period, antibiotic prophylaxis is probably warranted after medical consultation. After a full recovery, a programme of periodic check-ups is needed.","Because of the insufficient quality of information that exists about the state of national and regional preparedness capacities, we used data and information from IHR State Party Annual Reporting tool to review existing levels of health security capacities to prevent, detect, respond, and establish enabling functions for an effective response, and operational readiness against public health risks and events, including infectious disease outbreaks.","Hospitals and health systems must develop agile ways to transmit timely and critical information in times of crises. A designated communication team that is integrated into the work so they have a strong understanding of the clinical care being provided and the communication needs of the workforce, patients, and public is recommended. Crisis communications should ideally occur via several media, such as a telephone hotline, the hospital Web page, social media platforms, or text-based messages. Important metrics, including the number of cases being triaged, investigated, or managed; bed capacity and availability; and new or emerging data on treatments or care strategies, should be provided. Similarly, timely communication of national updates on travel restrictions, policies for self-monitoring and quarantine, and trends in infection rates must occur. To this end, health care leaders must remember that patients and their families are as much in need of actionable information as hospital personnel. Comprehensive communication strategies for both internal and external stakeholders are key.","While total oil and gas deal values in 2019 increased 40% to $370 bn, thanks to several upstream and downstream mega-deals, overall deal count declined year-over-year (y-o-y) by 40% as companies continue to struggle with low commodity prices and challenging market conditions, according to a new Deloitte report. M&amp;A activity in 2020 will be more of the same, but a little bit different, the report said. In 2019, upstream deal values totaled $156 bn, the report noted, up $26 bn y-o-y. Only 208 deals were struck, 40% below the 5-year trend. The US was the hub of global upstream M&amp;A last year, representing more than 60% in terms of both deal volume and value. Midstream significantly increased in both deal count and deal value in 2019, striking 76 deals worth $78 bn, a 30% and 50% y-o-y increase, respectively. Private equity spending increased in this sector as investors pivoted from production to infrastructure. Downstream deal value reached $114 bn, a decade high and almost double the prior year and 5-year average, while the number of transactions declined 15% y-o-y. Oilfield services (OFS) deal making stalled with deal values reaching $19 bn in 2019, down $2.5 bn y-o-y and 35% below the 5-year average. Volumes decreased 20% y-o-y, 10% below the 5-year average. Absent an increase in commodity prices, the dampened level of deal making activity is expected to continue in 2020, the report said. However, as many companies change their portfolios to match external market conditions and their own shifts in strategic priorities, evolving trends and themes could shape the oil and gas transactions market in the year ahead and beyond. The largest driver in 2020 divestitures will likely be massive 2018 and 2019 acquisitions, the report noted. Upstream companies involved in recent deals are expected to continue to realign their portfolios and strategies while also looking for divestment opportunities that allow them to focus on expanded footprints and assets. In looking at existing assets, some companies are considering carbon footprints when it comes to divestitures. As investor sentiment has changed, oil companies have increased their discussion of environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues. As the size of ESG investment funds grow, so could oil and gas companies' interests in burnishing their environmental credentials. To that end, not only renewables investment will likely increase but also carbon-based divestitures, Deloitte said. In 2020, majors are expected to be primary catalyst for global M&amp;A. In 2019, the majors divested a wide swath of assets across a range of geographies and resource types. Integrated and national oil companies are moving onward and downward. To capitalize on growing chemicals demand, most international oil and gas companies are continuing to expand their downstream footprints, beyond refining assets, and into distribution, retail, and chemicals businesses. This investment push, that has primarily targeted integrated refining and petrochemical assets, as well as fuel and natural gas networks in the Middle East and Asia Pacific, is expected to continue. High purity alumina market size worth $6.7 bn by 2025","The large population movements that accompany infrastructure construction, as well as improved transportation networks that open up opportunities for trade, commerce, travel, and an expanded sex industry, provide opportunities to spread HIV. Thus, to preserve the economic and social opportunities presented by construction while preventing further spread of HIV, the ASEAN countries agreed to coordinate efforts of finance and planning, construction and transportation, agriculture and rural development, and health planning in the form of an international AIDS committee. The committee\u2019s goal was to maximize the utility of investments provided through infrastructure construction, while mitigating the potential negative impacts such construction might bring to surrounding communities.","The \"silver lining\" is that all of these efforts serve to enhance and promote what palliative care teams have already been striving for. The need for earlier goals of care conversations, multidisciplinary team work, and enhanced use of technology and telemedicine will not fade with the resolution of COVID-19. Let our call to action help us to maintain hope in the face of so much serious illness. ","The recent MERS-CoV epidemic and the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in 2003 emphasized that new emerging diseases can occur at any time and in any place without prior notice. MERS-CoV shares certain similarities with SARS-CoV: both are zoonotic viruses which belong to the genus Betacoronavirus and can cause an acute respiratory illness which may be fatal. Although MERS-CoV has a higher case-fatality rate than SARS-CoV (36 vs. 10 %), both viruses are highly pathogenic and can apparently be transmitted through all routes of exposure. Moreover, currently, there are no effective vaccines or antiviral treatments for these diseases [36]. Failure to contain the outbreak in its first stages can have devastating effects, emphasizing the importance of a national preparedness plan for unusual biological events (UBEs). There are some key elements to improve the readiness for UBEs such as MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV. (1) Containment abilities Implementation of quarantine measures to isolate healthy people who have been in contact with infected people and designated hospitals for receiving sick patients. (2) Infection control Given the unknown route of transmission, PPE against contact, droplet and airborne transmissions should be allocated to first responders. (3) Epidemic management team The need for a multidisciplinary team to advise the Ministry of Health regarding modes of action has been shown to be essential in the last outbreaks. Nevertheless, this consulting team should have routine training sessions in order to be ready during outbreaks. (4) Epidemiologic investigation team An early epidemiologic investigation is vital for containment of an outbreak and it allows early intervention that could prevent morbidity and mortality. Skilled teams with advanced epidemiologic investigation tools can detect earlier the index case and take prompt countermeasures. (5) Table-top and \u201creal-life\u201d exercises Exercises should be undertaken for testing contingency plans and coordination between organizations. The Israeli Orange Flame preparedness build-up project, in which medical and nonmedical staff are trained at three levels: tactical, operational and strategic, is a good example for a comprehensive drill that is aimed at improving national readiness and preparedness for emerging diseases [37].","The Lancet Infectious Diseases Commission will discuss disruptive factors and how preparedness planning must consider this new ecology by exploring current preparedness platforms and their vulnerability to disruptive factors; by addressing key disruptions, iden tifying possible solutions, and providing recommendations for countries to strengthen preparedness; by developing a multidisciplinary approach including","Similar to the study of Md Mahbub Hossain MBBS [10] , we did not identify any topic about social, economic, political, psychological, or cultural consequences of COVID-19 as well as other CoV infections. The WHO roadmap has noticed this and taken 'social sciences in the outbreak response' as a priority. The social science research community should act to assess the impact of a major public health crisis like COVID-19 on the complex network of modern societies [23, 24] . [25] . By highlighting such theme interactions within coronavirus research, we hope to inspire new collaborations among researchers, by sharing data, information, technologies and ideas. The fight against the COVID-19 pandemic will benefit from active efforts to cross fertilize.","Though calls for greater involvement by the UN in global health have accelerated following the EVD outbreak, recommendations for a permanent UN global health structure are not new. As early as 2012, this author specifically advocated for the formation of a UN Global Health Panel chaired by WHO, which could alternatively be housed within the UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) - a central mechanism of the UN system that has been active in global health issues (including developing the UN Sustainable Development Goals) and is the principal UN organ coordinating work across its 14 specialized agencies [45]. ECOSOC represents an optimal space to establish cooperation, coordination, and policy coherence across the entire UN system, its technical agencies, and its respective stakeholder networks on key global health challenges, including health emergencies (see Fig. 1 for visualization of governance recommendations by the panels and the UN Global Health Panel recommendation) [45]. ","The FDA's CBER regulatory review staff consists of an internal multidisciplinary team of scientists, medical officers, and regulatory and public health professionals. To stay current on scientific advances and biotechnologies, the team is involved in a dynamic exchange of information with the outside scientific community through laboratory research and collaborations, participation in workshops and seminars, and engagement with national partners. The FDA also relies on the expertise of formal advisory committees, which include experts in the fields of vaccinology, microbiology, infectious diseases, immunology, biostatistics, epidemiology, and clinical trial design. In addition, CBER works closely with its counterparts in other U.S. government agencies within the Department of Health and Human Services and the U.S. Public Health Service (PHS), such as the National Vaccine Program Office, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the NIH, and the Health Resources and Services Administration. The CDC is responsible, among its other duties, for epidemiologic surveillance of disease and for support of immunization programs. Its Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices makes recommendations for vaccine use. The Director of the National Vaccine Program Office coordinates vaccine efforts throughout the PHS and other governmental agencies. The NIH is responsible for conducting and providing funds for a wide variety of biomedical research. The Health Resources and Services Administration is responsible for managing the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program. Other important collaborators inside the U.S. government involved in vaccine activities include the U.S. Department of Defense, and the Department of Veterans Affairs. Additionally, CBER works closely with its multilateral partners, notably the Pan American Health Organization and the World Health Organization (WHO), to provide assistance in regulatory capacity building. CBER has been very active in supporting the WHO's Developing Countries' Vaccine Regulators Network and the WHO's African Regional Office-led African Vaccine Regulatory Forum. As a WHO Collaborating Center, CBER contributes to a range of activities, including establishment of physical and written standards, implementation of WHO international standards, strengthening global regulatory systems, and serving as the National Regulatory Authority (NRA) of reference for WHO's vaccine prequalification program. CBER experts also contribute as members of several WHO Advisory Committees including the Global Advisory Committee on Vaccine Safety, the Polio Research Committee, the HIV Vaccine Advisory Committee, and the Expert Committee on Biological Standardization. CBER is an Essential Regulatory Laboratory in WHO's Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System. In addition, the FDA has confidentiality arrangements with many NRAs around the globe, allowing it to share information as part of its regulatory processes. These arrangements have strengthened interactions between the regulatory authorities and have contributed to improving the promotion and protection of public health globally.","Moderate-to-high staff attrition rates as a result of increased psychological stress should be anticipated and ameliorated with provision of stress management and psychosocial support for team members. 51 A multidisciplinary team of trained psychiatrists, psycho logists, social workers, or psychiatric nurses would be ideal to monitor and treat affected staff. A psychiatric hotline could be made available to staff members in need of urgent attention. 52 Centres need to review policies to manage and retain staff trained in ECMO, including insurance, incentives, sick leave, and occupational health and safety.","Here we introduce a new technique to main-tain the desired population of a city via selfconsistent parametrisation. In this approach, disease dynamics inside individual cities are treated with SIR model that accounts for the intra-city mixing. On the other hand, intercity migration is modeled by spatially realistic networks of airports and train stations. Put differently, the \"fully-mixed\" approximation is assumed to be valid inside cities but not between the cities. Another notable feature of the scheme proposed here is the introduction of distancedependent delay inherent in the transportation. Additionally, the model is also capable of simultaneously handling cities with different populations. This is achieved by scaling the product terms inside the SIR equations by respective populations as discussed in the next section. As an application to ongoing COVID-19 outbreak, we run our model on aviation and rail networks of India where links connect multiple cities of varying population sizes.","Through this structure, WHO could then establish clear and delineated roles for other actors when preparing for and responding to health emergencies. It could then act as both the primary coordination mechanism and provide technical support to other UN institutions, such as the World Bank, UN Development Programme, UNICEF, UNAIDS, UN Environmental Programme, UN Population Fund, UN Office of Drugs and Crime, Food and Agriculture Organization, many of whom were active participants in the fight against EVD [45]. The design of the structure should also leverage existing inter-agency structures already established between WHO, the UN and other health partners (including the Global Health Cluster and Inter-Agency Standing Committee that both focus on humanitarian and health issues.) [13]. In this sense, a UN global health panel apparatus could act as a hybrid multistakeholder global health body bringing together the respective organizational and partnership networks available between the UN system and WHO. This would enable more robust engagement with key civil society actors, NGOs, foundations, civil-military cooperation, and private sector actors that will be critical in the prevention, detection, and response to future health emergencies and potential pandemics.","In 1991, the National Academy of Science's Institute of Medicine convened a 19-member multidisciplinary panel to study the emergence of infectious disease threats. This expert panel issued a landmark report, entitled Emerging Infections-Microbial Threats to Health in the United States [1] , which described a host of factors that contribute to the introduction and spread of novel infectious diseases. In 2003, a follow-up report was issued, entitled Microbial Threats To Health: Emergence, Detection, and Response [2] . These two reports emphasize the urgent threat posed by the introduction and spread of novel infectious disease agents in the United States. Furthermore, they describe the critical role that globalization plays in the rapid and efficient spread of these infectious diseases. As global borders blur, and people, animals, food, and other products are rapidly transported, the infectious diseases that they harbor may also be 0095-5108/05/$ -see front matter D 2005 Elsevier Inc.

It is no longer enough for scientists to hone their own corners of research to perfection, and assume someone else (who?) will put it all together. Increased sophistication in efforts to incorporate systems-based concepts regarding ecology, health, and sustainability into professional curricula (Howard, 2004; Howard and Rapport, 2004) is a step in the right direction for a new generation of researchers. We must also find ways to cultivate leadership in the current generation of researchers because it is they who will be required to build the collegial and collaborative platforms from which to bridge disciplines and policy, and make useful contributions in the multistakeholder arena of EID investigation and control. Critical skills will be required to identify how, when, and where disciplinary, interdisciplinary, and transdisciplinary approaches will be required in building responses to disease emergence. This is not a small task or an \u201cacademic exercise,\u201d but a necessary step in building our capacity to better respond to the emerging infections of the 21st century.","We appreciate the Modeling in Health Research Center, School of Health, Deputy of Research and Technology, Shahrekord University of Medical Sciences. Furthermore, we truly appreciate the Ministry of Health and Medical Education, especially the team of daily information reports of COVID-19 in Iran.","Surgical programmes have responded to the trend towards same day admission for patients undergoing major procedures. The basis of effective pre-operative management is multidisciplinary assessment and patient education, both core values of accreditation. One cardiac surgical unit reported that 80% of patients referred for heart surgery had co-morbidities. Treatment was changed in 15% of patients after assessment by the team which included the surgery, anaesthesiology, nursing, respiratory therapy, social work and physiotherapy.","In turn, consensus is required regarding the definition of a \"critically ill patient\", the requirements for beds in the ICU, the levels of care, the admission, discharge and prioritization criteria, and the needs relating to personnel and their qualification. 2. Positioning of Intensive Care Medicine as a cost-effective discipline capable of offering useful survival and of restoring health, wellbeing and wealth to society, with efficient and prioritized management of the available resources. Flexibility is needed in the management of these resources, including the capacity to foresee and cope with overwhelming situations such as epidemics, disasters, etc., which may require rapid reorientation of the existing material and human resources. 3. The need to improve research in Intensive Care Medicine, in relation to ethical norms, with the incorporation of social utility criteria, adequate methodology, the adoption of a global and collaborative perspective, and taking into account the heterogeneity of critically ill patients. 4. Multidisciplinary cooperation (participation of the different levels and medical specialties implicated in patient care), including adequate communication in the \"key moments\" of the transfer of healthcare responsibility (upon patient admission and discharge from the ICU) and times of maximum risk (patient intraand inter-hospital transfer outside the ICU).","Rehabilitation medicine was increasingly affected by everstricter infection control measures regarding close contacts and interactions between health care workers. Multidisciplinary team meetings were canceled; instead, telephone updates or intranet e-mails were strongly encouraged. Nevertheless, oneon-one meetings between masked team rehabilitation members still occurred, to pass on progress reports and to discuss important issues.","On 18 January 2020, after the admission of the suspected cases in West China Hospital, a multidisciplinary team was organized for patients with fevers of unknown cause. The team (also co-authors of this article) includes experts from the Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, Center of Infectious Diseases, Department of Emergency Medicine, Department of Critical Care Medicine, Department of Radiology, and Department of Laboratory Medicine. The multi-disciplinary team collects pulmonary specimens, performs RT-PCR testing, acquires CT scans, collectively discusses the data, and makes the diagnosis.","In many ways, virology and viral forensics are still in their infancy. We know very little about the vast spectrum of viruses in nature. Although we should continue to pursue studies on known human pathogens, we need to broaden our efforts in virus isolation, viral genomics, and bioinformatics. A comprehensive database of viral sequences is critical for rapid identification of emerging viral pathogens and new diagnostic platforms, such as oligonucleotide 55 arrays. In addition to viral genomics, global proteomic analysis of viral disease processes may uncover molecular signatures that can be used to implicate a particular etiologic agent or class of agents, even in the absence of viral nucleic acid or serology. The global eradication of smallpox ranks as one of humankind' s greatest accomplishments. In the wake of this triumph, many viral challenges remain. HIV, hepatitis B and C, influenza, dengue, rotavirus, and many other viral diseases continue to affect tens of millions. It is distressing that in the face of these undeniable challenges we are back to discussing the deliberate use of existing or modified viruses for harm, not good.","To supplement formal reporting mechanisms between countries and with WHO (including the IHR), the use of informal mechanisms such as media and social media reports was advocated in the light of the SARS experience. There are now globally several systems that provide collated information from informal reporting including networks of experts and scanning of media and social media. These contribute to, and amplify, epidemic intelligence and are being integrated with national and international surveillance systems.","Multidisciplinary breast cancer experts at a high-volume comprehensive cancer center convened contingency planning meetings over the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic to review the relevant literature and establish recommendations for the application of hypofractionated and abbreviated breast radiation regimens.","We also anticipate that there will be a range of long-term mental health consequences to this pandemic. In this respect, the field of geriatric psychiatry is in an uncharted territory, given that this confluence of a global viral pandemic and increased life expectancy is a new phenomenon and hence, little literature exists in this area. The scope and drawn-out nature of this pandemic may also mean that lessons learned from managing natural disasters may not be fully applicable here (10) . Moreover, even as we assess impact on aging individuals, we also account for their important contributions in disaster preparedness and response. Research has documented the important social capital, perspective and wisdom provided by these individuals in the form of their experience and pre-existing social networks (7, 11) . Thus, older adults may have important lessons to teach COVID-19 sufferers, as well as healthcare professionals from all age groups.","The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.20.20025957 doi: medRxiv preprint Our ETCS has demonstrated substantial benefits in terms of the effectiveness of consultations and remote patient monitoring, multidisciplinary care, and prevention education and training. First, 63 severe cases and 591 patients with mild and moderate respiratory infections received telemedicine consultations through the ETCS between January 28, 2020 and February 17, 2020. As of February 17, 2020, 420 cases had been cured and discharged from the hospitals. Second, in the isolation wards, the mobile telemedicine device effectively collects, transforms, and evaluates patient health data such as blood pressure, oxygen level, and respiratory rate, and reports them to the care team. This facilitates the avoidance of direct physical contact, thus reducing the risk of exposure to respiratory secretions and preventing the potential transmission of infection to physicians and nurses. Third, the specialist treatment team includes specialists from different clinical disciplines, and can therefore offer comprehensive assessment and treatment. Meanwhile, nurse care managers and social workers can be involved strategically to help patients with pneumonia obtain post-treatment care to avoid coronavirus re-infection. Fourth, the specialist treatment team provides primary care guidance on coronavirus (e.g., clinical criteria for COVID-19 diagnosis, patient transfers, and cleaning process) to all physicians and nurses at 126 connected hospitals via video conference. Substantial efforts are devoted to training physicians and nurses, many of whom are new to the treatment of coronavirus infections. Figure 2 .

The number of consulted cases through ETCS refers to the number of consultations provided by the provincial specialist treatment team to the municipal and county hospitals, excluding the consultations provided by the municipal hospitals to the county hospitals.","Accordingly, on 13 January 2020, the Vaccine Research Center of the US National Institutes of Health communicated the 2019-nCoV viral sequence to collaborators at Moderna, which has initiated good-manufacturing-practice production of an mRNA vaccine targeting the viral spike glycoprotein. The hope is to launch a phase 1 clinical trial in healthy people within three months. Initial phylogenetic analysis of 2019-nCoV sequences suggests there is little diversity\u2014indicative of limited evolution\u2014among viral isolates, which would be a potential boon to broad dissemination of a protective vaccine (http://virological.org/t/preliminary-phylogenetic-analysis-of-11-ncov2019-genomes-2020-01-19/329). On 23 January 2020, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations announced funding for Inovio Pharmaceuticals and the University of Queensland to leverage their existing platforms from MERS vaccine efforts, and separately to Moderna for its mRNA platform, to help accelerate clinical testing of a vaccine against 2019-nCoV.","Evolution of antibiotic consumption in a geriatric ward of a university hospital: results of a five-year policy involving a multidisciplinary collaboration team B.

In early stages of epidemics with emerging pathogens, real-time analysis of accurate and robust epidemiological and clinical data is essential to developing interventional strategies and guiding public health decisionmaking. 2, 3 Such data can provide insight into infectivity, routes of transmission, disease severity, and outcomes, thus enabling epidemiologic modelling and improved public health responses. 4, 5 Line list data, which includes individual patient-level data on important epidemiological and clinical variables, is rarely available early during an outbreak with a novel pathogen. 5 However, recognizing the utility of such data and its ability to provide for real-time analyses, multiple academic groups have been curating line list data using crowdsourcing and openly sharing the data with the scientific community. 4, 5 Crowdsourcing enables the collection of data from multiple platforms including health-care-oriented social networks, government and public health agencies, and global news sources.","The current state of much of the Wuhan pneumonia virus (COVID-19) research shows a regrettable lack of data sharing and considerable analytical obfuscation. This impedes global research cooperation, which is essential for tackling public health emergencies, and requires unimpeded access to data, analysis tools, and computational infrastructure. Here we show that community efforts in developing open analytical software tools over the past ten years, combined with national investments into scientific computational infrastructure, can overcome these deficiencies and provide an accessible platform for tackling global health emergencies in an open and transparent manner. Specifically, we use all COVID-19 genomic data available in the public domain so far to (1) underscore the importance of access to raw data and to (2) demonstrate that existing community efforts in curation and deployment of biomedical software can reliably support rapid, reproducible research during global health crises.

This emergency has attracted global concern, and the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). Joint efforts to identify the causative agent were undertaken by multidisciplinary task forces under the organization of the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China, and a novel coronavirus, named 2019-nCoV by the WHO, was swiftly identified as the pathogen responsible for this contagious epidemic.","With the adoption of the International Health Regulations [IHR(2005)] by the WHO, India has made considerable progress and continues to demonstrate a strong commitment for establishing and operating a disease surveillance programme. The Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare launched an Integrated Disease Surveillance Project (IDSP) in 2004 to connect all district hospitals and state-run medical colleges to facilitate tele-education, training of health professionals and monitoring of disease trends. The project is implemented through the Central Surveillance Unit within the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) at New Delhi and aims to detect early warning signals of impending disease outbreaks and initiate effective and rapid health actions with the help of information and communication technology at the district, state and national levels. In addition to monitoring diseases like vector borne infections, diarrhoeal diseases, respiratory diseases, and vaccine preventable diseases, the IDSP also has a category called \u2018unusual clinical syndromes,\u2019 which would alert public health professionals to an intentional release of any biological-agent [114].","The need for Saudi Arabia to share experience of international health system strengthening is recognised, 1 and global health diplomacy was suggested as a powerful tool to facilitate such a mission. 1, 4 In global health diplomacy, public health professionals and diplomats work together as a team in decision making on global public health issues. 5 To facilitate teamwork, diplomats and public health professionals need to be educated in an interdisciplinary environment that promotes shared learning and joint training to improve communication, collaboration, and cooperation. 5 The Hajj is an exceptional environment for such a model, 1 and Mecca Governor Prince Khalid Al-Faisal recently proposed to establish a Hajj University 6 to serve as a focal point. The University, to be in Mecca, will provide education, training, and research to improve Hajj services. The University could benefi t from the experience of the Graduate Institute of International Studies, Geneva, in global health diplomacy training, and other international and local public health institutes such as the Hajj research centre, the Saudi centre for disease control and prevention, and local universities. The proposed new University can be seen as an example of Saudi Arabian global health diplomacy, which could be benefi cial in sharing experience of international health system strengthening to control potential global public health hazards, such as poliovirus in Pakistan. 7","\u2022 A public communication and media strategy, delivered through designated communication centres and/or broadly accessible networks, should provide regular, reliable and transparent public communication. This conduit should represent the plans and operational aspects of the consortium of actors participating in the response and offer regular updates and progress reports. Protection of personal information legislation must be complied with and SOPs must be implemented to ensure its protection."],"title":["The French Infectious Diseases Society's readiness and response

Until recently, MS was applied for protein detection and characterization. During the last decade, however, MS has successfully been used for molecular diagnostics of microbial and viral infections with the most notable applications being identification of pathogens, genomic sequencing, mutation detection, DNA methylation analysis, tracking of transmissions, and characterization of genetic heterogeneity. These new developments vastly expand the MS application from experimental research to public health and clinical fields.

Commensal GM modulates brain development and behavior and has been implicated in several neurological disorders like Alzheimer's disease, multiple sclerosis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, anxiety, stress and much more. A recent study has shown that Parkinson's disease patients suffer from GM dysbiosis, but whether it is a cause or an effect is yet to be understood. In this review, we try to connect the dots between GM and PD pathology using direct and indirect evidence.","N4-hydroxycytidine (NHC) has been recently reported to have promising antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2. To join worldwide efforts in identifying potential drug targets against this pandemic, the target landscape of NHC was defined by extracting all known targets of its chemical neighborhood, including drugs, analogues, and metabolites, and by performing target predictions from two independent platforms, following the recent Public Health Assessment via Structural Evaluation (PHASE) protocol. The analysis provides a list of over 30 protein targets that could be useful in future design activities of new COVID-19 antivirals. The relevance for existing drugs within the same chemical space, such as remdesivir, is also discussed.","Abstract Context In 2012, the French Infectious Diseases Society (French acronym SPILF) initiated the \u201cCoordination of epidemic and biological risk\u201d (SPILF-COREB - Emergences [SCE]) group to support the readiness and response of healthcare workers (HCWs) to new alerts. Objective To present the SCE group, its functioning, and the main support it provided for frontline HCWs. Methods A multidisciplinary group of heads of infectious disease departments from reference hospitals was created to build a network of clinical expertise for care, training, and research in the field of epidemic and biological risk (EBR). The network developed a set of standardized operational procedures (SOPs) to guide interventions to manage EBR-suspect patients. Results A working group created the SOP aimed at frontline HCWs taking care of patients. Priority was given to the development of a generic procedure, which was then adapted according to the current alert. Five key steps were identified and hierarchized: ...","The 2009 influenza A (H1N1) pandemic highlighted the importance of quality hospital care of the severely ill, yet there is evidence that the impact of the 2009 pandemic was highest in low\u2010 and middle\u2010income countries with fewer resources. Recent data indicate that death and suffering from seasonal influenza and severe illness in general are increased in resource\u2010limited settings. However, there are limited clinical data and guidelines for the management of influenza and other severe illness in these settings. Life\u2010saving supportive care through syndromic case management is used successfully in high\u2010resource intensive care units and in global programs such as the Integrated Management of Childhood Illness (IMCI). While there are a variety of challenges to the management of the severely ill in resource\u2010limited settings, several new international initiatives have begun to develop syndromic management strategies for these environments, including the World Health Organization's Integrated M...","SUMMARY The French public health institute is responsible for promoting and coordinating threats the detection and assessment of health risks, and for suggesting possible responses. Transmissible diseases affecting both human and animal health are the focus of surveillance networks. Early detection of potential infectious threats is based on the screening of \u201c alert signals \u201c identified through routine surveillance networks and other systems. The quality and accuracy of these signals is first verified, before assessing, through a multidisciplinary approach, the risk of introduction and dissemination. This article examines specific cases illustrating the process of detection, risk analysis and response, with respect to infectious threats that are endemic in tropical regions and have the potential to be imported into metropolitan France. For both novel pathogens and exotic diseases \u2014 which, not being endemic in France, are less well known \u2014 the analysis and response process must regularl...","Viral infections, such as Ebola, severe acute respiratory syndrome/Middle East respiratory syndrome and West Nile virus have emerged as a serious health threat with no effective therapies. These infections have little commercial potential and are not a high priority for the pharmaceutical industry. However, the academic community has been active in this area for many years. The challenge is how to take this academic virology knowledge into a drug discovery and development domain. One approach is the use of consortia and public\u2013private partnerships \u2013 this article highlights ongoing efforts in the USA. Public funds, such as those from government sources, can support research efforts that do not to appear to have commercial value. The key to success is finding a way to combine the different cultural and operational values and reward systems into a productive collaboration to identify new antivirals.","Global gene expression analysis is beginning to move from the laboratories of basic investigators to large-scale clinical trials. The potential of this technology to improve diagnosis and tailored treatment of human disease may soon be realised, now that several comprehensive studies have demonstrated the utility of gene expression profiles for the classification of tumours into distinct, clinically relevant subtypes and the prediction of clinical outcomes. In addition, new data from the emerging proteomics platforms add another layer of molecular information to the study of human disease, as scientists attempt to catalogue a complete inventory of the proteins encoded by the genome and to establish a 'biosignature' profile of human health and disease. As a result, it is anticipated that, together, these technologies will facilitate the comprehensive study of genes, gene products and signalling pathways so that the objective of personalised molecular medicine can be achieved. This paper...","The current state of much of the Wuhan pneumonia virus (COVID-19) research shows a regrettable lack of data sharing and considerable analytical obfuscation. This impedes global research cooperation, which is essential for tackling public health emergencies, and requires unimpeded access to data, analysis tools, and computational infrastructure. Here we show that community efforts in developing open analytical software tools over the past ten years, combined with national investments into scientific computational infrastructure, can overcome these deficiencies and provide an accessible platform for tackling global health emergencies in an open and transparent manner. Specifically, we use all COVID-19 genomic data available in the public domain so far to (1) underscore the importance of access to raw data and to (2) demonstrate that existing community efforts in curation and deployment of biomedical software can reliably support rapid, reproducible research during global health crises. A...","The ongoing pandemic of 2019-nCov (COVID-19) coronavirus has made reliable epidemiological modeling an urgent necessity. Unfortunately, most of the existing models are either too fine-grained to be efficient or too coarse-grained to be reliable. Here we propose a computationally efficient hybrid approach that uses SIR model for individual cities which are in turn coupled via empirical transportation networks that facilitate migration among them. The treatment presented here differs from existing models in two crucial ways: first, self-consistent determination of coupling parameters so as to maintain the populations of individual cities, and second, the incorporation of distance dependent temporal delays in migration. We apply our model to Indian aviation as well as railway networks taking into account populations of more than 300 cities. Our results project that through the domestic transportation, the significant population is poised to be exposed within 90 days of the onset of epidem...","The novel coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19)epidemic has brought serious social psychological impact to the Chinese people, especially those quarantined and thus with limited access to face-to-face communication and traditional social psychological interventions. To better deal with the urgent psychological problems of people involved in the COVID-19 epidemic, we developed a new psychological crisis intervention model by utilizing internet technology. This new model, one of West China Hospital, integrates physicians, psychiatrists, psychologists and social workers into Internet platforms to carry out psychological intervention to patients, their families and medical staff. We hope this model will make a sound basis for developing a more comprehensive psychological crisis intervention response system that is applicable for urgent social and psychological problems.","Abstract Introduction Breast radiotherapy accounts for a significant proportion of patient volume in contemporary radiation oncology practice. In the setting of anticipated resource constraints and widespread community infection with SARS-CoV-2 during the COVID-19 pandemic, measures for balancing both infectious and oncologic risk among patients and providers must be carefully considered. Here, we present evidence-based guidelines for omitting or abbreviating breast cancer radiotherapy, where appropriate, in an effort to mitigate risk to patients and optimize resource utilization. Methods Multidisciplinary breast cancer experts at a high-volume comprehensive cancer center convened contingency planning meetings over the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic to review the relevant literature and establish recommendations for the application of hypofractionated and abbreviated breast radiation regimens. Results Substantial evidence exists to support omitting radiation among certain favorabl...","Abstract To overcome the limitations of the state-of-the-art influenza surveillance systems in Europe, we established in 2008 a European-wide consortium aimed at introducing an innovative information and communication technology approach for a web-based surveillance system across different European countries, called Influenzanet. The system, based on earlier efforts in The Netherlands and Portugal, works with the participation of the population in each country to collect real-time information on the distribution of influenza-like illness cases through web surveys administered to volunteers reporting their symptoms (or lack of symptoms) every week during the influenza season. Such a large European-wide web-based monitoring infrastructure is intended to rapidly identify public health emergencies, contribute to understanding global trends, inform data-driven forecast models to assess the impact on the population, optimize the allocation of resources, and help in devising mitigation and co...","Since December 2019, China has been experiencing an outbreak of a new infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The clinical features include fever, coughing, shortness of breath, and inflammatory lung infiltration. China rapidly listed SARS-CoV-2-related pneumonia as a statutory infectious disease. To standardize the diagnosis and treatment of this new infectious disease, an operational recommendation for the diagnosis and management of SARS-CoV-2 infection is developed by Peking Union Medical College Hospital.","Abstract The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) was first diagnosed in Wuhan, China in December 2019 and has now spread throughout the world, being verified by the World Health Organization as a Pandemic on March 11th. This had led to the calling of a national emergency on March 13th in the United States. Many hospitals, healthcare networks, and specifically Departments of Surgery are asking the same questions of how to cope and plan for surge capacity, personnel attrition, novel infrastructure utilization, and resource exhaustion. Herein, we present a tiered plan for surgical department planning based on incident command levels. This includes Acute Care Surgeon deployment (given their critical care training and vertically integrated position in the hospital), recommended infrastructure and transfer utilization, triage principles, and faculty, resident and advanced care practitioner deployment.","","Background and Aim: Since late 2019, an unknown-origin pneumonia outbreak detected in Wuhan city, Hubei Province, China. We aimed to build a model to qualitatively and quantitatively assess publications of research of COVID-19 from 2019 to 2020. Materials and Methods: Data were obtained from the Web of Science (WOS), PubMed, and Scopus Core Collection on March 02, 2020, and updated on March 10. We conducted a qualitative and quantitative analysis of publication outputs, journals, authors, institutions, countries, cited references, keywords, and terms according to bibliometric methods using VOS viewer c software packages. Results: Initially, we identified 227 papers, of which after an exclusion process, 92 studies were selected for statistical analyses. China accounted for the highest proportion of published research (44 papers, 40.48%), followed by the United States (21 papers, 19.32%), and Canada (7 papers, 6.44%). Adjusted by gross domestic product (GDP), ranked first, with 0.003 art...","","We describe the benefit of using reconstructed ancestral sequences (RAS) on resequencing microarrays for rapid pathogen identification, with Enterobacteriaceae rpoB sequences as a model. Our results demonstrate a sharp improvement of call rate and accuracy when using RASs as compared to extant sequences. This improvement was attributed to the lower sequence divergence of RASs, which also expanded the sequence space covered by the microarray. Extension of this novel microarray design strategy to viruses, antimicrobial resistance elements or toxins is straightforward.","The recent Ebola and Zika epidemics demonstrate the need for the continuous surveillance, rapid diagnosis and real-time tracking of emerging infectious diseases. Fast, affordable sequencing of pathogen genomes \u2014 now a staple of the public health microbiology laboratory in well-resourced settings \u2014 can affect each of these areas. Coupling genomic diagnostics and epidemiology to innovative digital disease detection platforms raises the possibility of an open, global, digital pathogen surveillance system. When informed by a One Health approach, in which human, animal and environmental health are considered together, such a genomics-based system has profound potential to improve public health in settings lacking robust laboratory capacity. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The online version of this article (doi:10.1038/nrg.2017.88) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.","","","Abstract In the present work, a single-step purification of recombinant nucleocapsid protein (NP) of the Newcastle disease virus (NDV) directly from unclarified feedstock using an expanded bed adsorption chromatography (EBAC) was developed. Streamline 25 column (ID=25mm) was used as a contactor and Streamline chelating adsorbent immobilized with Ni2+ ion was used as affinity adsorbent. The dynamic binding capacity of Ni2+-loaded Streamline chelating adsorbent for the NP protein in unclarified feedstock was found to be 2.94mg ml\u22121 adsorbent at a superficial velocity of 200cm h\u22121. The direct purification of NP protein from unclarified feedstock using expanded bed adsorption has resulted in a 31% adsorption and 9.6% recovery of NP protein. The purity of the NP protein recovered was about 70% and the volume of processing fluid was reduced by a factor of 10. The results of the present study show that the IMA-EBAC developed could be used to combine the clarification, concentration and initia...","The pace of pathogen discovery is increasing dramatically. This reflects not only factors that enable the appearance and globalization of new microbial infections but also improvements in methods for ascertainment. New molecular diagnostic platforms; investments in pathogen surveillance in wildlife, domestic animals and humans; and the advent of social media tools that mine the world wide web for clues to outbreaks of infectious disease are proving invaluable in early recognition of threats to public health. Additionally, models of microbial pathogenesis are becoming more complex, providing insights into the mechanisms by which microorganisms can contribute to chronic illnesses like cancer, peptic ulcer disease and mental illness. Here we review the contributions of each of these elements to infectious disease emergence and strategies for addressing the challenges of pathogen surveillance and discovery.","Novel coronavirus infection special intensive care team We set up a special emergency multi-disciplinary intensive care team to discuss the problems that we might encounter and countermeasures. Team members include intensive care unit (ICU) physician, infectious disease physician, nurse, respiratory therapist, nosocomial infection control expert, and administrative staff. We first evaluated the isolation conditions and the capacity of our department to admit a larger number of patients. Second, we specified the protection levels for different types of health care activities. Third, we assigned special work such as patient screening, consultation, and transfer to designated staff to minimize the number of health workers who had contact with patients with nCoV infection.ID - LiaoER -","Abstract Objective MERS-CoV infection is uncommonly identified among patients visiting healthcare facilities &amp; we were vigilant in screening all patients entering our hospital to prevent cross infection among patients, visitors &amp; healthcare providers and aiming to prevent potential outbreaks with MERS-CoV infection. In spite of our efforts on practicing Failure Mode Effect Analysis for MERS-CoV infection management we ended up having an outbreak with MERS-CoV. Based on our experience, we actively implemented policies, procedures &amp; practices on early identification &amp; appropriate isolation practices along with supplemental infection prevention &amp; control measures for preventing future outbreaks at our healthcare facility. Methods Retrospectively we analyzed our failure in preventing the outbreak of MERS-CoV infection among our hospitalized patients by identifying the outbreak &amp; actively intervening as a team to control the outbreak with the support of Hospital Higher management, Administr...","In the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic, currently vaccines and specific anti-viral treatment are not yet available. Thus, preventing viral transmission by case isolation, quarantine, and social distancing is essential to slowing its spread. Here we model social networks using weighted graphs, where vertices represent individuals and edges represent contact. As public health measures are implemented, connectivity in the graph decreases, resulting in lower effective reproductive numbers, and reduced viral transmission. For COVID-19, model parameters were derived from the coronavirus epidemic in China, validated by epidemic data in Italy, then applied to the United States. We calculate that, in the U.S., the public is able to contain viral transmission by limiting the average number of contacts per person to less than 7 unique individuals over each 5 day period. This increases the average social distance between individuals to 10 degrees of separation.","In the setting of emerging infections, such as COVID-19, this commentary argues that all members of the health care team need training on how to integrate key epidemiologic information, such as travel history, into their risk assessments in the same way they are trained to ask about tobacco exposure to assess cancer and heart disease risk.","AbstractMotivationAccurately determining the atomic structure of proteins represents a fundamental problem in the field of structural bioinformatics. A solution would be significant as protein structure information could be utilized in the medical field, e.g. in the development of vaccines for new viruses. This paper focuses on predicting the protein structure based on 3D images of the proteins captured through cryogenic electron microscopes (cryo-EM). A fully automated computationally efficient protein structure prediction method would be particularly beneficial in the field of cryo-EM as the technology allows researchers to photograph multiple large protein complexes in a single study, which means that a fast prediction method could allow for a high throughput of derived protein structures. We present a deep learning approach, DeepTracer, for predicting locations of the backbone atoms, secondary structure elements, and the amino acid types. In order to connect the predicted amino aci...","The rapid spread of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) presents China with a critical challenge. As normal capacity of the Chinese hospitals is exceeded, healthcare professionals struggling to manage this unprecedented crisis face the difficult question of how best to coordinate the medical resources used in highly separated locations. Responding rapidly to this crisis, the National Telemedicine Center of China (NTCC), located in Zhengzhou, Henan Province, has established the Emergency Telemedicine Consultation System (ETCS), a telemedicine-enabled outbreak alert and response network. ETCS is built upon a doctor-to-doctor (D2D) approach, in which health services can be accessed remotely through terminals across hospitals. The system architecture of ETCS comprises three major architectural layers: (1) telemedicine service platform layer, (2) telemedicine cloud layer, and (3) telemedicine service application layer. Our ETCS has demonstrated substantial benefits in terms of the effective...","Our understanding of human disease and potential therapeutics is improving rapidly. In order to take advantage of these developments it is important to be able to identify disease markers. Many new high-throughput genomics and proteomics technologies are being implemented to identify candidate disease markers. These technologies include protein microarrays, next-generation DNA sequencing and mass spectrometry platforms. Such methods are particularly important for elucidating the repertoire of molecular markers in the genome, transcriptome, proteome and metabolome of patients with diseases such as cancer, autoimmune diseases, and viral infections, resulting from the disruption of many biological pathways. These new technologies have identified many potential disease markers. These markers are expected to be valuable to achieve the promise of truly personalized medicine.","A major focus of systems biology is to characterize interactions between cellular components, in order to develop an accurate picture of the intricate networks within biological systems. Over the past decade, protein microarrays have greatly contributed to advances in proteomics and are becoming an important platform for systems biology. Protein microarrays are highly flexible, ranging from large-scale proteome microarrays to smaller customizable microarrays, making the technology amenable for detection of a broad spectrum of biochemical properties of proteins. In this article, we will focus on the numerous studies that have utilized protein microarrays to reconstruct biological networks including protein\u2013DNA interactions, posttranslational protein modifications (PTMs), lectin\u2013glycan recognition, pathogen\u2013host interactions and hierarchical signaling cascades. The diversity in applications allows for integration of interaction data from numerous molecular classes and cellular states, pr...","Abstract A new system to recognize protein coding genes in the coronavirus genomes, specially suitable for the SARS-CoV genomes, has been proposed in this paper. Compared with some existing systems, the new program package has the merits of simplicity, high accuracy, reliability, and quickness. The system ZCURVE_CoV has been run for each of the 11 newly sequenced SARS-CoV genomes. Consequently, six genomes not annotated previously have been annotated, and some problems of previous annotations in the remaining five genomes have been pointed out and discussed. In addition to the polyprotein chain ORFs 1a and 1b and the four genes coding for the major structural proteins, spike (S), small envelop (E), membrane (M), and nuleocaspid (N), respectively, ZCURVE_CoV also predicts 5\u20136 putative proteins in length between 39 and 274 amino acids with unknown functions. Some single nucleotide mutations within these putative coding sequences have been detected and their biological implications are di...","Ten years have elapsed since the World Health Organization issued its first global alert for an unexplained illness named severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). The anniversary provides an opportunity to reflect on the international response to this new global microbial threat. While global surveillance and response capacity for public health threats have been strengthened, critical gaps remain. Of 194 World Health Organization member states that signed on to the International Health Regulations (2005), &lt;20% had achieved compliance with the core capacities required by the deadline in June 2012. Lessons learned from the global SARS outbreak highlight the need to avoid complacency, strengthen efforts to improve global capacity to address the next pandemic using all available 21st century tools, and support research to develop new treatment options, countermeasures, and insights while striving to address the global inequities that are the root cause of many of these challenges.","IAs of February 11, 2020, all prefecture-level cities in mainland China have reported confirmed cases of 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), but the city-level epidemical dynamics is unknown. The aim of this study is to model the current dynamics of 2019-nCoV at city level and predict the trend in the next 30 days under three possible scenarios in mainland China. We developed a spatially explicit epidemic model to consider the unique characteristics of the virus transmission in individual cities. Our model considered that the rate of virus transmission among local residents is different from those with Wuhan travel history due to the self-isolation policy. We introduced a decay rate to quantify the effort of each city to gradually control the disease spreading. We used mobile phone data to obtain the number of individuals in each city who have travel history to Wuhan. This city-level model was trained using confirmed cases up to February 10, 2020 and validated by new confirmed cases on...","Background: Since December 2019, Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) emerged in Wuhan city and rapidly spread throughout China. The mortality of novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP) in severe and critical cases is very high. Facing this kind of public health emergency, high efficient administrative emergency responsive mode in designated hospital is needed. Method: As an affiliated hospital of Sun Yat-sen University, our hospital is the only designated one for diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19 in Zhuhai, a medium-sized city. Novel coronavirus pneumonia department, which is administrative led by the president of hospital directly, has been established at early stage of epidemic crisis in my hospital. In NCP department, there are core members of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine (PCCM) specialist and multidisciplinary team. Don't stick to national guidelines of NCP, based on professional opinion by respiratory professor and expert group, we focused on individualized treatment and timel...","Abstract: We propose that the palliative care team response will occur in two waves: first communication and second symptom management. Our experience with discussing goals of care with the family of a COVID positive patient highlighted some expected and unexpected challenges. We describe these challenges along with recommendations for approaching these conversations. We also propose a framework for proactively mobilizing the palliative care workforce to aggressively address goals of care in all patients, with the aim of reducing the need for rationing of resources.","Immunity to respiratory virus infection is governed by complex biological networks that influence disease progression and pathogenesis. Systems biology provides an opportunity to explore and understand these multifaceted interactions based on integration and modeling of multiple biological parameters. In this review, we describe new and refined systems-based approaches used to model, identify, and validate novel targets within complex networks following influenza and coronavirus infection. In addition, we propose avenues for extension and expansion that can revolutionize our understanding of infectious disease processes. Together, we hope to provide a window into the unique and expansive opportunity presented by systems biology to understand complex disease processes within the context of infectious diseases.","Biosyntheses of proteins, nucleotides and fatty acids, are essential for the malignant proliferation and survival of cancer cells. Cumulating research findings show that amino acid restrictions are potential strategies for cancer interventions. Meanwhile, dietary strategies are popular among cancer patients. However, there is still lacking solid rationale to clarify what is the best strategy, why and how it is. Here, integrated analyses and comprehensive summaries for the abundances, signalling and functions of amino acids in proteomes, metabolism, immunity and food compositions, suggest that, intermittent dietary lysine restriction with normal maize as an intermittent staple food for days or weeks, might have the value and potential for cancer prevention or therapy. Moreover, dietary supplements were also discussed for cancer cachexia including dietary immunomodulatory.","Summary Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a respiratory tract infection caused by a newly emergent coronavirus, that was first recognized in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. Currently, the World Health Organization (WHO) has defined the infection as a global pandemic and there is a health and social emergency for the management of this new infection. While most people with COVID-19 develop only mild or uncomplicated illness, approximately 14% develop severe disease that requires hospitalization and oxygen support, and 5% require admission to an intensive care unit (1). In severe cases, COVID-19 can be complicated by the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), sepsis and septic shock, and multiorgan failure. This consensus document has been prepared on evidence-informed guidelines developed by a multidisciplinary panel of health care providers from four spanish scientific societies (Spanish Society of Intensive Care Medicine [SEMICYUC], Spanish Society of Pulmonologists [SEPAR],...","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-2019) has been recognized as a global threat, and several studies are being conducted using various mathematical models to predict the probable evolution of this epidemic. These mathematical models based on various factors and analyses are subject to potential bias. Here, we propose a simple econometric model that could be useful to predict the spread of COVID-2019. We performed Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model prediction on the Johns Hopkins epidemiological data to predict the epidemiological trend of the prevalence and incidence of COVID-2019. For further comparison or for future perspective, case definition and data collection have to be maintained in real time.","COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 has recently affected over 200,000 people and killed more than 8000. Immune system dysregulation such as lymphopenia and inflammatory cytokine storm has been observed in COVID-19 patients, but it remains unclear for the change of key immune cell subsets and their states during COVID-19. Here, we applied single-cell technology to comprehensively characterize transcriptional changes of peripheral blood mononuclear cells in ten patients recovered from COVID-19. Compared with healthy control, COVID-19 induced a unique signature of immune cells in humans, especially in the early recovery stage (ERS). In ERS patients, T cells were decreased remarkably, while monocytes were increased. A detailed analysis of monocytes showed that there was an increased ratio of classical CD14++ monocytes with highly inflammatory genes expression, as well as a greater abundance of CD14++IL1B+ monocytes. For nature killer (NK) cells and T cells, CD4+ T cells were significantly decre...","Summary The causative agent of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), which affected over 8000 individuals worldwide and was responsible for over 700 deaths in the 2002\u20132003 outbreak, is a coronavirus that was unknown before the outbreak. Although many different treatments were used during the outbreak, none were implemented in a controlled fashion. Thus, the optimal treatment for SARS is unknown. Since the outbreak, much work has been done testing new agents against SARS using in-vitro methods and animal models. In addition, global research efforts have focused on the development of vaccines against SARS. Efforts should be made to evaluate the most promising treatments and vaccines in controlled clinical trials, should another SARS outbreak occur.","Summary In the USA, infectious diseases continue to exact a substantial toll on health and health-care resources. Endemic diseases such as chronic hepatitis, HIV, and other sexually transmitted infections affect millions of individuals and widen health disparities. Additional concerns include health-care-associated and foodborne infections\u2014both of which have been targets of broad prevention efforts, with success in some areas, yet major challenges remain. Although substantial progress in reduction of the burden of vaccine-preventable diseases has been made, continued cases and outbreaks of these diseases persist, driven by various contributing factors. Worldwide, emerging and reemerging infections continue to challenge prevention and control strategies while the growing problem of antimicrobial resistance needs urgent action. An important priority for control of infectious disease is to ensure that scientific and technological advances in molecular diagnostics and bioinformatics are we...","To date, official data on the number of people infected with the SARS-CoV-2 , responsible for the CoViD19 , have been released by the Italian Government just on the basis of a non representative sample of population which tested positive for the swab. However a reliable estimation of the number of infected, including asymptomatic people, turns out to be crucial in the preparation of operational schemes and to estimate the future number of people, who will require, to different extents, medical attentions. In order to overcome the current data shortcoming, this paper proposes a bootstrap driven, estimation procedure for the number of people infected with the SARSCoV2. This method is designed to be robust, automatic and suitable to generate estimations at regional level. Obtained results show that, while official data at March the 12th report 12.839 cases in Italy, people infected wiyh the SARSCoV2 could be as high as 105.789.","Abstract Since the middle of December 2019, human-to-human transmission of novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP) has occurred among close contacts. At the same time, greater attention should be paid to psychological crisis intervention (PCI) among affected populations, for the timely prevention of inestimable damage from a secondary psychological crisis. PCI has been initiated via remote (telephone and internet) and onsite medical services to help medical workers, patients, and others affected to overcome any psychological difficulties. This paper outlines experiences based on the work of the Shanghai Medical Team.","Global airline networks play a key role in the global importation of emerging infectious diseases. Detailed information on air traffic between international airports has been demonstrated to be useful in retrospectively validating and prospectively predicting case emergence in other countries. In this paper, we use a well-established metric known as effective distance on the global air traffic data from IATA to quantify risk of emergence for different countries as a consequence of direct importation from China, and compare it against arrival times for the first 24 countries. Using this model trained on official first reports from WHO, we estimate time of arrival (ToA) for all other countries. We then incorporate data on airline suspensions to recompute the effective distance and assess the effect of such cancellations in delaying the estimated arrival time for all other countries. Finally we use the infectious disease vulnerability indices to explain some of the estimated reporting del...","We present a timely evaluation of the Chinese 2019-nCov epidemic in its initial phase, where 2019-nCov demonstrates comparable transmissibility but lower fatality rates than SARS and MERS. A quick diagnosis that leads to case isolation and integrated interventions will have a major impact on its future trend. Nevertheless, as China is facing its Spring Festival travel rush and the epidemic has spread beyond its borders, further investigation on its potential spatiotemporal transmission pattern and novel intervention strategies are warranted.","BACKGROUND: In response to global concerns about the largest Ebola virus disease (EVD), outbreak to-date in West Africa documented healthcare associated transmission and the risk of global spread, the International Society of Chemotherapy (ISC) Infection Control Working Group created an Ebola Infection Control Readiness Checklist to assess the preparedness of institutions around the globe. We report data from the electronic checklist that was disseminated to medical professionals from October to December 2014 and identify action needed towards better preparedness levels. FINDINGS: Data from 192 medical professionals (one third from Africa) representing 125 hospitals in 45 countries around the globe were obtained through a specifically developed electronic survey. The survey contained 76 specific questions in 7 major sections: Administrative/operational support; Communications; Education and audit; Human resources, Supplies, Infection Prevention and Control practices and Clinical manage...","As the Coronavirus (COVID-19) expands its impact from China, expanding its catchment into surrounding regions and other countries, increased national and international measures are being taken to contain the outbreak. The placing of entire cities in \u2018lockdown\u2019 directly affects urban economies on a multi-lateral level, including from social and economic standpoints. This is being emphasised as the outbreak gains ground in other countries, leading towards a global health emergency, and as global collaboration is sought in numerous quarters. However, while effective protocols in regard to the sharing of health data is emphasised, urban data, on the other hand, specifically relating to urban health and safe city concepts, is still viewed from a nationalist perspective as solely benefiting a nation\u2019s economy and its economic and political influence.
