It is used by weaker sections of society, such as marginal farmers as insurance against crop failure, for ready cash and to ensure basic economic returns and the empowerment of women and children. However, backyard farming does not appear to be a promising strategy to achieve the poverty reduction until the production level is increased. The major constraint in increasing the production in backyard birds is microbial infection due to lack of biosecurity knowledge among the farmers. The mitigation of the microbial infection depends on the detection of the infection route and its prevention. The source of microbial infection (Salmonella, Escherichia coli) and their dissemination through the eggs in backyard flocks kept in different agroclimatic zones of West Bengal, a major egg producing state in India, was identified. The pattern of virulence gene specially associated with urina...","In the past twenty years, numerous novel zoonotic viral agents with pandemic potential have emerged in China, such as the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus and, more recently, the avian-origin influenza A/H7N9 virus, which have caused outbreaks among humans with high morbidity and mortality. In addition, several emerging and re-emerging viral pathogens have also been imported into China from travelers, e.g. the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus and Zika virus (ZIKV). Herein, we review these emerging viral pathogens in China and focus on how surveillance by pathogen genomics has been employed to discover and annotate novel pathogenic agents, identify natural reservoirs, monitor the transmission events and delineate their evolution and adaption to the human host. We also highlight the application of genomic sequencing in the recent Ebola epidemics in Western Africa. In summary, genomic sequencing has become a standard research tool in the field of eme...","The capacity to injure infected cells is a widespread property of viruses. Usually, this cytopathic effect (CPE) is ascribed to viral hijacking of cellular resources to fulfill viral needs. However, evidence is accumulating that CPE is not necessarily directly coupled to viral reproduction but may largely be due to host defensive and viral antidefensive activities. A major part in this virus\u2013cell interaction appears to be played by a putative host-encoded program with multiple competing branches, leading to necrotic, apoptotic, and, possibly, other types of cell suicide. Manifestations of this program are controlled and modulated by host, viral, and environmental factors.","Middle East Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is a novel coronavirus discovered in 2012 and is responsible for acute respiratory syndrome in humans. Though not confirmed yet, multiple surveillance and phylogenetic studies suggest a bat origin. The disease is heavily endemic in dromedary camel populations of East Africa and the Middle East. It is unclear as to when the virus was introduced to dromedary camels, but data from studies that investigated stored dromedary camel sera and geographical distribution of involved dromedary camel populations suggested that the virus was present in dromedary camels several decades ago. Though bats and alpacas can serve as potential reservoirs for MERS-CoV, dromedary camels seem to be the only animal host responsible for the spill over human infections.","Abstract There are many diseases for which a microbial aetiology is suspected. The hypothesis that a disease has an infectious cause is supported by: clinical features (similar to those of known infectious diseases, e.g. fever, leucocytosis), epidemiology (case clustering in time or location), histology (inflammation of affected tissues, e.g. granulomata) or characteristic microbial structures, treatment (clinical response to antimicrobial treatment), and prevention of disease by vaccines targeting microbial antigens. Proof that a microbe causes a disease requires more rigorous evidence. Future attempts to identify novel microbes associated with human disease may use sequence-based approaches. High-throughput sequencing may allow identification of unique microbial nucleic acid sequences in a background of host DNA. The complete sequencing of the human genome and multiple microbial genomes make this approach more feasible. DNA microarrays are also likely to be used in the search for nov...","Bats are being increasingly recognized as an important reservoir of zoonotic viruses of different families, including SARS coronavirus, Nipah virus, Hendra virus and Ebola virus. Several recent studies hypothesized that bats, an ancient group of flying mammals, are the major reservoir of several important RNA virus families from which other mammalian viruses of livestock and humans were derived. Although this hypothesis needs further investigation, the premise that bats carry a large number of viruses is commonly accepted. The question of whether bats have unique biological features making them ideal reservoir hosts has been the subject of several recent reviews. In this review, we will focus on the public health implications of bat derived zoonotic viral disease outbreaks, examine the drivers and risk factors of past disease outbreaks and outline research directions for better control of future disease events.","BACKGROUND: Coronavirus can cross the species barrier and infect humans with a severe respiratory syndrome. SARS-CoV-2 with potential origin of bat is still circulating in China. In this study, a prediction model is proposed to evaluate the infection risk of non-human-origin coronavirus for early warning. METHODS: The spike protein sequences of 2666 coronaviruses were collected from 2019 Novel Coronavirus Resource (2019nCoVR) Database of China National Genomics Data Center on Jan 29, 2020. A total of 507 human-origin viruses were regarded as positive samples, whereas 2159 non-human-origin viruses were regarded as negative. To capture the key information of the spike protein, three feature encoding algorithms (amino acid composition, AAC; parallel correlation-based pseudo-amino-acid composition, PC-PseAAC and G-gap dipeptide composition, GGAP) were used to train 41 random forest models. The optimal feature with the best performance was identified by the multidimensional scaling method, ...","Summary Emerging and re-emerging zoonoses are a significant public health concern and cause considerable socioeconomic problems globally. The emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1, avian influenza H7N9, and severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS), and the re-emergence of rabies, brucellosis, and other zoonoses have had a significant effect on the national economy and public health in China, and have affected other countries. Contributing factors that continue to affect emerging and re-emerging zoonoses in China include social and environmental factors and microbial evolution, such as population growth, urbanization, deforestation, livestock production, food safety, climate change, and pathogen mutation. The Chinese government has devised new strategies and has taken measures to deal with the challenges of these diseases, including the issuing of laws and regulations, establishment of disease reporting systems, im...","Bats have been identified as a natural reservoir for an increasing number of emerging zoonotic viruses, including henipaviruses and variants of rabies viruses. Recently, we and another group independently identified several horseshoe bat species (genus Rhinolophus) as the reservoir host for a large number of viruses that have a close genetic relationship with the coronavirus associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). Our current research focused on the identification of the reservoir species for the progenitor virus of the SARS coronaviruses responsible for outbreaks during 2002\u20132003 and 2003\u20132004. In addition to SARS-like coronaviruses, many other novel bat coronaviruses, which belong to groups 1 and 2 of the 3 existing coronavirus groups, have been detected by PCR. The discovery of bat SARS-like coronaviruses and the great genetic diversity of coronaviruses in bats have shed new light on the origin and transmission of SARS coronaviruses.","BACKGROUND: Prior to emergence in human populations, zoonoses such as SARS cause occasional infections in human populations exposed to reservoir species. The risk of widespread epidemics in humans can be assessed by monitoring the reproduction number R (average number of persons infected by a human case). However, until now, estimating R required detailed outbreak investigations of human clusters, for which resources and expertise are not always available. Additionally, existing methods do not correct for important selection and under-ascertainment biases. Here, we present simple estimation methods that overcome many of these limitations. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Our approach is based on a parsimonious mathematical model of disease transmission and only requires data collected through routine surveillance and standard case investigations. We apply it to assess the transmissibility of swine-origin influenza A H3N2v-M virus in the US, Nipah virus in Malaysia and Bangladesh, and also present...","Abstract Farmers attempting to reduce first-calving age (FCA) need to understand which rearing management factors influence FCA and first-lactation milk production (FLP). Reduced FCA might be associated with lower FLP. This study describes the association between herd FCA, FLP, and several herd-level health and rearing management variables and describes the association between FCA and FLP at the cow level. It uses data from a 2010 survey of 100 Dutch dairy farms about general management, colostrum and milk feeding, housing, cleanliness, healthcare, disease, and breeding. It also used available data on FCA and 305-d FLP at both cow and herd level. The associations between median FCA and median FLP of the herd and herd-level health and rearing management variables were determined using multivariate regression analysis. The median FCA was associated with minimum age of first insemination, feeding of waste milk, and the amount of milk given preweaning. The median FLP was associated with me...","Infections with bat-origin coronaviruses have caused severe illness in humans by \u2018host jump\u2019. Recently, novel bat-origin coronaviruses were found in pigs. The large number of mutations on the receptor-binding domain allowed the viruses to infect the new host, posing a potential threat to both agriculture and public health.","In 2007, a novel coronavirus associated with an acute respiratory disease in alpacas (Alpaca Coronavirus, ACoV) was isolated. Full-length genomic sequencing of the ACoV demonstrated the genome to be consistent with other Alphacoronaviruses. A putative additional open-reading frame was identified between the nucleocapsid gene and 3'UTR. The ACoV was genetically most similar to the common human coronavirus (HCoV) 229E with 92.2% nucleotide identity over the entire genome. A comparison of spike gene sequences from ACoV and from HCoV-229E isolates recovered over a span of five decades showed the ACoV to be most similar to viruses isolated in the 1960\u2019s to early 1980\u2019s. The true origin of the ACoV is unknown, however a common ancestor between the ACoV and HCoV-229E appears to have existed prior to the 1960\u2019s, suggesting virus transmission, either as a zoonosis or anthroponosis, has occurred between alpacas and humans.","Abstract The development of rapid, accurate, and sensitive diagnostic methods for detecting pathogens is the basis for treating, controlling, and eradicating infectious diseases of veterinary importance. Scientific and technological advancements have revolutionized the field of veterinary diagnostics. Genome sequencing has allowed efficient, sensitive, and specific diagnostic assays to be developed based on the detection of nucleic acids. The integration of advances in biochemistry, proteomics, engineering, and medicine offers enormous potential for the rapid and accurate diagnosis of viral, microbial, genetic, and metabolic disease. In the future, polymerase chain reaction assays, microarray testing, genomic analysis, and metabolic profiling will be accomplished in a rapid, portable, sensitive, and cost-efficient manner.","Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is one of the major threats to the healthcare systems in some countries, especially in the Arabian Peninsula. MERS-CoV is considered an ideal example of the One Health concept. This is due to the animals, especially dromedary camels, play important roles in the transmission and sustainability of the virus, and the virus can be transmitted through aerosols of infected patients into the environment. However, there is some debate regarding the origin of MERS-CoV either from bats or other unknown reservoirs. The dromedary camel is the only identified animal reservoir to date. These animals play important roles in sustaining the virus in certain communities and may act as an amplifier of the virus by secreting it in their body fluids, especially in nasal and rectal discharges. MERS-CoV has been detected in the nasal and rectal secretions of infected camels, and MERS-CoV of this origin has full capacity to infect human airway epithelium...","Protein disordered regions are segments of a protein chain that do not adopt a stable structure. Thus far, a variety of protein disorder prediction methods have been developed and have been widely used, not only in traditional bioinformatics domains, including protein structure prediction, protein structure determination and function annotation, but also in many other biomedical fields. The relationship between intrinsically-disordered proteins and some human diseases has played a significant role in disorder prediction in disease identification and epidemiological investigations. Disordered proteins can also serve as potential targets for drug discovery with an emphasis on the disordered-to-ordered transition in the disordered binding regions, and this has led to substantial research in drug discovery or design based on protein disordered region prediction. Furthermore, protein disorder prediction has also been applied to healthcare by predicting the disease risk of mutations in patie...","Abstract A strain of bovine coronavirus (BC) adapted to tissue culture, was inoculated into organ cultures of bovine foetal trachea. Haemagglutinin in the fluid from infected organ cultures reached titres of 32 and characteristic coronavirus particles were observed electron microscopically. BC virus antigen was detected in frozen sections of the organ cultures by staining with fluorescent antibody. These data were evidence that BC virus replicated in organ cultures of respiratory tissue. The use of this technique for primary isolation of bovine coronaviruses from field material is discussed.","Abstract Analyses of turkey coronavirus (TCoV), an enteric disease virus that is highly similar to infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) an upper-respiratory tract disease virus in chickens, were conducted to determine the adaptive potential, and genetic changes associated with emergence of this group 3 coronavirus. Strains of TCoV that were pathogenic in poults and nonpathogenic in chickens did not adapt to cause disease in chickens. Comparative genomics revealed two recombination sites that replaced the spike gene in IBV with an unidentified sequence likely from another coronavirus, resulting in cross-species transmission and a pathogenicity shift. Following emergence in turkeys, TCoV diverged to different serotypes through the accumulation of mutations within spike. This is the first evidence that recombination can directly lead to the emergence of new coronaviruses and new coronaviral diseases, emphasizing the importance of limiting exposure to reservoirs of coronaviruses that can serv...","Abstract During the first few months of 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic has reached Europe. Health systems all over the world are trying to control the outbreak in the shortest possible time. Exotic disease outbreaks are not uncommon in animal health and randomised surveillance is frequently used as support for decision-making. This editorial discusses the possibilities of practicing One Health, by using methods from animal health to enhance surveillance for COVID-19 to provide an evidence base fort decision-making in communities and countries.","","Abstract COVID-19 is a viral respiratory illness caused by a new coronavirus called SARS-CoV-2. The World Health Organization declared the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak a global public health emergency. We performed genetic analyses of eighty-six complete or near-complete genomes of SARS-CoV-2 and revealed many mutations and deletions on coding and non-coding regions. These observations provided evidence of the genetic diversity and rapid evolution of this novel coronavirus.","Abstract This paper reviews the impact of infections on the onset and clinical course of bronchial asthma. A just emphasis is given to the role viral infections, particularly rhinovirus infections, play in exacerbations, and that played by respiratory syncytial virus, suspected of triggering the asthmatic syndrome. The mechanisms of the immune response to virus attacks are explained, highlighting the asthmatic and allergic patient's weakened response, particularly in the perinatal period. Further stressed is a potentiating effect of viral aggression on the allergic response. The hygiene hypothesis and its lack of scientific consistency is detailed, at least as far as the role it seeks to confer on an unproven antagonism of the Th1 and Th2 lymphocyte responses. The current importance of research not into bacteria, but into bacterial products, including endotoxins, on the modulation of asthma and allergy is noted. Studies which, along these lines, show an environmental impact on genetic ...","Objectives: The novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) originating from Wuhan has rapidly spread throughout China. While the origin of the outbreak remains uncertain, accumulating evidence links a wet market in Wuhan for the early spread of 2019-nCoV. Similarly, the influence of the marketplace on the early transmission dynamics is yet to be investigated. Methods: Using the daily series of COVID-19 incidenceincluding contact history with the market, we have conducted quantitative modeling analyses to estimate the reproduction numbers (R) for the market-to-human and human-to-human transmission together with the reporting probability and the early effects of public health interventions. Results: Our mean R estimates for China in 2019-2020 are estimated at 0.37 (95%CrI: 0.02-1.78) for market-to-human transmission, and 3.87 (95%CrI: 3.18-4.78) for human-to-human transmission, respectively. Moreover we estimated that the reporting rate cases stemming from market-to-human transmission was 3-31 fold h...","Abstract On the Internet, there is a lot of open access information related to infectious diseases, e.g., official announcement, media news, bulletin boards, blogs, and other social media. If proper data retrieval and screening methods were applied on these Internet-based data, it would be very useful to improve the timeliness of early detection for infectious diseases. In China, we practice early warning using Internet-based data with routine intelligence screening assessment every day, and respond to any unusual event in a timely manner. Through this mechanism, the surveillance and early warning of Internet-based data for infectious disease and public health emergency plays an important supplemental role to the traditional surveillance systems.","Summary The Zika epidemic in the Americas has challenged surveillance and control. As the epidemic appears to be waning, it is unclear whether transmission is still ongoing, which is exacerbated by discrepancies in reporting. To uncover locations with lingering outbreaks, we investigated travel-associated Zika cases to identify transmission not captured by reporting. We uncovered an unreported outbreak in Cuba during 2017, a year after peak transmission in neighboring islands. By sequencing Zika virus, we show that the establishment of the virus was delayed by a year and that the ensuing outbreak was sparked by long-lived lineages of Zika virus from other Caribbean islands. Our data suggest that, although mosquito control in Cuba may initially have been effective at mitigating Zika virus transmission, such measures need to be maintained to be effective. Our study highlights how Zika virus may still be \u201csilently\u201d spreading and provides a framework for understanding outbreak dynamics. Vi...","Known human coronaviruses are believed to have originated in animals and made use of intermediate hosts for transmission to humans. The intermediate hosts of most of the human coronaviruses are known, but not for HCoV-NL63. This study aims to assess the possible role of some major domestic livestock species as intermediate hosts of HCoV-NL63. We developed a testing algorithm for high throughput screening of livestock sera with ELISA and confirmation with recombinant immunofluorescence assay testing for antibodies against HCoV-NL63 in livestock. Optimization of the ELISA showed a capability of the assay to significantly distinguish HCoV-NL63 from HCoV-229E (U = 27.50, p &lt; 0.001) and HCoV-OC43 (U = 55.50, p &lt; 0.001) in coronavirus-characterized sera. Evaluation of the assay with collected human samples showed no significant difference in mean optical density values of immunofluorescence-classified HCoV-NL63-positive and HCoV-NL63-negative samples (F (1, 215) = 0.437, p = 0.509). All the ...","The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 has resulted in more than 200,000 infections and nearly 9,000 deaths globally so far. This novel virus is thought to have originated from an animal reservoir, and acquired the ability to infect human cells using the SARS-CoV cell receptor hACE2. In the wake of a global pandemic it is essential to improve our understanding of the evolutionary dynamics surrounding the origin and spread of a novel infectious disease. One way theory predicts selection pressures should shape viral evolution is to enhance binding with host cells. We first assessed evolutionary dynamics in select betacoronavirus spike protein genes to predict where these genomic regions are under directional or purifying selection between divergent viral lineages at various scales of relatedness. With this analysis, we determine a region inside the receptor-binding domain with putative sites under positive selection interspersed among highly conserved sites, which are implicated in structural stabi...","","Abstract There have been rapid recent developments in establishing methods for identifying and characterising viruses associated with animal and human diseases. These methodologies, commonly based on hybridisation or PCR techniques, are combined with advanced sequencing techniques termed \u2018next generation sequencing\u2019. Allied advances in data analysis, including the use of computational transcriptome subtraction, have also impacted the field of viral pathogen discovery. This review details these molecular detection techniques, discusses their application in viral discovery, and provides an overview of some of the novel viruses discovered. The problems encountered in attributing disease causality to a newly identified virus are also considered.","Abstract This chapter provides an overview of the basic theory of early warning for infectious diseases, including definitions of surveillance, early warning and prediction; the characteristics of early warning (surveillance, information for action, timeliness, insufficiency, and the uncertainty of information); a conceptual framework of an early warning system for infectious diseases (the target setting, data collection and analysis, disseminating early warning signals, response actions, and evaluation); classifying early warning based on the data sources (case-based, event-based, laboratory-based, or syndromic surveillance). The significance of early warning for infectious diseases, the status quo and research and application trends in the field are also highlighted.","The emergence of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) highlights the zoonotic potential of Betacoronaviruses. Investigations into the origin of MERS-CoV have focused on two potential reservoirs: bats and camels. Here, we investigated the role of bats as a potential reservoir for MERS-CoV. In vitro, the MERS-CoV spike glycoprotein interacted with Jamaican fruit bat (Artibeus jamaicensis) dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) receptor and MERS-CoV replicated efficiently in Jamaican fruit bat cells, suggesting there is no restriction at the receptor or cellular level for MERS-CoV. To shed light on the intrinsic host-virus relationship, we inoculated 10 Jamaican fruit bats with MERS-CoV. Although all bats showed evidence of infection, none of the bats showed clinical signs of disease. Virus shedding was detected in the respiratory and intestinal tract for up to 9 days. MERS-CoV replicated transiently in the respiratory and, to a lesser extent, the intestinal tracts and internal ...","SUMMARYA novel coronavirus (nCoV-2019) was the cause of an outbreak of respiratory illness detected in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China in December of 2019. Genomic analyses of nCoV-2019 determined a 96% resemblance with a coronavirus isolated from a bat in 2013 (RaTG13); however, the receptor binding motif (RBM) of these two genomes share low sequence similarity. This divergence suggests a possible alternative source for the RBM coding sequence in nCoV-2019. We identified high sequence similarity in the RBM between nCoV-2019 and a coronavirus genome reconstructed from a viral metagenomic dataset from pangolins possibly indicating a more complex origin for nCoV-2019.","Abstract Recent publications have brought attention to the possible benefit of chloroquine, a broadly used antimalarial drug, in the treatment of patients infected by the novel emerged coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2). The scientific community should consider this information in light of previous experiments with chloroquine in the field of antiviral research.","","The study of virus evolution has historically been concerned with disease and its emergence and has not been integrated into the general study of evolution. Yet viruses dominate our planet and their evolution is a broad and applied field that can be studied in the real time (such HIV in human disease) and can also be applied to biotechnological problems. Virus evolution is very similar, but not identical, to host evolution. Darwinian principles apply, such as with Fisher population genetics, but other features, such as reticulated and quasispecies-based evolution, distinguish virus evolution. In RNA viruses, high error rates have led to the quasispecies concept in which collective populations are the basis of evolution. These populations provide viruses with high capacities for adaptation. Yet some RNA viruses show remarkable evolutionary stability. With DNA viruses, especially of bacteria, extensive recombination defines vast dynamic and ancient genetic pools. Temperate viruses can di...","To investigate bat coronaviruses (CoVs), we collected 132 rectal swabs and urine samples from five bat species in three countries in southwestern China. Seven CoVs belonging to distinct groups of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like CoVs and \u03b1-CoVs were detected in samples from least horseshoe bats. Samples from other bat species were negative for these viruses, indicating that the least horseshoe bat represents one of the natural reservoirs and mixers for strains of CoVs and has a pivotal role in the evolution and dissemination of these viruses. The genetic and evolutionary characteristics of these strains were described. Whole-genome sequencing of a new isolate (F46) from a rectal swab from a least horseshoe bat showed that it contained 29 699 nucleotides, excluding the poly (A) tail, with 13 open reading frames (ORFs). Phylogenetic and recombination analyses of F46 provided evidence of natural recombination between bat SARS-like CoVs (Rs3367 and LYRa11) or SARS-CoV (BJ01), ...","The fourth outbreak of the Coronaviruses, known as the 2019-nCoV, has occurred in Wuhan city of Hubei province in China in December 2019. We propose a time-varying sparse vector autoregressive (VAR) model to retrospectively analyze and visualize the dyamic transmission routes of this outbreak in mainland China over January 31 - February 19, 2020. Our results demonstrate that the influential inter-province routes from Hubei have become unidentifiable since February 4, whereas the self-transmission in each province was accelerating over February 4-15. From February 16, all routes became less detectable, and no influential transmissions could be identified on February 18 and 19. Such evidence supports the effectiveness of government interventions, including the travel restrictions in Hubei. Implications of our results suggest that in addition to the origin of the outbreak, virus preventions are of crucial importance in provinces with the largest migrant workers percentages (e.g., Jiangxi,...","Abstract Lipid rafts often serve as an entry site for certain viruses. Here, we report that lipid rafts in Vero E6 cells are involved in the entry of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV). Infectivity assay showed the integrity of lipid rafts was required for productive infection of pseudotyped SARS-CoV. Depletion of plasma membrane cholesterol with M\u03b2CD relocalized raft-resident marker caveolin-1 as well as SARS-CoV receptor ACE2 to a nonraft environment, but did not significantly change the surface expression of ACE2. M\u03b2CD-treatment inhibited infectivity of pseudotyped SARS-CoV by 90%. Biochemical fractionation and confocal imaging confirmed that ACE2 colocalized with raft-resident markers. Furthermore, an ectodomain of SARS-CoV S protein (S1188HA) could associate with lipid rafts after binding to its receptor, and colocalize with raft-resident marker ganglioside GM1. The binding of S1188HA was not affected by depleting plasma membrane cholesterol. Taken together, ...","","Summary Emerging infectious diseases arising from livestock and wildlife pose serious threats to global human health, as shown by a series of continuous outbreaks involving highly pathogenic influenza, SARS, Ebola and MERS. The risk of pandemics and bioterrorism threats is ever present and growing, but our ability to combat them is limited by the lack of available vaccines, therapeutics and rapid diagnostics. The use of high bio-containment facilities, such as the CSIRO Australian Animal Health Laboratory, plays a key role studying these dangerous pathogens and facilitates the development of countermeasures. To combat diseases like MERS, we must take a holistic approach that involves the development of early biomarkers of infection, a suite of treatment options (vaccines, anti-viral drugs and antibody therapeutics) and appropriate animal models to test the safety and efficacy of candidate treatments.","The pandemic of the COVID-19 disease extended from China across the north-temperate zone, and more recently to the tropics and southern hemisphere. We find no evidence that spread rates decline with temperatures above 20 oC, suggesting that the COVID-19 disease is unlikely to behave as a seasonal respiratory virus.","","","The epidemic of 2019 novel coronavirus, later named as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is still gradually spreading worldwide. The nucleic acid test or genetic sequencing serves as the gold standard method for confirmation of infection, yet several recent studies have reported false-negative results of real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR). Here, we report two representative false-negative cases and discuss the supplementary role of clinical data with rRT-PCR, including laboratory examination results and computed tomography features. Coinfection with SARS-COV-2 and other viruses has been discussed as well.","","Abstract Bats are the natural reservoirs of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) which caused the outbreak of human SARS in 2002\u20132003. We introduce the genetic diversity of SARS-related coronaviruses (SARSr-CoVs) discovered in bats and provide insights on the bat origin of human SARS. We also analyze the viral geographical structure that may improve our understanding of the evolution of bat SARSr-CoVs.","","The outbreak of pneumonia caused by the 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) was reported in Wuhan City, China. However, the clinical symptoms varied in different reports. Based on the results of inter-group difference test, we found that the incidence of diarrhea differed in three recent reports. As 2019-nCoV utilizes the same cell entry receptor ACE2 as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and ACE2 tightly controls intestinal inflammation, to trace the route of infection mediated by 2019-nCoV, we used the single-cell RNA sequencing data for analysis. We found that the ACE2 mRNA was highly expressed in the healthy human small intestine rather than the lung. Besides, single-cell RNA sequencing data showed that ACE2 was significantly elevated in the proximal and distal enterocytes, where the small intestinal epithelium is exposed to the foreign pathogen. Thus, we suspect that ACE2-expressing small intestinal epithelium cells might be vulnerable to 2019-nCoV infection w...","BACKGROUND: Wild birds are an important but to some extent under-studied reservoir for emerging pathogens. We used unbiased sequencing methods for virus discovery in shorebird samples from the Delaware Bay, USA; an important feeding ground for thousands of migratory birds. FINDINGS: Analysis of shorebird fecal samples indicated the presence of a novel astrovirus and coronavirus. A sanderling sample yielded sequences with distant homology to avian nephritis virus 1, an astrovirus associated with acute nephritis in poultry. A ruddy turnstone sample yielded sequences with homology to deltacoronaviruses. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings highlight shorebirds as a virus reservoir and the need to closely monitor wild bird populations for the emergence of novel virus variants.","Summary Background A new betacoronavirus\u2014Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV)\u2014has been identified in patients with severe acute respiratory infection. Although related viruses infect bats, molecular clock analyses have been unable to identify direct ancestors of MERS-CoV. Anecdotal exposure histories suggest that patients had been in contact with dromedary camels or goats. We investigated possible animal reservoirs of MERS-CoV by assessing specific serum antibodies in livestock. Methods We took sera from animals in the Middle East (Oman) and from elsewhere (Spain, Netherlands, Chile). Cattle (n=80), sheep (n=40), goats (n=40), dromedary camels (n=155), and various other camelid species (n=34) were tested for specific serum IgG by protein microarray using the receptor-binding S1 subunits of spike proteins of MERS-CoV, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, and human coronavirus OC43. Results were confirmed by virus neutralisation tests for MERS-CoV and bovine ..."],"title":["Chapter 14 Biosecurity Strategies for Backyard Poultry: A Controlled Way for Safe Food Production","Pathogen genomic surveillance elucidates the origins, transmission and evolution of emerging viral agents in China","Cytopathic effects: virus-modulated manifestations of innate immunity?","Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) origin and animal reservoir","The infectious aetiology of disease: the search for new agents","Bats and their virome: an important source of emerging viruses capable of infecting humans","Using the spike protein feature to predict infection risk and monitor the evolutionary dynamic of coronavirus","Major emerging and re-emerging zoonoses in China: a matter of global health and socioeconomic development for 1.3 billion","Review of Bats and SARS","Using Routine Surveillance Data to Estimate the Epidemic Potential of Emerging Zoonoses: Application to the Emergence of US Swine Origin Influenza A H3N2v Virus","First-calving age and first-lactation milk production on Dutch dairy farms","Bat-Origin Coronaviruses Expand Their Host Range to Pigs","Identification and Characterization of a Novel Alpaca Respiratory Coronavirus Most Closely Related to the Human Coronavirus 229E","Future Veterinary Diagnostics","Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus and the One Health concept","An Overview of Practical Applications of Protein Disorder Prediction and Drive for Faster, More Accurate Predictions","Replication of a bovine coronavirus in organ cultures of foetal trachea","Emergence of a group 3 coronavirus through recombination","Surveillance to improve evidence for community control decisions during the COVID-19 pandemic \u2013 Opening the animal epidemic toolbox for public health","Single-cell RNA sequencing data suggest a role for angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 in kidney impairment in patients infected with 2019-nCoV","Genetic diversity and evolution of SARS-CoV-2","The role of infection in asthma","Transmissibility of 2019 Novel Coronavirus: zoonotic vs. human to human transmission, China, 2019-2020","Chapter 12 Early Warning Practice Using Internet-Based Data","Travel Surveillance and Genomics Uncover a Hidden Zika Outbreak during the Waning Epidemic","Development of a Whole-Virus ELISA for Serological Evaluation of Domestic Livestock as Possible Hosts of Human Coronavirus NL63","SARS-CoV-2, an evolutionary perspective of interaction with human ACE2 reveals undiscovered amino acids necessary for complex stability","Microbial molecular markers and epidemiological surveillance in the era of high throughput sequencing: an update from the IMMEM-10 conference","Metagenomics and the molecular identification of novel viruses","Chapter 1 Introduction","Replication and shedding of MERS-CoV in Jamaican fruit bats (Artibeus jamaicensis)","Evidence of recombination in coronaviruses implicating pangolin origins of nCoV-2019","Of chloroquine and COVID-19","Comparative genetic analysis of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV/SARS-CoV-2) receptor ACE2 in different populations","Evolution of Viruses","Discovery and genetic analysis of novel coronaviruses in least horseshoe bats in southwestern China","How does the outbreak of 2019-nCoV spread in mainland China?

Bushmeat consumption and animal trading, arising from the growing demand of animal protein, causes significant changes at the human-animal reservoir interface (7). Among the BPDs, studies demonstrate that the SARS and EVD outbreaks were directly linked to the consumption of infected bushmeat (8, 9) . LF, MVD and EVD flourish in West and central Africa where the consumption of bushmeat is four times greater than the Amazon, which is richer in biodiversity (10) . Moreover, EIDs are also triggered by anthropogenic pressures on land use for agricultural expansion and livestock farming to meet the demand of a growing human population. The fruit-bat migration driven by the deforestation through forest fires in the islands of Sumatra lead to the emergence of Nipah disease in farmers and abattoir workers in Malaysia (11, 12) . Once sufficient infection cycles between human-animal without the sustainable transmission among humans termed as viral chatter is established, the emergence of human-tohuman transmission is inevitable (7). Mathematical modeling and prediction provides quick assessment for control and potential preventive efforts when time for epidemiological studies is scarce (13) . Modeling of infection dynamics analyses diseases outbreaks in animal population and estimates the rate of transmission as well as the potential chance of spillover. Yet, the increasing trends of EIDs risks surpass our capacity in the surveillance and detection of spillovers and outbreaks. Thus, the current public health response to EIDs is to \"get ahead of the curve\" and the growing resolution of satellite imagery has shifted the paradigm towards identifying potential environmental drivers such as deforestation, land fragmentation, biodiversity loss and climate change rather than the surveillance of the EIDs themselves.","For example, understanding human behaviors and practices at the interface of tropical forests and villages could help us to interpret how zoonotic transmission happens. Through acting upon these behaviors and habits, we could lower this type of emerging risk. Currently EcoHealth Alliance has research sites in Uganda, Malaysia and Brazil; they are investigating the role played by habitat changes such as deforestation, human interaction with biodiversity through behavior and use. In Manaus in Brazil for example, the maximum risk of new infection is not in the heart of the city where the major markets are located, but in the peri-urban areas where agriculture and ranching are developing. These zones which ecologists call ''ecotones'', or transition zones, are located near strongly species-rich regions, with high concentrations of livestock which can come into contact with wild fauna, and which are furthermore inhabited by ranchers and farmers. These regions which are now located everywhere in the intertropical world for the purpose of feeding urban populations, are generally those where new infections appear, and where future pandemics will also most likely appear. At the heart of this research is the priority of understanding behaviors, habits and practices of populations with the goal of changing these factors. This is a long-term endeavor which requires developing approaches in the field for communicating with local populations, and for developing community participation in our own research, which we also consider an excellent means of education. O. Borraz recalled the fact that we live in a society of risk. It is not that the dangers surrounding us are more numerous or more fearsome than before, but simply that the notion of risk plays a central role in public policies, in public and private organizational management, and in the controversies around new technologies. Genetically modified organisms, mobile phones, nuclear waste, urban sanitation sludge; the activities now considered health or environmental risks are countless. This categorization puts public authorities in a position of having to ensure the safety of populations, even as the State itself sometimes represents a risk factor. It is therefore essential to understand how an activity becomes a risk, and how it is then managed by public authorities as well as by companies, associations and local conglomerates. Risk from its identification to its management, from its highlighting to its instrumentalization becomes a tool linked to the emergence and expansion of a welfare state. It is used by politicians to justify on the one hand its lack of involvement in risk management, on the other the seizing of power over sectors from which they had previously disengaged. This political power seizure plays on politicians' selective dissemination within society of risk identification and the knowledge required for its management.","Reports of community-associated meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA) infections among healthy persons who have had no recent contact with healthcare and who have none of the traditional risk factors for MRSA infection have been increasing at a substantial rate in the last 7 years. Children in daycare, sports participants, military recruits, prisoners in institutional settings, pig farmers, and men who have sex with men are among the many diverse groups who appear to be at risk for CA-MRSA infections. While these are primarily skin and soft tissue infections, severe and rapidly fatal syndromes, including necrotising pneumonia, also have been reported, particularly among young adults. The pulsed-field gel electrophoresis type USA300 (ST-8; SCCmec type IV) is prominent among CA-MRSA infections in the United States, and recent evidence confirms that USA300 has spread to Europe, South America, and the Pacific Islands. Genomic sequencing data from multiple USA300 isolates confirm the dramatic clonal expansion of the USA300 MRSA strain, which has been the predominant strain type isolated both from patients with invasive CA-MRSA infections and from patients presenting to emergency departments with uncomplicated skin infections. However, data on the virulence of USA300 strains and the outcomes of CA-MRSA infections are quite divergent. Is this really a fearful new epidemic strain, or is CA-MRSA more a media event than a medical problem?","The Chinese Ministry of Health (CMH) issued a technical guide for avian flu prevention and control in 2004 [21]. It requires that suspected and confirmed cases be handled quickly at designated hospitals with the equipment to prevent nosocomial infection. The epidemiological and etiological data of patients should be acquired to enable determination of human-to-human transmission capacity. The guide suggests that persons exposed to dead poultry infected by avian flu virus be isolated and observed for 7 days. In order to control zoonotic infectious diseases, China revised its Law on Animal Disease Prevention in 2007, adding an animal epidemic surveillance and reporting system for timely disclosure of animal epidemics and providing compensation to farmers for economic loss due to culling infected or potentially infected poultry [22].","Currently, the virus infects both humans and animals following tick bites [115]. However, a human can be infected by the animal through contact with the blood or tissues of the infected animal, in particular, exposures at the abattoirs are common. Therefore, workers in contact with animals (e.g., veterinarians, farmers\u2019 and workers in slaughterhouses) form a high percentage of those affected [87]. Also, different species of infected animals\u2014such as camels, cattle, sheep, goats, and ostriches\u2014might be infected with no clinical signs [83]. In addition, human-to-human transmission is also documented, mostly through a form of nosocomial or in-house infection [113,116,117,118].","Livestock production in China has expanded at an unprecedented rate over the past three decades. The consumption of pigs increased 3.7-fold from 160 million in 1978 to 610 million in 2008, of cattle increased 1.5-fold from 70 million to 106 million, of sheep and goats increased 1.65-fold from 170 million to 281 million, and of poultry increased 7.3-fold from 170 million to 9700 million. 57 Large-scale farms and scattered small-scale individual farms coexist in China, and the latter account for the majority. 58 Almost every household in rural areas is engaged in livestock production, including pigs, chickens, bovines, sheep, ducks, etc. Different domestic animals live in the same environment, which provides a dynamic micro-environment that contributes to interspecies transmission, even from animals to humans. 59, 60 Another example is human echinococcosis in Tibetan pastoral communities in western China, in which dogs, domestic animals (yaks, sheep, and goats), and wild animals living in the same environment are involved in the transmission cycle of Echinococcus granulosus and Echinococcus multilocularis, contributing to the high prevalence of human echinococcosis. 61 Due to the practice of scattered small-scale individual farming and the lack of meat inspection at such small operations, farmers often slaughter their animals for their own consumption. Compared with professionals in modern abattoirs, the local farmers do not wear protective clothing or gloves, resulting in high incidences of brucellosis infection in this population and other livestock-related occupations, such as herdsmen, coat and leatherworkers, and veterinarians. 37 On the other hand, the largescale farms, also termed concentrated animal feeding operations (CAFO), are increasing at an unprecedented rate in China, which will increase the risk of disease transmission.","Perhaps the biggest problem plaguing medical microbiology today is the rise of antibiotic resistance. There are many reasons why bacteria have developed this resistance, but all of the explanations have one thing in common: the proliferation and misuse of antibiotics. For instance, medical doctors often prescribe antibiotics to patients who have an infection, even if it is unknown whether the disease is bacterial. Other times, the wrong antibiotic is prescribed. In many developing countries, antibiotics can be bought over the counter without a prescription. Compounding the dilemma, patients who receive antibiotics often do not comply with the recommended dose, ending treatment as soon as they feel better. This has the effect of selecting for the survival of the bacteria that have already developed a slight resistance to the drug. When the patient propagates the infection, he unintentionally passes on these toughened survivors. The widespread use of antibiotics in animal feed-which farmers use to fatten up livestock-is also a major contributor to the problem. There have been reports from around the world of totally drug-resistant tuberculosis, which as the name implies, appears to be resistant to all treatment. In a 2013 report, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued an urgent warning about infections from (1) Clostridium difficile, which causes diarrhea and is often acquired by patients in healthcare settings who were treated with antibiotics for other infections;","LPAI is also transmitted from poultry to humans causing influenza-like syndrome (CDC, 2008) . Antibodies against H4 and H11 Avian influenza virus were detected in a small locality in Lebanon among the backyard farmers (Kayali et al., 2011) . There is serologic evidence that waterfowl hunters, wildlife professionals, and veterinarians are at higher risk of infection with LPAI (Gill et al., 2006; Myers et al., 2007) .","At the time of the cross-sectional study 85/116 herds were PMWS-affected, 44% (37) of these had been confirmed as PMWS positive by a laboratory (clinical signs, no other known cause and PCV2 antigen) and a further 51% (43) by the farmer's veterinarian (clinical signs, no other known cause and raised mortality). Most of the farms not laboratory confirmed were the outbreaks of PMWS that started during the 2001 foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) epidemic when routine diagnostic procedures were halted (Woodbine et al., 2007) . Ten of the 116 farmers considered that their farms had previously had the clinical signs mentioned above but were recovered (PMWS-recovered). Nineteen farmers reported that their herd had never raised postweaning mortality and pigs with the clinical signs, pallor and wasting (PMWS-unaffected), and 2 herds had unknown PMWS-status.","Chicken (Gallus sp.) is the most common species kept in backyard farming throughout the world. For example, the majority of the backyard farmers in Chile, New Zealand (North Island) and Egypt prefer to rear domestic chicken (Abdelwhab and Hafez, 2011; Hamilton-West et al., 2012; Zheng et al., 2010) . In Ethiopia, however, cattle are the most common species reared by backyard farmers, which is followed by chickens (Sambo et al., 2015) .","Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is a tick-borne viral infection that occurs in parts of Africa, Asia, eastern Europe, and the Middle East. 53 The virus belongs to the genus Nairovirus in the Bunyaviridae family. Isolates from different regions show considerable genetic diversity. Farmers and healthcare workers are particular at risk for this infection, but","Lastly, increased zoonotic pathogens surveillance, particularly influenza, during the Hajj season, increased infection control interventions, screening, and quarantine of suspected cases, provision of adequate medical treatment, sustainable awareness, increased education and training of target groups at high risk (e.g., doctors, nurses, veterinarians, and animal workers such as farmers and abattoir workers, etc.) are of great importance to reduce the burden of zoonoses among Saudi Arabian localities. Fortunately, in collaboration with three organizations\u2014including the MOH in Saudi Arabia, the USA Centers for Disease Control and prevention, and the WHO\u2014a successful preparedness plan during the Hajj season was put in place to vaccinate all pilgrims before leaving their home countries [68]. Altogether, there is an urgent need for collaborative surveillance and intervention plans for the control of zoonotic pathogens in Saudi Arabia.","In developing countries, the backyard poultry sector mostly suffers from two infectious diseases, such as Avian influenza (AI) and Newcastle disease (ND) due to lack of biosecurity and proper vaccination (Alexander, 2001) . Surveillance of infectious diseases (such as AI) in backyard and free-grazing poultry is challenging due to the reluctance of the farmers to report outbreaks (Kanamori and Jimba, 2007) .","The origin of 2019-nCoV merits in-depth investigations, with a few key questions that also need to be addressed thoroughly. (i) What is the molecular mechanism underlying the interspecies transmission of 2019-nCoV? How is this mechanism similar to, or distinct from, that associated with the emergence of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV? (ii) What is the role played by point mutation and recombination in the evolution of 2019-nCoV? Since coronaviruses can experience rapid mutation and frequent recombination, will these activities generate novel strains with heightened transmissibility and pathogenicity? (iii) How prevalent is the virus in its natural host, and does it possess the ability to infect other animals? This question is relevant because coronavirus originating in the bat has been found to cross the species barrier and infect pigs [9] , which are hypothesized to serve as the 'mixing vessels' for the generation of genetically novel viruses. The introduction of 2019-nCoV into livestock animals could pose a potential threat to both agriculture and public health.","Since zoonotic diseases can easily be transmitted to man in several ways, they target persons who work closely with animals; this plays a big role in zoonotic transmission. Such persons working with animals include veterinarians, slaughterers/butchers, farmers, researchers, pet owners (e.g., through bites and/or scratches of owners of indoor pet-animals), and animal feeders in animal companies using animal products, via animals used for food (e.g., meat, dairy, eggs, birds, infected domestic poultry, and other birds). Furthermore, transmission can also occur through animal vectors (e.g., tick bite, and insects like mosquitoes or flea) [4,14,15]. In addition, in the transmission of bacteria in comparison with viruses, the role of contaminated food and water, the importance of international travels as well as changes in land use and agriculture, are important [4,9]. According to recent WHO data, more than 75% of the different zoonotic diseases that may cause illnesses in humans are transmitted through animals and/or animal products [16]. Nevertheless, several zoonotic pathogens may be transmitted from various animals to man via several direct and/or indirect pathways such as close contact with the infected animals that might be shedding the infectious pathogen, when humans use contaminated sources of food or water, and/or by outdoor or indoor animal scratches or bites [17,18,19,20,21]. The prevention and control strategies against zoonotic pathogens are considered important issues and a global challenge requiring efforts of all veterinarian and medical staff [22].","The FAO had issued several guidelines for the farmers on how to increase biosecurity in backyard flocks, but a significant proportion of villagers continue their at-risk practices as observed in several countries (FAO, 2005 (FAO, , 2006 . This discrepancy was explained by the fact that measures were often costly and may not be correlated with the economic benefits of the farmers (Aini, 2000) . In Bangladesh, the biosecurity recommendation issued by the government to decrease the transmission of AI was not followed by the farmers because change in practices caused financial losses (Sultana et al., 2012b) . In India (West Bengal), a cost-effective, agroclimatic zone-specific biosecurity strategy was developed for backyard farmers. The strategy stressed daily cleaning of the utensils with ash, offering potable drinking water to the birds, preparation of feed with boiled water, daily change of drinking water in the trough, sprinkling of detergent water left after washing of clothes in the scavenging area, disposal of carcasses by garden burial, washing of the eggs, storage of the eggs in cold temperature maintained by indigenous structures, and so forth.","The seroprevalence of coxiellosis in farmers and cattle in north-eastern Turkey S. Seyitoglu, Z. Ozkurt, U. Dinler, B. Okumus (Erzurum, TR)","There is an antigenically related cousin, PEDV, which has similar characteristics as TGEV 29 . Like TGEV, diarrhea and vomiting are main symptoms of PEDV infection. While TGEV is highly infectious, PEDV is less contagious among farm pigs. A peculiar characteristic has been observed by farmers and veterinarians: PEDV can reappear out of nowhere from within the same pen that was previously occupied by infected pigs, even after the disease has passed on several months ago.","David Mosley and Daniel DeBehnke, MD, studied this exact issue and reported: \"The closing of a rural hospital often signals the beginning of progressive decline and deterioration of small rural towns and counties. Hospitals often serve as financial and professional anchors as well as source of pride for its small rural community. It also often means loss of other employers or inability to recruit new employers due to lack of nearby health care. When a rural hospital closes its doors, unemployment often rises, and average income drops.\" 17 There are no nurses, doctors, pharmacists or ERs for local farmers, ranchers, growers and assorted men, women and children who love living and working in America's vast rural regions. Rural communities and rural citizens are often left with no options for routine primary care, maternity care or emergency care. Even basic medical supplies are often hard to find. Just think about one example of what would happen if 13 million Americans were on the move in desperation. Consider diabetes.","The strategy was moderately well adopted among the farmers due to its cost-effective nature and the ease of administration. Adoption of such strategies caused change in practices (Table 14. 2) and as a consequence, the egg production level in the studied village increased (Samanta et al., 2015c) .","In the periurban area of Madagascar, a study showed that NDV was responsible for 44% of annual mortality in local backyard chickens (Maminiaina et al., 2007) . In Brazil, higher seroprevalence of NDV was detected in backyard flocks in which the farmers introduced their own poultry to restock the flock. This replacement caused the continuous presence of virus in the flock. Further, proximity to water bodies (estuary) provided direct contact with other infected birds and favored the transmission of NDV (Marks et al., 2014) .","Outbreaks of avian influenza due to H5N1 strains were detected in Ivory-Coast in 2006. From that date on a continuous surveillance of poultry farms, both backyard and commercial production systems, has been implemented. Every month, the team of the Virology Laboratory was sent to the field to collect tracheal and cloacal swabs and serum samples. These samples were collected in the southern regions (Agneby, District of Abidjan, South Comoe), which are the biggest large-scale poultry production areas in the country. In addition, the south-eastern region (South Comoe) includes lakes and rivers with large populations of various water bird species (Fig. 1) . The sampling was carried out following a validated protocol previously described with data from 2007 through 2009 previously reported (Couacy-Hymann et al., 2012a) . In each region, a minimum of 5 villages were randomly selected from a known list of villages. In addition, following the same protocol, 5 commercial farms were selected per region. However, any commercial farm, having reported any diseases to the veterinary field technician, was systematically included in the survey (in addition to the 5 commercial farms randomly selected). Within a selected village, any backyard poultry's owner having a poultry flock (flock size varying between 5 and 20 birds per household) was systematically included in the survey. At live bird markets (mainly one big live market per region), 5 vendors were randomly selected (average number of vendors per market = 10). In addition, farmers were interviewed regarding the case mortality that occurred on their farms.","The bacterial disease of greatest concern is brucellosis, which is not only zoonotic but also causes severe economic losses for farmers and ranchers across the world in lost milk, reduced fertility, stillbirths, and abortions (Akakpo et al. 2010). Camel farmers should be cautious and aware when handling camels, and this exemplifies another area where increased attention to sanitation practices would be beneficial. Food-borne diseases are of high importance as evidenced by the rapid establishment of complex camel milk value chains in urban Kenya as well as the breadth of food-borne pathogens found in our review (Muloi et al. 2018). These locations exemplify the high-risk transmission interfaces that are formed due to a lack of proper protocol and oversight by government agencies in regard to food safety training and hygienic practices (Muloi et al. 2018). Camels contract plague from infected fleas and may infect humans through contact with infected bodily fluids or consumption of infected meat (Leslie et al. 2011). However, vaccination in humans can be used to control the spread and occurrence of outbreaks. For example, vaccination rates have steadily increased in Kazakhstan since 2001 and the usage of vaccines in combination with antibiotics has greatly reduced case fatality across the country (Aikimbajev et al. 2003). The abundance of publications on brucellosis, plague, and food-borne bacterial illnesses reaffirms their presence in camels.","Just over half (51.3%) of all cases were contributed by four occupation groups: healthcare workers (17.3%, revised from 16.2%); 4 government officials (12.9%); retired people (11.4%); and factory workers (9.7%). These four occupational groups contributed more than half (66.3%) of all deaths, with retired people having sustained the highest death rate (24.5%), followed by factory worker cases (8.8%), government officials (5.3%), and healthcare workers (2.5%). Those whose socio-economic status would seems to be low (e.g. retired people, farmers and unemployed people), sustained the greatest proportion of deaths (24.5%, 11.7% and 10.6%, respectively).","Another key area where the One Health approach is needed is monitoring and surveillance. Some professions have greater exposure to zoonotic risks than others\u2014eg, farmers or butchers. Nearly half of the first patients affected by COVID-19 were working at the wet market where the virus originated, according to the first clinical characterisation provided by Chen and colleagues from The University of Hong Kong\u2013Shenzhen Hospital (Shenzhen, China), and published by The Lancet in January. Those occupational categories deserve attention as groups at particular risk of zoonotic exposure. In public health departments the collaboration between hygienists, occupational physicians, general practitioners, and veterinarians could provide a push to implement monitoring activities, where the health of workers, animals, and the general population are jointly monitored.","The materials used to build the chicken sheds, such as mud and cow dung made it difficult for sufficient cleaning with chemical disinfectants (Sambo et al., 2015) . In Ghana, general biosecurity practices, such as hand washing after handling poultry, was low in the farmers (Odoom et al., 2012) . In Bangladesh, the farmers who kept the birds in the sheds, cleaned the sheds every 2-4 days. The dried poultry feces and other debris were collected in a basket and directly used as fertilizer. The sick birds were mostly slaughtered for consumption. Hand washing with soap after slaughter, cleaning up the slaughter place in the yard with detergent was rarely practiced. The offals and visceras after slaughter were thrown into the nearest water bodies and bushes (Sultana et al., 2012b) . Similarly in India (West Bengal), a low level of biosecurity awareness was observed among the backyard farmers, such as preparation of feed with boiled water (only 3% of the cohort), cleaning of feeding utensils and the drinking trough once in a month (90%), frequency of change of drinking water in the trough in 15 days interval (90%), frequency of change of litter in 15 days (90%), and storage of eggs at room temperature (93%). Majority of the farmers (60%) did not wash their hands before providing feed to the birds and before entry or exit of the poultry houses (Table 14. 2) (Samanta et al., 2015c) .","Objectives: Coxiellosis is a worldwide zoonosis caused by Coxiella burnetii. The aim of this study was to determine the Abstracts prevalence of coxiellosis in cattle and farmers in North Eastern Turkey. Methods: A total of 230 cattle and 92 human sera were collected in 2003, and tested for antibodies against C.burnetii by commercial ELISA test. Results: The antibodies of C. burnetii were detected in 22 (9.56%) cattle and 18 (19.5%) healthy farmers. Seropositivity was found in 12 of 53 (22.6%) cattle with abortion history, and 10 of 177 (5.6%) cattle without abortion history (p &lt; 0.05). There was correlation between animals and human seroprevalance in same district. Thirteen of 18 farmers who were antibody positive had seropositive animals, and there were seropositive animals in the villages of remaining 5 cases. It was observed that seroprevalance of coxiellosis was higher in north districts (in animals 15.4%, in humans 32.4%), have drier and warmer climate, than in other districts (in animals 6.5%, in humans 12.1%) both for humans and animals (p &lt; 0.05). Conclusions: The study show that coxiellosis was an important health problem both in humans and in animals in our region.","Little was known about the importance of paramyxoviruses in bats until the recent emergence of zoonotic infections caused by paramyxoviruses of bat origin. Before the emergence of Nipah virus (NipPV) and Hendra virus (HenPV) which belong to the genus Henipavirus (Chua et al., 2000) , only two bat paramyxoviruses, both belonging to the genus Rubulavirus, were known to exist (Henderson et al., 1995; Hollinger and Pavri, 1971; Karabatsos, 1985; Pavri et al., 1971) . The first was a bat parainfluenza virus isolated from a Rousettus leschenaulti bat in India in 1966 , whereas the other was Mapuera virus (MapPV) isolated from the salivary glands of another fruit bat, Sturnira lilium, captured in the tropical rainforest of Brazil in 1979 (Karabatsos, 1985) . In 1994, outbreaks of fatal respiratory disease and meningoencephlaitis occurred in horses and humans in Australia. A novel paramyxovirus, HenPV, was found to be the etiological agent which was originated from fruit bats of the genus Pteropus (Halpin et al., 2000; Young et al., 1996) . Menangle virus (MenPV), first isolated from stillborn piglets in a commercial piggery in Australia in 1997, has also been detected from fruit bats of the genus Pteropus (Chant et al., 1998; Philbey et al., 1998) . In 1999, another novel paramyxovirus, NipPV, was identified as the causative agent of outbreaks of fatal encephalitis in pig-farmers in Malaysia (Chua et al., 1999 (Chua et al., , 2000 . The virus has also been isolated from fruit bats of the genus Pteropus which are likely the natural reservoir (Enserink, 2000) . During the search for the animal reservoir of NipPV, a new paramyxovirus, Tioman virus (TioPV), was isolated from pooled urine samples of fruit bats, Pteropus hypomelanus, in Tioman Island, Malaysia in 2001 (Chua et al., 2001) . MenPV and TioPV are antigenically related and belong to the genus Rubulavirus (Chua et al., 2001) .","Swedish dairy farmers are required by law to report all cattle movements (including birth, culling, death, and euthanasia, as well as movement between farms) to the central register of bovine animals (CDB) kept by the Swedish Board of Agriculture (J\u00f6nk\u00f6ping, Sweden). Data were extracted from the CDB in October 2010 and included information about cows that were reported as euthanized or dead in each herd for every month from January 2002 to September 2010.","The field work was done between February and March 2015 in collaboration with the animal health institutes from Burkina Faso (Laboratoire de Biologie et Sant\u00e9 Animales - INERA-CNRST), Ethiopia (National Veterinary Institute) and Morocco (Institut Agronomique et V\u00e9t\u00e9rinaire Hassan II). Cross-sectional studies were carried out simultaneously in the three countries. Blood (for serological analyses) and nasal swabs (for virological analyses) were collected from camels. The swabs were placed in virus medium transport. The blood samples were allowed to clot at room temperature and the serum extracted with a pipette. Swabs and sera were placed in cool box with ice packs if a \u221280 \u00b0C freezer was reachable in 48 h or otherwise frozen in a liquid nitrogen tank. On arrival at the national laboratory, all the samples were stored in a \u221280 \u00b0C freezer before their shipment to the international reference laboratory at the University of Hong Kong, for MERS-CoV serological and virological analyses. Questionnaires to ascertain camel habitats, environment and farming practices were administered to the farmers by veterinarians after specimen collection.","In Bangladesh, 67% of the total egg production is contributed by backyard sector with an annual egg production of 4.4 billion from this sector itself (Dolberg, 2008) . In India, this rural poultry sector contributes 23% of the total national egg production (Ngullie and Sharma, 2012) and the income per bird per annum ranges between US$ 0.6-2.3 (Indian rupees 4-13 per bird/month) (Ahuja et al., 2008) . This contribution is considerably low for a rural livelihood, but it can be increased by expanding the egg production level. The major constraint in increasing the egg production in backyard birds is microbial infection due to lack of biosecurity practices followed by the farmers (Conan et al., 2012) . Similarly, in developed countries, such as Chile, the farmers mostly sell their products to their neighbors during any occasion or to the tourists who occasionally visit the farms (Hamilton-West et al., 2012) . Thus, the income is not sustainable and considerably low.","Results from our study demonstrated that herds with low calving intervals had a reduced MR ratio, which is in agreement with McConnel et al. (2008) and Raboisson et al. (2011) who reported that longer calving intervals were associated with increased risk of mortality. We would argue that calving interval at a herd level in this case may serve as a proxy for good management, as has also been indicated by Sandgren et al. (2009) and Nyman et al. (2011) , and that the high level of management needed to achieve short calving intervals also increases the probability for low on-farm mortality. We found regional differences in MR ratio. The length of the legislated pasture season, being shorter in Norrland, explained some, but not all, of the differences among regions in our study, as the model with region had a better fit to the data than the model that included pasture period. A possible explanation for the higher MR ratio in Norrland compared with S\u00f6dra G\u00f6taland is that distances between farmers, veterinar-ians, and abattoirs are longer in Norrland, but this cannot explain the numerically higher MR ratio in \u00d6stra G\u00f6taland and V\u00e4stra Svealand. More detailed studies are, therefore, needed to further elucidate this finding.","Nipah virus, a zoonotic paramyxovirus, is an emerging virus endemic in Southeast Asia. Beginning in September 1998 a major outbreak of disease in pigs and human beings appeared in the northern part of peninsular Malaysia, resulting in 265 infected individuals and 105 deaths, most of whom were farmers or abattoir workers who had come in close contact with infected pigs [15]. Surprisingly, while respiratory symptoms predominated in pigs, infected humans presented mostly with encephalitic symptoms. In March 1999, a novel paramyxovirus was isolated from the CSF of an encephalitic patient from Sungai Nipah village. This virus which was later named as the Nipah virus was found to be closely related to Hendra virus, another paramyxovirus, identified in 1994, which caused severe respiratory illness in horses and humans in Australia [15\u201317]. These two geographically remote, yet phylogenetically close viruses were classified into a new genus-Henipavirus [18, 19]. Fruit bats belonging to the genus Pteropus were identified as the natural hosts for Nipah virus, while pigs were considered the intermediary hosts. The most likely explanation for introduction of the virus into pigs appears to be related to the practice of growing fruit orchards near piggeries to allow efficient use of pig waste as fertilizer for the trees. With some trees overhanging the pig-pens, it is likely that pigs were exposed to virus laden excreta and masticated fruit pellets dropped from feeding fruit bats also called as flying foxes, who are symptomless carriers of the virus [15]. Pigs infected with the virus showed less mortality; however, due to their predominant respiratory involvement, they spread the infection to humans in close contact.","\u2022 Leaving the post of the US secretary of state, Ms Hillary Rodham Clinton will be remembered for not concentrating on long\u2013term intractable conflicts, but rather focusing on more feasible international development goals: saving children from dying of preventable diseases, connecting poor farmers to markets as part of a new food security program, and improving the prospects for women who lack of education and resources. During her tenure, she became an icon of global development. (Devex, 31 Jan 2013)","Overall the current measures to control the 2019n-CoV are being implemented with care and strictness. The entrances of residential communities, dormitories and public places are restricted and residents entering are monitored for temperature and related symptoms. People from Wuhan are registered and kept under medical observation in some cities in China; meanwhile, their suspected contacts may be tracked to isolate them for monitoring purposes. Farmers are being directed to maintain hygiene, and seafood markets are being monitored in major cities.","Treatment of diseases in backyard flocks is also limited. The backyard poultry farmers in India (West Bengal) are reluctant to call for the assistance of local veterinarians or paraveterinarians due to lack of awareness, time, and motivation. In addition, doorstep services are also unavailable, especially in the remote villages (Debnath et al., 2011) . The landless or marginal farmers also could not afford the treatment or vaccine costs (Indian Rupees 75 or US$ 1.15 per bird/year) (SAPPLPP, 2009) . This is the probable reason the backyard birds reared in this part of India are not exposed to the antimicrobials and thus the commensal (E. coli, Salmonella spp.) present in the birds do not possess major antibiotic resistance genes (Samanta et al., 2015b) . In Bangladesh, sometimes the farmers prefer to collect the medicines and suggestions from the local medicine shops. The farmers also avoid the government animal health centers due to lack of proper diagnosis and availability of poultry medicines (Sultana et al., 2012b) . The reluctance of owners to seek veterinary attention was also noted even in developed countries, such as the United States (2.9% farmers use veterinary service), the United Kingdom, and Chile (Garber et al., 2007; Hamilton-West et al., 2012; Karabozhilova et al., 2012) . The urban backyard farmers in the United States mostly use dewormers (coccidiostats) and antibiotics in larger flocks (&lt;20) of birds (Elkhorabi et al., 2014) . In Chile, the backyard birds were sometimes treated with the drugs approved for human use, which could be responsible for presence of drug residues in the poultry products (Greenlees, 2003) . The Animals and Animal Products (Examination for Residues and Maximum Residue Limits) Regulations, 1997, control residues of medicines in food animals, including poultry, in European Union countries. These regulations divide medicinal substances into three categories: allowed, prohibited, and unlisted. Use of prohibited/unlisted medicines in poultry (commercial and backyard) is illegal (Table 14 .1) (Whitehead and Roberts, 2014) .","F. Carletti*, A. Brozzi, C. Eleni, N. Polici, G. D'alterio, M. Scicluna, C. Castilletti, A. Di Caro, G. Autorino, A. Demetrio, G. Cardeti (Rome, IT) Objective: In July 2009, 5 llamas, farmed in Central Italy, exhibited skin lesions at different sites evolving from nodules to crusts; some of them had a crater morphology typical for pox lesions. On the farm, there are present many species of birds (local and exotic) and mammals (goats, cattle, pigs, donkeys, horses) none of which showed any of the above mentioned symptoms. Methods: From one moribund female which was euthanised samples were collected for laboratory analysis. Skin lesions were processed for electron microscopy techniques. Two mammal cell lines (Vero and BHK21) were used for virus isolation attempts. Total viral DNA was extracted from both homogenized crusts and Vero cells supernatant. Real-time PCR, targeting the crmB gene, sequencing and phylogenetic analysis were performed to identify the virus. Other viral and bacterial diseases were considered as differential diagnosis. Results: Transmission electron microscopy revealed brick particles typical of orthopoxviruses. CPXV-antibodies were detected from llama and human sera (farmers). A Real-Time PCR gave positive results for both crust and cells supernatant. Phylogenetic analysis of two poxvirus genes (HA and crmB) confirmed a Cowpoxvirus infection, homologous to the CPXV-GuWi strain isolated in Germany in 2007.","Major camel-keeping societies in Ethiopia include Afar, Somali, Oromo (Karayu, Gabra, Boran and Guji groups), Kunama and Irob peoples, among others. The Afar and the Somali peoples are known for their camel-keeping traditions for centuries; the Boran and Guji pastoralists, on the other hand, started camel production recently. Gabra and Somali, who have been keeping camels for centuries, are believed to play instrumental roles in introducing camels to the Borana Plateau (Coppock 1994). Besides, farmers and agro-pastoral communities in mid-altitude areas who were not traditionally camel keepers recently started adopting camels. Consequently, one can nowadays see camels along a vast expanse of central, north-eastern and north-western mid-altitude regions of the country (Aklilu and Catley 2011). Nearly all the camels sold by mid-altitude farmers and traders are male, essentially because of three reasons: market demand for male camels, female camels are never used for loading, and most pastoralists do not sell female camels (Aklilu and Catley 2011).","Data on PCV2 antibody titre and antigen score and histological presentation of three lymph nodes were collected from 375 sick and healthy euthanased pigs taken from 113 herds in GB. These 113 herds were a subsample of 116 herds (because euthanased pigs were not taken from all herds visited). One hundred of these herds were from 500 randomly selected farmers that were contacted by post and who agreed to participate in the study. Their data were held by the British Quality Pigs database that contains virtually all herds with more than 100 breeding sows in England and Wales. Four herds were nonrandomly selected from farms in England or Wales that were PMWS negative and 12 were non-randomly selected from farms in Scotland where farmers agreed to participate in the study. The geographical distribution, mean herd size and percent outdoor farms of randomly selected farms were representative of pig farms in GB using DEFRA data on herd size and location (Woodbine et al., 2007) .","professorships. 52 Local governments offer young entrepreneurs with funding for startups, working spaces, law services (ex. company registration service), and other business incentives. 53 Some professional associations even provide young Taiwanese professionals with certificates related to their future careers. For example, young tea farmers in central Taiwan are encouraged to take China's version of certification in tea art. It is easier for those with China's Professional Qualification Certificates to seek jobs in China and to promote Taiwanese tea products in Chinese market. 54","The World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) considered the backyard system as the most familiar system of poultry rearing throughout the world because the system is highly adaptable to local climate, and it requires less capital and other inputs to establish (FAO, 2008a) . In the economy of developing countries this kind of poultry plays a major role by means of income generation and household food security. It is an important component of small farmers' livelihoods and a tool for poverty alleviation (Sambo et al., 2015) . It can provide meat and eggs throughout the year and ready cash in times of hardship or emergency, which may make the difference between life and death. The ready cash is also used for school expenditure, daily household need, buying of other domestic animals, etc. (FAO, 2008a) .","There are a number of microorganisms that cause allergic alveolitis. Most of these are fungi. A disease called farmer's lung occurs in farm workers repeatedly exposed to mouldy hay containing the actinomycete Micromonospora faeni. Cows suffer from the same condition. A fungus contaminating the bark of the maple tree causes a similar disease (maple bark stripper's disease) in workers in the USA employed in the extraction of maple syrup. The mild respiratory symptoms occasionally reported after respiratory exposure of sensitised individuals to tuberculosis doubtless have the same immunopathological basis.","We previously developed a potent human nAb 80R against S protein of both civet and human 2002/03 viral strains that demonstrated profound protection against viral infection in a SARS-CoV mouse model. Our studies revealed that 80R recognizes a conformationally sensitive epitope located within the receptor binding domain (RBD) [23]. A comprehensive neutralization sensitivity/resistance profile for 80R was also established based on the detailed epitope mapping and a co-crystallographic structural study [23],[24]. In this paper, we used this nAb and detailed knowledge of its epitope to examine nAb responses in convalescent serum samples from chronically exposed civet farmers, 2002/03 and 2003/04 SARS outbreak patients, and 2004 civet cats. Our studies provide the first evidence that contemporaneous strain-specific and cross-strain nAb responses against S protein are present in natural civet cat and human infection. In vitro neutralization escape studies with 80R recapitulated a highly conserved escape mutation that also occurred naturally from 2002/03 to 2003/04 viruses regardless of host species. The structural features of human nAbs that were required to broaden their activity to include binding to escape mutants was also investigated. Indeed, among several different approaches examined, amino acid changes in a single activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) \u201chot spot\u201d of a light chain CDR alone, introduced through shuffling of naturally occurring non-immune human variable light chains (VLs) or by targeted CDR mutagenesis were sufficient to generate broad nAbs (BnAbs) against a range of viral strains including neutralization escape variants. These results have important implications for the management of new emerging viral pathogens and provide a strategy to directly manipulate virus evolution through Ab blockade of escape pathways.","Besides conventional vaccines, a novel approach in the form of fast-dissolving tablets (FDT) against ND virus was also produced. The virus (LaSota strain) was freeze-dried into tablets containing a small number of doses, which is economically feasible for backyard farmers. The vaccine tablet can be diluted in water and administered either in drinking water of birds or by intraocular and/or intranasal route. The compact packaging of the FDTs will also provide cost savings in storing and distributing the vaccine in the cold chain (Lal et al., 2014) .","In Bangladesh, the poultry purchased from the market are slaughtered at home and the remnants are offered to their backyard flocks. This malpractice is considered as the strongest risk factor for transmission of HPAI in backyard flocks in Bangladesh (Biswas et al., 2009) . In Egypt, significant correlation exists between disposal of poultry carcass and feces in the environment and HPAI infection in poultry (F = 15.7, P &lt; 0.0001) (Sheta et al., 2014) . In Ethiopia, scavenging behavior of backyard chickens and chicken dealers were considered a major risk factor for infecting the backyard flocks. A number of farmers identified dogs bringing infected carcasses home to be an additional risk factor for transmission of infection (Sambo et al., 2015) . Female backyard birds were found to be more susceptible to NDV infection than male chickens due to extensive roaming throughout the village with a greater possibility of exposure to infected birds (Molia et al., 2011) .","Coronavirus, influenza C virus, and paramyxovirus have been identified with transmission electron microscope in the feces of crocodilians, but their significance remains to be determined. Finally, evidence exists of seroconversion to paramyxovirus and eastern equine encephalitis virus in crocodilians. 11 Toxicities are not common in captive crocodilian. However, cases have been found of lead toxicity in alligators fed leadshot nutria. Clinical signs include weakness, lethargy, anorexia, and death. Alligator ranchers and farmers are now more diligent in inquiring about the source and kill method of nutria before feeding the animals. Another phenomenon seen in captive crocodilian operations is runting. This describes the lack of growth and failure to thrive of some animals within a group. In some operations, animals are separated by size and some buildings contain only the runts. A clear size difference is observed in same-age animals between the runts and the otherwise healthy ones. These animals are not as hardy in the captive environment and are potentially more susceptible to disease. Dominance by other animals, environment, and even incubation factors 13 contribute to the presence of runts.","Enforcement of current wildlife protection policy and continued community infrastructure development appears to significantly reduce high-risk contact between humans, wildlife and livestock. Closer collaboration between local animal and human health authorities within the current epidemic disease prevention programmes will provide educational and training opportunities to promote risk-mitigation knowledge, skills and best practice in local communities. For example, cave monitoring and management is a low-cost and efficient method to help restrict human activities (e.g. recreation and mining) that lead to contact with bats in caves. This is of particular importance given the emergence of 2019-nCoV, which appears likely to be a bat-origin coronavirus.10,11","Evidence suggest that the novel coronavirus likely jumped from a primary reservoir (e.g, horseshoe bats) to an intermediary reservoir, possibly generating an outbreak among wild animals in at least one wet market in Wuhan, China [6] [7] . The virus first infected multiple individuals visiting the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, initiating multiple chains of transmission that ensured sustained transmission in the human population [8] . While the detailed origin of the outbreak remains uncertain, significant evidence strongly links the .

Because much of the genetic diversity of alpha-and beta-CoVs is associated with infections in bats, it has been suggested that bats are the main reservoir hosts for both alpha-and beta-CoVs (Woo et al., 2009) . Herein, we discovered three phylogenetically distinct lineages of rodent-associated CoVs within a limited geographic area in China, all of which are distinct from those viruses associated in bats. Consequently, it is clear that large-scale surveillance is needed to fully understand the role played by rodents in the evolution and emergence of coronaviruses."],"title":["Development of a Whole-Virus ELISA for Serological Evaluation of Domestic Livestock as Possible Hosts of Human Coronavirus NL63","In search for the hotspots of Disease X: A biogeographic approach to mapping the predictive risk of WHO s Blueprint Priority Diseases","Need for integrative thinking to fight against emerging infectious diseases.
