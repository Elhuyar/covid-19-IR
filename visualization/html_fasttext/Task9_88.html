Information regarding this particular disease is limited, however, it is known to have high mortality rates, particularly among individuals with preexisting medical conditions. Creating models to identify individuals who are at the greatest risk for severe complications due to COVID-19 will be useful to help for outreach campaigns in mitigating the diseases worst effects. While information specific to COVID-19 is limited, a model using complications due to other upper respiratory infections can be used as a proxy to help identify those individuals who are at the greatest risk. We present the results for three models predicting such complications, with each model having varying levels of predictive effectiveness at the expense of ease of implementation.","Background: With new cases of COVID-19 surging around the world, some countries may have to prepare for moving beyond the containment phase. Prediction of the effectiveness of non-case-based interventions for mitigating, delaying or preventing the epidemic is urgent, especially for countries affected by the increased seasonal influenza activity. Methods: We developed a transmission model to evaluate the impact of self-imposed prevention measures (handwashing, mask-wearing, and social distancing) due to COVID-19 awareness and of short-term government-imposed social distancing on the peak number of diagnoses, attack rate and time until the peak number of diagnoses. Findings: For fast awareness spread in the population, self-imposed measures can significantly reduce the attack rate, diminish and postpone the peak number of diagnoses. A large epidemic can be prevented if the efficacy of these measures exceeds 50%. For slow awareness spread, self-imposed measures reduce the peak number of d...","While coronaviruses were first identified nearly 60 years ago, they received notoriety in 2003 when one of their members was identified as the etiological agent of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV) 1. Previously these viruses were known to be important agents of respiratory and enteric infections of domestic and companion animals and to cause approximately 15% of all cases of the common cold. This Review focuses on recent advances in our understanding of the mechanisms of coronavirus replication, interactions with the host immune response and disease pathogenesis and highlights the recent identification of numerous novel coronaviruses and the propensity of this virus family to cross species barriers.","Summary The Zika epidemic in the Americas has challenged surveillance and control. As the epidemic appears to be waning, it is unclear whether transmission is still ongoing, which is exacerbated by discrepancies in reporting. To uncover locations with lingering outbreaks, we investigated travel-associated Zika cases to identify transmission not captured by reporting. We uncovered an unreported outbreak in Cuba during 2017, a year after peak transmission in neighboring islands. By sequencing Zika virus, we show that the establishment of the virus was delayed by a year and that the ensuing outbreak was sparked by long-lived lineages of Zika virus from other Caribbean islands. Our data suggest that, although mosquito control in Cuba may initially have been effective at mitigating Zika virus transmission, such measures need to be maintained to be effective. Our study highlights how Zika virus may still be \u201csilently\u201d spreading and provides a framework for understanding outbreak dynamics. Vi...","As the Coronavirus (COVID-19) expands its impact from China, expanding its catchment into surrounding regions and other countries, increased national and international measures are being taken to contain the outbreak. The placing of entire cities in \u2018lockdown\u2019 directly affects urban economies on a multi-lateral level, including from social and economic standpoints. This is being emphasised as the outbreak gains ground in other countries, leading towards a global health emergency, and as global collaboration is sought in numerous quarters. However, while effective protocols in regard to the sharing of health data is emphasised, urban data, on the other hand, specifically relating to urban health and safe city concepts, is still viewed from a nationalist perspective as solely benefiting a nation\u2019s economy and its economic and political influence. This perspective paper, written one month after detection and during the outbreak, surveys the virus outbreak from an urban standpoint and adva...","Background We aimed to investigate the frequency of standard precautions (SPs) compliance and the factors affecting the compliance among nursing students (NSs). Methods A cross-sectional survey study guided by the health belief model was conducted in 2009. The study questionnaire is valid (content validity index, 0.81) and reliable (Cronbach \u03b1 range, 0.65-0.94). Results There were 678 questionnaires analyzed, with a response rate of 68.9%. The mean frequency score of SPs compliance was 4.38 \u00b1 0.40 out of 5. Tukey honest significant difference post hoc test indicated that year 2 and year 4 students had better SPs compliance than year 3 students. Further analysis using a univariate general linear model identified an interaction effect of perceived influence of nursing staff and year of study (F1,593 = 3.72; P &lt; .05). The 5 following predictors for SPs compliance were identified: knowledge of SPs, perceived barriers, adequacy of training, management support, and influence of nursing staff...","","","","","Objective: Establishing a social contact data sharing initiative and an interactive tool to assess mitigation strategies for COVID-19. Results: We organized data sharing of published social contact surveys via online repositories and formatting guidelines. We analyzed this social contact data in terms of weighted social contact matrices, next generation matrices, relative incidence and R0. We incorporated location-specific isolation measures (e.g. school closure or telework) and capture their effect on transmission dynamics. All methods have been implemented in an online application based on R Shiny and applied to COVID-19 with age-specific susceptibility and infectiousness. Using our online tool with the available social contact data, we illustrate that social distancing could have a considerable impact on reducing transmission for COVID-19. The effect itself depends on assumptions made about disease-specific characteristics and the choice of intervention(s). Keywords: social contact ...","On January 20, 2020, the first COVID-19 case was confirmed in South Korea. After a rapid outbreak, the number of incident cases has been consistently decreasing since early March; this decrease has been widely attributed to its intensive testing. We report here on the likely role of social distancing in reducing transmission in South Korea. Our analysis suggests that transmission may still be persisting in some regions.","The need to protect public health during the current COVID-19 pandemic has necessitated conference cancellations on an unprecedented scale. As the scientific community adapts to new working conditions, it is important to recognize that some of our actions may disproportionately affect early-career researchers and scientists from countries with limited research funding. We encourage all conference organizers, funders and institutions who are able to do so to consider how they can mitigate the unintended consequences of conference and travel cancellations and we provide seven recommendations for how this could be achieved. The proposed solutions may also offer long-term benefits for those who normally cannot attend conferences, and thus lead to a more equitable future for generations of researchers.","Timely detection of novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection cases is crucial to interrupt the spread of this virus. We assessed the required expertise and capacity for molecular detection of 2019-nCoV in specialised laboratories in 30 European Union/European Economic Area (EU/EEA) countries. Thirty-eight laboratories in 24 EU/EEA countries had diagnostic tests available by 29 January 2020. A coverage of all EU/EEA countries was expected by mid-February. Availability of primers/probes, positive controls and personnel were main implementation barriers.","Abstract There is a current worldwide outbreak of the novel coronavirus Covid-19 (coronavirus disease 2019; the pathogen called SARS-CoV-2; previously 2019-nCoV), which originated from Wuhan in China and has now spread to 6 continents including 66 countries, as of 24:00 on March 2, 2020. Governments are under increased pressure to stop the outbreak spiraling into a global health emergency. At this stage, preparedness, transparency, and sharing of information are crucial to risk assessments and beginning outbreak control activities. This information should include reports from outbreak site and from laboratories supporting the investigation. This paper aggregates and consolidates the epidemiology, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, treatments and preventions of this new type of coronavirus.","Abstract Individuals who visit community pharmacies are regarded as customers rather than patients. The public tends to view community pharmacists as businesspeople. Several factors influence individuals' willingness to patronize and to continue visiting such pharmacies. On the supply side, community pharmacists' responsibilities and duties center on the health and well-being of society. In this chapter, an assessment of community pharmacy practices in developing countries is particularly interesting in terms of medication dispensing and extended pharmacy services that promote public wellness. Community pharmacists in developing countries, who are supposedly strategically positioned in the community to provide public health, are not taking advantage on this opportunity. Although several studies have noted the services provided by community pharmacists, in general, the practice is far from meeting expectations due to several barriers. Pharmacists need to realize their opportunities and ...","This year marks the 15th anniversary of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in Canada and the 100th anniversary of the 1918 Spanish influenza pandemic. These, and other recent public health events, provide an opportunity for us to review and reflect on the evolution of Canada\u2019s public health emergency response over the past 15 years\u2014from SARS, to the 2009 H1N1 pandemic influenza, to Ebola virus and Zika virus disease. Key lessons have been learned and milestones achieved that have shaped and sharpened our response approach and structures. While SARS was a wake-up-call to strengthen infection prevention and control capacity in health care settings and led to the formation of the Public Health Agency of Canada, it also strengthened our Federal/Provincial/Territorial (FPT) senior-level governance and led to agreements for pan-Canadian mutual aid and infectious disease information sharing. As well, our collective public health laboratory capacity has been strengthened through ongoing ...","AbstractThe rapid sharing of sequence information as seen throughout the current SARS-CoV-2 epidemic, represents an inflection point for genomic epidemiology. Here we describe aspects of coronavirus evolutionary genetics revealed from these data, and provide the first direct RNA sequence of SARS-CoV-2, detailing coronaviral subgenome-length mRNA architecture.","BACKGROUND: Viral epidemics or pandemics of acute respiratory infections like influenza or severe acute respiratory syndrome pose a global threat. Antiviral drugs and vaccinations may be insufficient to prevent their spread. OBJECTIVES: To review the effectiveness of physical interventions to interrupt or reduce the spread of respiratory viruses. SEARCH METHODS: We searched The Cochrane Library, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2010, Issue 3), which includes the Acute Respiratory Infections Group's Specialised Register, MEDLINE (1966 to October 2010), OLDMEDLINE (1950 to 1965), EMBASE (1990 to October 2010), CINAHL (1982 to October 2010), LILACS (2008 to October 2010), Indian MEDLARS (2008 to October 2010) and IMSEAR (2008 to October 2010). SELECTION CRITERIA: In this update, two review authors independently applied the inclusion criteria to all identified and retrieved articles and extracted data. We scanned 3775 titles, excluded 3560 and retrieved full pape...","To learn how outbreaks of infectious disease are detected and to describe the entities and information systems that together function to identify outbreaks in the U.S., the authors drew on multiple sources of information to create a description of existing surveillance systems and how they interact to detect outbreaks. The results of this analysis were summarized in a system diagram. The authors reviewed a sample of recent outbreaks to determine how they were detected, with reference to the system diagram. The de facto U.S. system for detection of outbreaks consists of five components: the clinical health care system, local/state health agencies, federal agencies, academic/professional organizations, and collaborating governmental organizations. Primary data collection occurs at the level of clinical health care systems and local health agencies. The review of a convenience sample of outbreaks showed that all five components of the system participated in aggregating, analyzing, and sha...","Abstract Coronaviruses (CoVs) are enveloped, positive-strand RNA viruses with characteristic spike glycoproteins that project outward like the rays of the sun (corona \u2013 Latin for \u2018crown\u2019), when visualized by electron microscopy. CoV are classified, together with the toroviruses, in the family Coronaviridae and the order Nidovirales. All nidoviruses have a common genome organization and generate a nested set (nido \u2013 Latin for \u2018nest\u2019) of 3\u2032 co-terminal mRNAs. CoVs have been isolated from a variety of species, including birds, livestock, domestic animals, and humans. CoV infections can cause respiratory, gastrointestinal, and neurologic disease, depending on the strain of the virus and the site of infection. Importantly, CoVs have been shown to cross species barriers and have emerged from animal reservoirs to infect humans and cause severe disease. The CoV responsible for an outbreak of severe acute respiratory disease (SARS-CoV) in 2002\u201303 likely originated as a bat coronavirus which, du...","Background The novel coronavirus COVID19 has been classified by the World Health Organisation as a pandemic due to its worldwide spread. The ability of countries to contain and control transmission is critical in the absence of a vaccine. We evaluated a range of social distancing measures to determine which strategies are most effective in reducing the peak daily infection rate, and consequential pressure on the health care system. Methods Using COVID19 transmission data from the outbreak source in Hubei Province, China, collected prior to activation of containment measures, we adapted an established individual based simulation model of the city of Newcastle, Australia, population 272,409. Simulation of virus transmission in this community model without interventions provided a baseline from which to compare alternative social distancing strategies. The infection history of each individual was determined, as was the time infected. From this model generated data, the rate of growth in c...","Objective To provide an overview of supply and demand issues in the vaccine industry and the policy options that have been implemented to resolve these issues. Data sources Medline, Policy File, and International Pharmaceutical Abstracts were searched to locate academic journal articles. Other sources reviewed included texts on the topics of vaccine history and policy, government agency reports, and reports from independent think tanks. Keywords included vaccines, immunizations, supply, demand, and policy. Study selection Search criteria were limited to English language and human studies. Articles pertaining to vaccine demand, supply, and public policy were selected and reviewed for inclusion. Data extraction By the authors. Data synthesis Vaccines are biologic medications, therefore making their development and production more difficult and costly compared with \u201csmall-molecule\u201d drugs. Research and development costs for vaccines can exceed $800 million, and development may require 10 y...","This case study is the first to be developed in the Middle East region to document what happened during the response to the 2013 MERS outbreak in Qatar. It provides a description of key epidemiologic events and news released from a prime daily newspaper and main Emergency Risk Communication (ERC) actions that were undertaken by public health authorities. Using the Crisis and Emergency Risk Communication (CERC) theoretical framework, the study analyzes how the performed ERC strategies during the first days of the outbreak might have contributed to the outbreak management. Methods: MERS-CoV related events were chronologically tracked, together with the relevant stories that were published in a major newspaper over the course of three distinct phases of the epidemic. The collected media stories were then assessed against the practiced emergency risk communication (ERC) activities during the same time frame. Results: The Crisis &amp; Emergency Risk Communication (CERC) framework was partially ...","The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) is the etiological agent for the infectious disease, SARS, which first emerged 10 years ago. SARS-CoV is a zoonotic virus that has crossed the species barriers to infect humans. Bats, which harbour a diverse pool of SARS-like CoVs (SL-CoVs), are believed to be the natural reservoir. The SARS-CoV surface Spike (S) protein is a major antigenic determinant in eliciting neutralizing antibody production during SARS-CoV infection. In our previous work, we showed that a panel of murine monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that target the S2 subunit of the S protein are capable of neutralizing SARS-CoV infection in vitro (Lip KM et al, J Virol. 2006 Jan; 80(2): 941\u201350). In this study, we report our findings on the characterization of one of these mAbs, known as 1A9, which binds to the S protein at a novel epitope within the S2 subunit at amino acids 1111\u20131130. MAb 1A9 is a broadly neutralizing mAb that prevents viral entry mediated by the S ...","","The novel coronavirus, COVID-19, has sparked an outflow of scientific research seeking to understand the virus, its spread, and best practices in prevention and treatment. If this international research effort is going to be as swift and effective as possible, it will need to rely on a principle of open science. When researchers share data, code, and software and generally make their work as transparent as possible, it allows other researchers to verify and expand upon their work. Furthermore, it allows public officials to make informed decisions. In this study, we analyzed 535 preprint articles related to COVID-19 for eight transparency criteria and recorded study location and funding information. We found that individual researchers have lined up to help during this crisis, quickly tackling important public health questions, often without funding or support from outside organizations. However, most authors could improve their data sharing and scientific reporting practices. The contr...","Abstract We present here the proceedings of the 5th seminar on emerging infectious diseases, held in Paris on March 22nd, 2016, with seven priority proposals that can be outlined as follows: encourage research on the prediction, screening and early detection of new risks of infection; develop research and surveillance concerning transmission of pathogens between animals and humans, with their reinforcement in particular in intertropical areas (\u201chot-spots\u201d) via public support; pursue aid development and support in these areas of prevention and training for local health personnel, and foster risk awareness in the population; ensure adapted patient care in order to promote adherence to treatment and to epidemic propagation reduction measures; develop greater awareness and better education among politicians and healthcare providers, in order to ensure more adapted response to new types of crises; modify the logic of governance, drawing from all available modes of communication and incorpor...","As the international community responds to an outbreak of coronavirus-induced pneumonia in Wuhan, China, early and open data sharing \u2014 which are vital for its control \u2014 depend on the trust that the data will not be used without proper attribution to those who generated it.","AbstractThe SARS-CoV-2 epidemic has rapidly spread outside China with major outbreaks occurring in Italy, South Korea and Iran. Phylogenetic analyses of whole genome sequencing data identified a distinct SARS-CoV-2 clade linked to travellers returning from Iran to Australia and New Zealand. This study highlights potential viral diversity driving the epidemic in Iran, and underscores the power of rapid genome sequencing and public data sharing to improve the detection and management of emerging infectious diseases.","The recently emerged coronavirus in Wuhan, China has claimed at least six lives as of January 22 and infected hundreds if not thousands of individuals. The situation has drawn international attention, including from the virology community. We applaud the rapid release to the public of the genome sequence of the new virus by Chinese virologists, but we also believe that increased transparency on disease reporting and data sharing with international colleagues are crucial for curbing the spread of this newly emerging virus to other parts of the world.","AbstractBackgroundThe current outbreak caused by novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) in China has become a worldwide concern. As of 28 January 2020, there were 4631 confirmed cases and 106 deaths, and 11 countries or regions were affected.MethodsWe downloaded the genomes of 2019-nCoVs and similar isolates from the Global Initiative on Sharing Avian Influenza Database (GISAID and nucleotide database of the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). Lasergene 7.0 and MEGA 6.0 softwares were used to calculate genetic distances of the sequences, to construct phylogenetic trees, and to align amino acid sequences. Bayesian coalescent phylogenetic analysis, implemented in the BEAST software package, was used to calculate the molecular clock related characteristics such as the nucleotide substitution rate and the most recent common ancestor (tMRCA) of 2019-nCoVs.ResultsAn isolate numbered EPI_ISL_403928 showed different phylogenetic trees and genetic distances of the whole length genome, ...","The current state of much of the Wuhan pneumonia virus (COVID-19) research shows a regrettable lack of data sharing and considerable analytical obfuscation. This impedes global research cooperation, which is essential for tackling public health emergencies, and requires unimpeded access to data, analysis tools, and computational infrastructure. Here we show that community efforts in developing open analytical software tools over the past ten years, combined with national investments into scientific computational infrastructure, can overcome these deficiencies and provide an accessible platform for tackling global health emergencies in an open and transparent manner. Specifically, we use all COVID-19 genomic data available in the public domain so far to (1) underscore the importance of access to raw data and to (2) demonstrate that existing community efforts in curation and deployment of biomedical software can reliably support rapid, reproducible research during global health crises. A...","Abstract Apart from bat-SARS-CoV, we have identified a novel group 1 coronavirus, bat-CoV HKU2, in Rhinolophus sinicus (Chinese horseshoe bats). Since it has been suggested that the receptor-binding motif (RBM) of SARS-CoV may have been acquired from a group 1 coronavirus, we conducted a surveillance study and identified bat-SARS-CoV and bat-CoV HKU2 in 8.7% and 7.5% respectively of R. sinicus in Hong Kong and Guangdong. Complete genome sequencing of four strains of bat-CoV HKU2 revealed the smallest coronavirus genome (27164 nucleotides) and a unique spike protein evolutionarily distinct from the rest of the genome. This spike protein, sharing similar deletions with other group 2 coronaviruses in its C-terminus, also contained a 15-amino acid peptide homologous to a corresponding peptide within the RBM of spike protein of SARS-CoV, which was absent in other coronaviruses except bat-SARS-CoV. These suggest a common evolutionary origin in the spike protein of bat-CoV HKU2, bat-SARS-CoV,...","Background: The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) continues to expand across the world. Though both the number of cases and mortality rate in children and adolescents is reported to be low in comparison to adults, limited data has been reported on the outbreak with respect to pediatric patients. To elucidate information, we utilized crowdsourced data to perform a preliminary epidemiologic analysis of pediatric patients with COVID-19 Methods: In this observational study, data was collected from two open-access, line list crowdsourced online databases. Pediatric cases of COVID-19 were defined as patients \u226419 years of age with a laboratory confirmed diagnosis. The primary outcomes were case counts and cumulative case counts. Secondary outcomes included days between symptoms onset and first medical care and days between first medical care and reporting. Tertiary outcomes were rate of travel to Wuhan, rate of infected family members and rates of symptoms. Results: A total of 8...","Abstract First identified in 2001, human metapneumovirus (HMPV) is a novel pathogen and causative agent of acute respiratory tract infection. Re-infection with HMPV is common, and currently there is no available vaccine against HMPV infection. Two genotypes of HMPV have been identified, A and B, both of which can be divided further into at least two distinct sub-genotypes. Here we report the results of the first study to investigate the genetic variability of HMPV strains circulating within Cambodia. The overall incidence of HMPV infection amongst an all-ages population of patients hospitalised with ALRI in Cambodia during 3 consecutive years, between 2007 and 2009, was 1.7%. The incidence of HMPV infection was highest amongst children less than 5 years of age, with pneumonia or bronchopneumonia the most frequent clinical diagnoses across all age groups. The incidence of HMPV infection varied annually. As anticipated, genetic diversity was low amongst the conserved F gene sequences but...","Abstract Context In 2012, the French Infectious Diseases Society (French acronym SPILF) initiated the \u201cCoordination of epidemic and biological risk\u201d (SPILF-COREB - Emergences [SCE]) group to support the readiness and response of healthcare workers (HCWs) to new alerts. Objective To present the SCE group, its functioning, and the main support it provided for frontline HCWs. Methods A multidisciplinary group of heads of infectious disease departments from reference hospitals was created to build a network of clinical expertise for care, training, and research in the field of epidemic and biological risk (EBR). The network developed a set of standardized operational procedures (SOPs) to guide interventions to manage EBR-suspect patients. Results A working group created the SOP aimed at frontline HCWs taking care of patients. Priority was given to the development of a generic procedure, which was then adapted according to the current alert. Five key steps were identified and hierarchized: ...","Abstract This chapter describes the source, access, extent, and quality of information available among pharmacists and pharmacy personnel in developing countries to practice effectively. Our world today witnesses huge advancements in the information-related technologies and in the amount of medicines information available and accessible by all healthcare providers as well as the public. Remaining in the front line as medicines information providers represents great challenge for pharmacists. Scientific biomedical journals represent the core source of our knowledge about medicines. Textbooks and books represent the cornerstone for a user who has no or little basic information about certain topic. Today, the Internet is the most commonly used source of information for a variety of uses and topics. The literature available in our hand indicates the presence of medicines information centers in a variety of countries from the developing world. Manufacturers of medicines usually represent an...","AbstractFaced with the current large-scale public health emergency, collecting, sorting, and analyzing biomedical information related to the \u201ccoronavirus\u201d should be done as quickly as possible to gain a global perspective, which is a basic requirement for strengthening epidemic control capacity. However, for human researchers studying the viruses and the hosts, the vast amount of information available cannot be processed effectively and in a timely manner, particularly when the scientific understanding may be limited, which can further lower the information processing efficiency. We present TWIRLS, a method that can automatically acquire, organize, and classify information. Additionally, independent functional data sources can be added to build an inference system using a machine-based approach, which can provide relevant knowledge to help human researchers quickly establish subject cognition and to make more effective decisions.

Perspectives were sought from key decision-makers and clinical staff about the factors perceived to promote and inhibit effective and rapid control of the outbreak. SETTING: A large teaching tertiary healthcare centre in KSA; the outbreak lasted 6 weeks from June 2015. PARTICIPANTS: Data were collected via individual and focus group interviews with 28 key informant participants (9 management decision-makers and 19 frontline healthcare workers). DESIGN: We used qualitative methods of process evaluation to examine perceptions of the outbreak and the factors contributing to, or detracting from successful management. Data were analysed using qualitative thematic content analysis. RESULTS: Five themes and 15 subthemes were found. The themes were related to: (1...","The emergence of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in 2012 marked the second introduction of a highly pathogenic coronavirus into the human population in the twenty-first century. The continuing introductions of MERS-CoV from dromedary camels, the subsequent travel-related viral spread, the unprecedented nosocomial outbreaks and the high case-fatality rates highlight the need for prophylactic and therapeutic measures. Scientific advancements since the 2002\u20132003 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) pandemic allowed for rapid progress in our understanding of the epidemiology and pathogenesis of MERS-CoV and the development of therapeutics. In this Review, we detail our present understanding of the transmission and pathogenesis of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, and discuss the current state of development of measures to combat emerging coronaviruses. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The online version of this article (doi:10.1038/nrmicro.2016.81) contains suppl...","Zoonotic viruses that emerge from wildlife and domesticated animals pose a serious threat to human and animal health. In many instances, mouse models have improved our understanding of the human immune response to infection; however, when dealing with emerging zoonotic diseases, they may be of limited use. This is particularly the case when the model fails to reproduce the disease status that is seen in the natural reservoir, transmission species or human host. In this Review, we discuss how researchers are placing more emphasis on the study of the immune response to zoonotic infections in the natural reservoir hosts and spillover species. Such studies will not only lead to a greater understanding of how these infections induce variable disease and immune responses in distinct species but also offer important insights into the evolution of mammalian immune systems. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The online version of this article (doi:10.1038/nri3551) contains supplementary material, which...","BACKGROUND: As the 2014 Ebola virus disease outbreak (EVD) transitions to its post-endemic phase, its impact on the future of global public health, particularly the World Health Organization (WHO), is the subject of continued debate. Criticism of WHO\u2019s performance grew louder in the outbreak\u2019s wake, placing this international health UN-specialized agency in the difficult position of navigating a complex series of reform recommendations put forth by different stakeholders. Decisions on WHO governance reform and the broader role of the United Nations could very well shape the future landscape of 21st century global health and how the international community responds to health emergencies. DISCUSSION: In order to better understand the implications of the EVD outbreak on global health and infectious disease governance, this debate article critically examines a series of reports issued by four high-level commissions/panels convened to specifically assess WHO\u2019s performance post-Ebola. Collec...","Abstract Molecular analysis of respiratory viruses and the host response to both infection and vaccination have transformed our understanding of these ubiquitous pathogens. Polymerase chain reaction for the rapid and accurate diagnosis of viral infections has led to a better understanding of the epidemiology and impact of many common respiratory viruses and resulted in better patient care. Over the past decade a number of new respiratory viruses including human metapneumovirus and new coronaviruses have been discovered using molecular techniques such as random primer amplification, pan-viral array and next generation sequencing. Analysis of the host transcriptional response during respiratory viral infection using in-vitro, animal models and natural and experimental human challenge have furthered the understanding of the mechanisms and predictors of severe disease and may identify potential therapeutic targets to prevent and ameliorate illness.","Understanding the disease pathogenesis of the novel coronavirus, denoted SARS-CoV-2, is critical to the development of anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapeutics. The global propagation of the viral disease, denoted COVID-19 (\"coronavirus disease 2019\"), has unified the scientific community in searching for possible inhibitory small molecules or polypeptides. Given the known interaction between the human ACE2 (\"Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2\") protein and the SARS-CoV virus (responsible for the coronavirus outbreak circa. 2003), considerable focus has been directed towards the putative interaction between the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein and ACE2. However, a more holistic understanding of the SARS-CoV-2 vs. human inter-species interactome promises additional putative protein-protein interactions (PPI) that may be considered targets for the development of inhibitory therapeutics. To that end, we leverage two state-of-the-art, sequence-based PPI predictors (PIPE4 &amp; SPRINT) capable of generating the compr...","Background: Community responses are important for outbreak management during the early phase when non-pharmaceutical interventions are the major preventive options. Therefore, this study aims to examine the psychological and behavioral responses of the community during the early phase of the COVID-19 epidemic in Hong Kong. Method: A cross-sectional online survey was launched within 36 hours after confirmed COVID-19 cases were first reported. Councilors of all 452 district council constituency areas were approached for survey dissemination. Respondent demographics, anxiety level, risk perception, sources to retrieve COVID-19 information, actual adoption and perceived efficacy of precautionary measures were collected. Result: Analysis from 1715 complete responses indicated high perceived susceptibility (89%) and high perceived severity (97%). Most respondents were worried about COVID-19 (97%), and had their daily routines disrupted (slightly/greatly: 98%). The anxiety level, measured by ...","ABSTRACTEffective countermeasures against the recent emergence and rapid expansion of the 2019-Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) require the development of data and tools to understand and monitor viral spread and immune responses. However, little information about the targets of immune responses to 2019-nCoV is available. We used the Immune Epitope Database and Analysis Resource (IEDB) resource to catalog available data related to other coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV, which has high sequence similarity to 2019-nCoV, and is the best-characterized coronavirus in terms of epitope responses. We identified multiple specific regions in 2019-nCoV that have high homology to SARS virus. Parallel bionformatic predictions identified a priori potential B and T cell epitopes for 2019-nCoV. The independent identification of the same regions using two approaches reflects the high probability that these regions are targets for immune recognition of 2019-nCoV.ONE SENTENCE SUMMARYWe identified potential...","The discovery of a novel coronavirus (CoV) as the causative agent of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) has highlighted the need for a better understanding of CoV replication. The replication of SARS-CoV is highly dependent on host cell factors. However, relatively little is known about the cellular proteome changes that occur during SARS-CoV replication. Recently, we developed a cell line expressing a SARS-CoV subgenomic replicon and used it to screen inhibitors of SARS-CoV replication. To identify host proteins important for SARS-CoV RNA replication, the protein profiles of the SARS-CoV replicon cells and parental BHK21 cells were compared using a quantitative proteomic strategy termed \u201cstable-isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture-mass spectrometry\u201d (SILAC-MS). Our results revealed that, among the 1,081 host proteins quantified in both forward and reverse SILAC measurements, 74 had significantly altered levels of expression. Of these, significantly upregulated BCL2-as...","Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is now a global public health threat with many medical, ethical, social, economic, political, and legal implications. The nonspecific signs and symptoms of this disease, coupled with a relatively long incubation period and the initial absence of a reliable diagnostic test, limited the understanding of the magnitude of the outbreak. This paper outlines our experience with public health issues that have arisen during this outbreak of SARS in Hong Kong. We confirmed that case detection, reporting, clear and timely dissemination of information, and strict infection control measures are essential in handling such an infectious disease outbreak.

The results of our study demonstrate that D. rotundus carries both novel and known microbes, and that the populations in this region appear to display an overwhelming preference for feeding on domestic livestock species. As populations of D. rotundus continue to expand in Latin America with the increasing production of livestock, better understanding of their infectious disease ecology and diversity will become even more critical. Subsequent studies are necessary to further resolve the phylogeny and further investigate the actual pathogenicity of the novel viruses detected in this study. Additional research efforts involving microbial discovery and surveillance among domestic animals may also prove useful for investigating whether microbe sharing occurs between D. rotundus and their prey, as well as how viral and bacterial diversity may change seasonally and geographically. Gaining a better understanding of the role of D. rotundus as a potential source and reservoir of infectious diseases will help better inform public health and wildlife management policies aimed at preventing or mitigating future disease spillover events in the face of ecosystem changes.","COVID-19 presents a unique challenge to public health. Effective mitigation of the disease will require nontrivial efforts from a significant fraction of the world population, including social distancing and avoiding unnecessary interactions with others. No matter how stringently these measures are recommended, a fraction of people may not believe that they can or should act in ways that will limit the threat. The HBM is a model that has been used to study behaviors related to preventing or mitigating disease. It conceptualizes beliefs about disease as being comprised of the perception of the threat as severe and relevant, the perception of benefits of and barriers to acting, and the perception of one's intrinsic ability to act. As trusted, community-facing healthcare professionals, pharmacists are uniquely suited to bring about change in patient behaviors.Community pharmacists using HBM to reinforce COVID-19 mitigation behaviors should appropriately emphasize the severity and susceptibility of the threat, emphasize barriers to acting, help patients identify ways to overcome barriers to acting, and reinforce self-efficacy beliefs.","Economic globalization has promoted the delocalization and gathering of manufacturing sites of drug substances and medicinal products, stressing the resilience of the pharmaceutical supply chain of many medicinal products to the shortages. The European countries cannot face the different shortage crisis alone, but the cooperation at EU-level is necessary to provide practical and rational solutions to the problem. For mitigating shortages that affect the Union, the stronger coordination at EU-level and the harmonization of communication, risk-assessment and risk-management strategies are desirable and urgent. Although further studies in real-world settings are needed to complete the validation of the procedure and decision trees, the approach proposed in this article may contribute to improving the information sharing and cooperation among European countries. Indeed, risk-assessment and risk-management strategies adopted by professionals (e.g., pharmacists) and other stakeholders can be rationalized and harmonized based on the medicines shortage impact scores calculated by a competent National Authority.","Compared with other international migrants (ie, international students), IMWs encounter more barriers in accessing health services in host countries (eg, inadequate health insurance), particularly migrant domestic workers. 2 Under normal conditions, IMWs have a high burden of common mental disorders (eg, depression) and a lower quality of life than local populations. 2, 3 This situation could worsen during the COVID-19 epidemic due to the potential and fear of governmental-imposed quarantine and lost income. For instance, some migrant domestic workers in Hong Kong and Macau have lost their jobs because their employers have left the territory. Many domestic workers cannot obtain masks from the pharmacy because they must stay with employers and adhere to government-recommended selfquarantine. 4 In the absence of reliable information in their own language, IMWs may also not recognise the seriousness of the epidemic or receive accurate information on how to protect themselves from infection. 5 However, most IMWs have smartphones, 3 which can be a useful aid in providing informational and social support during the epidemic, like during the previous MERS epidemic. 5 For instance, WeChat (a Chinese social network platform) is used by IMWs in Hong Kong and Macau for sharing key health messages and official information to the community and providing one another with emotional support. It can, however, also spread inaccurate information and panic that could lead to IMWs delaying visits to health centres due to stigmatisation of those who are infected. 5 Regardless of IMWs communities' self-reliance and resilience, addressing their health needs should be made an urgent public health priority because infection among these individuals could also lead to community infection, eventually affecting the entire population's health. For instance, during the epidemic, IMWs should be provided more accessible health care. Public health campaigns should be available in multiple languages and diffused through various communication channels and networks of IMWs as soon as possible. In addition, more countries should ratify the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families to provide global health equity and ensure that migrant workers' health is not neglected in future epidemics and disasters.","Nosocomial infectious disease outbreaks are serious threats that can impose great stress on any given healthcare facility if not managed properly.

Since the beginning of the epidemic, daily and weekly surveillance reports were communicated among the NOCT and the leaders of the represented institutions as part of stakeholders\u2019 information sharing, consistent with the CERC recommendations. Thanks to such reports, public health experts were able to respond quickly to requests for clarification on surveillance. This allowed for a national consensus on the anticipated risk of MERS-CoV and the establishment of a recommended course of action, and it ensured a collective understanding among risk communicators, minimizing the amount of contradictory messages given to the public.","A key parameter is the basic reproduction number (R 0 ), which determines how fast SARS-CoV-2 can spread through the population during the early stages of the outbreak. This is an inherently difficult parameter to estimate, since the true number of cases that can transmit infection at a given time is unknown (reported cases are likely to be just a small fraction of true cases) and probably varies over time (because of different interventions being introduced and population behaviour changing in response to the epidemic). In our analysis, we used an existing model that inferred time-dependent R e based on the growth of reported cases in Wuhan and the number of exported cases outside China originating from Wuhan. 14 We acknowledge that the underlying reproduction number in Wuhan could have been larger than that used in our study. However, other studies of early SARS-CoV-2 transmission dynamics in Wuhan, using different methods, arrived at the same estimate with similar ranges. 1, 9 Although the precise effects of interventions might vary by country and different estimates of key parameters, our model highlights the usefulness of physical distancing interventions and the need to carefully calibrate their lifting to avoid second and subsequent waves of a COVID-19 epidemic. Areas of China outside Hubei and other east or southeast Asian regions have managed to avert a major outbreak locally and delayed the peak of the epidemic, without resorting to Hubei's extreme measures. 38 Policy makers are advised to reapportion their resources to focus on mitigating the effects of potentially soon-to-be overwhelmed health systems. 39 Non-physical distancing factors play a part in mitigating potential spikes in cases, especially when physical distancing measures are relaxed. The effects of seasonality on SARS-CoV-2 are difficult to predict without long time series; supporting evidence for the link between climate and COVID-19 has been largely anecdotal and based on spread in different settings and such analyses are subject to confounding. 40, 41 Consequently, we have not incorporated climatic factors into our mathematical model. Future research should be directed towards understanding the potential seasonality of COVID-19 and the climatic factors that could affect its transmission dynamics. Other innovations, such as the rapid expansion of hospital capacity and testing capabilities, would shorten diagnostic and health system delays, 3, 38, 39 thus reducing effective interactions between infectious and susceptible individuals and interrupting transmission. Effective vaccines 42 and antivirals 43 that are being developed could counteract this global public health threat. The extent to which these strategies can detect cases earlier and isolate infectious individuals from the susceptible pool or protect against infection is less well-understood, hence nece ssitating further evaluation.","While the virus resembles other coronaviruses harbored in bats, the animal host of 2019-nCoV has not been identified, nor has the mechanism by which a suspected animal virus made the jump to humans. Likewise, whether the initial infections derived from a single zoonotic transmission event or many such events has yet to be ascertained. Resolving these issues will help establish effective control measures to limit further viral transmission. However, to do so will require sharing not just knowledge but the virus itself. At the time of this writing, only China had access to the intact virus, which means that other countries would need to create it anew by reverse engineering or by isolating the virus from infected people. Although this is feasible, such barriers to complete collaboration can contribute to delays in outbreak control.","\u2610Types of facilitators and barriers that were considered \u2610Methods by which information regarding the facilitators and barriers to implementing recommendations were sought (e.g., feedback from key stakeholders, pilot testing of guidelines before widespread implementation) NR \u2610Information/description of the types of facilitators and barriers that emerged from the inquiry (e.g., practitioners have the skills to deliver the recommended care, sufficient equipment is not available to ensure all eligible members of the population receive mammography) \u2610Types of cost information that were considered (e.g., economic evaluations, drug acquisition costs)","\u2610Types of facilitators and barriers that were considered \u2610Methods by which information regarding the facilitators and barriers to implementing recommendations were sought (e.g., feedback from key stakeholders, pilot testing of guidelines before widespread implementation) \u2610Information/description of the types of facilitators and barriers that emerged from the inquiry (e.g., practitioners have the skills to deliver the recommended care, sufficient equipment is not available to ensure all eligible members of the population receive mammography) \u2610How the information influenced the guideline development process and/or formation of the recommendations 19.

These activities are not conducive to the rapid response to a crisis (although many academics do respond), or to sustained engagement and training of corporate and government teams. Companies are incentivised by profit, and are rightly beholden to national regulatory frameworks and the public with respect to the data they collect. Ministries of health have complex relationships with both the companies that have access to personal data and with the public. They face many competing health priorities and complex political choices when it comes to open sharing of epidemiological data. Disease control programmes are often hampered by limited capacity and high turnover of personnel, and health workers on the ground during an epidemic have their hands full responding to the immediate crisis and might not be trained or incentivised to report epidemiological data accurately. Taken together, these incentive structures create multiple barriers to rapid data generation and the development of streamlined epidemic forecasting systems that use these new data types.","Costa Rica (Hall, Gomez, &amp; Fernandez-Llimos, 2006) .

Information sharing systems: A possible compensation for the lack and the scarcity of information is to establish an information sharing system by constructing a national or a regional medicines information database.

Our model transmission rate \u03c4 (t) can be modified to illustrate the effects of an earlier or later implementation of the major public policy interventions that occurred in this epidemic. The implementation one week earlier (25 is replaced by 18 in (4.1)) is graphed in Figure 6A . All other parameters and the initial conditions remain the same. The total reported cases is approximately 4, 500 and the total unreported cases is approximately 1, 100. The implementation one week later (25 is replaced by 32 in (4.1)) is graphed in Figure 6B . The total reported cases is approximately 820, 000 and the total unreported cases is approximately 200, 000. The timing of the institution of major social restrictions is critically important in mitigating the epidemic. The number of unreported cases is of major importance in understanding the evolution of an epidemic, and involves great difficulty in their estimation. The data from January 19 to February 15 for reported cases in Table 2 , was only for confirmed tested cases. Between February 11 and February 15, additional clinically diagnosed case data, based on medical imaging showing signs of pneumonia, was also reported by the Chinese CDC. Since February 16, only tested case data has been reported by the Chinese CDC, because new NHC guidelines removed the clinically diagnosed category. Thus, after February 15, there is a gap in the reported case data that we used up to February 15. The uncertainty of the number of unreported cases for this epidemic includes this gap, but goes even further to include additional unreported cases.","With the experience of mitigating the outbreaks of SARS and avian influenza, what strategies can be applied in mitigating COVID-19 and future CoV outbreaks? Should veterinarians play more important roles in the prevention and control of emerging zoonoses in the future?","Research in contextEvidence before this studyContact tracing and isolation of cases is a common intervention for controlling infectious disease outbreaks. It can be effective but might require intensive public health effort and cooperation to effectively reach and monitor all contacts. Previous work has shown that when the pathogen has infectiousness before symptom onset, control of outbreaks using contact tracing and isolation is more challenging. Further introduction of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) to new territories is likely in the coming days and weeks, and interventions to prevent an outbreak following these introductions are a key mitigating strategy. Current planning is focused on tracing of contacts of introduced cases, and rapid isolation. These methods have been used previously for other novel outbreaks, but it is not clear if they will be effective for COVID-19.Added value of this studyWe use a mathematical model to assess the feasibility of contact tracing and case isolation to control outbreaks of COVID-19. We used disease transmission characteristics specific to the pathogen and give the best available evidence if contact tracing and isolation can achieve control of outbreaks. We simulated new outbreaks starting from 5, 20, or 40 introduced cases. Contact tracing and isolation might not contain outbreaks of COVID-19 unless very high levels of contact tracing are achieved. Even in this case, if there is subclinical transmission, or a high fraction of transmission before onset of symptoms, this strategy might not achieve control within 3 months.Implications of all the available evidenceThe effectiveness of isolation of cases and contacts to control outbreaks of COVID-19 depends on the precise characteristics of transmission, which remain unclear at the present time. Using the current best understanding, around 80% of symptomatic contacts must be traced and isolated to control over 80% of outbreaks in the model. Future research on the transmission characteristics could improve precision on control estimates.","1. Poorest countries with limited resources should work on establishing national medicines information centers to cover the needs of the whole country. 2. Different institutions within the same country can work on establishing an information sharing system to facilitate information exchange and building up huge medicines information databases. 3. Collaboration among countries from the same region provides great opportunities to save resources and strengthening the capacities for attaining sustainable high-quality services. This can be achieved via sharing available experiences and resources and can be maximized by building collaborative regional MICs. 4. Institutions from developing countries with no or limited access to high-quality medicines information resources should seek assistance from supportive organizations such as the WHO, which can offer free access to the Hinari database. Other freely available resources should be also sought. 5. Medicines information education should be promoted among colleges of pharmacy at various levels including didactic courses during undergraduate studies, during APPE training of PharmD students and as postgraduate studies and training (i.e., residencies, fellowships, and masters programs). 6. Training for developing and strengthening the medicines information skills should be provided regularly to all practicing pharmacists as part of the continuing professional development (CPD) programs 7. Advanced training can be scheduled for pharmacists working on the provision of medicines information services as part of CPD activities to build their capacities and to raise their competencies. 8. Countries with limited experiences in the area of medicines information should work on to learn from countries having well-established systems of medicines information and try to copy successful innovations. 9. There is a need to monitor and evaluate various resources of medicines information available in the developing countries as well as evaluating the services provided by the medicines information centers. This is very useful for improvement and for the expansion and the sustainability of the services. Evaluations are done by conducting scientific research studies. Such researches should be published to allow others make use of the established evidence.","Certainly, organizational issues impact individual attitudes considerably. For example, workload issues are thought to affect HCW willingness to comply with recommendations for PPE use. Workers who feel stressed and overloaded at work are much less likely to be attendant to safety needs and precautions. 23 Helfgott et al found that knowledge of how to prevent occupational exposure did not appear to correlate with compliance with UP. 41 The most common reasons why HCWs in this study did not comply were time constraints, interference with performing specific tasks, and lack of risk-based information to assist HCWs in identifying infectious patients. It was also noteworthy that this study also found that level of compliance was inversely proportional to level of experience of the HCW. Osborne determined that mean compliance rates among Australian operating room nurses were 55.6% with always double gloving during surgical procedures and 92% with always wearing adequate eye protection. 52 The variable that had the most influence on compliance was the perception of barriers to compliance, specifically, that adhering to UP interfered with duties. Nickell et al found in their study of 2001 HCWs during the SARS outbreak in Toronto that the most commonly cited difficulty with complying with precautionary measures, especially masks, was that wearing one for any extended period of time was very uncomfortable. 53 Dejoy et al, in their 2000 study, demonstrated the importance of easy access to the correct PPE when needed as an influence on compliance. 14 Presumably, the greater perceived availability of PPE may lead to stronger beliefs in their effectiveness for prevention among HCWs. It is interesting that the case-control study conducted by Lau et al during the SARS outbreak in Hong Kong also found that perceiving that adequate PPE was unavailable was associated with an increased risk of acquiring disease. 40 The perception that the use of PPE may lead to decreased quality in the therapeutic relationship between patients and HCWs has been shown to be a significant factor that influences HCW compliance. 5, 54, 55 Interference with the practitioner-patient relationship and decreased dexterity were the most frequently cited reasons for noncompliance in one study. 54 Nickell et al found that, during the Toronto SARS outbreak, HCWs found that wearing of masks made communication difficult and led to a sense of social isolation. 53 Others have found that the wearing of PPE places barriers between 2 people, negatively altering interpersonal dynamics and complicating the performance of tasks and treatment. 14 Respirators cover the face and mouth, hampering communication, especially for the elderly population and those with hearing loss. Use of respirators may lead to increased isolation and fear among patients. 56 Prieto and Clark also cited concerns among nurses that isolation of patients could lead to depression from lack of social contacts. 45 CONCLUSION SARS was a disease largely spread by respiratory droplets. The lack of spread within the community and the recent information on relatively low natural transmission rates for SARS coronavirus indicate that SARS is less contagious than influenza and other similar respiratory infections. 1 The consistent application of basic infection control precautions terminated outbreaks in Vietnam, 10 Taiwan, 57 Singapore, Hong Kong, 58 and, eventually, Toronto. 59 Large outbreaks occurred when the causative agent was not recognized, generally early in the course of the epidemic, and basic infection control procedures were not in place. As such, attention to understanding why there was a failure to implement appropriate precautions, and how best to promote compliance in future, is an important topic for study.","For any country, eff ective control of infectious diseases is dependent on focused eff orts to decrease endemic infections in at-risk and susceptible populations, combined with strong epidemiological and laboratory capacity to detect and stop emerging threats. Inherent in these eff orts are well established links between clinical, public health, and research communities working with non-traditional partners such as industry, law enforcement, businesses, and the media. Although at their core these collaborations need to be established locally, such crucial partnerships have to extend across state, national, and international levels. Together, these alliances can form a global infrastructure and system to detect and control infectious diseases. With that aim, in February, 2014, the USA and other nations joined WHO, the Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations, and the World Organization for Animal Health in a new global health security agenda designed to enhance strategies to prevent, detect, and respond to threats of infectious disease. 123 Partner countries will work together to meet a series of objectives covering crucial issues aff ecting control of infectious disease such as antimicrobial resistance, biosafety and biosecurity, global disease detection and response networks, and emergency responses. Much emphasis has been placed on the aptly named perfect storm inherent in today's globalised world for rapid emergence and spread of infectious diseases. Despite this persistent challenge, extraordinary achievements in science and technology continue to bolster the capacity to recognise and respond to these threats. Scientifi cally, next-generation sequencing and state-of-the-art bioinformatics capabilities are transforming the practice of microbiology and the speed at which infectious pathogens can be detected and analysed. 85,124 These technologies provide a new level of information about infectious pathogens and therefore off er tremendous opportunities for public health eff orts to detect and control outbreaks, target antimicrobial resistance, and develop and refi ne treatments and vaccines. [125] [126] [127] Additionally, the increasing understanding of the role of human microbiomes in disease development and new links between infectious agents and chronic diseases opens new possibilities for disease prevention and treatment. 128 Advances in electronic communications have also been essential and have enabled rapid sharing of health and safety information and expertise by health-care and public health workers, researchers, law enforcement, the media, and private individuals. These communication capacities can facilitate and enhance research and public health partnerships worldwide, generating broad sharing of research fi ndings and health updates in near real time. The latest surge in health communications has come from social media tools, which are increasingly being used to extend the reach of public health information. To ensure that these rapidly changing scientifi c and technological advances are routinely used in public health is a crucial challenge and priority.","SARS galvanized the international community to finally conclude drafting of the revised IHR. The IHR bind WHO member countries to not only notify all events that may constitute a public health emergency, but also to respond to requests for verification of information. WHO has also produced outbreak communication guidelines to aid in the dissemination of information to the public, recognizing that 'expertise [in communications] has become as essential to outbreak control as epidemiological training and laboratory analysis'. 2 The boundaries between risk communication and management are not, however, sharply delineated, as illustrated by the controversy surrounding H5N1 influenza virus sharing. Indonesia is one of the countries hardest hit by outbreaks of H5N1. Virus sharing with the international community is the mechanism by which, first, viruses developing pandemic potential can be tracked (risk communication), and second, vaccines can be developed to meet global need (risk management). Indonesia refused to virus share, not because it was opposed to the sharing of technical information to better understand the threat posed by H5N1 avian influenza, but because it felt excluded from equitable access to the resulting vaccine, meaning that its management of a subsequent pandemic would be constrained. 3 It could be argued that Indonesian authorities currently view virus sharing as an important element in risk management and thus a sovereign issue, although the international community, by contrast, views virus sharing as a critical element of risk communication and, by extension, a global risk management issue. Differing interpretations of international treaties are possible and resolution is proving challenging. 4 Ultimately, the debate is centred on the boundary between the governance of risk communication and risk management, the former now being mandated through international laws, with the latter remaining, to a large degree, a national sovereignty responsibility.","\u2610A statement that the guideline will be updated NR Describe the procedure for updating the guideline. \u2610Explicit time interval or explicit criteria to guide decisions about when an update will occur \u2610Methodology for the updating procedure \u2610Methods by which information regarding the facilitators and barriers to implementing recommendations were sought (e.g., feedback from key stakeholders, pilot testing of guidelines before widespread implementation) \u2610Information/description of the types of facilitators and barriers that emerged from the inquiry (e.g., practitioners have the skills to deliver the recommended care, sufficient equipment is not available to ensure all eligible members of the population receive mammography)","Financial and vocational barriers are likely to be most profound with persons of lower socioeconomic status. Individuals who can work from home may be those whose jobs revolve around information technology in some way; those jobs may be higher-paying. Conversely, those in manufacturing or service sectors may find they suddenly have severely restricted income. These individuals may therefore aggressively pursue any work outside the home. Community pharmacists can help address these barriers when they arise by keeping contact information for local governmental and nongovernmental organizations that may provide support for people who are experiencing economic distress. These resources may include social workers, local government aid agencies, or even food pantries.","With its unparalleled capacity for near-instant, wide-scale information sharing and dissemination, the Internet proved to be an indispensable and very effective tool in understanding, rapidly responding to and successfully controlling global outbreaks like SARS.","The triage station was required to be located outside the entrance of the outpatient hall with highlighted signs. This location was chosen for better ventilation and more space, mitigating close contact among people by setting one-metre interval lines for queueing. The security guard and the nurse measure the temperature of the people on line using a mobile infrared thermometer. Tents are pitched for further investigation of suspected patients. One tent is for nonfebrile persons and the other is for febrile patients to enter. All people with mobile phone are required to register their identification and other basic information by scanning the QR code next to the queueing line before entry, reducing the time of collecting information, minimizing the risk of potential contamination by touching the pen and paper and also shortening the waiting time. Filling in the information manually is available, with the help of nurses, for people who cannot complete the task electronically. In the tent, a second time temperature measurement using a more precise infrared thermometer is undertaken, to further assess suspected patients and to minimize the risk of contact transmission to medical staff. Routine hand sanitizers are ready to be used at any time. Trained physicians and nurses wearing personal protective equipment (PPE) work together for initial assessment and the differential diagnosis of the fever. A simple, but crucial, questionnaire is designed to assist diagnosing patients (Figure 1 and Supplementary Figure 1) . [3, 6] General fever clinic and specific fever clinic for the suspected After assessment, patients with fever or cold-like symptoms with epidemiological history or suspected epidemiological history are referred to the 'COVID-2019 fever clinic'; other fever patients without epidemiological history are referred to the \"general fever clinic\". At the clinics the suspected febrile patient undergoes detailed history taking, physical examination, blood and other specimen collection and imaging. Usually, nasopharyngeal specimen are tested all of the febrile patients, regardless of epidemiological links, to ensure that cases are not mis-assigned at triage. Only trained staff are engaged in specimen collection to guarantee the quality of specimen. Extra backup room is kept to accommodate for any overflow of febrile patient. Besides, routine use of disinfectant wipes, disinfectant spray, UV light and air disinfecting machines ensure timely cleaning and sterilization. Hospitals are either redesigning and remodelling old buildings or quickly setting up temporary tents or barrack-like rooms at an open area for better classification and circuit of two passages and the three regions of standard fever clinic, dramatically reducing the risks of hospital cross infection.","Preparing for epidemic threats is not a static or binary (prepared or unprepared) exercise, but a dynamic state reflecting the constantly changing world. Countries prepare in different ways based on their interpretation of disease risks and international agreements such as the International Health Regulations (IHR). The IHR were introduced in 1969 to prevent spread of specific serious diseases between countries and set out preparedness measures at international borders to stop disease spread. The 2005 revisions to the IHR reflect changes across multiple dimensions, requiring countries to develop preparedness capacities to detect and respond to outbreaks where and when they occur, supported by international partners to respond when outbreaks cannot be contained locally. 5 However, disruptive factors have emerged at a greater pace over the past decade, creating a new ecology that requires novel strategies for preparedness. These factors include dealing with the increasing human population density and connectivity, harnessing novel data streams and new technological advances to manage epidemics, mitigating false information on social networks, to creating informal technical networks that can work together when political forces fail to do so.","Registry data can be essential in the development of radiology diagnosis and shared learning. They have sometimes changed practice, for example, the identification of high rates of morbidity in patients undergoing emergency biliary procedures via the Swedish Registry GallRiks, and complications in vascular surgery via vascular registries. 3, 4 The Royal College of Radiologists document \"Setting up a regional or national digital teaching archive\" 3,5 makes clear that such databases are needed for developing the knowledge and skills of radiology trainees, but would also significantly benefit trained radiologists. This is perhaps even more pertinent in the face of a new virus whose imaging features can be varied and unfamiliar. Indeed, it has long been recognised that breaking down technological barriers to contributing imaging studies directly from a picture archiving and communications system (PACS) viewer to a central imaging repository would make teaching and research in the National Health Service (NHS) more efficient and accurate. Overcoming such a bottleneck would also deliver the potential to exponentially upskill the radiology workforce in the early and accurate diagnosis of COVID-19, in what is currently a highly dynamic situation. By bringing together thoracic CT expertise across the UK, a central COVID-19 imaging repository and database can help reduce unwarranted diagnostic variation, provide better quality care for patients, and provide a resource to accumulate knowledge rapidly. Such a database would also allow real-time tracking of confirmed CT cases and allow improved understanding of the significance of cases with positive CT findings, but negative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) results. This will help collate valuable information for the NHS and Public Health England.","Viral and bacterial surveillance and discovery is useful for evaluating the possibility of microbe sharing with other animals and humans that come into contact with D. rotundus. Identifying bloodmeals from bat fecal samples can also reveal ecological connections of epidemiological importance such as host prey preference (Carter et al. 2006), and understanding the foraging patterns and movement of both D. rotundus and their prey may give further insights into patterns of microbe sharing and potential routes of disease transmission. In this study, we collect and analyze clinical specimens from D. rotundus in Guatemala to examine their viral diversity and host species feeding preferences in order to better understand the potential for pathogen spillover.","The above impacts demonstrate that the issues of virus outbreaks transcend urban safety and impacts upon all other facets of our urban fabric. Therefore, it becomes paramount to ensure that the measures taken to contain a virus transcend nationalist agendas where data and information sharing is normally restricted, to a more global agenda where humanity and global order are encouraged. With such an approach, it would be easier to share urban health data across geographies to better monitor emerging health threats in order to provide more economic stability, thereby ensuring no disruptions on such sectors like tourism and travel industries, amongst others. This is possible by ensuring collaborative, proactive measures to control outbreak spread and thus, human movements. This would remove fears on travelers, and would have positive impacts upon the tourism industry, that has been seen to bear the economic brunt whenever such outbreaks occur. This can be achieved by ensuring that protocols on data sharing are calibrated to remove all hurdles pertaining to sharing of information. On this, Lawpoolsri et al. [31] posits that such issues, like transparency, timelessness of sharing and access and quality of data, should be upheld so that continuous monitoring and assessment can be pursued.","Behavior (Guitton, 2013) pinpointed the importance of virtual spaces to help understand human behavior in existential risk situations. What was then a mainly theoretical stance is now a reality. While information is central in dealing with the pandemic, it can also generate high levels of anxiety among the population. Fake news are more actual than even, and mitigating their propagation is potentially as important to preserve social peace as fighting the virus itself. With social isolation getting more and more drastic, social media and the Internet can allow us to maintain the social bounds necessary for people to stay united. Distance teaching can compensate the closing down of schools and universities. Telework can reduce some of the impacts of the crisis on economy. While technology (notably with the democratization of travelling) might have been one of the factors that made COVID-19 reach a pandemic status, technology -and particularly online technologies -will also be a key element for us to survive this crisis. Therefore, for all these reasons, cyberpsychology research should not stop. As researchers specializing in how technology impacts human behavior, it is our duty to stay active, and to work to help document all these aspects. It is our duty to help propose and find solutions to the problems elicited by this sanitary crisis.","Many of the studies in this special issue identified strategies to improve the health of marginalized groups. Wallimann and colleagues [19] explored the primary care network of Eritrean immigrants in Switzerland. They found language difficulties and intercultural understanding are barriers to properly accessing care and identified six key lessons for practices to facilitate health care access for Eritrean immigrants. Pudpong et al. [20] assessed a voluntary health insurance scheme for migrants in Thailand. They found that it improved access for previously uninsured migrants and reduced the financial burden for public hospitals in the project area. They suggested further efforts to raise community understanding of the benefits of being insured in order to improve the sustainability and effectiveness of the program. Gaboardi et al. [21] assessed the goals and principles of providers working with people experiencing homelessness in eight European countries, indicating a contrast between providers who were more focused on their client\u2019s autonomy and those whose primary focus was on the client\u2019s basic needs such as food, health and temporary accommodation. Braun-Lewensohn et al. [22] explored the coping strategies for stressors among women in Bedouin society and described the stability of sense of coherence (SOC) in this minority society as it underwent rapid social and cultural changes. Significant differences were found between age groups, and the oldest women were identified as an at-risk population due to limitations in their coping strategies and SOC. In related research in a very different community, Millan et al. [23] examined the health beliefs and practices of Gypsies and Travelers in the UK, where these communities experience significant marginalization and discrimination. They described this community\u2019s health problems and their experiences in health care systems, including discrimination and negative stereotypes. The authors indicate the need for a more concentrated and intensive approach to improve health among travelers in the UK.","The regional bodies like ASEAN, SAARC, European Union (EU) need to enact regional protocols, coupled with information portals on pandemic risk. Traffic is quite high within the region, especially among countries with land borders. Thus proper protocol on human movement information sharing is required. The information sharing needs to be open and transparent, which enhances safer regional, cross border as well as global movement.","The OECD (1986) report, which set benchmarks for international harmonization of the regulatory framework, reviews national positions on safety of recombinant (r-DNA) organisms for industrial, agricultural and environmental use, and existing or proposed regulations for r-DNA organisms. It also identifies criteria for authorization of the use of r-DNA organisms and explores ways of monitoring production and use in these sectors, in the belief that 'a common understanding of these safety issues will provide the basis for taking initial steps toward international accord, the protection of health and of the environment, the promotion of international commerce, and the reduction of national barriers to trade in the field of biotechnology'.","Although this is not an exhaustive list of chemical additives capable of mitigating Salmonella or other biological hazards in animal feeds, it does give manufacturers an additional option to ensure finished product safety.","Here, factors such as pre-existing mental illness, self-and extraneous endangerment, violence and aggressive behavior, refusal to eat, and also assessments and recommendations of experienced security staff should be taken into account. -Given the flood of perceivable unsettling information on Covid-19, staff providing psychological or psychiatric treatment should be informed regularly and urgently about symptomatology and presentation and on the realistic clinical course, also in comparison to other infectious diseases or in comparison to other daily risks. Sharing of accurate information without bias and panic is critical. -Ensuring the provision of masks, disinfectants and protective measures in sufficient quantity for psychological and psychiatric staff visiting individuals in detention. -Particular attention should also be paid to certify that staff deployed to provide psychological-psychiatric care in institutions are informed and/or sensitized of known potential risk factors for a more severe course of a Covid-19 infection of their own (advanced age, somatic comorbidities, chronic respiratory diseases, hypertension, cancer, known immune deficiencies etc.). Due to the currently limited understanding of Covid-19, it may be advisable to prohibit employees with such conditions from providing psychological or psychiatric care to individuals in detention and prisons. -If there is a sudden shortage of staff providing psychological and psychiatric care to detained individuals with a mental illness, staff from general psychiatry may have to fill consequential gaps. This needs careful planning on an urgent basis so that the potential of extremely long working hours of medical staff during the current outbreak can be managed successfully.","On this occasion information sharing seems to have been rapid and effective (while recognising that the information available in the early stages of an outbreak is always less than the global community would like). The WHO was notified of the original clustering within days and the full genomic sequence of the new virus was published less than 2 weeks after the cluster was first detected. The WHO has expressed its satisfaction with the actions of the Chinese authorities in sharing information with the WHO.","A numerical investigation of this alternative model shows that confirmed case data can be reasonably fit for all provinces, as well, which confirms the argumentation of App. B that removal of susceptibles from the transmission process is more effective than quarantine in mitigating epidemic spread.","Although the study of bat-borne coronaviruses has only started just about 10 years ago, the scientific community has already learnt a great deal of useful lessons which will be instrumental in mitigating, predicting, and preventing future zoonotic coronavirus outbreaks. Some of these lessons are summarized below.","Another key factor in successfully preventing and managing emerging threats is the rapid and transparent sharing of information between countries and agencies. There was extensive criticism of China for its perceived failure to share information about the emerging SARS infection early enough in the outbreak to allow countries to prepare and respond. There were similar concerns about information sharing as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) emerged and evolved in the Middle East in 2012, particularly in Saudi Arabia, and about the emergence of Ebola in West Africa in 2014.","Here again, the establishing a unique decision tree to support National decision about medicine importation/exportation could be useful to reduce the fragmentation of shortage-mitigating strategies among European countries and to improve the effectiveness of the National strategic plan to satisfy the patients' needs, without altering the National regulatory framework.","Chlamydia pneumoniae can produce fever, cough (again mitigating against GABHS), and sore throat.I9 Pharyngitis can occur without pneumonia, concomitantly with it, or precede it by 2 to 4 weeks. Prolonged pharyngitis has been reported.
