However, it is also important for clinicians and epidemiologists to differentiate COVID-19 from other respiratory infectious diseases, such as influenza viruses. Research question The aim of the study was to explore the different clinical presentations between COVID-19 and influenza A (H1N1) pneumonia in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Study Design and Methods: This was a retrospective case-control study. We compared two independent cohorts of ARDS patients infected with either COVID-19 (n=73) or H1N1 (n=75). We analyzed and compared their clinical manifestations, imaging characteristics, treatments, and prognosis. Results The median age of COVID-19 patients was higher than that of H1N1 patients, and there was a higher proportion of males among COVID-19 patients (p&lt;0.05). COVID-19 patients exhibite...","Acute renal impairment in coronavirus-associated severe acute respiratory syndrome. Background Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a newly emerged infection from a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV). Apart from fever and respiratory complications, acute renal impairment has been observed in some patients with SARS. Herein, we describe the clinical, pathologic, and laboratory features of the acute renal impairment complicating this new viral infection. Methods We conducted a retrospective analysis of the plasma creatinine concentration and other clinical parameters of the 536 SARS patients with normal plasma creatinine at first clinical presentation, admitted to two regional hospitals following a major outbreak in Hong Kong in March 2003. Kidney tissues from seven other patients with postmortem examinations were studied by light microscopy and electron microscopy. Results Among these 536 patients with SARS, 36 (6.7%) developed acute renal impairment occurring at a median duration of 2...","Abstract H7N9 viruses quickly spread between mammalian hosts and carry the risk of human-to-human transmission, as shown by the 2013 outbreak. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), lung failure, and fulminant pneumonia are major lung diseases in H7N9 patients. Transplantation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) is a promising choice for treating virus-induced pneumonia, and was used to treat H7N9-induced ARDS in 2013. The transplant of MSCs into patients with H7N9-induced ARDS was conducted at a single center through an open-label clinical trial. Based on the principles of voluntariness and informed consent, 44 patients with H7N9-induced ARDS were included as a control group, while 17 patients with H7N9-induced ARDS acted as an experimental group with allogeneic menstrual-blood-derived MSCs. It was notable that MSC transplantation significantly lowered the mortality of the experimental group, compared with the control group (17.6% died in the experimental group while 54.5% died in t...","Viral infections are an important cause of pediatric acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Numerous viruses, including respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and influenza A (H1N1) virus, have been implicated in the progression of pneumonia to ARDS; yet the incidence of progression is unknown. Despite acute and chronic morbidity associated with respiratory viral infections, particularly in \u201cat risk\u201d populations, treatment options are limited. Thus, with few exceptions, care is symptomatic. In addition, mortality rates for viral-related ARDS have yet to be determined. This review outlines what is known about ARDS secondary to viral infections including the epidemiology, the pathophysiology, and diagnosis. In addition, emerging treatment options to prevent infection, and to decrease disease burden will be outlined. We focused on RSV and influenza A (H1N1) viral-induced ARDS, as these are the most common viruses leading to pediatric ARDS, and have specific prophylactic and definitive tre...","Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) causes sporadic zoonotic disease and healthcare-associated outbreaks in human. MERS is often complicated by acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and multi-organ failure(1,2). The high incidence of renal failure in MERS is a unique clinical feature not often found in other human coronavirus infections(3,4). Whether MERS-CoV infects the kidney and how it triggers renal failure are not understood(5,6). Here, we demonstrated renal infection and apoptotic induction by MERS-CoV in human ex vivo organ culture and a nonhuman primate model. High-throughput analysis revealed that the cellular genes most significantly perturbed by MERS-CoV have previously been implicated in renal diseases. Furthermore, MERS-CoV induced apoptosis through upregulation of Smad7 and fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) expression in both kidney and lung cells. Conversely, knockdown of Smad7 effectively inhibited MERS-CoV replication and protected cells from v...","Background: The outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) results in a cluster of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). We reported the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and further investigated the treatment and progression of ARDS in COVID-19. Methods: This study enrolled 109 patients with COVID-19 admitted to the Central Hospital of Wuhan, a designated hospital in Wuhan, China, from January 2 to February 1, 2020. Patients were followed up to February 12, 2020. The clinical data were collected from the electronic medical records. The differences in the treatment and progression with the time and the severity of ARDS were determined. Findings: Among 109 patients, mean age was 55 years, and 59 patients were male. With a median 15 days (range, 4 to 30 days) follow-up period, 31 patients (28.4%) died, while 78 (71.6%) survived and discharged. Of all patients, 53 (48.6%) developed ARDS. Compared to ...","Abstract We recently established a mouse model (288\u2013330+/+) that developed acute respiratory disease resembling human pathology following infection with a high dose (5 \u00d7 106 PFU) of mouse-adapted MERS-CoV (icMERSma1). Although this high dose conferred fatal respiratory disease in mice, achieving similar pathology at lower viral doses may more closely reflect naturally acquired infections. Through continued adaptive evolution of icMERSma1 we generated a novel mouse-adapted MERS-CoV (maM35c4) capable of achieving severe respiratory disease at doses between 103 and 105 PFU. Novel mutations were identified in the maM35c4 genome that may be responsible for eliciting etiologies of acute respiratory distress syndrome at 10\u20131000 fold lower viral doses. Importantly, comparative genetics of the two mouse-adapted MERS strains allowed us to identify specific mutations that remained fixed through an additional 20 cycles of adaptive evolution. Our data indicate that the extent of MERS-CoV adaptation...","Background Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is an emerging infectious disease, and indeed, the SARS epidemic in Taiwan from March to July 2003 had a great impact. This study depicts the clinical characteristics and short-term outcomes of patients with SARS treated at Taipei Veterans General Hospital; potential predictive factors for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) are also analyzed. Methods This study retrospectively analyzed data for 67 SARS patients, who were grouped according to whether or not ARDS developed during the clinical course of SARS. Results There were 32 males (mean age, 50.3 years; range, 20\u201375 years) and 35 females (mean age, 51.1 years; range, 23\u201386 years). Twenty-five patients (37.3%) were health care workers. At admission, 50 patients (74.6%) had abnormal chest radiographs, and all patients developed pulmonary infiltrates during the following week. During hospitalization, lymphopenia was found in 57 patients (85.1%); and elevated levels of lactate ...","Summary The acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) can be induced by viral diseases, with two virus types being responsible: respiratory viruses that cause community-acquired viral pneumonia and Herpesviridae that cause nosocomial viral pneumonia. Among the respiratory viruses that can affect the lung and cause ARDS, pandemic viruses head the list, with influenza viruses H5N1 and H1N1 2009 being the most recently identified. However, other viruses can cause severe ARDS. Notably, a novel coronavirus was responsible for the severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak in 2003. Apart from these pandemic viruses, respiratory viruses are rarely responsible for viral pneumonia and ARDS. Other than antiviral drug (mainly oseltamivir) administration and avoidance of corticosteroids, management of ARDS due to these viruses does not differ from that for ARDS caused by other diseases. Among Herpesviridae, herpes simplex virus (HSV) and cytomegalovirus (CMV) are the two viruses causing nosocomia...","Acute febrile respiratory illness (FRI) leading to respiratory failure is a common reason for admission to the ICU. Viral pneumonia constitutes a portion of these cases, and often the viral etiology goes undiagnosed. Emerging viral infectious diseases such as severe acute respiratory syndrome and avian influenza present with acute FRIs progressing to respiratory failure and ARDS. Therefore, early recognition of a viral cause of acute FRI leading to ARDS becomes important for protection of health-care workers (HCWs), lessening spread to other patients, and notification of public health officials. These patients often have longer courses of viral shedding and undergo higher-risk procedures that may potentially generate aerosols, such as intubation, bronchoscopy, bag-valve mask ventilation, noninvasive positive pressure ventilation, and medication nebulization, further illustrating the importance of early detection and isolation. A small number of viral agents lead to acute FRI, respirato...","Summary Background An ongoing outbreak of pneumonia associated with the severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) started in December, 2019, in Wuhan, China. Information about critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection is scarce. We aimed to describe the clinical course and outcomes of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia. Methods In this single-centered, retrospective, observational study, we enrolled 52 critically ill adult patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia who were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) of Wuhan Jin Yin-tan hospital (Wuhan, China) between late December, 2019, and Jan 26, 2020. Demographic data, symptoms, laboratory values, comorbidities, treatments, and clinical outcomes were all collected. Data were compared between survivors and non-survivors. The primary outcome was 28-day mortality, as of Feb 9, 2020. Secondary outcomes included incidence of SARS-CoV-2-related acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and the proportion of pati...","Viral infections are common causes of respiratory tract disease in the outpatient setting but much less common in the intensive care unit. However, a finite number of viral agents cause respiratory tract disease in the intensive care unit. Some viruses, such as influenza, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), cytomegalovirus (CMV), and varicella-zoster virus (VZV), are relatively common. Others, such as adenovirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-coronavirus, Hantavirus, and the viral hemorrhagic fevers (VHFs), are rare but have an immense public health impact. Recognizing these viral etiologies becomes paramount in treatment, infection control, and public health measures. Therefore, a basic understanding of the pathogenesis of viral entry, replication, and host response is important for clinical diagnosis and initiating therapeutic options. This review discusses the basic pathophysiology leading to clinical presentations in a few common and rare, but important, viruses found in ...","Introduction: Despite the improved outcomes in solid organ transplantation with regard to prevention of rejection and increased patient and graft survival, infection remains a common cause of morbidity and mortality. Respiratory viruses are a frequent and potentially serious cause of infection after solid organ transplantation. Furthermore, clinical manifestations of respiratory virus infection (RVI) may be more severe and unusual in solid organ transplant recipients (SOTRs) compared with the non-immunocompromised population. Areas covered: This article reviews the non-influenza RVIs that are commonly encountered in SOTRs. Epidemiologic and clinical characteristics are highlighted and available treatment options are discussed. Expert opinion: New diagnostic tools, particularly rapid molecular assays, have expanded the ability to identify specific RVI pathogens in SOTRs. This is not only useful from a treatment standpoint but also to guide infection control practices. More data are need...","Summary Background In December, 2019, a pneumonia associated with the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) emerged in Wuhan, China. We aimed to further clarify the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of 2019-nCoV pneumonia. Methods In this retrospective, single-centre study, we included all confirmed cases of 2019-nCoV in Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital from Jan 1 to Jan 20, 2020. Cases were confirmed by real-time RT-PCR and were analysed for epidemiological, demographic, clinical, and radiological features and laboratory data. Outcomes were followed up until Jan 25, 2020. Findings Of the 99 patients with 2019-nCoV pneumonia, 49 (49%) had a history of exposure to the Huanan seafood market. The average age of the patients was 55\u00b75 years (SD 13\u00b71), including 67 men and 32 women. 2019-nCoV was detected in all patients by real-time RT-PCR. 50 (51%) patients had chronic diseases. Patients had clinical manifestations of fever (82 [83%] patients), cough (81 [82%] patients), shortness of breat...","Abstract In 2009, a novel H1N1 Influenza virus has emerged and on June 11 the World Health Organization declared it as pandemic. It may cause acute respiratory failure ranging from severe Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome to exacerbations of airflow limitation. Non-invasive ventilation is now considered first-line intervention for different causes of acute respiratory failure and may be considered in the context of H1N1 pandemic. Although infection control issues have been arisen, non-invasive ventilation was effective and safe during the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome in Asia. It is reasonable to recommend non-invasive ventilation in H1N1-related exacerbations of chronic respiratory diseases, especially in negative-pressure wards. Treatment of early Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome associated with H1N1 using non-invasive ventilation could be tried rapidly identifying those who fail without delaying endotracheal intubation. Considering the high demand for critical care beds dur...","Abstract In 2009, a novel H1N1 Influenza virus has emerged and on June 11 the World Health Organization declared it as pandemic.

Methods In this single center, observational study, We recruited all Death Cases with COVID-19 from Dec 30, 2019 to Feb 16, 2020 in Intensive care unit of Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital.Demographics, basic diseases, X-ray/CT results, possible therapy strategies and test results when their entrance into admission, ICU and 48 h before death were collected and analyzed. Results This study involved 101 COVID-19 dead cases in Intensive care unit of Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital.47 patients went directly to the ICU because of critical condition, and 54 patients were transferred to ICU with aggravated condition.57 (56.44%) were laboratory confirmed by RT-PCR, and 44 (43.6%) were consistent with clinical diagnostic criteria.The cases included 64 males and 37 females with average age of 65.46 years (SD 9.74). The blood type distributi...","Approximately 20% of patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) develop respiratory failure that requires admission to an intensive care unit (ICU). Old age, comorbidity, and elevated lactate dehydrogenase on hospital admission are associated with increased risk for ICU admission. ICU admission usually is late and occurs 8 to 10 days after symptom onset. Acute respiratory distress syndrome occurs in almost all admitted patients and most require mechanical ventilation. ICU admission is associated with significant morbidity, particularly an apparent increase in the incidence of barotrauma and nosocomial sepsis. Long-term mortality for patients admitted to the ICU ranges from 30% to 50%. Many procedures in ICUs pose a high risk for transmission of SARS coronavirus to health care workers. Contact and airborne infection isolation precautions, in addition to standard precautions, should be applied when caring for patients with SARS. Ensuring staff safety is important to maintain ...","Abstract Background In December 2019, human infection with a novel coronavirus, known as SARS-CoV-2, was identified in Wuhan, China. The mortality of critical illness was high in Wuhan. Information about critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection outside of Wuhan is scarce. We aimed to provide the clinical features, treatment, and prognosis of the critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection in Guangdong Province. Methods In this multi-centered, retrospective, observational study, we enrolled critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia who were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) in Guangdong Province. Demographic data, symptoms, laboratory findings, comorbidities, treatments, and prognosis were collected. Data were compared between patients with and without intubation. Results Forty-five critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia were identified in 7 ICUs in Guangdong Province. The mean age was 56.7 years, and 29 patients (64.4%) were men. The most commo...","The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) plays a key role in maintaining blood pressure homeostasis, as well as fluid and salt balance. Angiotensin II, a key effector peptide of the system, causes vasoconstriction and exerts multiple biological functions. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) plays a central role in generating angiotensin II from angiotensin I, and capillary blood vessels in the lung are one of the major sites of ACE expression and angiotensin II production in the human body. The RAS has been implicated in the pathogenesis of pulmonary hypertension and pulmonary fibrosis, both commonly seen in chronic lung diseases such as chronic obstructive lung disease. Recent studies indicate that the RAS also plays a critical role in acute lung diseases, especially acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). ACE2, a close homologue of ACE, functions as a negative regulator of the angiotensin system and was identified as a key receptor for SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) coronavir...","\u201cWe now have a name for the disease caused by coronavirus and it's COVID-19\u201d, said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Director-General of WHO on Feb 11, 2020.1 WHO recently updated the name novel coronavirus pneumonia, previously named by Chinese scientists,2 to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). More attention should be paid to comorbidities in the treatment of COVID-19. In the literature, COVID-19 is characterised by the symptoms of viral pneumonia such as fever, fatigue, dry cough, and lymphopenia. Many of the older patients who become severely ill have evidence of underlying illness such as cardiovascular disease, liver disease, kidney disease, or malignant tumours.3, 4, 5 These patients often die of their original comorbidities; we therefore need to accurately evaluate all original comorbidities of individuals with COVID-19. In addition to the risk of group transmission of an infectious disease, we should pay full attention to the treatment of the original comorbidities of the indiv...","Summary Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a respiratory tract infection caused by a newly emergent coronavirus, that was first recognized in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. Currently, the World Health Organization (WHO) has defined the infection as a global pandemic and there is a health and social emergency for the management of this new infection. While most people with COVID-19 develop only mild or uncomplicated illness, approximately 14% develop severe disease that requires hospitalization and oxygen support, and 5% require admission to an intensive care unit (1). In severe cases, COVID-19 can be complicated by the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), sepsis and septic shock, and multiorgan failure. This consensus document has been prepared on evidence-informed guidelines developed by a multidisciplinary panel of health care providers from four spanish scientific societies (Spanish Society of Intensive Care Medicine [SEMICYUC], Spanish Society of Pulmonologists [SEPAR],...","Summary Acute respiratory distress syndrome presents as hypoxia and bilateral pulmonary infiltrates on chest imaging in the absence of heart failure sufficient to account for this clinical state. Management is largely supportive, and is focused on protective mechanical ventilation and the avoidance of fluid overload. Patients with severe hypoxaemia can be managed with early short-term use of neuromuscular blockade, prone position ventilation, or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. The use of inhaled nitric oxide is rarely indicated and both \u03b22 agonists and late corticosteroids should be avoided. Mortality remains at approximately 30%.","We report a case of a 45-year-old patient who developed severe acute respiratory distress syndrome accompanied by renal failure. An infection with a novel human coronavirus was confirmed and found to be the reason for rapidly progressive respiratory failure of our patient.","","Summary Background We investigated the temporal progression of the clinical, radiological, and virological changes in a community outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). Methods We followed up 75 patients for 3 weeks managed with a standard treatment protocol of ribavirin and corticosteroids, and assessed the pattern of clinical disease, viral load, risk factors for poor clinical outcome, and the usefulness of virological diagnostic methods. Findings Fever and pneumonia initially improved but 64 (85%) patients developed recurrent fever after a mean of 8.9 (SD 3.1) days, 55 (73%) had watery diarrhoea after 7.5 (2.3) days, 60 (80%) had radiological worsening after 7.4 (2.2) days, and respiratory symptoms worsened in 34 (45%) after 8.6 (3.0) days. In 34 (45%) patients, improvement of initial pulmonary lesions was associated with appearance of new radiological lesions at other sites. Nine (12%) patients developed spontaneous pneumomediastinum and 15 (20%) developed acute resp...","There is a new public health crises threatening the world with the emergence and spread of 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) or the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The virus originated in bats and was transmitted to humans through yet unknown intermediary animals in Wuhan, Hubei province, China in December 2019. There have been around 96,000 reported cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-2019) and 3300 reported deaths to date (05/03/2020). The disease is transmitted by inhalation or contact with infected droplets and the incubation period ranges from 2 to 14 d. The symptoms are usually fever, cough, sore throat, breathlessness, fatigue, malaise among others. The disease is mild in most people; in some (usually the elderly and those with comorbidities), it may progress to pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and multi organ dysfunction. Many people are asymptomatic. The case fatality rate is estimated to range from 2 to 3%. Diagnosis is...","Background: To investigate the prevalence and outcomes of acute gastrointestinal injury (AGI) in critically ill patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Methods: In this clinical retrospective study, demographic data, laboratory parameters, AGI grades, clinical severity and outcomes were collected. The primary endpoints were AGI incidence and 28-day mortality, the secondary endpoints were organ dysfunction and septic shock incidence. Results: From February 10 to March 10 2020, 83 critically ill patients of 1314 patients with COVID-19 were enrolled. Seventy-two (86.7%) patients had AGI during hospital stay, of them, 30 had AGI grade I, 35 had AGI grade II, 5 had AGI grade III, and 2 had AGI grade IV. The incidence of AGI grade II and above was 50.6%. As of March 16, 40 (48.2%) patients died within 28 days of admission, the median hospital stay was 12.0 days, ranging from 3 days to 27 days. Multiple organ dysfunction syndrome developed in 58 (69.9%) patients, septic shock in 16...","Two novel coronaviruses have emerged in humans in the 21(st) century, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome human coronavirus (MERS-CoV), both of which cause acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and have high mortality rates. There are no clinically approved vaccines or antiviral drugs available for either of these infections; thus, a priority in the field is the development of effective therapeutic and preventive strategies that can be readily applied to new emergent strains. This review will: describe the emergence and identification of novel human coronaviruses over the last 10 years; review their key biological features, including tropism and receptor use; and summarize approaches to develop broadly effective vaccines.","Introduction: The highly pathogenic coronaviruses severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) are lethal zoonotic viruses that have emerged into human populations these past 15 years. These coronaviruses are associated with novel respiratory syndromes that spread from person-to-person via close contact, resulting in high morbidity and mortality caused by the progression to Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). Areas covered: The risks of re-emergence of SARS-CoV from bat reservoir hosts, the persistence of MERS-CoV circulation, and the potential for future emergence of novel coronaviruses indicate antiviral drug discovery will require activity against multiple coronaviruses. In this review, approaches that antagonize viral nonstructural proteins, neutralize structural proteins, or modulate essential host elements of viral infection with varying levels of efficacy in models of highly pathogenic coronavirus di...","Summary WHO interim guidelines recommend offering extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) to eligible patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) related to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The number of patients with COVID-19 infection who might develop severe ARDS that is refractory to maximal medical management and require this level of support is currently unknown. Available evidence from similar patient populations suggests that carefully selected patients with severe ARDS who do not benefit from conventional treatment might be successfully supported with venovenous ECMO. The need for ECMO is relatively low and its use is mostly restricted to specialised centres globally. Providing complex therapies such as ECMO during outbreaks of emerging infectious diseases has unique challenges. Careful planning, judicious resource allocation, and training of personnel to provide complex therapeutic interventions while adhering to strict infection control measures are all c...","Abstract A strain of bovine coronavirus (BC) adapted to tissue culture, was inoculated into organ cultures of bovine foetal trachea. Haemagglutinin in the fluid from infected organ cultures reached titres of 32 and characteristic coronavirus particles were observed electron microscopically. BC virus antigen was detected in frozen sections of the organ cultures by staining with fluorescent antibody. These data were evidence that BC virus replicated in organ cultures of respiratory tissue. The use of this technique for primary isolation of bovine coronaviruses from field material is discussed.","","Abstract This article summarizes the likely benefits of melatonin in the attenuation of COVID-19 based on its putative pathogenesis. The recent outbreak of COVID-19 has become a pandemic with tens of thousands of infected patients. Based on clinical features, pathology, the pathogenesis of acute respiratory disorder induced by either highly homogenous coronaviruses or other pathogens, the evidence suggests that excessive inflammation, oxidation, and an exaggerated immune response very likely contribute to COVID-19 pathology. This leads to a cytokine storm and subsequent progression to acute lung injury (ALI)/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and often death. Melatonin, a well-known anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative molecule, is protective against ALI/ARDS caused by viral and other pathogens. Melatonin is effective in critical care patients by reducing vessel permeability, anxiety, sedation use, and improving sleeping quality, which might also be beneficial for better clinic...","BACKGROUND There is little information about the coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) during pregnancy. This study aimed to determine the clinical features and the maternal and neonatal outcomes of pregnant women with Covid-19. METHODS In this retrospective analysis from five hospitals, we included pregnant women with Covid-19 from January 1 to February 20, 2020. The primary composite endpoints were admission to an intensive care unit (ICU), the use of mechanical ventilation, or death. Secondary endpoints included the clinical severity of Covid-19, neonatal mortality, admission to neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), and the incidence of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) of pregnant women and newborns. RESULTS Thirty-three pregnant women with Covid-19 and 28 newborns were identified. One (3%) pregnant woman needed the use of mechanical ventilation. No pregnant women admitted to the ICU. There were no moralities among pregnant women or newborns. The percentages of pregnant women...","Abstract Background Randomized trials have shown that the major antihypertensive drug classes are similarly effective to reduce mortality, but whether these drug class difference exists in clinical practice has been scarcely explored. This study evaluated the association between antihypertensive drug class, all-cause mortality and deaths due to diabetes or renal disease in real-life clinical settings. Methods A clinical database in Hong Kong included all patients who were prescribed their first-ever antihypertensive agents between 2001 and 2005 from the public healthcare sector. All patients were followed up for five years, and grouped according to the initial antihypertensive prescription. The associations between antihypertensive drug class, all-cause mortality or combined diabetes and renal mortality, respectively, were evaluated by Cox proportional hazard models. Results From 218,047 eligible patients, 33,288 (15.3%) died within five years after their first-ever antihypertensive pr...","Effective treatments for Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak are urgently needed. While anti-viral approaches and vaccines are being considered immediate countermeasures are unavailable. The aim of this article is to outline a perspective on the pathophysiology of COVID-19 in the context of the currently available clinical data published in the literature. This article appreciates clinical data published on COVID-19 in the context of another respiratory illness - high altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE). Both conditions have significant similarities that portend pathophysiologic trajectories. Following this potential treatment options emerge. Both COVID-19 and HAPE exhibit a decreased ratio of arterial oxygen partial pressure to fractional inspired oxygen with concomitant hypoxia and tachypnea. There also appears to be a tendency for low carbon dioxide levels in both as well. Radiologic findings of ground glass opacities are present in up to 86% of patients with COVID-19 in additi...","Background. The clinical presentation of 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCov) infected pneumonia (NCIP) resembles that of other etiologies of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). We aimed to identify clinical laboratory features to distinguish NCIP from CAP. Methods. We compared the ability of the hematological and biochemical features of 84 patients with NCIP at hospital admission and 316 patients with CAP. Parameters independently predictive of NCIP were calculated by multivariate logistic regression. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were generated and the area under the ROC curve (AUC) was measured to evaluate the discriminative ability. Results. Most hematological and biochemical indexes of patients with NCIP were significantly different from patients with CAP. Nine laboratory parameters were identified to be highly predictive of a diagnosis of NCIP by multivariate analysis. The AUCs demonstrated good discriminatory ability for red cell distribution width (RDW) with ...","El tratamiento inmunosupresor que recibe el receptor de un trasplante de \u00f3rgano s\u00f3lido dificulta la respuesta defensiva frente a la infecci\u00f3n. La transmisi\u00f3n de la misma desde un donante puede provocar la disfunci\u00f3n o p\u00e9rdida del injerto e, incluso, la muerte del receptor si no se establecen las medidas preventivas oportunas. Este riesgo potencial debe ser evaluado minuciosamente con la intenci\u00f3n de optimizar el uso de \u00f3rganos, especialmente en aquellos casos procedentes de donantes infectados, sin aumentar la disfunci\u00f3n del injerto y la morbimortalidad en el receptor.

The defence response to infectious agents is compromised in solid organ recipients because of their immunosuppressive treatment. Transmission of infection from a donor organ can result in dysfunction or loss of the allogr...","Abstract First reported in September 2012, the Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) has resulted in 206 laboratory-confirmed deaths, with a 42% mortality rate as of 27 March 2014. Closely related coronaviruses have been isolated in bats, but most evidence suggests that humans have become infected directly from camels in a number of separate transmission events, with limited human-to-human transmission reported thus far. The majority of cases originated in the Middle East (predominantly Saudi Arabia), including all the index cases. Clinical manifestations primarily involve fever, chills, and rapidly progressive respiratory failure, often resulting in an acute respiratory distress syndrome, with a minority of patients reporting gastrointestinal symptoms, as well. The majority of critically ill patients are older males with medical co-morbidities, and a large number of minimally symptomatic cases likely go undetected. Unfortunately, attempted therapies have all been ...","Sepsis, acute lung injury, and ARDS contribute substantially to the expanding burden of critical illness within our ICUs. Each of these processes is characterized by a myriad of injurious events, including apoptosis, microvascular dysfunction, abnormal coagulation, and dysregulated host immunity. Only recently have platelets\u2014long considered merely effectors of thrombosis\u2014been implicated in inflammatory conditions and the pathobiology of these disease processes. A growing body of evidence suggests a prominent role for maladaptive platelet activation and aggregation during sepsis and ARDS and has begun to underscore the pluripotential influence of platelets on outcomes in critical illness. Not only do platelets enhance vascular injury through thrombotic mechanisms but also appear to help orchestrate pathologic immune responses and are pivotal players in facilitating leukocyte recruitment to vulnerable tissue. These events contribute to the organ damage and poor patient outcomes that stil...","Abstract In December 2019, an outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) due to the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus began in China and spread rapidly worldwide. It is unknown whether hemodialysis patients represent a distinct group of patients with certain characteristics that may make them susceptible to infection or severe disease. In this Case Report, we describe the clinical and epidemiological features of COVID-19 in 201 maintenance hemodialysis patients in Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan university, including 5 maintenance hemodialysis patients who contracted COVID-19 disease. Of the 5 patients with COVID-19, one had a definite history of contact with an infected person. The age range of the patients was 47\u201367 years. Diarrhea (80%), fever (60%), and fatigue (60%) were the most common symptoms. Lymphopenia occurred in all patients.Chest computerized tomography (CT) scans showed ground glass opacity in the lungs of all patients. Up to February 13, 2020, none of the patients had developed severe ...","Given the rapidly progressing COVID-19 pandemic, this report on a US cohort of 54 COVID-19 patients from Stanford Hospital and data regarding risk factors for severe disease obtained at initial clinical presentation is of high importance and is immediately clinically relevant. We identified low presenting oxygen saturation as predictive of severe disease outcomes, such as diagnosis of pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and admission to the ICU, and also replicated data from China suggesting a link between hypertension and disease severity. Clinicians will benefit by tools to rapidly risk stratify patients at presentation by likelihood of progression to severe disease.","Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and ACE2 are highly homologous metalloproteases that provide essential catalytic functions in the renin-angiotensin system (RAS). Angiotensin II is one key effector peptide of the RAS, inducing vasoconstriction and exerting multiple biological functions. ACE cleaves angiotensin I to generate angiotensin II, whereas ACE2 reduces angiotensin II levels. Accumulating evidence has demonstrated a physiological and pathological role of ACE2 in the cardiovascular systems. Intriguingly, the SARS coronavirus, the cause of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), utilizes ACE2 as an essential receptor for cell fusion and in vivo infections. Moreover, recent studies have demonstrated that ACE2 protects murine lungs from acute lung injury as well as SARS-Spike protein-mediated lung injury, suggesting a dual role of ACE2 in SARS infections and protection from ARDS.","The COVID-19 pandemic is overwhelming healthcare systems worldwide. A significant portion of COVID-19 patients develop pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), necessitating ventilator support. Some health systems do not have the capacity to accommodate this surge in ventilator demand, leading to shortages and inevitable mortality. Some clinicians have, of necessity, jerry-rigged ventilators to support multiple patients, but these devices lack protected air streams or individualized controls for each patient. Moreover, some have not been tested under conditions of ARDS. We have developed the Individualized System for Augmenting Ventilator Efficacy (iSAVE), a rapidly deployable platform to more safely use a single ventilator to simultaneously support multiple critically-ill patients. The iSAVE enables patient-specific volume and pressure control and incorporates safety features to mitigate cross-contamination between patients and flow changes due to patient interdepende...","Objectives: To study the effectiveness of noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) in the treatment of acute respiratory failure (ARF) in severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), and the associated infection risk. Methods: All patients with the diagnosis of probable SARS admitted to a regional hospital in Hong Kong from March 9 to April 28, 2003, and who had SARS-related respiratory distress complications were recruited for NIPPV usage. The health status of all health-care workers working in the NIPPV wards was closely monitored, and consent was obtained to check serum for coronavirus serology. Patient outcomes and the risk of SARS transmission to health-care workers were assessed. Results: NIPPV was applied to 20 patients (11 male patients) with ARF secondary to SARS. Mean age was 51.4 years, and mean acute physiology and chronic health evaluation II score was 5.35. Coronavirus serology was positive in 95% (19 of 20 patients). NIPPV was started 9.6 days (mean) from symptom o...","With the increasing threat of pandemic influenza and catastrophic bioterrorism, it is important for intensive care providers to be prepared to meet the challenge of large-scale airborne epidemics causing mass casualty respiratory failure. The severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak exposed the vulnerability of health care workers and highlighted the importance of establishing stringent infection control and crisis management protocols. Patients who have acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome who require mechanical ventilation should receive a lung protective, low tidal volume strategy. Controversy remains regarding the use of high-frequency oscillatory ventilation and noninvasive positive pressure ventilation. Standard, contact, and airborne precautions should be instituted in intensive care units, with special care taken when aerosol-generating procedures are performed.","Background With the spread of COVID-19 from Wuhan, Hubei Province to other areas of the country, medical staff in Fever Clinics faced the challenge of identifying suspected cases among patients with respiratory infections manifested with fever. We aimed to describe the prevalence and clinical features of COVID-19 as compared to pneumonias of other etiologies in a Fever Clinic in Beijing. Methods In this single-center, retrospective study, 342 cases of pneumonia were diagnosed in Fever Clinic in Peking University Third Hospital between January 21 to February 15, 2020. From these patients, 88 were reviewed by panel discussion as possible or probable cases of COVID-19, and received 2019-nCoV detection by RT-PCR. COVID-19 was confirmed by positive 2019-nCoV in 19 cases, and by epidemiological, clinical and CT features in 2 cases (the COVID-19 Group, n=21), while the remaining 67 cases served as the non-COVID-19 group. Demographic and epidemiological data, symptoms, laboratory and lung CT f...","Summary Background Since December, 2019, Wuhan, China, has experienced an outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Epidemiological and clinical characteristics of patients with COVID-19 have been reported but risk factors for mortality and a detailed clinical course of illness, including viral shedding, have not been well described. Methods In this retrospective, multicentre cohort study, we included all adult inpatients (\u226518 years old) with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 from Jinyintan Hospital and Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital (Wuhan, China) who had been discharged or had died by Jan 31, 2020. Demographic, clinical, treatment, and laboratory data, including serial samples for viral RNA detection, were extracted from electronic medical records and compared between survivors and non-survivors. We used univariable and multivariable logistic regression methods to explore the risk factors associated with in-hosp...","Background: Since mid-December 2019, a cluster of pneumonia-like diseases caused by a novel coronavirus, now designated COVID-19 by the WHO, emerged in Wuhan city and rapidly spread throughout China. Here we identify the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 in a cohort of patients in Shanghai. Methods: Cases were confirmed by real-time RT-PCR and were analysed for demographic, clinical, laboratory and radiological features. Results: Of 198 patients, the median duration from disease onset to hospital admission was 4 days. The mean age of the patients was 50.1 years, and 51.0% patients were male. The most common symptom was fever. Less than half of the patients presented with respiratory systems including cough, sputum production, itchy or sore throat, shortness of breath, and chest congestion. 5.6% patients had diarrhoea. On admission, T lymphocytes were decreased in 45.8% patients. Ground glass opacity was the most common radiological finding on chest computed tomography. 9.6% were adm..."],"title":["Comparison of Hospitalized Patients with Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome

Inhaled NO (iNO) selectively vasodilates the pulmonary vasculature with few systemic effects. Randomized controlled trials comparing iNO treatment with conventional therapy in adult patients with ARDS showed acute improvement in oxygenation and hemodynamics. 131, 132 However, because no reduction in mortality has been demonstrated, iNO has an unproven role in the treatment of patients with ALI/ARDS. OUTCOME Numerous factors influence the risk of death for a patient with established ARDS. Since publication of the 1992 AECC criteria, most clinical series have reported mortality rates for patients with ARDS that range from 25% to 70%. Differences in the application of ALI/ARDS definitions, associated risk factors and comorbidities, and the time period during which mortality is recorded are likely to contribute to this variation. The mortality rate from ARDS appears to have decreased since the mid-to late 1990s. 5,133131,132 136 Although the annual age-adjusted mortality, as observed by Moss and colleagues, may have increased from 1979 (5.0 deaths per 100,000 individuals) to 1993 (8.1 deaths per 100,000 individuals), a decrease in mortality was observed from 1993 to 1996 (7.4 deaths per 100,000 individuals). Reasons for the decline in ARDS-associated mortality are varied. In a 9-year retrospective review of surgical and trauma patients, Rocco and colleagues found, predominantly in trauma patients, a declining death rate from ARDS largely resulting from the use of lung protective ventilation strategies. 137 The predictors of death in this study at the onset of ARDS were advanced age, a Multiple Organ Dysfunction Score of 8 or more, and a Lung Injury Score of 2.76 or more. In a similar study, the decrease in mortality of patients with ARDS was attributed mostly to a decreased incidence of nonpulmonary organ failure. 138 Consistent with this view, Page and associates found that, for patients with ARDS who were managed with a lung protective ventilation strategy, the strongest predictor of death was not the degree of pulmonary failure, but rather the presence and severity of circulatory failure. 139 The dominant influence on mortality of comorbidities was noted by Estenssoro and associates, who prospectively studied all patients who developed ARDS in four ICUs for 1 year. 140 Hospital mortality was reported to be 58%, and the main causes of mortality were multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, sepsis, and septic shock. In this study, independent predictors of death included organ dysfunction and PaO 2 /FiO 2 . A decrease in pulmonary dead space fraction has also been identified as a separate risk factor. 141 The influence of comorbidities was also observed by Davidson and colleagues, who, in a prospective cohort study of 127 patients with ARDS associated with trauma or sepsis, found no difference in the long-term mortality rate for the patients with ARDS compared with 127 control subjects matched for age, risk factors for ARDS, comorbidity, and severity of illness. 142 It is unclear whether patients with mild ALI (those with PaO 2 between 200 and 300 mm Hg) have a mortality that differs from that of patients with ARDS. In a study of patients in Scandinavian ICUs, Luhr and associates found a similar mortality of approximately 40% in both groups. 5 However, in a study of patients in 78 ICUs in Europe, Brun-Buisson and colleagues found ICU and hospital mortality to be 49.4% and 57.9%, respectively, for patients who developed ARDS and 22.6% and 32.7%, respectively, for patients with ALI. 143 Mortality was associated with age, immunocompetence, physiologic measures of injury, organ dysfunction, and early air leak.","In 1967, Ashbaugh and colleagues 1 first described a syndrome of acute respiratory distress in adults that closely resembled respiratory distress in infants. These authors detailed the clinical course of 12 patients treated in Denver for respiratory failure who did not respond to usual therapeutic modalities of respiratory support. The patients had an acute onset of tachypnea, hypoxemia, panlobular infiltration on chest X-ray, and loss of lung compliance. The investigators thought the syndrome resulted from surfactant deficiency, and found positive end-expiratory pressure helpful in treating the atelectasis and hypoxemia. They also thought that corticosteroids were helpful for patients in whom the syndrome resulted from fat embolism. In 1971, the same investigators coined the name adult respiratory distress syndrome. 2 Since its initial description in 1967, ARDS has been the focus of intense scrutiny and attempts to improve outcomes. The European-American Consensus Conference on ARDS developed a uniform definition for ARDS to aid clinical trial design. 3 The conference attendees agreed that ARDS was a severe form of ALI, and recommended that the syndrome be called \"acute\", rather than \"adult\", respiratory distress syndrome. They defined ALI and ARDS as being characterized by an acute onset, bilateral infiltration on chest X-ray, hypoxemia, and no evidence of left atrial hypertension (pulmonary artery occlusion pressure 18 mmHg). The degree of hypoxemia is more severe in ARDS (partial arterial oxygen pressure [PaO 2 ]:fractional inspired oxygen [FIO 2 ] ratio 200 mmHg) than ALI (PaO 2 / FIO 2 300 mmHg). The severity of ARDS can be scored (Murray lung injury score) using several easily measured clinical variables. 4 ARDS occurs in various clinical settings with direct or indirect respiratory insults (e.g. acute pneumonia or pneumonitis, aspiration of gastric content, near-drowning, acute pancreatitis, sepsis syndrome, massive emergency transfusions, environmental toxin exposure), severe multiple trauma (e.g. pulmonary contusion, multiple long bone fracture with fat embolism syndrome), or extensive tissue injury or destruction during major surgical interventions (e.g. cardiac surgery with prolonged extracorporeal bypass). The mortality rate from ARDS remains high (45-92%), but outcomes have improved over the last decade. [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] How did the term SARS originate? Before the mid-1990s, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and public authorities stipulated that sentinel hospitals or clinicians should report suspected or definitively diagnosed cases of respiratory illness in which there were associated public health concerns. However, public authorities derived important information from a rodent-borne hantavirus infection in 1993: an outbreak of an unexplained respiratory illness with high mortality occurred in the US southwest, and the cause was unexpectedly proved to be hantavirus. This contradicted the previous belief that human hantavirus infection only caused the hemorrhagic-fever renal syndrome described in Asia and Europe. Hence, the US outbreak led to the first description of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS), identified as a seemingly new human infectious disease caused by hantavirus variants including Sin Nombre and Black Creek Canal viruses; HPS has an influenzalike prodromal stage, but can progress to catastrophic hemodynamic failure and pulmonary edema. [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] Thus, public health authorities understood that the casereporting system was inadequate in this setting. In May 1995, the World Health Assembly amended international infectious disease regulations, and in 1998, the World Health Organization (WHO) arranged for 21 countries to conduct a clinical trial of a new case-reporting system for acute hemorrhagic fever syndrome, acute diarrhea syndrome, acute neurologic syndrome, acute respiratory syndrome, acute jaundice syndrome, and other notifiable syndromes.","Treatment principle: treat the patients to improve the symptoms and underlying diseases, actively prevent potential complications and secondary infection; provide timely measures to support organ function. Hypoxic respiratory failure and severe ARDS. Give oxygen therapy immediately to patients with ARDS, and closely monitor them for signs of clinical deterioration, such as rapidly progressive respiratory failure. Consider severe hypoxemic respiratory failure when standard oxygen therapy fails. When patients have increased frequency of breathing (&gt; 30 times/min) and hypoxemia (SpO2 &lt; 90% or PaO2 &lt; 60 mmHg) even with oxygen delivered via a face mask and reservoir bag (gas flow of 10~15 L/min, FiO2 0.60\u20130.95), it may be considered as hypoxic respiratory failure.ARDS is a status of severe acute hypoxic respiratory failure caused by increased pulmonary capillary permeability and alveolar epithelial cell damage. It can be divided into mild, moderate and severe conditions according to the Berlin definition [38] (Table 6). HFNO. Under the support of standard oxygen therapy, to maintain SpO2 above 93% stills hard, and the breathing rate increases rapidly, then HFNO should be considered. HFNO can deliver 60 L/min of gas flow and FiO2 up to 1.0. Generally, gas flow is initially set as 30\u201340 L/min and oxygen concentration 50%\u201360%, which is well tolerated and coordinated. Then settings can be adjusted according to the oxygenation status of patients. Compared with standard oxygen therapy, HFNO is able to reduce the chance of tracheal intubation. Patients with hypercapnia (like exacerbation of obstructive lung disease, cardiogenic pulmonary edema), hemodynamic instability, multi-organ failure, or abnormal mental status should not be given HFNO. HFNO may be safe in patients with mild-moderate and non-worsening hypercapnia. However, if the respiratory distress still exists or even worsens dramatically under HFNO (FiO2 &gt; 70%, gas flow &gt; 50 L/min for 1 hour), the respiratory supporting strategy should be changed.NIV. NIV provides a certain positive pressure ventilation effect through the positive pressure formed by the closed mask. HFNO combined with intermittent short-term NIV (1\u20132 h) support may be useful to reduce respiratory power consumption and improve oxygenation. But NIV guidelines recommend the use of respiratory support therapy in hypoxemic respiratory failure or pandemic viral illness. Limited data showed a high failure rate of NIV in MERS patients. Invasive mechanical ventilation should be considered in case the ARDS still exists and even acutely deteriorates in NIV process (about 1 h). Patients with hemodynamic instability, multiple organ failure, or abnormal mental status should not receive NIV.Invasive mechanical ventilation. Under the support of HFNO (the demand for FiO2 &gt; 70% and gas flow &gt; 50 L/min) or NIV, ARDS still exists and even acutely deteriorates, invasive mechanical ventilation should be implemented as soon as possible.Endotracheal intubation should be carried out by trained and experienced provider using airborne precautions, since endotracheal intubation is an operation that may produce a large number of contagious aerosols.The strategy of protective lung ventilation should be implemented in invasive mechanical ventilation: lower tidal volume (4\u20136 ml/kg), lower plateau pressure (&lt; 30 cmH2O), and appropriate PEEP. For patients with moderate-severe ARDS (PaO2/FiO2 &lt; 150), it is recommended to use higher PEEP, apply prone ventilation for more than 12 h per day and adopt deep sedation and analgesia muscle relaxation strategy within the first 48 h of mechanical ventilation. For patients with severe acute hypoxic respiratory failure, we should pay attention to and prevent ventilator-associated lung injury after mechanical ventilation.Extracorporeal Life Support (ECLS). In the process of invasive mechanical ventilation when the patient is still in the state of hypoxia, combined with increased partial pressure of carbon dioxide (excluding ventilation dysfunction, PaCO2 &gt; 60 mmHg), especially after muscle relaxation and prone ventilation, it is necessary to consider to implement ECLS. However, it is suggested that ECLS treatment should only be carried out under the condition that the professional center is with access to expertise. Currently the ECLS in ICU includes VV-ECMO (blood is pumped from femoral vein, and returns to right atrium through internal jugular vein after oxygenation through membrane oxygenator) and VA-ECMO (blood is pumped from femoral vein and directly enters aortic system through femoral artery after oxygenation through membrane oxygenator). For patients with severe refractory hypoxemia, neuromuscular blockade can improve oxygen supply, especially if there is still evidence of ventilator-patient dyssynchrony after the use of sedatives. However, neuromuscular blockade through continuous infusion should not be routinely used in patients with moderate-severe ARDS; Where available, ECMO in conjunction with low tidal-volume mechanical ventilation can be considered in the treatment of patients with severe refractory hypoxemia in whom standard therapy are failing; Routine use of high-frequency oscillatory ventilation (HFOV) in patients with moderate-severe ARDS is not beneficial, but may be harmful. However, HFOV may still be regarded as a rescue therapy for patients with severe ARDS and refractory hypoxemia. ECMO can be used in some severe ARDS patients (lung injury score &gt; 3 or pH &lt; 7.2 due to uncompensated hypercapnia), but it is not recommended for all ARDS patients. It can be considered to use extracorporeal carbon dioxide removal for ARDS patients, if there is more supportive research evidence in the future.","SARS disease in patients with poor outcome was marked by the progression to Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): approximately 25% of SARS cases were diagnosed with ARDS and the ARDS-associated mortality rate exceeded 50% [8] . Elderly SARS patients had a poor prognosis with mortality rates of 50% in patients over 65 year of age [9] . In SARS patients with ARDS, the acute phase characterized by pulmonary edema, severe hypoxia, and the accumulation of inflammatory cells in the lungs could progress to ARDS late phase fibrosis, organizing pneumonia, systemic inflammation responses, and multiple organ failure [10, 11] . Consistent with ARDS progression, the primary targets of SARS-CoV infection are ciliated cells of the airway epithelium and alveolar Type II pneumocytes [12, 13] . ARDS is also associated with the induction of inflammatory cytokines including IL-1, IL-6, IL-8, CXCL-10, and TNFa, many of which were highly expressed in the lungs of SARS patients [14, 15] . In many viral infections the antiviral cytokine Interferon (IFN) acts not only to control viral infections, but also to program the adaptive immune response to promote viral clearance [16] . However, in patients with severe SARS disease, aberrant IFN, Interferon Stimulated Genes (ISGs), and cytokine responses were observed compared to healthy individuals providing evidence that SARS is an innate immune regulated disease [17, 18] .","Two other pharmacotherapies deserve mentioncorticosteroids and nitric oxide. Acute respiratory distress syndrome is an infl ammatory lung injury, and the use of corticosteroids would thus appear ideally suited to it, with their ability to dampen both infl ammation and fi brosis. Unfortunately, despite a plethora of trials, there is inadequate evidence to make a defi nitive recom mendation in favour of or against the use of corticosteroids, 122, 123 although the US ARDSnet steroid study suggested harm if corticosteroid therapy was started more than 14 days after the onset of the syndrome. 124 Nitric oxide is an inhaled pulmonary vaso dilator that improves ventilationperfusion matching, resulting in increased oxygenation. However, this increase in oxygenation does not translate into improved patient-centred outcomes. 125 Nitric oxide is associated with numerous complications, including renal failure and rebound pulmonary hypertension. 125 Various other anti-infl ammatory and pathophysiologically (fi gure 5) targeted drugs have been investigated, but have not demonstrated robust eff ectiveness. 126, 127 Fluid management Acute respiratory distress syndrome is a form of pulmonary oedema, and thus fl uid therapy is an essential aspect of management. Fluid excess is increasingly linked to detrimental outcomes across the spectrum of critical illnesses. 128 A general paradigm exists of early fl uid loading for resuscitation and organ rescue during Thrombosis Key the presentation stage of the illness, followed by fl uid unloading (deresuscitation)-either spontaneous or induced-after haemodynamic stability has been achieved. 129 Fluid-induced lung injury describes the development of lung injury after intravenous fl uid administration. The rapid administration of saline in healthy volunteers can cause pulmonary interstitial oedema; 130 patients with sepsis can experience decreased oxygenation and worsening lung injury scores as a result of fl uid bolus administration after initial resuscitation. 131 In a randomised controlled trial 132 in 1001 patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome managed with lungprotective ventilation (FACTT), a detailed algorithm targeting cardiac fi lling pressures in the setting of haemodynamic stability was used for a comparison of liberal and conservative fl uid strategies. At 1 week, a conservative strategy was associated with a net neutral fl uid balance compared with a 7 L positive balance in the control arm, resulting in signifi cantly increased oxygenation, a better lung injury score, more ventilatorfree and ICU-free days, and fewer blood transfusions in the conservatively managed group. There was no diff erence between the conservative and liberal strategies in the primary outcome of death at 60 days (25\u00b75% [SD 1\u00b79] vs 28\u00b74% [2\u00b70]; 95% CI for diff erence -2\u00b76 to 8\u00b74, p=0\u00b730) or incidence of organ failures. A follow-up study at 2 years, however, showed an increased incidence of cognitive impairment in the deresuscitated group (adjusted odds ratio 3\u00b735 [95% CI 1\u00b716-9\u00b770] to 5\u00b746 [1\u00b792-15\u00b753]). 133 A small randomised controlled trial 134 of combined therapy with albumin and furosemide administration in 37 hypoproteinaemic patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome demonstrated improvements in oxygenation, fl uid balance, and haemodynamics. A further small follow-up study by the same group, in which furosemide administration with or without albumin supplementation was compared, suggested that the combination was superior to furosemide administration alone. However, in the large randomised controlled ALBIOS trial, 135 in which investigators examined a strategy of albumin administration to maintain plasma albumin concentrations higher than 30 g/L in patients with sepsis and septic shock, benefi cial eff ects on respiratory sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score were not associated with higher plasma albumin concentrations, although a specifi ed subgroup analysis was not done for this outcome. Therefore whether albumin has a place in the management of acute respiratory distress syndrome remains unclear. On the basis of available evidence, synthetic colloids do not have any role in the management of the critically ill. 136 ","acute respiratory distress syndrome ARDS A severe inflammatory reaction in the lung that can lead to fluid accumulation and effectively drowning. There may also be multiple organ failure. ARDS was formerly known as adult respiratory distress syndrome to differentiate it from infant respiratory distress syndrome which is caused by a deficiency of lung surfactant. See septic shock.","Avian influenza A virus H5N1, which was first described in 1998 [18] , causes severe pneumonia that often progresses rapidly to ARDS [19, 20] . This virus continues to provoke human disease, with 500 cumulative cases reported to the World Health Organization since 2003, and a case-fatality rate of nearly 60%. 1 Symptoms of H5N1 infection in humans are common and nonspecific, including fever, dyspnea, cough, vomiting, diarrhea, headache, etc. [20] . However, in most cases, pneumonia progresses rapidly to acute respiratory failure and ARDS [20] . Clinical factors that might be associated with severity include older age (&gt; 65 years), late consultation, lower respiratory tract lesions and/or leukopenia, but most H5N1-infected patients were previously healthy [19, 20] . Direct avian-to-human H5N1-virus transmission is the predominant means of human infection, and human-to-human transmission is probably limited [19, 20] . Autopsies of patients who succumbed to H5N1 infection found diffuse alveolar damage with hyaline membrane formation, patchy interstitial lymphoplasmacytic infiltrates, bronchiolitis with squamous metaplasia and/or pulmonary congestion with various degrees of hemorrhage [19, 20] . The nonspecific clinical and radiological characteristics of H5N1-induced disease often result in the misdiagnosis of subsequently confirmed cases. Conventional or real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) detection of viral RNA is the best diagnostic method. Because the disease is still endemic in poultry in parts of Asia, Africa and the Middle East, clinicians must be aware of this rare but fulminant ARDS etiology, particularly in travellers with pulmonary symptoms of unknown origin [19, 20] . Management of patients with H5N1-induced ARDS remains nonspecific. Although human-to-human transmission is not frequent, isolation is recommended [20] . Treatment with high-dose oseltamivir (e.g., 150 mg twice daily) for 10 days is recommended [20] . For oseltamivir-resistant H5N1 variants, compassionate use of intravenous zanamivir to treat seriously ill patients showed promising results [21] . Although the new, intravenously administered, neuraminidase-inhibitor peramivir has demonstrated antiviral activity against H5N1 and yielded encouraging results in lethally infected mice, data are lacking in humans [22] . Corticosteroids should not be used routinely, not only because their efficacy has not been demonstrated, but also because their use might increase the infectious complication rate. Other therapeutic modalities are nonspecific and include MV, rescue strategies for severe ARDS (nitric oxide, recruitment manoeuvres, high-frequency oscillation and/or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation [ECMO]) and organ support. In 2009, a new influenza A H1N1 virus was detected in California. After initially spreading among individuals in Mexico, the United States, and Canada [23] [24] [25] , the virus spread globally, causing the first influenza pandemic since 1968, with circulation outside the usual influenza season in the Northern Hemisphere [26] . H1N1-2009 infection triggers a broad spectrum of clinical syndromes, ranging from afebrile upper respiratory illness to fulminant viral pneumonia [26] . Most illnesses caused by this virus have been acute and self-limited, with children and young adults being the most susceptible, while sparing adults over 60 years old [26] . However, severe cases with ARDS have been described (figure 1) [23, 24, 27, 28] . During the 2009 pandemic, risk factors for severe H1N1 disease or its complications were pregnancy [29, 30] , chronic cardiovascular condition (congestive heart failure, atherosclerotic disease), chronic lung disorder (e.g., asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cystic fibrosis), morbid obesity, hemoglobinopathy, chronic renal disease, cirrhosis, and age &lt; 1 year [26] . However, approximately onequarter to one-half of the H1N1-2009-infected patients who were hospitalized or died had no known coexisting medical conditions [24, 26, 28] . The main syndrome leading to ICU hospitalization consisted of diffuse viral pneumonitis associated with severe hypoxemia, ARDS and, sometimes, shock and renal failure [24, 26, 28] , and accounted for approximately 49-72% of ICU admissions for H1N1-2009 infections [24, 26, 28, 31] . Rapid progression was common, typically starting on day 4-5 after influenza onset, and intubation was often required within 24 hours after admission [26, 28, 30] . During autopsy of patients who died of H1N1-2009 infections, the virus was localized all along the respiratory tract, from the upper respiratory tract to the alveoli [32, 33] . The most prominent histopathological feature was diffuse alveolar damage in the lungs of all patients examined, but alveolar hemorrhage, intraalveolar edema, perivasculitis, microthrombi and/or pulmonary embolism were also observed [32, 33] . Alveolar lining cells, including type I and type II pneumocytes, were the primary cells infected. Notably, bacterial co-infections were identified in &gt; 25% of those patients [32, 33] . As for H5N1, management of patients with ARDS due to H1N1-2009-virus infection included early administration of high-dose oseltamivir for 10 days [26] . Bioavailability in critically ill e563 [ ( F i g u r e _ 1 ) T D $ F I G ] Virus-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome: Epidemiology, management and outcome patients receiving oseltamivir by nasogastric tube appears to be similar to that in patients with uncomplicated H1N1 flu [26] . For patients with oseltamivir-resistant H1N1 variants, successful compassionate use of intravenous zanamivir has been reported [34] . Peramivir was recently authorized for emergency use in the United States [26] . Again, as for H5N1, corticosteroids are not recommended. Although roughly half of the patients received corticosteroids in most published series, their use was associated with a higher rate of nosocomial infection [35] or mortality [36] [37] [38] .","Four randomised controlled trials [75] [76] [77] [78] published between 1998 and 1999 provided mixed results for the optimal tidal volume in acute respiratory distress syndrome. In the landmark ARMA study, 28 which was published in 2000 by the ARDSnet group, a traditional ventilatory strategy of 12 mL per kg of predicted bodyweight tidal volume in com bination with a plateau airway pressure \u2264 50 cm H 2 O was compared with a lower tidal volume of 6 mL per kg of predicted bodyweight in com bination with a plateau airway pressure of 30 cm H 2 O or less in 861 mechanically ventilated patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome. The study was stopped early, because, despite initially worse oxygenation, low-tidal-volume ventilation was associated with an 8\u00b78% (95% CI 2\u00b74-15\u00b73) absolute reduction in mortality (39\u00b78% vs 31\u00b70%; p=0\u00b7007), and signifi cantly more ventilator-free days (10 [SD 11] vs 12 [11]; p=0\u00b7007). Importantly, less injurious ventilation was associated with more days free of non-pulmonary organ failure (12 [11] vs 15 [11]; p=0\u00b7006). Tidal volume was estimated from predicted bodyweight, which is dependent on height and sex, and calculated as 50 + 0\u00b791 \u00d7 (height in cm -152\u00b74) for men and 45\u00b75 + 0\u00b791 \u00d7 (height in cm -152\u00b74) for women. Lung-protective ventilation is associated with improved outcomes if used early in the course of acute respiratory distress syndrome, 79 and reduced mortality at 2 years. 80 Despite the adoption of a volume-limited and pressurelimited protective ventilatory strategy, critically ill mechanically ventilated patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome receiving a tidal volume of 6 mL/kg and a plateau pressure of 30 cm H 2 O or less can still be exposed to tidal hyperinfl ation, whereby the smaller-than-usual aerated section of the lung (so-called baby lung) 81 receives a larger-than-usual volume of gas, resulting in greater biotrauma and fewer ventilator-free days than those in patients without tidal hyperinfl ation. 82 Similarly, a post-hoc review 83 of the ARDSnet database did not demonstrate a safe upper limit for plateau pressures in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome. Volume-limited and pressure-limited ventilation can cause hypercapnic acidosis, and the overall clinical eff ect of protective ventilation and hypercapnia is uncertain. 84 Hypercapnic acidosis could provide protective eff ects in the setting of high-tidal-volume ventilation, but a benefi cial eff ect is not noted in patients receiving lung-protective ventilation. 85 PEEP prevents lung unit collapse at the end of the respiratory cycle. Benefi cial eff ects include the maintenance of functional residual capacity, improved compliance, and higher mean airway pressure, which result in decreased shunt with enhanced oxygenation, and reduced atelectasis and biotrauma. These advantages should be weighed against the eff ects of raised intrathoracic pressure-namely, decreased venous return and increased right ventricular afterload. 86 Numerous methods of setting the PEEP level have been described, including most recently oesophageal balloon manometry. 87 In the lung-protective era, four randomised controlled trials [87] [88] [89] [90] have been done to answer the question of whether higher or lower pressure is superior, with a suggestion that higher PEEP could be benefi cial. A metaanalysis 91 of three of these trials also showed a possible benefi t for a high PEEP setting in acute respiratory distress syndrome, which was associated with both lower in-hospital mortality (34\u00b71% vs 39\u00b71%; RR 0\u00b790, 95% CI 0\u00b781-1\u00b700; p=0\u00b7049) and less require ment for mechanical ventilation by day 28 (hazard ratio [HR] 1\u00b716, 95% CI 1\u00b703-1\u00b730; p=0\u00b701). 91 The EPVent randomised controlled trial, 87 in which oesophageal-balloon manometry-guided PEEP was compared with use of the ARDSnet PEEP-FiO 2 table, showed that oesophageal-guided PEEP provided increased oxy genation and compliance, which translated into higher PEEP (18 cm vs 12 cm H 2 O on day one) and associated improved adjusted 28 day mortality (RR 0\u00b746, 95% CI 0\u00b719-1\u00b70; p=0\u00b7049). 87 A further meta-analysis that included this additional study showed non-signifi cant improvements in 28 day mortality with higher PEEP (pooled RR 0\u00b790, 95% CI 0\u00b779-1\u00b702), without a signifi cantly higher risk of barotrauma (1\u00b717, 0\u00b790-1\u00b752). 92 The driving pressure, which is defi ned as the diff erence between plateau and end-expiratory pressures, has been suggested as the mediator for the benefi cial eff ects of the three main components of lung-protective ventilationnamely, low tidal volume, low plateau pressure, and high PEEP. 93 On the basis of derivation and validation cohorts from 3562 patients recruited into nine randomised controlled trials, Amato and colleagues 93 reported that an increase in driving pressure of 7 cm H 2 O was associated with increased 60 day mortality (RR 1\u00b741, 95% CI 1\u00b731-1\u00b751; p&lt;0\u00b7001). According to the statistical method of multilevel mediation analysis, none of the three main components of lung-protective ventilation was individually associated with reduced mortality, but they acted via a reduced driving pressure to exert their benefi cial eff ects.","Since Dec 8, 2019, several cases of pneumonia of unknown aetiology have been reported in Wuhan, Hubei province, China. [1] [2] [3] Most patients worked at or lived around the local Huanan seafood wholesale market, where live animals were also on sale. In the early stages of this pneumonia, severe acute respiratory infection symptoms occurred, with some patients rapidly dev eloping acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), acute respiratory failure, and other serious complications. On Jan 7, a novel coronavirus was identified by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) from the throat swab sample of a patient, and was subsequently named 2019nCoV by WHO. 4 Coronaviruses can cause multiple system infections in various animals and mainly respiratory tract infections in humans, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). [5] [6] [7] Most patients have mild symptoms and good prognosis. So far, a few patients with 2019nCoV have developed severe pneumonia, pulmonary oedema, ARDS, or mul tiple organ failure and have died. All costs of 2019nCoV treatment are covered by medical insurance in China.","On the other hand, respiratory viruses are an emerging threat to global health security and have led to worldwide epidemics with substantial morbidity and mortality [31]. Coronaviruses (CoVs) cause respiratory and enteric diseases in human and other animals that induce fatal respiratory, gastrointestinal and neurological disease. Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is an epidemic human disease, is caused by a coronavirus (CoV), called SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) [32]. SARS patients may present with a spectrum of disease severity ranging from flu-like symptoms and viral pneumonia to acute respiratory distress syndrome and death [33]. Most of the deaths were attributed to complications related to sepsis, ARDS and multiorgan failure, which occurred commonly in the elderly for comorbidities [34]. Age and comorbidity (e.g. diabetes mellitus, heart disease) were consistently found to be significant independent predictors of various adverse outcomes in SARS [35]. Children with SARS have better prognosis than adults [34]. Advanced age and comorbidities were significantly associated with increased risk of SARS-CoV related death, due to acute respiratory distress syndrome [35]. Mild degree of anaemia is common in the SARS infected patients and patients who have recovered from SARS show symptoms of psychological trauma [34]. Another novel coronavirus MERS-CoV, which is a new threat for public health, has similar clinical characteristics to SARS-CoV, but the comorbidity is the key aspect to underline their different impacts [36, 37]. MERS-CoV causes respiratory infections of varying severity and sometimes fatal infections in humans including kidney failure and severe acute pneumonia [38]. Despite sharing some clinical similarities with SARS (eg, fever, cough, incubation period), there are also some important differences such as the rapid progression to respiratory failure, which we have studied on comorbidities point of view.","Second, respiratory support should be given to patients with hypoxic respiratory failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome. HFNO or NIV can be selected when nasal cannula or mask oxygen therapy was ineffective or the patient had hypoxic respiratory failure. However, when patients had hypercapnia (acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cardiogenic pulmonary edema), hemodynamic instability, multiple organ failure, and abnormal mental status HFNO oxygen is not the routinely adopted measure. If respiratory failure cannot be improved or worsens continuously within a short time (1 h) after using HFNO or NIV, intubation should be performed immediately. Low tidal volume (4-8 ml/kg) and low suction pressure (platform pressure &lt; 30cmH2O) are used for invasive mechanical ventilation. It is suggested that positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) with high positive end-expiratory pressure should be used in patients with moderate or severe acute respiratory distress syndrome, and PEEP should be titrated according to FiO2 to maintain SpO2, in order to improve alveolar atelectasis and reduce alveolar hyper-expansion and pulmonary vascular resistance at the end of inspiration. For severe patients with ARDS, it is recommended to ventilate in prone position for more than 12 h/d. (4)Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO) should be considered for the patients with refractory hypoxemia that is difficult to be corrected by protective lung ventilation. (Strong recommendation).","On February 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) officially named this novel coronavirus pneumonia as Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID- 19) , whereas the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses has named it as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Huang and colleagues reported that the first 41 patients of COVID-19 exhibited fever, cough, myalgia, and/or fatigue as common symptoms, 29% of whom had acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and six of whom died (15%) 2 . The typical findings from chest computed tomographies (CTs) were bilateral ground-glass opacity and subsegmental areas of consolidation 2 . At earlier times during the COVID-19 outbreak, patients with COVID-19 were more likely to report exposure to food from the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market. With the epidemic gradually growing, it is now clear that human-to-human transmission has been prevalent 3 Importantly, when assessing COVID-19, it is noteworthy that influenza viruses share common etiologies and occur in the same season. Recently, global influenza associated with respiratory mortality is occurring at a higher frequency than what has been previously reported 5 . From September 2019 through the present day, there have been more than 170,000 patients with influenza in the United States, more than half of whom have been infected with the influenza A (H1N1) virus. The percentage of deaths attributed to pneumonia induced by influenza is 6.8% 6 . During the H1N1 global epidemic in 2009, Jain et al. found that 5% of patients with H1N1 influenza were admitted to intensive care units (ICUs) and 7% died 7 .","Human H5N1 infection is characterized by a severe influenza syndrome, including fever, cough, shortness of breath, and radiological evidence of pneumonia [5,6]. Almost all patients have clinically apparent pneumonia, and death ensues within 9 or 10 days on average after the onset of illness. Most patients die of progressive respiratory failure that is believed to be associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) [1,7]. ARDS is a common, devastating clinical syndrome of acute lung injury with high mortality ranging from 40% to 60% [8,9]. Pathological findings show that 64% of ARDS patients may have pulmonary fibrosis (PF) during convalescence [10]. Owing to the damage of architecture and loss of functional capillary units of the lung, Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) in human can lead to respiratory failure within a few years following diagnostic confirmation, and may correlate with an increased risk of death [11]. PF results as a consequence of many types of severe lung injury and is almost always associated with an inflammatory reaction [12,13]. Some virus infections, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) caused by a novel coronavirus, can induce the typical ARDS and PF, and most patients eventually die [14,15]. Also, it is possible that patients infected with H5N1 viruses may suffer from PF as a result of ARDS.","The clinical features of COVID-19 are varied, ranging from asymptomatic state to acute respiratory distress syndrome and multi organ dysfunction. The common clinical features include fever (not in all), cough, sore throat, headache, fatigue, headache, myalgia and breathlessness. Conjunctivitis has also been described. Thus, they are indistinguishable from other respiratory infections. In a subset of patients, by the end of the first week the disease can progress to pneumonia, respiratory failure and death. This progression is associated with extreme rise in inflammatory cytokines including IL2, IL7, IL10, GCSF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNF\u03b1 [15]. The median time from onset of symptoms to dyspnea was 5 d, hospitalization 7 d and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) 8 d. The need for intensive care admission was in 25\u201330% of affected patients in published series. Complications witnessed included acute lung injury, ARDS, shock and acute kidney injury. Recovery started in the 2nd or 3rd wk. The median duration of hospital stay in those who recovered was 10 d. Adverse outcomes and death are more common in the elderly and those with underlying co-morbidities (50\u201375% of fatal cases). Fatality rate in hospitalized adult patients ranged from 4 to 11%. The overall case fatality rate is estimated to range between 2 and 3% [2].","The overall case-fatality rate was 9.6% and the terminal events were severe respiratory failure associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and multiple organ failure. Age, presence of co-morbidities, and viral load in the nasopharynx and serum during the first 5 days of illness correlated with an adverse prognosis.","Investigators in the EDEN study explored the eff ect of low-volume trophic feeding for up to 6 days in 1000 non-malnourished patients with early acute respiratory distress syndrome. 137 Despite separation of calorifi c delivery between groups (roughly 400 kcal per day vs full feeding of 1300 kcal per day), neither the primary outcome of ventilator-free days (14\u00b79 vs 15\u00b70; diff erence \u22120\u00b71, 95% CI \u22121\u00b74 to 1\u00b72; p=0\u00b789) nor the seco ndary outcomes of 60 day mortality (23\u00b72% vs 22\u00b72%; 1\u00b70, \u22124\u00b71 to 6\u00b73; p=0\u00b777) or infectious complications diff ered between groups. The full feed group, however, received more prokinetic agents, and spent more days with increased gastric residual volume, vomiting, and constipation. Additionally, there was no diff erence in physical or cognitive function in survivors at 1 year. 138 The ability to modulate the infl ammatory response via immunonutrition-ie, the delivery of immune-enhancing dietary agents such as fi sh oils, glutamine, selenium, vitamins, and other antioxidants-has long been a potential target. Early studies were suggestive of benefi t, especially when used in acute respiratory distress syndrome. 139 But randomised controlled trials have not shown effi cacy for a range of additives in either patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome 140 or those needing general critical care. [141] [142] [143] In the OMEGA study, 144 the twice daily use of the n-3 fatty acids docosahexaenoic acid and eicosapentaenoic acid, \u03b3-linolenic acid, and a mixture of antioxidants, was compared with use of an isocaloric control in 272 patients with early acute respiratory distress syndrome who were also receiving enteral nutrition. Despite an eight-times increase in plasma n-3 fatty acid concentrations in the intervention group, there were clear signals of harm necessitating the termination of the study, including decreased ventilatorfree, non-pulmonary-organ-failure-free, and ICU-free days, and a non-signifi cant increase in mortality. A subsequent small phase 2 study of fi sh oils in 90 patients again failed to demonstrate benefi t in this population. 140 A meta-analysis 145 supported a lack of effi cacy associated with fi sh oil supplementation in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome, and a consensus paper summarising current nutritional evidence did not support the administration of pharma conutrients. 146","Auxiliary consultation to improve successful rescue rate SARI is reported to have a high incidence with a staggering number of deaths. Causes of death are related to sepsis, hypoxic respiratory failure, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), multiple organ failure, and complications and pregnancy. If these complications can be addressed in a timely manner, early support for treatment and monitoring, and immediate oxygenation therapy for patients with respiratory distress, hypoxemia, or shock can undoubtedly reduce mortality. However, the large number of doctors participating in the rescue work, many with no corresponding experience, require the guidance of experienced experts; however, experienced experts are extremely limited. The IoT can assist in this task. With AR technology, experts and front-line physicians can perform and support consultations through AR, which can be easily and quickly completed without time, space, and location constraints, while reducing the probability of infection and avoiding the requirement of isolation after consultation.","Viral infections are common causes for upper and lower respiratory tract infections and a frequent reason for outpatient office visits. Comparatively, viral respiratory infections are less common in the intensive care unit (ICU) setting but still play an important clinical role. Most viral respiratory infections in the ICU are community-associated cases with severe lower respiratory disease that can progress into respiratory failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) [1]. The remainder are infections seen in immunocompromised patients, such as transplantation [2,3]. In some instances (severe acute respiratory syndrome [SARS], influenza, and adenovirus), viral respiratory infections present with fulminant respiratory failure and ARDS, heralding a larger community outbreak [4]. In these situations, the newly recognized illness in an ICU patient might be the first presentation of a larger public health emergency.","[3]. The majority of the cases has been reported in China, but significant outbreaks are taking place in South Korea, Japan, Europe, Iran and more recently in USA [4] . In the human host, SARS-CoV-2 infection may be asymptomatic or may cause a syndrome (named COVID-19) ranging from common cold to a severe pneumonia with acute respiratory syndrome and need of mechanical ventilation in intensive care unit (ICU). In a retrospective Chinese study on 138 consecutive patients admitted with COVID-19, the median time from clinical onset to hospital admission was 7 days, 26% of patients were admitted to the ICU and 61% of them met clinical criteria for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) [5] . Another retrospective Chinese study on critically ill patients with COVID-19 pneumonia showed that 67% of patients met ARDS criteria, with a mortality of 61.5% at 28 days. Reported casualties in the ICU are characterized of various profiles of multiorgan failure (81% of deceased patients had ARDS, 37.5% had AKI, 28% had cardiac injury and 28% had liver failure) [6] . Autoptic findings in a published clinical case showed features resembling those of coronavirus-related infections such as Severe Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (SARS) and Middle Eastern Resporatory Syndrome (MERS), including bilateral diffuse alveolar damage with fibromyxoid exudates, desquamation of pneumocytes and hyaline membrane formation. Findings in cardiac and hepatic tissues may suggest the contribution of a viral infection as well [7] . COVID-19 is highly contagious and responsible for thousands of casualties and is now spreading to many countries. The combined effect of the high transmission and the reported high incidence of severe disease in symptomatic patients poses a threat to healthcare systems involved in the outbreaks in different ways, including: cumulative casualties, increased need for hospital and ICU beds causing work overload for all the healthcare staff and often forcing hospitals to shut down all elective surgical activity; high social and economic costs, dramatically reduction of the productivity by the rigorous quarantine requirements and strategies for curtailing disease spreading, which made economic pain that disrupt supply chains and stock markets .","Acute respiratory distress syndrome is a form of noncardiogenic pulmonary oedema, due to alveolar injury secondary to an infl ammatory process, that can be either pulmonary or systemic in origin. This syndrome presents as acute hypoxaemia with bilateral pulmonary infi ltrates on chest imaging, which are not wholly due to heart failure. As a syndrome, it is characterised by the presence of several criteria. Since the original description by Ashbaugh and colleagues in 1967, 1 four defi nitions have been used to determine the presence of acute respiratory distress syndrome (table) . [2] [3] [4] [5] The American European Consensus Conference defi nition, 3 which was published in 1994, was the fi rst agreed and widely used defi nition. However, it had numerous limitations across all four diagnostic criteria (panel), and, as a result, the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine engaged in a consensus process to generate an improved defi nition for acute respiratory distress syndrome. The Berlin defi nition, 5 which was published in 2012, was validated in over 4000 patients' data: on the basis of hypoxaemia, acute respiratory distress syndrome is classifi ed as mild (ratio of the partial pressure of arterial oxygen to the fraction of inspired oxygen [PaO 2 /FiO 2 ] of 200-\u2264300 mm Hg), moderate (PaO 2 /FiO 2 100-\u2264200 mm Hg), or severe (PaO 2 /FiO 2 \u2264100 mm Hg). The most important updates to the defi nition are the stipulation of a minimum positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cm H 2 O, (PEEP can increase oxygenation, which is a key criterion of the syndrome-this update was to establish a minimum standard for mechanical ventilation); the acknowledgment that acute respiratory distress syndrome can be diagnosed in the presence of cardiac failure; a requirement for new respiratory failure, or worsening of chronic respiratory disease, within 7 days; and the inclusion of chest CT as an alternative form of imaging for the demonstration of lung infi ltrates.","Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronarvirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), the agent responsible for COVID-19 has an affinity for angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors. 11 This is central to the pathophysiology of the condition, leading to pneumonia and in critical stages, associated fulminant acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and multi-organ failure. 12 The primary affected organ is the lung but cardiovascular injury is also common. There is enhanced expression of ACE-2 in those with cardiovascular conditions, possibly accounting for the apparent greater severity of COVID-19 related illness in these patients. In one study, a majority (58%) of those with severe infection had a background of hypetension, and non-specifically 44% had a history of 'arrhythmia'. 13 Binding of the virus to ACE2 receptors in the lung and the heart initiates the acute inflammatory response. Pneumonia results, but also evidence of myocarditis; those with a rise in high-sensitivity Troponin I are more likely to require admission to intensive care. 14 There is a strong association between a history of hypertension and mortality from COVID-19. Systolic blood pressure was significantly higher in those with COVID-19 treated in intensive care units compared to those not requiring this level of care (144 versus 122, P&lt;0.001). 14 This may relate to up-regulation of ACE2 receptors in those receiving ACE inhibiting drugs.

However, the term acute kidney injury (AKI) shares some similarities with that of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) given that these \u2018definitions\u2019 provide no information as to the underlying specific aetiologies. Clearly the cause of AKI determines treatment but also has been shown to influence both prognosis and outcome [2]; for example, sepsis-related AKI is associated with particularly high mortality rates approaching 70% in some studies [3] and is usually attributed to bacterial infections, less so to fungal causes and rarely to a viral aetiology [4].","COVID-19 has a mean incubation period of 5.2 days (95% confidence interval, 4.1-7.0). 16 The infection is acute without any carrier status. Symptoms usually begin with nonspecific syndromes, including fever, dry cough, and fatigue.

But the disease progresses to short of breath (~8 days), acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (~9 days), and to mechanical ventilation (~10.5 days) in about 39% patients. 1 Patients with fatal disease develop ARDS and worsened in a short period of time and died of multiple organ failure. 1, 15 The mortality rate in the early series of hospitalized patients was 11%-15%, but the later statistics was 2%-3%. 1, [15] [16] [17] The 2019-nCoV virus may enter the host through respiratory tract or mucosal surfaces (such as conjunctiva). Oral-fecal transmission has not been confirmed.

In the ICU setting, SARS is essentially ARDS plus intensified respiratory isolation. 25 The clinical presentation and radiologic features of SARS bear some resemblance to the syndrome commonly referred to as 'atypical pneumonia'. The high incidence of altered liver function, leucopenia, severe lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and subsequent evolution into adult respiratory distress syndrome suggest a severe systemic inflammatory damage induced by this human pneumonia-associated coronavirus. 26 The constellation of absence of upper respiratory symptoms, the presence of dry cough, and minimal auscultatory findings with consolidations on chest radiographs may alert the clinician to the possible diagnosis of SARS. However, the clinical and radiographic characteristics of atypical pneumonia are not useful in differentiating these pathogens from usual bacterial pathogens such as S. penumoniae and H. influenzae. Clinical diagnosis also becomes particularly problematic once the association with travel or case contact is lost. The difficulty of making a firm diagnosis until chest radiographic changes appear has important implications for healthcare personnel and for surveillance.","Since December 2019, the outbreak of corona virus disease-19 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) swept across China and emerged in many other countries have caused global concerns [1] . As of March 10, 2020, a total of 80924 COVID-19 cases in China have been confirmed and 3140 lost their life. In the early stages of this COVID-19, respiratory infection symptoms occurred, with some patients rapidly developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), acute respiratory failure and even death. Compared with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), the concealed onset, similar or stronger contagion and lower mortality could be defined as the clinical features of the disease [2] [3] [4] . However, many patients suffered a death attack in the early stages of the outbreak in Wuhan City, China.","MERS CoV can cause a spectrum of illness ranging from mild upper respiratory symptoms to rapidly progressive lower respiratory infection/pneumonia [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] 16, [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] . Fever, cough, and breathing difficulties accompany pneumonia that can progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), multi-system organ failure, and death [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] . Many patients present with non-pulmonary symptoms such as headache, myalgia, vomiting, and diarrhea. MERS CoV progresses more rapidly to pulmonary failure, as well as acute kidney injury (AKI) than SARS CoV. Patients with underlying comorbidities are associated with more advanced, complicated disease and death, than essentially healthy patients.","Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), due to a novel coronavirus (HuCoV-SARS), causes pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), with respiratory failure in 15% of patients and a mortality rate of 8% to 30%. 57, 58 Although data are limited, pregnant women appear to do worse than nonpregnant patients, with four of seven patients requiring ventilatory support in one series. 59 SARS infection adversely affects pregnancy, with miscarriage, fetal distress, and intrauterine death reported, presumably related to hypoxemia.","First reported in Wuhan, China, on 31 December 2019, an ongoing outbreak of a viral pneumonia in humans has raised acute and grave global concern. The causative pathogen was rapidly identified as a novel \u03b2 -coronavirus, which has since been formally named as the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses. According to the daily report of the National Health Commission of China, the epidemic of SARS-CoV-2 has so far caused 57,416 confirmed cases, including 11,272 severe cases, and 1,665 deaths in China by February 15th, 2020 [1] show symptoms of fever, dry cough, fatigue, abnormal chest CT findings but with a good prognosis [2, 3] . In contrast, some patients develop severe pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or multiple organ failure, with death rates ranging from between 4.3% to 15% according to different study reports [2, 4] .","In December 2019, the first acute respiratory disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV)-2, and recently officially named as Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID- 19) by World Health Organization (WHO) occurred in Wuhan, China. 1, 2 Person-to-person transmission has been identified through respiratory droplets or likely feces. [3] [4] [5] By February 14, 2020, more than 60,000 confirmed cases and close to 2,000 dead cases have been documented in China, with hundreds of imported patients found in other countries. [4] [5] [6] [7] Generally, the incubation period of COVID-19 was 3 to 7 days. Fever, cough, and fatigue were the most common symptoms. 1 Approximately 20-30% of cases would develop severe illness, and some need further intervention in intensive care unit (ICU) . 8, 9 Organ dysfunction including acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), shock, acute cardiac injury, and acute renal injury, can happen in severe cases with COVID-19. 1, 8, 9 It has been reported that critical ill patients were more likely to be older, had underlying diseases, and were more likely to have a symptom of dyspnea. 9 Oxygen therapy, mechanical ventilation, intravenous antibiotics and antiviral therapy were usually applied in clinical management, but presently there were no effective drugs for improving the clinical outcome of COVID-19, especially for severe cases. 1, 8, 9 ARDS, a rapidly progressive disease, is the main cause of death for the patients infected with previously recognized corona virus infection such as SARS-CoV and Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). 10, 11 In this context, it was initially considered that lung is the most commonly damaged organ by All rights reserved.

Non-survivors, with profound hypoxia and inflammatory response, are more likely to develop acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (2, 3) . Additionally, reduced peripheral lymphocytes, high levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) and IL-6, and significantly abnormal coagulation parameters are hallmarks in those severe cases (4, 5) . Emerging evidence indicates the potential benefits of managing cytokine storm, via using steroid or IL-6/IL-6-receptor blocking antibodies (3, 6) . The capability of blood purification therapy in removing pathogenic antibodies or cytokines has been proven in multiple scenarios, but not in COVID-19 patients (7, 8) . ","The early symptoms of MERS include fever, chills, fatigue, headache, muscle pain, etc., followed by cough, chest pain, dyspnea [5, 6] . About 30% of the cases may suffer from vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea and other symptoms. The severe cases can develop severe pneumonia within 1 week, which may lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), acute renal failure, and even multiple organ failure (MODF). It is worth noting that a considerable portion of the patients develop diarrhea firstly in the early onset.","The clinical presentation ranges from asymptomatic infection, to a mild flu-like illness or severe pneumonia accompanied by acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), septic shock, and multi-organ failure preceding death. The course of infection is more severe among immunocompromised individuals and those with underlying medical conditions, especially chronic renal failure, heart disease, and diabetes.","The acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) can be induced by viral diseases, with two virus types being responsible: respiratory viruses that cause community-acquired viral pneumonia and Herpesviridae that cause nosocomial viral pneumonia. Among the respiratory viruses that can affect the lung and cause ARDS, pandemic viruses head the list, with influenza viruses H5N1 and H1N1 2009 being the most recently identified. However, other viruses can cause severe ARDS. Notably, a novel coronavirus was responsible for the severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak in 2003. Apart from these pandemic viruses, respiratory viruses are rarely responsible for viral pneumonia and ARDS. Other than antiviral drug (mainly oseltamivir) administration and avoidance of corticosteroids, management of ARDS due to these viruses does not differ from that for ARDS caused by other diseases. Among Herpesviridae, herpes simplex virus (HSV) and cytomegalovirus (CMV) are the two viruses causing nosocomial viral pneumonia that can evolve into ARDS. HSV is frequently recovered in the respiratory tract of mechanically ventilated patients and can sometimes be responsible for HSV bronchopneumonitis. Although not evaluated for this indication, acyclovir can be a therapeutic option for patients with HSV bronchopneumonitis and ARDS. CMV pneumonia can also occur in mechanically ventilated patients, but is difficult to diagnose because virus recovery does not necessarily mean viral disease. Ganciclovir can be considered for patients with ARDS and histology-or cytology-proven CMV pneumonia.","The mode of transmission is through droplets from coughing or sneezing, and through direct or indirect contact with the respiratory secretions of an infected person. The clinical spectrum of the illness varies from a mild respiratory tract illness to severe complications such as pneumonia, resulting in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), respiratory and multi-organ failure, and death. The risk of complications is higher among pregnant women and those with pre-existing diseases such as asthma, heart disease, obesity and kidney disease. Laboratory confirmation is achieved by detection of viral RNA by RT-PCR on respiratory samples. The drug of choice is Oseltamivir; Zanamivir can be used as an alternative. Indigenously developed vaccines have been approved for use in India.","The development of acute respiratory distress syndrome has been described in the setting of numerous illnesses and injuries, which are broadly classed as being pulmonary or systemic in origin. Pneumonia is the most common risk factor for the development of the syndrome, and, along with aspiration, has the highest associated mortality; trauma-related illness has the lowest. 29 Inappropriately administered mechanical ventilation is an important contributor to both the development and worsening of acute respiratory distress syndrome. 28, 45 This ventilator-induced lung injury can occur by several mechanisms, including excessive lung stretch (volutrauma) 46 or pressure (barotrauma), repetitive alveolar opening and closing, which causes a shearing injury (atelectrauma), and potential oxygen toxicity. 47 These processes also drive excessive systemic infl ammation, with the ability to induce non-pulmonary organ failure (biotrauma). In a randomised controlled trial 45 of 150 critically ill mechanically ventilated patients, ventilation with 10 mL rather than 6 mL per kg of predicted bodyweight was associated with a fi ve-times increase in the odds of developing acute respiratory distress syndrome. This fi nding has been substantiated in a further randomised controlled trial 48 in 400 patients at risk of pulmonary complications undergoing general anaesthesia for major abdominal surgery. A non-lungprotective ventilatory strategy of 10-12 mL/kg tidal volume ventilation with no PEEP was compared with lungprotective ventilation of 6-8 mL/kg tidal volume with PEEP of 6-8 cm H 2 O plus a recruitment manoeuvre every 30 min. The lung-protective group had fewer major complications (10\u00b75% vs 27\u00b75%; relative risk [RR] 0\u00b740, 95% CI 0\u00b724 to 0\u00b768; p=0\u00b7001), required less respiratory support by day 7 (5% vs 17%; 0\u00b729, 0\u00b714 to 0\u00b761; p=0\u00b7001), and had a shorter hospital stay (11 vs 13 days; diff erence -2\u00b745 days, -4\u00b717 to -0\u00b772; p=0\u00b7006).","CoV=coronavirus. MERS=Middle East respiratory syndrome. RSV=respiratory syncytial virus. SARS=severe acute respiratory syndrome. *Hydrocortisone, methylprednisolone, dexamethasone, and prednisolone. corticosteroids, suggested impaired antibody responses at 28 days in those given corticosteroids. 17 Life-threatening acute respiratory distress syndrome occurs in 2019-nCoV infection. 18 However, generalising evidence from acute respiratory distress syndrome studies to viral lung injury is problematic because these trials typically include a majority of patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome of non-pulmonary or sterile cause. A review of treatments for acute respiratory distress syndrome of any cause, based on six studies with a total of 574 patients, 19 concluded that insufficient evidence exists to recommend corticosteroid treatment. 20 Septic shock has been reported in seven (5%) of 140 patients with 2019-nCoV included in published reports as of Jan 29, 2020. 3, 18 Corticosteroids are widely used in septic shock despite uncertainty over their efficacy. Most patients in septic shock trials have bacterial infection, leading to vasoplegic shock and myocardial insufficiency. 21, 22 In this group, there is potential that net benefit might be derived from steroid treatment in severe shock. 21, 22 However, shock in severe hypoxaemic respiratory failure is often a consequence of increased intrathoracic pressure (during invasive ventilation) impeding cardiac filling, and not vasoplegia. 23 In this context, steroid treatment is unlikely to provide a benefit.","A large body of evidence indicates that ventilation at low lung volumes may also contribute to lung injury. In 1984, Robertson proposed that repeated opening and closing of lung units during tidal breathing of infants with respiratory distress syndrome could result in lung injury. 37 Robertson suggested that in an atelectatic lung, the air-liquid interface may be found proximally in the terminal conducting airways, rather than in the alveoli. Opening of these airways would require relatively higher forces, and the shear stresses produced could cause epithelial disruption. Other investigators have shown evidence for lung injury from low lung volume ventilation using various species, lung injury models, PEEP strategies, and modes of ventilation. [38] [39] [40] [41] [42] In patients with ALI/ARDS, ventilation at traditional tidal volumes (10 to 15 mL/kg of predicted body weight) may overdistend uninjured alveoli, promote further lung injury, and contribute to multiorgan failure. 34 Clinical trials have examined the benefit of protective ventilatory strategies that reduce alveolar overdistention and increase the recruitment of atelectatic alveoli. A National Institutes of Health (NIH) National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI) trial showed that the use of a tidal volume of 6 mL/kg ideal body weight resulted in a 22% decrease in mortality compared with ventilation with 12 mL/kg ideal body weight in patients with ALI/ARDS. 43 The excess mortality associated with large tidal volume ventilation may be related to cytokine response and the development of multisystem organ failure. 34, 44, 45 Ranieri and colleagues found that both the pulmonary and the systemic cytokine responses were reduced in patients with ARDS who were treated with low tidal volume ventilation. 44 ","The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) can induce acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which can progress to refractory pulmonary failure. In such cases, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) may be considered as a rescue therapy. In a study of ECMO for ARDS in patients with Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV), a similar coronavirus disease emerged in 2012, a significant decrease of inhospital mortality rate and length of intensive care unit (ICU) stay was found in patients treated with ECMO compared to those managed with conventional therapy [1] . However, with COVID-19, concerns have been raised about high mortality rate observed in an early report which included data on ECMO in infected patients [2] . It has been suggested that the compounded immunologic insult by both infection and extracorporeal circuit may counterbalance or even offset survival benefits [2] . In this article, we aimed to evaluate ECMO mortality as reported in early COVID-19 epidemiological studies.","For serious cases, hospital inpatient care is required to reduce the risk of complications such as organ failure and secondary infections. Non-invasive ventilation is associated with a high failure rate (92%) in patients with acute hypoxaemic respiratory failure due to MERS-CoV infection. 109 Patients with severe symptoms might need to be managed in an intensive care unit, where lungprotective ventilatory strategies for acute respiratory distress syndrome, inotropic support, antimicrobial therapy for co-infections, and renal replacement therapy for acute renal failure can be provided.","Current management of COVID-19 is supportive, and respiratory failure from acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is the leading cause of mortality. 2 Secondary haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (sHLH) is an under-recognised, hyperinflammatory syndrome characterised by a fulminant and fatal hypercytokinaemia with multiorgan failure. In adults, sHLH is most commonly triggered by viral infections 3 and occurs in 3\u00b77-4\u00b73% of sepsis cases. 4 Cardinal features of sHLH include unremitting fever, cytopenias, and hyperferritinaemia; pulmonary involvement (including ARDS) occurs in approximately 50% of patients. 5 A cytokine profile resembling sHLH is associated with COVID-19 disease severity, characterised by increased interleukin (IL)-2, IL-7, granulocytecolony stimulating factor, interferon-\u03b3 inducible protein 10, monocyte chemoattractant protein 1, macrophage inflammatory protein 1-\u03b1, and tumour necrosis factor-\u03b1. 6 Predictors of fatality from a recent retrospective, multicentre study of 150 confirmed COVID-19 cases in Wuhan, China, included elevated ferritin (mean 1297\u00b76 ng/ml in nonsurvivors vs 614\u00b70 ng/ml in survivors; p&lt;0\u00b7001) and IL-6 (p&lt;0\u00b70001), 2 suggesting that mortality might be due to virally driven hyperinflammation.","Most of the available studies have shown that diabetes mellitus (DM) as a distinctive comorbidity is associated with more severe disease, acute respiratory distress syndrome and increased mortality (1, 3, 4) . Amongst the 32 non-survivors from a group of 52 intensive care unit (ICU) patients, DM (22%) was a predominant underlying comorbidity (3 It can be assumed that patients with DM are more likely to be older than those without DM and advancing age has consistently been shown to be associated with poor prognosis in COVID-19, however, most of the aforementioned studies did not adjust for age. Nevertheless, diabetes has been uniformly reported to be associated with poor prognosis in other viral infections, notably seasonal influenza, pandemic influenza A H1N1 (2009), Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) (5) (6) (7) (8) . Multiple explanations can be put forward for this apparent association between pre-existing DM and COVID-19 severity. Innate immunity, the first line of defense against SARS-CoV-2, is inevitably compromised in patients with uncontrolled DM thereby allowing unhindered proliferation of the pathogen within the host (9) . Even short-term hyperglycemia has been shown to transiently stun the innate immune system (10) . Moreover, DM is characterized by exaggerated pro-inflammatory cytokine response, notably interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6 and tumor-necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1, in the absence of appropriate immunostimulation; this may be further exaggerated in response to a stimulus as seen in patients with COVID-19 complicated by acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (9) .","The 2019 novel coronavirus disease has spread rapidly across Hubei province and dispersed to all regions in China owing to its person-to-person transmission and strong invasiveness targeting the lower respiratory tract. [1] By the end of February 15, 2020, more than 68,000 cases of COVID-19 pneumonia had been confirmed in China, including over 1,600 fatalities. [2] Most infected patients who developed COVID-19 pneumonia suffered from only mild symptoms and then completely recovered. However, in some patients, the phenotype may rapidly progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and multi-organ failure. The initial clinical data, collected in Jinyintan Hospital, Wuhan, showed that ARDS was reported in 12 (29%) among 41 confirmed patients. [3] Among the 41 patients, 13 patients received medical care in the intensive care unit (ICU), 4 patients were provided invasive mechanical ventilations, whereas for 2 others, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) treatment was applied.","Since its emergence in December 2019, the outbreak of novel Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak has infected over 113,000 people globally with nearly 4000 deaths [1] . COVID-19, caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), produces a respiratory and systemic illness which progresses to a severe form of pneumonia in 10-15% of patients [2] . Severe COVID-19 can lead to critical illness, with acute respiratory distress (ARDS) and multi-organ failure (MOF) as its primary complications, eventually followed by intravascular coagulopathy [3] . In order to optimize patient care and resource allocation during this pandemic, biomarkers are urgently needed for stratifying patients' risk and for actively monitoring illness severity.","Our findings are similar to those reported in studies of long-term follow-up of survivors of SARI due to other etiologies associated with high mortality. The overall scores of SF-36 domains (with exception for mental health and role emotion) were significantly lower in survivors of SARS-CoV at 2 years compared with the general Hong Kong population [18]. Similar findings were observed at 1-year follow-up evaluation among patients who survived critical illness and the acute respiratory distress syndrome from influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus infection compared with a sample of the general population [22]. In a recent study that assessed survivors of severe disease due to avian influenza A(H7N9) virus infection in China, quality of life reported at approximately 1.5 years was lower than a sample of the general population [17].","Clinical presentation of COVID-19 greatly resembled viral pneumonia such as SARS and MERS. Most cases are mild cases(81%), whose symptoms were usually self-limiting and recovery in two weeks (Wu and McGoogan, 2020) . Severe patients progressed rapidly with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and septic shock, eventually ended in multiple organ failure.","Patients experience a spectrum of disease from a mild illness, through varying severity of pneumonia all the way to ARDS and sepsis with multi-organ failure and death. Initial clinical features at disease onset are fever (77-98%), dry cough (46-82%), myalgia or fatigue (11-52%) and dyspnea (3-31%) . 3 The majority of patients develop pneumonia, which can proceed in up to 20-30% of cases to respiratory failure requiring intubation and ventilatory support. In those COVID-19 patients who go on to develop pneumonia, dyspnea develops a median of 8 days after onset of illness. Radiographic abnormalities (CT or chest x-ray) consisting of ground-glass opacities and focal consolidation are seen in patients with pneumonia. Major causes of death include respiratory failure and myocardial damage due to myocarditis. Acute kidney injury, secondary infection and coagulopathy are each seen in approximately 50% of non-survivors. Mortality increases with age and in patients with underlying co-morbidities, such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus, coronary heart disease, chronic lung disease, and cancer. According to a recent retrospective report from Wuhan, clinical predictors of increased mortality on multivariate analysis included advanced age, progressive organ failure and elevated D-Dimers on admission. 4 Other factors significantly associated with poor outcome on univariate analysis included elevated levels of serum ferritin, interleukin-6 (IL-6), Alanine amino transferase (ALT), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and highly sensitive cardiac Troponin I, as well as reduced levels of lymphocytes, Hemoglobin (Hb), Platelets and serum albumin.","The virus was first isolated in June 2012 from respiratory specimens of a Saudi patient from Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, who presented with severe pneumonia that progressed to Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), renal failure, multi-organ failure and eventually lead to death (Zaki et al., 2012) . In the same week, a patient with a recent history of travel to the United Kingdom (UK) in August 2015, with 16 cases across three hospitals, and seven deaths (43.7% case fatality rate) (Payne et al., 2018) . Smaller outbreaks continued to occur in 2016-18 although the number of patients and the magnitude of the outbreaks were less compared to earlier years, presumably due to better infection control practices and earlier identification of cases.","The acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), first described in the medical literature in 1967, 1 consists of the symptom constellation of acute respiratory distress, cyanosis refractory to oxygen administration, decreased lung compliance, and diffuse opacities on the chest radiograph not explained by hydrostatic causes. Although initially called the adult respiratory distress syndrome because of clinical experience with adult patients, 2 it is now termed the acute respiratory distress syndrome and is recognized in the pediatric population.","High-throughput sequencing has revealed a novel \u03b2 -coronavirus that is currently named as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) 1 , which resembled severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) 2 . Most patients with COVID-19 were mild. Moderate patients often experienced dyspnea after one week. Severe patients progressed rapidly to critical conditions including acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), acute respiratory failure, coagulopathy, septic shock, and metabolic acidosis."],"title":["CHAPTER 4 Acute Lung Injury: Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome","Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS): Are We Speaking
