If this international research effort is going to be as swift and effective as possible, it will need to rely on a principle of open science. When researchers share data, code, and software and generally make their work as transparent as possible, it allows other researchers to verify and expand upon their work. Furthermore, it allows public officials to make informed decisions. In this study, we analyzed 535 preprint articles related to COVID-19 for eight transparency criteria and recorded study location and funding information. We found that individual researchers have lined up to help during this crisis, quickly tackling important public health questions, often without funding or support from outside organizations. However, most authors could improve their data sharing and scientific reporting practices. The contr...","ABSTRACT Within weeks, COVID-19 has transformed our practice of palliative care and clinical medicine as we know it. Telemedicine has emerged as a critical technology to bring medical care to patients while attempting to reduce the transmission of COVID-19 among patients, families, and clinicians. It is also increasingly necessary to preserve scarce resources like personal protective equipment. In this article, we share just-in-time tips to support palliative care clinicians and program leaders in providing the best care possible by telemedicine. These quick, practical tips cover telemedicine set-up, patient considerations, and clinician considerations. Next steps include ensuring equitable access to affordable telemedicine technology for vulnerable populations through creative solutions and financing, and dedicated attention to telemedicine evaluation and quality improvement.","The rapid spread of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) presents China with a critical challenge. As normal capacity of the Chinese hospitals is exceeded, healthcare professionals struggling to manage this unprecedented crisis face the difficult question of how best to coordinate the medical resources used in highly separated locations. Responding rapidly to this crisis, the National Telemedicine Center of China (NTCC), located in Zhengzhou, Henan Province, has established the Emergency Telemedicine Consultation System (ETCS), a telemedicine-enabled outbreak alert and response network. ETCS is built upon a doctor-to-doctor (D2D) approach, in which health services can be accessed remotely through terminals across hospitals. The system architecture of ETCS comprises three major architectural layers: (1) telemedicine service platform layer, (2) telemedicine cloud layer, and (3) telemedicine service application layer. Our ETCS has demonstrated substantial benefits in terms of the effective...","Abstract Individuals who visit community pharmacies are regarded as customers rather than patients. The public tends to view community pharmacists as businesspeople. Several factors influence individuals' willingness to patronize and to continue visiting such pharmacies. On the supply side, community pharmacists' responsibilities and duties center on the health and well-being of society. In this chapter, an assessment of community pharmacy practices in developing countries is particularly interesting in terms of medication dispensing and extended pharmacy services that promote public wellness. Community pharmacists in developing countries, who are supposedly strategically positioned in the community to provide public health, are not taking advantage on this opportunity. Although several studies have noted the services provided by community pharmacists, in general, the practice is far from meeting expectations due to several barriers. Pharmacists need to realize their opportunities and ...","Summary By accelerating global mRNA decay, many viruses impair host protein synthesis, limiting host defenses and stimulating virus mRNA translation. Vaccinia virus (VacV) encodes two decapping enzymes (D9, D10) that remove protective 5\u2032 caps on mRNAs, presumably generating substrates for degradation by the host exonuclease Xrn1. Surprisingly, we find VacV infection of Xrn1-depleted cells inhibits protein synthesis, compromising virus growth. These effects are aggravated by D9 deficiency and dependent upon a virus transcription factor required for intermediate and late mRNA biogenesis. Considerable double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) accumulation in Xrn1-depleted cells is accompanied by activation of host dsRNA-responsive defenses controlled by PKR and 2\u2032-5\u2032 oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS), which respectively inactivate the translation initiation factor eIF2 and stimulate RNA cleavage by RNase L. This proceeds despite VacV-encoded PKR and RNase L antagonists being present. Moreover, Xrn1 deple...","AbstractThe recent reclassification of the Riboviria, and the introduction of multiple new taxonomic categories including both subfamilies and subgenera for coronaviruses (family Coronaviridae, subfamily Orthocoronavirinae) represents a major shift in how official classifications are used to designate specific viral lineages. While the newly defined subgenera provide much-needed standardisation for commonly cited viruses of public health importance, no method has been proposed for the assignment of subgenus based on partial sequence data, or for sequences that are divergent from the designated holotype reference genomes. Here, we describe the genetic variation of a partial region of the coronavirus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), which is one of the most used partial sequence loci for both detection and classification of coronaviruses in molecular epidemiology. We infer Bayesian phylogenies from more than 7000 publicly available coronavirus sequences and examine clade groupings re...","","Chest X-ray is the first imaging technique that plays an important role in the diagnosis of COVID-19 disease. Due to the high availability of large-scale annotated image datasets, great success has been achieved using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image recognition and classification. However, due to the limited availability of annotated medical images, classification of medical images remains the biggest challenge in medical diagnosis. Thanks to transfer learning, an effective mechanism that can provide a promising solution by transferring knowledge from generic object recognition tasks to domain-specific tasks. In this paper, we validate and adopt our previously developed CNN, called Decompose, Transfer, and Compose (DeTraC), for the classification of COVID-19 chest X-ray images. DeTraC can deal with any irregularities in the image dataset by investigating its class boundaries using a class decomposition mechanism. The experimental results showed the capability of DeTraC i...","COVID-19, the first pandemic of this decade and the second in less than 15 years, has harshly taught us that viral diseases do not recognize boundaries; however, they truly do discriminate between aggressive and mediocre containment responses. We present a simple epidemiological model that is amenable to implementation in Excel spreadsheets and sufficiently accurate to reproduce observed data on the evolution of the COVID-19 pandemics in different regions (i.e., Italy, Spain, and New York City (NYC)). We also show that the model can be adapted to closely follow the evolution of COVID-19 in any large city by simply adjusting two parameters related to (a) population density and (b) aggressiveness of the response from a society/government to epidemics. Moreover, we show that this simple epidemiological simulator can be used to assess the efficacy of the response of a government/society to an outbreak.","","Direct RNA sequencing using an Oxford Nanopore MinION characterised the transcriptome of SARS-CoV-2 grown in Vero E6 cells. This cell line is being widely used to propagate the novel coronavirus. The viral transcriptome was analysed using a recently developed ORF-centric pipeline. This revealed the pattern of viral transcripts, (i.e. subgenomic mRNAs), generally fitted the predicted replication and transcription model for coronaviruses. A 24 nt in-frame deletion was detected in subgenomic mRNAs encoding the spike (S) glycoprotein. This feature was identified in over half of the mapped transcripts and was predicted to remove a proposed furin cleavage site from the S glycoprotein. This motif directs cleavage of the S glycoprotein into functional subunits during virus entry or exit. Cleavage of the S glycoprotein can be a barrier to zoonotic coronavirus transmission and affect viral pathogenicity. Allied to this transcriptome analysis, tandem mass spectrometry was used to identify over 50...","INTRODUCTION: There is little research on emergency care delivery in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). To facilitate future research, we aimed to assess the set of key metrics currently used by researchers in these settings and to propose a set of standard metrics to facilitate future research. METHODS: Systematic literature review of 43,109 published reports on general emergency care from 139 LMICs. Studies describing care for subsets of emergency conditions, subsets of populations, and data aggregated across multiple facilities were excluded. All facility- and patient-level statistics reported in these studies were recorded and the most commonly used metrics were identified. RESULTS: We identified 195 studies on emergency care delivery in LMICs. There was little uniformity in either patient- or facility-level metrics reported. Patient demographics were inconsistently reported: only 33% noted average age and 63% the gender breakdown. The upper age boundary used for paediatric ...","Timely detection of novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection cases is crucial to interrupt the spread of this virus. We assessed the required expertise and capacity for molecular detection of 2019-nCoV in specialised laboratories in 30 European Union/European Economic Area (EU/EEA) countries. Thirty-eight laboratories in 24 EU/EEA countries had diagnostic tests available by 29 January 2020. A coverage of all EU/EEA countries was expected by mid-February. Availability of primers/probes, positive controls and personnel were main implementation barriers.","While coronaviruses were first identified nearly 60 years ago, they received notoriety in 2003 when one of their members was identified as the etiological agent of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV) 1. Previously these viruses were known to be important agents of respiratory and enteric infections of domestic and companion animals and to cause approximately 15% of all cases of the common cold. This Review focuses on recent advances in our understanding of the mechanisms of coronavirus replication, interactions with the host immune response and disease pathogenesis and highlights the recent identification of numerous novel coronaviruses and the propensity of this virus family to cross species barriers.","Background We aimed to investigate the frequency of standard precautions (SPs) compliance and the factors affecting the compliance among nursing students (NSs). Methods A cross-sectional survey study guided by the health belief model was conducted in 2009. The study questionnaire is valid (content validity index, 0.81) and reliable (Cronbach \u03b1 range, 0.65-0.94). Results There were 678 questionnaires analyzed, with a response rate of 68.9%. The mean frequency score of SPs compliance was 4.38 \u00b1 0.40 out of 5. Tukey honest significant difference post hoc test indicated that year 2 and year 4 students had better SPs compliance than year 3 students. Further analysis using a univariate general linear model identified an interaction effect of perceived influence of nursing staff and year of study (F1,593 = 3.72; P &lt; .05). The 5 following predictors for SPs compliance were identified: knowledge of SPs, perceived barriers, adequacy of training, management support, and influence of nursing staff...","Infections with bat-origin coronaviruses have caused severe illness in humans by \u2018host jump\u2019. Recently, novel bat-origin coronaviruses were found in pigs. The large number of mutations on the receptor-binding domain allowed the viruses to infect the new host, posing a potential threat to both agriculture and public health.","There are outstanding evolutionary questions on the recent emergence of coronavirus SARS-CoV-2/hCoV-19 in Hubei province that caused the COVID-19 pandemic, including (1) the relationship of the new virus to the SARS-related coronaviruses, (2) the role of bats as a reservoir species, (3) the potential role of other mammals in the emergence event, and (4) the role of recombination in viral emergence. Here, we address these questions and find that the sarbecoviruses -- the viral subgenus responsible for the emergence of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 -- exhibit frequent recombination, but the SARS-CoV-2 lineage itself is not a recombinant of any viruses detected to date. In order to employ phylogenetic methods to date the divergence events between SARS-CoV-2 and the bat sarbecovirus reservoir, recombinant regions of a 68-genome sarbecovirus alignment were removed with three independent methods. Bayesian evolutionary rate and divergence date estimates were consistent for all three recombination-f...","The COVID-19 pandemic is overwhelming healthcare systems worldwide. A significant portion of COVID-19 patients develop pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), necessitating ventilator support. Some health systems do not have the capacity to accommodate this surge in ventilator demand, leading to shortages and inevitable mortality. Some clinicians have, of necessity, jerry-rigged ventilators to support multiple patients, but these devices lack protected air streams or individualized controls for each patient. Moreover, some have not been tested under conditions of ARDS. We have developed the Individualized System for Augmenting Ventilator Efficacy (iSAVE), a rapidly deployable platform to more safely use a single ventilator to simultaneously support multiple critically-ill patients. The iSAVE enables patient-specific volume and pressure control and incorporates safety features to mitigate cross-contamination between patients and flow changes due to patient interdepende...","Background Despite available recommendations on infection control for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), information is limited on actual practices in Asian hospitals during the epidemic. We describe practices observed by mobile SARS containment teams (mobile teams) during outbreak investigations. Methods We retrospectively summarized infection control practices observed in hospitals visited by mobile teams in the Lao People's Democratic Republic (PDR), Taiwan, and Thailand, during March and April 2003. Results Mobile teams investigated 22 reports of SARS in 20 hospitals (1, 5, and 14 hospitals in Lao PDR, Taiwan, and Thailand, respectively). Facilities ranged from urban hospitals with negative-pressure isolation rooms and high-efficiency particulate air filtration to rural hospitals with patient rooms open to outside air circulation and intermittent running water. At the time of mobile team visits, 5 (25%) hospitals implemented infection control practices consistent with World ...","Widespread, non-stop, and often sensational coverage of the coronavirus (COVID-19) has caught many governments flat-footed in efforts to protect the health and safety of their citizens. In response to the current global health event, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic. Mass gatherings present a historic challenge in protecting the health and safety of attendees. The majority of the prominent mass gatherings are religious in nature. Global sporting events, such as the Olympics and the World Cup, pose unique health risks to attendees and host nations. Deferment or cancellation of such mass gatherings may exert an extraordinary economic loss to the host nation. Universal adoption of best practices for infection control is the surest way for governments to prepare for mass gatherings. In these uncertain times, it is up to intergovernmental organizations to be the voice of reason.","Viral diseases are one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in the world. Virus-specific vaccines and antiviral drugs are the most powerful tools to combat viral diseases. However, broad-spectrum antiviral agents (BSAAs, i.e. compounds targeting viruses belonging to two or more viral families) could provide additional protection of general population from emerging and re-emerging viral diseases reinforcing the arsenal of available antiviral options. Here, we reviewed discovery and development of BSAAs and summarized the information on 119 safe-in-man agents in freely accessible database (https://drugvirus.info/). Future and ongoing pre-clinical and clinical studies will increase the number of BSAAs, expand spectrum of their indications, and identify drug combinations for treatment of emerging and re-emerging viral infections as well as co-infections.","Mass spectrometry (MS) has found numerous applications in life sciences. It has high accuracy, sensitivity and wide dynamic range in addition to medium- to high-throughput capabilities. These features make MS a superior platform for analysis of various biomolecules including proteins, lipids, nucleic acids and carbohydrates. Until recently, MS was applied for protein detection and characterization. During the last decade, however, MS has successfully been used for molecular diagnostics of microbial and viral infections with the most notable applications being identification of pathogens, genomic sequencing, mutation detection, DNA methylation analysis, tracking of transmissions, and characterization of genetic heterogeneity. These new developments vastly expand the MS application from experimental research to public health and clinical fields. Matching of molecular techniques with specific requirements of the major MS platforms has produced powerful technologies for molecular diagnosti...","","Being aware and implementing the latest and best scientific evidence in infection control and health care epidemiology is critical to enhancing patient outcomes. In this review, the latest published scientific data in health care epidemiology and patient safety were reviewed for the period May 2003-May 2004. Medline reviews and reviews of infection control and infectious diseases journals were used for this period. The latest guidelines and publications on antimicrobial resistance, nursing or infection control professional staffing, West Nile virus, and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) are included. Awareness of these and other important infection control publications is essential if the latest measures are to be implemented to prevent and control health care-associated infections.","Abstract Pathogenic viruses are viruses that can infect and replicate within human cells and cause diseases. The continuous emergence and re-emergence of pathogenic viruses has become a major threat to public health. Whenever pathogenic viruses emerge, their rapid detection is critical to enable implementation of specific control measures and the limitation of virus spread. Further molecular characterization to better understand these viruses is required for the development of diagnostic tests and countermeasures. Advances in molecular biology techniques have revolutionized the procedures for detection and characterization of pathogenic viruses. The development of PCR-based techniques together with DNA sequencing technology, have provided highly sensitive and specific methods to determine virus circulation. Pathogenic viruses potentially having global catastrophic consequences may emerge in regions where capacity for their detection and characterization is limited. Development of a loc...","Abstract Angiotensin-(1-7) is a vasoactive peptide of the renin\u2013angiotensin system (RAS), which is generated mainly by angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and exerts its actions via activation of its receptor Mas. The Ang-(1-7)/ACE2/Mas axis is nowadays considered to be a main mechanism, which counterbalances the vasoconstrictive actions of classical RAS, which includes renin, ACE, ANG II, and its receptors AT1 and AT2. Whereas the classical RAS has been known for more than 100 years, the protective arm of the RAS was relatively recently discovered. Both Mas and Ang-(1-7) were first described almost 30 years ago; however, it took an additional 15 years until the interaction of these components was revealed. Here, we will describe the story of Mas and Ang-(1-7), which was full of errors and uncertainty at the beginning, until the interrelationship between the two was unveiled in 2003.","Abstract Coronaviruses (CoVs) are enveloped, positive-strand RNA viruses with characteristic spike glycoproteins that project outward like the rays of the sun (corona \u2013 Latin for \u2018crown\u2019), when visualized by electron microscopy. CoV are classified, together with the toroviruses, in the family Coronaviridae and the order Nidovirales. All nidoviruses have a common genome organization and generate a nested set (nido \u2013 Latin for \u2018nest\u2019) of 3\u2032 co-terminal mRNAs. CoVs have been isolated from a variety of species, including birds, livestock, domestic animals, and humans. CoV infections can cause respiratory, gastrointestinal, and neurologic disease, depending on the strain of the virus and the site of infection. Importantly, CoVs have been shown to cross species barriers and have emerged from animal reservoirs to infect humans and cause severe disease. The CoV responsible for an outbreak of severe acute respiratory disease (SARS-CoV) in 2002\u201303 likely originated as a bat coronavirus which, du...","A high diversity of corona- and paramyxoviruses have been detected in different bat species at study sites worldwide, including Africa, however no biosurveillance studies from Rwanda have been reported. In this study, samples from bats collected from caves in Ruhengeri, Rwanda, were tested for the presence of corona- and paramyxoviral RNA using reverse transcription PCR assays. Positive results were further characterized by DNA sequencing and phylogenetic analysis. In addition to morphological identification of bat species, we also did molecular confirmation of species identities, contributing to the known genetic database available for African bat species. We detected a novel Betacoronavirus in two Geoffroy\u2019s horseshoe bats (Rhinolophus clivosus) bats. We also detected several different paramyxoviral species from various insectivorous bats. One of these viral species was found to be homologous to the genomes of viruses belonging to the Jeilongvirus genus. Additionally, a Henipavirus-r...","COVID-19 is now a pandemic and many of the affected countries face severe shortages of hospital resources. In Brazil, the first case was reported on February 26. As the number of cases grows in the country, there is a concern that the health system may become overwhelmed, resulting in shortages of hospital beds, intensive care unit beds, and mechanical ventilators. The timing of shortage is likely to vary geographically depending on the observed onset and pace of transmission observed, on the availability of resources, and on the actions implemented. Here we consider the daily number of cases reported in municipalities in Brazil to simulate twelve alternative scenarios of the likely timing of shortage, based on parameters consistently reported for China and Italy, on rates of hospital occupancy for other health conditions observed in Brazil in 2019, and on assumptions of allocation of patients in public and private facilities. Results show that hospital services could start to experien...","A novel coronavirus has caused thousands of human infections in China since December 2019, raising a global public health concern. Recent studies (Huang et al ., Chan et al ., and Zhou et al .) have provided timely insights into its origin and ability to spread among humans, informing infection prevention and control practices.","","Two months after the emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the possibility of established and widespread community transmission in the European Union and European Economic Area (EU/EEA) is becoming more likely. We provide scenarios for use in preparedness for a possible widespread epidemic. The EU/EEA is moving towards the \u2018limited sustained transmission\u2019 phase. We propose actions to prepare for potential mitigation phases and coordinate efforts to protect the health of citizens.","This year marks the 15th anniversary of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in Canada and the 100th anniversary of the 1918 Spanish influenza pandemic. These, and other recent public health events, provide an opportunity for us to review and reflect on the evolution of Canada\u2019s public health emergency response over the past 15 years\u2014from SARS, to the 2009 H1N1 pandemic influenza, to Ebola virus and Zika virus disease. Key lessons have been learned and milestones achieved that have shaped and sharpened our response approach and structures. While SARS was a wake-up-call to strengthen infection prevention and control capacity in health care settings and led to the formation of the Public Health Agency of Canada, it also strengthened our Federal/Provincial/Territorial (FPT) senior-level governance and led to agreements for pan-Canadian mutual aid and infectious disease information sharing. As well, our collective public health laboratory capacity has been strengthened through ongoing ...","Unprecedented measures have been adopted to control the rapid spread of the ongoing COVID-19 epidemic in China. People's adherence to control measures is affected by their knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) towards COVID-19. In this study, we investigated Chinese residents' KAP towards COVID-19 during the rapid rise period of the outbreak. An online sample of Chinese residents was successfully recruited via the authors' networks with residents and popular media in Hubei, China. A self-developed online KAP questionnaire was completed by the participants. The knowledge questionnaire consisted of 12 questions regarding the clinical characteristics and prevention of COVID-19. Assessments on residents' attitudes and practices towards COVID-19 included questions on confidence in winning the battle against COVID-19 and wearing masks when going out in recent days. Among the survey completers (n=6910), 65.7% were women, 63.5% held a bachelor degree or above, and 56.2% engaged in mental l...","The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) is a critical regulator of hypertension, primarily through the actions of the vasoactive peptide Ang II, which is generated by the action of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) mediating an increase in blood pressure. The discovery of ACE2, which primarily metabolises Ang II into the vasodilatory Ang-(1-7), has added a new dimension to the traditional RAS. As a result there has been huge interest in ACE2 over the past decade as a potential therapeutic for lowering blood pressure, especially elevation resulting from excess Ang II. Studies focusing on ACE2 have helped to reveal other actions of Ang-(1-7), outside vasodilation, such as antifibrotic and antiproliferative effects. Moreover, investigations focusing on ACE2 have revealed a variety of roles not just catalytic but also as a viral receptor and amino acid transporter. This paper focuses on what is known about ACE2 and its biological roles, paying particular attention to the regulation of ACE2 ex...","Abstract This chapter provides an overview of the basic theory of early warning for infectious diseases, including definitions of surveillance, early warning and prediction; the characteristics of early warning (surveillance, information for action, timeliness, insufficiency, and the uncertainty of information); a conceptual framework of an early warning system for infectious diseases (the target setting, data collection and analysis, disseminating early warning signals, response actions, and evaluation); classifying early warning based on the data sources (case-based, event-based, laboratory-based, or syndromic surveillance). The significance of early warning for infectious diseases, the status quo and research and application trends in the field are also highlighted.","The two largest Brazilian cities, Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo, have declared community transmission of COVID-19 on mid March, 2020. In this study we estimated the most vulnerable areas in Brazil for COVID-19, both in terms of risk of introduction and risk of mortality associated with social vulnerability. We explore the most likely routes of spread through the country, from the already exposed cities, according to human mobility statistics. The resulting maps should help authorities in their efforts to prioritize actions and if resource allocation to mitigate the effects of the pandemic.","","Objective To provide an overview of supply and demand issues in the vaccine industry and the policy options that have been implemented to resolve these issues. Data sources Medline, Policy File, and International Pharmaceutical Abstracts were searched to locate academic journal articles. Other sources reviewed included texts on the topics of vaccine history and policy, government agency reports, and reports from independent think tanks. Keywords included vaccines, immunizations, supply, demand, and policy. Study selection Search criteria were limited to English language and human studies. Articles pertaining to vaccine demand, supply, and public policy were selected and reviewed for inclusion. Data extraction By the authors. Data synthesis Vaccines are biologic medications, therefore making their development and production more difficult and costly compared with \u201csmall-molecule\u201d drugs. Research and development costs for vaccines can exceed $800 million, and development may require 10 y...","Abstract The world is faced with a remarkable coronavirus outbreak with epicentre in Wuhan, China. Altogether 40554 cases have been confirmed globally with novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) until February 10, 2020. Rigorous surveillance in other countries is required to prevent further global expansion of the outbreak, but resolving the exact mechanism of the initial transmission events is crucial. Most initial cases had visited Huanan South Seafood Market in Wuhan selling also various exotic live animals. Based on the limited initial human-to-human transmission and timely clustering of cases in Huanan market among elderly men, coupled with knowledge that coronaviruses are derived from animals and relationship of SARS-CoV-2 to bat coronavirus, zoonotic transmission in the first instance is probable. To target the actions, similar epidemiological actions to human cases are needed with animal or food exposures. According to current information, an exceptionally wide contamination of seafood...","The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak on the Diamond Princess ship has caused over 634 cases as of February 20, 2020. We model the transmission process on the ship with a stochastic model and estimate the basic reproduction number at 2.2 (95%CI: 2.1\u22122.4). We estimate a large dispersion parameter than other coronaviruses, which implies that the virus is difficult to go extinction. The epidemic doubling time is at 4.6 days (95%CI: 3.0\u22129.3), and thus timely actions were crucial. The lesson learnt on the ship is generally applicable in other settings.","Public disclosure from Chinese local Health Commissions show that male and mid-aged index patients are the major source of virus from outside to the households. This implies that two important actions should be taken in disease control. First considers the kindergarten and school closure time. Local kindergarten and primary schools should postpone their admission and regular operation, to at least not earlier than local secondary schools. Second, workplace hygiene is of particular important in the next phase of disease control. As travel restrictions within China are being gradually lifted, we suggest that workplace hygiene should be taken serious care in the next month or two.","Abstract In this paper the mathematical SIRC epidemic model is considered. It efficiently describes diseases in which a cross immune class (C) is present, along with the susceptible (S), the infected (I) and the removed (R) ones. Controlling epidemic diseases corresponds to the introduction of vaccination, quarantine and treatment strategies; generally only one of these actions is considered. In this paper the possibility of optimal controls both over the susceptible and the infected subjects is assumed, taking into account also limitations of resources. A suitable cost index is introduced and via the Pontryagin's Minimum Principle the optimal control strategy is determined and the existence of the optimal solution is assessed. Numerical results are developed analyzing the effects of different control strategies.","The need to protect public health during the current COVID-19 pandemic has necessitated conference cancellations on an unprecedented scale. As the scientific community adapts to new working conditions, it is important to recognize that some of our actions may disproportionately affect early-career researchers and scientists from countries with limited research funding. We encourage all conference organizers, funders and institutions who are able to do so to consider how they can mitigate the unintended consequences of conference and travel cancellations and we provide seven recommendations for how this could be achieved. The proposed solutions may also offer long-term benefits for those who normally cannot attend conferences, and thus lead to a more equitable future for generations of researchers.","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is optimized to spread widely: Its signs and symptoms are largely indistinguishable from those of other respiratory viruses. This commentary specifically addresses best ways to protect our hospitals against COVID-19.","The novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV, or COVID-19) epidemic first broke out in Wuhan and has been spreading in whole China and the world. The numbers of new infections and deaths in Wuhan are still increasing, which have posed major public health and governance concerns. A series of mandatory actions have been taken by the municipal and provincial governments supported by the central government, such as measures to restrict travels across cities, case detection and contact tracing, quarantine, guidance and information to the public, detection kit development, etc. Challenges such as lacking effective drugs, insufficient hospital services and medical supplies, logistics, etc. have much alleviated with the solidarity of the whole society. The pandemic will definitely be ended with the continuous efforts of both national and international multi-sectoral bodies.","ABSTRACT THE CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL and Prevention has published updated guidelines for isolation precautions that outline how health care workers can prevent the transmission of infectious agents to their patients and to themselves. THE GUIDELINES RE-EMPHASIZE standard precautions, which guide clinicians in the use of appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE), depending on the expected type of exposure. Respiratory hygiene/cough etiquette is incorporated into infection control practices as a new component of standard precautions. THE ARTICLE PROVIDES information on the new guidelines as well as information on newly emerging patho gens and methods to prevent disease transmission in health care settings.","Background: The coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) pandemic threatens to overwhelm the healthcare resources of the country, but also poses a personal hazard to healthcare workers, including physicians. To address the potential impact of excluding physicians with a high risk of adverse outcomes based on age, we evaluated the current patterns of age of licensed physicians across the United States. Methods: We compiled information from the 2018 database of actively licensed physicians in the Federation of State Medical Boards (FSMB) across the US. Both at a national- and the state-level, we assessed the number and proportion of physicians who would be at an elevated risk due to age over 60 years. Results: Of the 985,026 licensed physicians in the US, 235857 or 23.9% were aged 25-40 years, 447052 or 45.4% are 40-60 years, 191794 or 19.5% were 60-70 years, and 106121 or 10.8% were 70 years or older. Age was not reported in 4202 or 0.4% of physicians. Overall, 297915 or 30.2% of physicians we...","Abstract 2020 has become the year of coping with COVID-19. This year was to be the \u201csuper year\u201d for sustainability, a year of strengthening global actions to accelerate the transformations required for achieving the 2030 agenda. We argue that 2020 can and must be a year of both. Thus we call for more utilisation of the health-emergency disaster risk management (Health-EDRM) framework to complement current responses to COVID-19 and the patent risk of similar phenomena in the future. To make our case, we examine current responses to COVID-19 and their implications for the SFDRR. We argue that current mechanisms and strategies for disaster resilience, as outlined in the SFDRR, can enhance responses to epidemics or global pandemics such as COVID-19. In this regard, we make several general and DRR-specific recommendations. These recommendations concern knowledge and science provision in understanding disaster and health-related emergency risks, the extension of disaster risk governance to m...","We prepared the three-dimensional model of the SARS-CoV-2 (aka 2019-nCoV) 3C-like protease (3CL (pro)) using the crystal structure of the highly similar (96% identity) ortholog from the SARS-CoV. All residues involved in the catalysis, substrate binding and dimerisation are 100% conserved. Comparison of the polyprotein PP1AB sequences showed 86% identity. The 3C-like cleavage sites on the coronaviral polyproteins are highly conserved. Based on the near-identical substrate specificities and high sequence identities, we are of the opinion that some of the previous progress of specific inhibitors development for the SARS-CoV enzyme can be conferred on its SARS-CoV-2 counterpart. With the 3CL (pro) molecular model, we performed virtual screening for purchasable drugs and proposed 16 candidates for consideration. Among these, the antivirals ledipasvir or velpatasvir are particularly attractive as therapeutics to combat the new coronavirus with minimal side effects, commonly fatigue and

Care of people with serious illness and their families now requires impeccable social distancing for their protection and for all healthcare professionals so critically needed in response to COVID-19. Preparation, patience, and practice will help ensure effective implementation of telemedicine. The quick tips offered above are an excellent starting point, but additional support and innovation can help eliminate barriers and stimulate rapid mastery. First, we must find creative ways to ensure that all patients have equitable access to this valuable resource. We must reach individuals with poor social networks, poor technological literacy, and who lack access to technology. Soliciting the help of volunteers, philanthropy, and tech companies who can create plug-and-play telemedicine devices at low-cost can help shore up potential gaps in access. Second, reimbursement for telephone visits, particularly to those in whom video visits are not possible, will incentivize the use of this important modality when it is needed. Third, we must capitalize on this unprecedented time in which telemedicine will become a critical part of healthcare delivery to study processes and outcomes through programmatic evaluation and research to guide best practices in the future.","\u2610Types of facilitators and barriers that were considered \u2610Methods by which information regarding the facilitators and barriers to

As telemedicine has inevitably altered the traditional working relationships within the healthcare network, how to ensure high-quality communication among healthcare practitioners poses a significant challenge. As such, frequent, timely, accurate, and problem-solving focused communication among clinical staffs from hospitals at different levels in the healthcare system is essential to minimize the risk incurred in handling patients with possible COVID-19 infection 3 . However, we have found that high quality of communication is not always maintained during the telemedicine coordination. Therefore, a learning telemedicine system platform for coronavirus care was developed across connected hospitals, serving as the overarching authoritative source for diagnostic decision making and knowledge sharing for treatment. The platform could aggregate COVID-19 patient records across 126 connected hospitals and rapidly expand to enable open collaborations with key stakeholders such as government authorities, research institutions and laboratories. The lessons learned from this crisis can provide insights to guide public health institutions as they implement telemedicine to increase resilience to future epidemic outbreaks.","\u2610Information/description of the types of facilitators and barriers that emerged from the inquiry (e.g., practitioners have the skills to deliver the recommended care, sufficient equipment is not available to ensure all eligible members of the population receive mammography)","There are numerous considerations specific to the care of CV patients that should be taken into account in order to minimize risk for COVID-19 transmission to patients and healthcare workers, which are outlined in Table 7 . One important mechanism to help prevent transmission is the use of telemedicine. This technology, already utilized by numerous large health care systems around the world, is ideal in public health crises as it allows for patients to be triaged while minimizing exposure of patients and health care workers to potential infection. Additionally, telemedicine provides an opportunity for specialists that might not otherwise be available to evaluate patients. While there are currently barriers to the widespread implementation of telemedicine such as coordination of testing in patients triaged as high risk, this is a technology that will likely prove important to promote viral containment (86) . Other essential principles are to minimize non-essential/non-urgent in-person provider-patient interactions as much as possible (i.e. social distancing), and limiting elective cardiac catheterization, operating room and echocardiographic procedures. If such procedures are necessary, the number of required personal should be kept to a minimum. (38, 89) . These societies as well as a number of others agree that further data would be vital to inform decisions on adjusting regimens of these agents in the setting of this outbreak (38, (89) (90) (91) (92) . Moving forward, these important CV societies among other large physician groups and health systems will be critical allies to advance the knowledge generation and CV care in patients infected with this virus.","\u2022 Mass fatality events often include deaths of both nationals and foreigners. Internationally accepted best practices and procedures that promote the dignified and professional management of the dead and respectful engagement with people of different backgrounds, cultures and religions must be upheld. This will facilitate the sometimes complex administrative and legal procedures of foreign governments when seeking repatriation of bodies to the country of residence or requesting assistance with notifications of death to relatives living abroad. Shipment of bodies across international boundaries may be delayed until the infection is deemed no longer transmissible. Planning should include participation of airline companies expected to provide the shipment of bodies.","Dynamic maps of the disease distribution were produced to show the changes in new cases .

In addition, countries in Africa and Americas should try their best to avoid becoming the next epicenter.","Simulation training provides another opportunity to engage learners regardless of language and cultural barriers and has been found especially useful in introducing primary triage and culturally sensitive treatments (94, 95). With the improvement and advancement in technology, the interactive delivery of healthcare over distance using technology such as video conferencing or telemedicine can increase access, improve outcomes, and reduce costs (96). In work done by M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res (MSF) in Somalia, introduction of telemedicine resulted in a change in case-management in 64% of children for which it was used and detection of a previously undetected life-threatening condition in 25% (97). However, the reliable application of this technology in resource-limited settings can be challenging. The MSF system demonstrated a median response time of 13 h making its utility in critical, time-sensitive cases, somewhat limited (98).","Perceived barriers in the HBM are things that the individual feels may prevent them from making the desired behavior change. In general, as perceived barriers increase, the individual's likelihood to engage with the behavior decreases. Therefore, exploring ways to mitigate or remove perceived barriers will help individuals engage with the behavior in question.","The deficiencies in this legislation were highlighted by the measles epidemic of 1989-1991, which involved more than 55,000 cases and led to 123 deaths. 35, 76 Substantial numbers of unimmunized preschool children, particularly in inner-city areas, contributed to this event. 76 To ensure that vulnerable children had more reliable access to vaccines, the government refocused their funding resources on helping individual states in building immunization infrastructure. VFC is a state-operated federal entitlement program that provides free Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices-recommended vaccines to children 18 years of age or younger who are uninsured, Alaska Native or Native American, eligible for Medicaid, or receive their vaccines in a federally qualified health center. 77 At the state level, funds are earmarked for vaccine purchase and immunization programs. 35 State funds also have been used to purchase vaccines for children and adolescents not eligible for VFC. A combination of VFC, state/local, and Section 317 program funds (i.e., VFC only, VFC and Underinsured, VFC and Underinsured Select, Universal, and Universal Select) has been used by a number of states to purchase all recommended vaccines for children in the state, including the privately insured. 78 Many states use universal programs that expand the eligibility for VFC vaccines by supplementing VFC purchases at federally discounted prices. The universal purchase states have been successful in raising vaccination rates among the underinsured 79 and increasing access to newer and more expensive vaccines for children without insurance. 75 However, criticisms of the universal purchase programs have been raised, including (1) vaccine manufacturers' claims that universal purchase programs unfairly provide for the purchase of all vaccines at lower government contract prices, thus eliminating the private market for vaccines and decreasing revenue; (2) although immunization charges are reduced under this program, patients still pay for the vaccine administration fee; and (3) some contend that taxpayer money should not be spent to provide free vaccines for children whose insurance would otherwise pay for it. 79 State Medicaid and State Children's Health Insurance Program funds also are provided for vaccine purchase, although the level of Medicaid funding varies from state to state.","1. Telehealth and remote assessments. While these actions are intended to minimize COVID-19 exposure of patients and research team members, it is important to maintain, as best as possible, the integrity of HF clinical trial activities, particularly for study follow-up. The authors encourage study sponsors and sites to exercise the option of following patients using telephone follow-up procedures, until the COVID-19 pandemic abates. On March 17, 2020, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) announced unprecedented steps to expand Americans' access to telehealth services during the COVID-19 outbreak. In this announcement, HHS promoted a great deal of flexibility in telehealth access including the use of everyday technologies to talk to telehealth patients (3) . The HHS Office for Civil Rights announced it would waive potential HIPPA penalties for good faith use of telehealth during this public health emergency.","Midwives cannot address the needs of those in their care in isolation. What is important is that midwives engage with colleagues, the community, primary health care and health promotion activities. This is not limited to education and practices such as hand hygiene and physical distancing, but also embrace working across professional boundaries and collaborating with other disciples. Midwives need to learn from previous experiences with SARS, Ebola and H1N1 that foregrounded how professional silo thinking is unhelpful. COVID-19 calls for a coming together, a blurring of traditional professional boundaries in ways that promote greater coordinated cooperation between all stakeholders. Irrefutably midwives have the skills and experiences to do this in exemplary ways.","1. All elective outpatient visits cancelled with deferment for a teledermatology or face-toface visit. These measures also apply to the broader medical community and other specialties. We call upon the American Medical Association to take measures to promote guidance for wider implementation of telemedicine platforms and to help smaller solo and group practices with loans and other forms of financial relief to keep practices afloat during this crisis.","By addressing the phylogenetic controversies and taxonomic uncertainties, our phylogeny has implications for the detection and surveillance of novel coronaviruses, as well as conservation strategies for these unique lineages. The recent emergence of the novel MERS-CoV (Bermingham et al. 2013) has highlighted the importance of detecting and monitoring animal reservoirs of potentially pathological novel coronaviruses. The intermediate phylogenetic position of a SARS-like CoV between Rhinolophidae and Hipposideridae derived from Rhinonicteris (Ar Gouilh et al. 2011) is supported by the resolved phylogeny for these bats as its phylogenetic position reflects the underlying divergence of these three bat families. Although they have been underrepresented in previous studies\u2014see table 2 in Ar Gouilh et al. (2011)\u2014our phylogenetic results suggest that other members of the Rhinonycteridae may represent excellent survey candidates to expand knowledge of the diversity of coronaviruses, especially those related to the Betacoronavirus-b group, which includes the SARS-CoV. Given the similarity of diversification rates between Rhinolophus and Hipposideros, studies focused on detecting novel coronaviruses in Hipposideros could potentially mirror the diversity of coronaviruses detected so far in Rhinolophus. A comprehensive understanding of the diversity of coronaviruses is important for human health in that as the genetic diversity of zoonotic viruses increases so too does the possibilities of variants crossing species boundaries (Li et al. 2005).","For many years IC has been considered a low priority and as a result was addressed in a limited and fragmented manner. Recent events such as the SARS, Ebola and avian influenza outbreaks and the continuing rise of healthcare associated infections, such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), have challenged the international public health community to apply the lessons learnt from IC practices during the 2003 SARS outbreak on a global basis. Indeed, international experts and policy makers have gathered at regional consultations supported by WHO and recommended that a global strategy be developed for IC practices in order to establish international minimum standards. 49 In the wake of SARS, IC has been provided with a window of opportunity to revolutionise the way it is viewed and ensure that in future it is considered as a high priority. SARS has clearly demonstrated that IC is not only about implementing and following guidelines or knowing how to don and remove PPE. It is also about surveillance, surge capacity, information provision, consistent application of IC measures and an appropriate and adequate public health infrastructure. Many of the IC measures implemented during SARS are yet to be formally evaluated. Nevertheless, the literature clearly demonstrates that failure to implement appropriate IC procedures and apply them consistently was an important factor in the hospital transmission of SARS. It is now upto IC practitioners to harness momentum generated by SARS into actions that will improve local, national and global infection control infrastructure.","With the emergence of COVID-19, telemedicine has been catapulted into the role of a critically essential service for patients to help mitigate the spread of COVID-19 and preserve valuable personal protective equipment. For example, the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) has mandated telemedicine be used to care for palliative care and non-palliative care patients whenever possible in ambulatory settings. Similarly, many hospice agencies are currently offering most, if not all, social work and chaplaincy support by telemedicine. For hospitals, strict limitations on visitors has meant that some inpatient palliative care consult programs are performing family meetings and consults virtually. To support these changes, many telemedicine regulatory measures are being relaxed. As of this month in the United States, patients can receive telemedicine across state lines, Medicare will reimburse for telemedicine visits, and the Drug Enforcement Administration will allow prescription of controlled substances by telemedicine without a prior in-person evaluation (2).","Within weeks, COVID-19 has transformed our practice of palliative care and clinical medicine as we know it. Telemedicine has emerged as a critical technology to bring medical care to patients while attempting to reduce the transmission of COVID-19 among patients, families, and clinicians. It is also increasingly necessary to preserve scarce resources like personal protective equipment. In this article, we share just-in-time tips to support palliative care clinicians and program leaders in providing the best care possible by telemedicine. These quick, practical tips cover telemedicine set-up, patient considerations, and clinician considerations. Next steps include ensuring equitable access to affordable telemedicine technology for vulnerable populations through creative solutions and financing, and dedicated attention to telemedicine evaluation and quality improvement.","Overall, it is important to remember that Radiation Oncology clinics have always functioned as an interdisciplinary team of support staff, nurses, therapists, dosimetrists, physicists, and physicians, all aiming to help patients ailing from cancer. Heading into the fight with COVID-19, that team nature and vision to protect cancer patients remains critical.

Professor Fidler, a lawyer, from Middle America uses the recent outbreak of respiratory infection caused by a novel coronavirus (SARS) as a model for examining the rights and wrongs of current legal powers and how structures may change to encompass future threats. He parallels public health with international relations following the Peace of Westphalia in 1648, which ended the Thirty Years War. This landmark treaty enabled European states to overrule the views of a single country and laid the basis for future international relations and eventually the UN and World Health Organisation. I think this analogy is rather overplayed but the book does give some good historical insight into how countries have fought the threat of infections that cross their boundaries. The phrase 'germs are epidemiological phenomena; passports are political phenomena' is catchy but does not add to the commonly heard mantra that infectious diseases do not respect international boundaries. In the author's view 'Westphalian public health' is exemplified by the WHO International Health Regulations which were created in 1951 but have never worked and are increasingly abandoned by many countries failing to report outbreaks for fear of economic repercussions and richer countries using their own methods of surveillance and control. SARS nearly became a worldwide epidemic and the rise of new strains of influenza A virus present a possible major global emergency. In the post-SARS world international health relations have improved even if that cannot be said of political relations. The Chinese authorities appear to have learnt from their mistake in declaring SARS as a potential problem early enough to prevent spread via Hong Kong to many other countries in Asia and in particular to Canada. I recommend this book to anyone thinking about the barriers to communicable disease control across boundaries. We need to revisit the Public Health Act 1984 and the powers for quarantining contacts of cases of a highly infectious disease before it is too late.","and, in some countries, individuals without the professional pharmacy degrees are allowed to work in pharmacies. Thus, pharmacy authorities, policy makers, and educators must collaborate to fix these problems and make improvements. \u2022 Due to the high prevalence of chronic diseases and the need to improve public health and wellbeing, community pharmacists must continue to be competent in their professional and business roles; pharmacists should expand the role in delivering wellness services (e.g., disease-oriented pharmaceutical care) that go beyond filling prescriptions. \u2022 Many developing nations do not have effective and efficient regulations, guidelines, policies, governmental support, or electronic patient records and databases in community pharmacies to help establish and implement clinical, cognitive, and extended pharmacy services. \u2022 Community pharmacists should establish benchmark best practices-at the very least among countries with similar economies and levels of development.","Telemedicine (TM) has the potential to help by permitting mildly ill patients to get the supportive care they need while minimizing their exposure to other acutely ill patients. After all, the only infection that one can catch while using TM is a computer virus. To encourage the TM approach, nearly all health plans and large employers offer some form of coverage for TM services. Although the use of TM has increased over the last 2 to 3 years, rates of TM adoption among allergists are still low. 3 In response to the current COVID-19 situation, the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services and commercial health plans largely have waived co-pays for TM visits as a means to encourage utilization in this time of need, and allergists need to pay attention to this. 4, 5 A recent survey demonstrated that patients are willing to use telehealth, but barriers still exist, namely: (1) At a time of need, many people revert to what they are used to doing and the way in which they previously interacted with the health care system. (2) Patients would prefer that they see their own provider through TM versus someone with whom they do not have a previously established relationship. (3) Patients may be unaware that they have TM as an option and do not know how to access it. 6 Health plans, employers, hospital systems, and media outlets should work to overcome these barriers by (1) educating people that TM is an effective alternative and safer under the current circumstances, (2) expanding network reimbursement coverage for physicians to see their patients through TM, (3) making people aware that a TM benefit exists, with step-by-step instructions on how it can be accessed, (4) helping people understand how TM works, and (5) continuing to reduce cost barriers to accessing TM.","We recommend the following steps for implementing telemedicine into outpatient practices:","For patients who have their elective procedures deferred, a virtual visit in the interim may be helpful in their GI management until their procedure can be safely performed. As part of the State of Emergency response in Massachusetts, telemedicine and virtual visit restrictions have greatly relaxed to promote usage across state lines and include new patient visits. Additionally, these types of visits are now reimbursed at the same rate as in-person visits. At present, telemedicine or virtual visits make up 91% of our upcoming clinic appointments.","\u2022 Social distancing -keeping at least six feet (1.8 meters) between individuals in waiting rooms and work spaces as much as feasible. \u2022 Encourage sick employees to stay home. Personnel who develop respiratory symptoms (e.g., cough, shortness of breath) or unexplained fever should be instructed not to report to work. \u2022 Ensure that your sick leave policies are flexible and consistent with public health guidance and that employees are aware of these policies. Make contingency plans for increased absenteeism \u2022 Screen patients and visitors for symptoms of acute respiratory illness (e.g., fever, cough, difficulty breathing) or gastrointestinal symptoms and coronavirus exposure in the last 2 weeks before entering one's healthcare facility (4). \u2022 Ensure technologist and CCT imager hand hygiene best practices. If soap and water are not readily available, use of a hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol. \u2022 Consider standard droplet precautions for patients and healthcare personnel as per institutional infection control protocols. \u2022 Increase scheduling intervals or appointment times to allow adequate time to clean equipment as needed. \u2022 Leverage telemedicine technologies and isolated workstations to allow for reading and interpretation, that allow for social distancing to limit staff exposure, when possible. \u2022 Assign a team member to monitor and incorporate regular updates from the CDC and appropriate regional jurisdictions.","A 1918-type pandemic would likely disrupt supply chains and cause severe shortages in supplies and equipment. In fact, we have already seen this with prior influenza epidemics. 13 Of note, the COVID-19 outbreak significantly disrupted Chinese manufacturing in February 2020 and resulted in the worst monthly production numbers ever recorded in China. 17 Given the potential volume of patients, the lack of resources and likely shortages of material and personnel, we may need to use crisis standards of care in order to accommodate all the additional patients. 8, 18 We may be forced to clean and re-use equipment that is typically disposable. We may need to change our standards of care, expand the responsibilities of unqualified or underqualified personnel and change our practices. 18 Will this be good medicine? I think the answer is clearly no. As noted above, crowding in the ED results in prolonged time to antibiotics, increased mortality and generally poorer care and outcomes. 5, 6, 7 However, we will do our best, with what we have, to save as many lives as possible.","While the mainstay of containing emerging threats often rests upon public health expertisethat is the big picture. Science can provide timely antimicrobials, even vaccines to help thwart the spread of infections. But disease and health care live at the street level where person to person transmission occurs. Hospital and emergency department(ED) overcrowding remains a significant problem in containing the spread of infections. While some health care facilities (HCF) have improved access to masks and hand sanitizers, as well as placed cough/sneeze etiquette posters, these can have limited value if manpower shortages, cultural imperatives, for example going to a health care facility with many members of the family, language and education barriers all work against social distancing, personal hygiene and other containment strategies. Some practices and health care facilities have implemented old pediatric strategies of placing potentially contagious patients into separate areas. Clearly this is a space, manpower and resource intensive strategy, but one that may reduce transmission of illness from those who are injured. On the regional and national level, a serious discussion on best practices in terms of how to cohort and isolate potentially contagious people, as well as strategies to alleviate overcrowding, much of which stems from the misuse of ED and HCF for primary care problems is vitally necessary.","Neighboring state actions increase the likelihood of social distancing policy. As in other policy areas, governors may look to their peers to determine appropriate action. The policy diffusion literature suggests different ways to determine each state's \"peer group.\" Because the coronavirus spreads spatially, we focus on actions by neighboring states, and estimate the likelihood a state will implement a specific kind of social distancing as a function of the percentage of contiguous states also mandating that policy. We find that a state with no neighbors adopting a given policy was 32.0% (95% CI: 8.4 to 50.8) less likely to adopt it than a state with 50% or more of its neighbors adopting that policy. This corresponds to a delay of 1.20 days (95% CI: 1.13 to 1.26). Investigation of other possible mechanisms -including policy diffusion based on the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in neighboring states or based on the actions of peers a given state typically looks to for policy innovations -failed to uncover additional patterns of diffusion. We speculate that actions by neighboring states may grant cover to governors to take similar actions.(28)","In his talk entitled \"Emergence and phylodynamics of rabies virus\" Herv\u00e9 Bourhy (Unit of Lyssavirus Dynamics and Host Adaptation, WHO Collaborating Center for Reference and Research on Rabies, Institut Pasteur, Paris, France) presented his ongoing work on rabies, a model for studies of cross-species transmission by zoonotic viruses. Despite the fact that 12 Lyssavirus species can infect a large range of hosts, including numerous Chiroptera species, more than 98% of human infections are due to the dog-adapted rabies virus (RABV), transmitted through dog bites. The study of nucleoproteins and glycoproteins allowed exploration of the spatiotemporal dynamics of rabies in dogs and the processes responsible for its maintenance and re-emergence. The most recent common ancestor of RABV was estimated to have circulated on the Indian subcontinent 1500 years ago. The main drivers of canid RABV phylogeography are genetic drift and population subdivision. In Africa, anthropogenic factors contributed to the spatial distribution of RABV. Moroccan and Algerian strains were clearly clustered separately, indicating that political boundaries were acting as efficient barriers to gene flow. Road distance is associated with RABV diversity, with human-mediated dispersal being inferred as a dominant factor in strain exchange between large cities. The periodic introduction of new lineages into cities leads to limited but recurrent outbreaks. Vaccination is a pivotal element for rabies control, but control of dog populations should also be implemented.","With the advent of new and broader spectrum antibiotics, improved environmental hygiene, and advances in microbiological techniques it was widely expected that the need for diagnosis of infectious agents in tissue would diminish in importance. This assumption underestimated the infinite capacity of infectious agents for genomic variation, enabling them to develop antimicrobial resistance and exploit new opportunities to spread infections which are created when host defenses become compromised. The following are currently the most important factors influencing the presentation of infectious diseases: \u2022 The increased mobility of the world's population through tourism, immigration and inter national commerce has distorted natural geographic boundaries to infection, exposing weaknesses in host defenses, and in knowledge. \u2022 Immunodeficiency states occurring either as part of an infection, e.g. Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) which causes acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), or as an iatrogenic disease. As treatment becomes more aggressive, depression of the host's immunity occurs, enabling organisms of low virulence to become life-threatening, and may allow latent infections, accrued throughout life, to reactivate and spread. \u2022 Emerging, re-emerging and antibiotic-resistant organisms such as the tubercle bacillus and staphylococcus are a constant and growing threat. \u2022 Adaptive mutation occurring in microorganisms allows them to jump species barriers and exploit new physical environments. Such adaptation allows infections to evade host defenses and resist agents of treatment. \u2022 Bioterrorism has become an increasing concern."],"title":["Telemedicine in the Time of
