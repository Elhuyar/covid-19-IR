As a result, 58 decision-making among low-income welfare recipients involves weighing short-term and 59 long-term costs and benefits within these constraints and the availability of other formal 60 and informal resources (Edin and Lein, 1997; Roll and East, 2014; Zippay, 2002) . In 61 particular, social supports provided by informal networks, through both direct (e.g., 62","Simple linear regressions were used to test the association of ACE2 gene expression with each single variable of age, gender, race and smoking status. And, multiple linear regression was used to test the association of ACE2 expression with multiple factors (age, gender, race, smoking status and data platform). Also, ordinal regression was performed to investigate the association between ACE2 expression and ordinal categorical smoking history. All data management, statistical analyses and visualizations were accomplished using R 3.6.1.","The first case of inequalities can be attributed to behavioral and quality of life factors that depend on the socioeconomic level (unemployment, housing conditions, level of education, crime, alcohol, tobacco, food or work conditions affected by the social and professional status of the inhabitants). In the second case, the disparities should be attributed to the allocation of health-care resources that affect health service use (high costs, inability to participate in the costs, waiting time for a medical operation, availability of expert medical opinion doctors with specific experience and expertise, new technologies in micro-robotics or biotechnology, specialized staff for home health-care, complete and fast diagnostic procedures with subsequent effective treatment, etc.).","The overall level of knowledge varied across several characteristics of the study participants. Individuals who were 30 years of age or older (P = 0.016), female (P = 0.04), married (P = 0.028), had received a tertiary education (P &lt; 0.001) and were employed (P = 0.10) showed significantly better overall knowledge about MERS-CoV than their counterparts. Knowledge about the clinical manifestations of the disease did not vary significantly by age (P = 0.58), marital status (P = 0.54), or employment status (P = 0.34) ( Table 4) . Table 5 shows the final multivariate logistic models for independent predictors of poor epidemiological, clinical, and overall knowledge scores. Some socio-demographic characteristics, such as age, gender, and education level, were significant independent predictors of poor epidemiological knowledge, whereas only the female gender and a tertiary educational level were significant predictors for poor clinical knowledge (Table 5) . ","2. Difficulty finding child care could be estimated from the household structure of healthcare workers. To simulate household statistics of healthcare workers, we use nationally representative microdata from IPUMS. We take employed healthcare workers who are either the head of the household or the partner of the head of the household and extract the age, relationship, and employment status of each member of the household. We estimate the ability to find child care by identifying other members of a household that could provide care. We define alternative child care as any member within the household that is over 13 and not employed (under 16, unemployed, or not in the labor force). We stratify the data by state, sex, occupation (practitioner or support staff), and partnership status (single or couple) to estimate the state-specific family structures of healthcare workers. We weight these state-specific derived absenteeism rates based on county-level demographic information to obtain estimates for each county."," Table 3 presents demographic characteristics for the 500 respondents and for a comparable population from the 2010 Singapore census. Although the age, gender, racial group, employment status and family status distributions are similar between the groups, the sample has a higher proportion of those educated to a polytechnic diploma level or higher (45.2% compared with 38.0% in census).","FeLV status, FIV status, sex, tumor burden and location, histologic grade and immunophenotype do not independently consistently predict achievement of remission, duration of remission or survival. Some of the weakness of prognostic factors may reflect different criteria for anatomic location and histologic grade as well as the poor statistical power of relatively small case series. Certain combination of factors may affect prognosis. For example, cats with well-differentiated intestinal epitheliotropic lymphoma have a better prognosis than with other forms of abdominal lymphoma. In one report, 69% achieved complete remission with a median survival of 22.8 months.","This approach to disease modelling allows us to explicitly simulate person-to-person virus transmission, the probability of such transmission, the location of transmission (e.g. school, workplace, home, community) and determines each individual's infection status through time. [10] [11] [12] 14 Simulation models create a \"virtual world\" of individuals whose daily movement, changing contact patterns and disease biology dynamics aim to replicate that of the real-world system in as much detail as data sources permit, such as data from the POLYMOD contact pattern study. 15 We modelled an Australian city, Newcastle in New South Wales. Its model matches the real-world counterpart with respect to population size, household structure, age of individuals in each household (stratified from Australian census data into ten age bands), employment, schooling, and daily movement between these locations. The model was developed using detailed census, workplace and mobility data using a model development methodology applied previously.11 Such models create realistic representations of the respective communities at an individual-byindividual level using the best available data sources, including from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS).16","The parameters of the status dynamic SEIO (MH) model were fitted according to the daily reports of new infections in Wuhan from Jan 27 th to Feb 2 th , during which the daily new increase of people in status \u202b\u072b\u202c was monotonously increasing with time. The initial number of people in status \u202b\u072b\u202c and \u202b\u0727\u202c were simulated from 500 to 10,000, while parameter \u07d9 and \u07da were simulated from 10 -9 to 10 -11 , respectively. Also, the median time of people from status \u202b\u072f\u202c to status \u0731 and people from status \u202b\u072b\u202c to status \u0731 were simulated according to the increasing number of cured and dead from Jan 27 th to Feb 2 th . By minimizing the absolute error to the ground truth number in status \u202b\u072b\u202c , the statuses on Jan 27 th can be inferred.","To clarify the dynamic change of IgG antibody in male and female patients, we analyzed the level of IgG antibody between male and female patients in those four disease status. As shown in Figure 1A , in female patients, the level of IgG antibody continuously increased from mild status patients to general patients and severe patients, and then decreased in recovering patients. While in male patients, the IgG antibody raised from mild status patients to general patients, and then decreased from severe patients to recovering patients. In addition to severe status, the level of IgG antibody in the other three statuses were nearly the same. While in severe status, compared with male patients, the level of IgG antibody in severe status seemed to be higher in female patients. Next, we mapped scatter diagrams respectively for the above four status of patients. However, none of these four status showed a statistical difference in IgG antibody level between male and female patients ( Figure 1B-1E) . Notably, in severe status, most of the female patients had an antibody level for more than 100AU/mL, while in male patients, most of the IgG antibody were under 100AU/mL. Together, above data showed that the SARS-CoV-2 IgG level in female patients seemed to be higher than that of in male patients in severe status.","Migrants and refugees are particularly vulnerable to the impact of COVID-19 in the wider community. They are over-represented among the homeless population in most member states-a growing trend in EU-15 and border and transit countries. 5 Living conditions for homeless refugees and migrants can undermine the ability to follow public health advice, including basic hygiene measures, quarantine, or self-isolation, because many people are in close contact and gather in large groups. Furthermore, international migrant workers and refugees can be affected by income loss, healthcare insecurity, and the ramifications that come with postponement of decisions on their legal status or reduction of employment, legal, and administrative services. There is also scarce culturally and linguistically accessible information about COVID-19 and how to protect oneself and others, which further increases risks to refugees and migrants as well as host populations.","In this study, the isolation measures refer to that from the time of publication TI, individuals in I-status stop moving and are isolated and treated by the hospital. It can be found that with the isolation measures implemented at four time points, the Estatus user changes are not obvious. The possible reason is that this isolation is only implemented for I-status users, but one of the characteristics of 2019-nCoV is that not only I-status is contagious, but E-status is also contagious. Although the I-status is being treated in isolation, there are still many members of the E-status in the incubation period.","We perform multiple ecological regression analysis to find associations between healthcare worker absenteeism and known COVID-19 complicating factors. We use a quasi-Poisson GLM with absenteeism rates as the outcome, and healthcare worker population as weights. 29 Our factors of interest, based on available county data, are adult cardiovascular disease mortality and adult diabetes rates, due to how cardiovascular disease and diabetes are reported to exacerbate COVID-19 outcomes. We control for race, age, state, household status, sex, population, and fair market rent. We run separate models for cardiovascular disease and diabetes.","Disease improvement or favorable clinical outcome included full recovery and discharge, progression from critical/severe to non-severe disease status, PCR positive to negative, and/or maintenance of non-severe status. Disease progression or unfavorable clinical outcome included death, progression from non-severe to severe/critical disease status or severe to critical status, and/or maintenance of severe or critical status.","To find county-level demographic and occupational data, we used 5-year estimates from the American Community Survey (ACS) 13 and the Integrated Public Use Microdata Series (IPUMS) 14 , a database derived from ACS. The ACS provides comprehensive coverage of data at the county level across factors such as education, housing, employment, and income. For probability estimates of child care dependency, we used data from The National Household Education Survey and a Pew Research Center survey on working parents. 12, 15 For county-level estimates of health assessments we used the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation and the CDC Diabetes Interactive Atlas. 16, 17 For county-level fair market rent estimates, we use data from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). 18 For child care cost estimates, we use data from Child Care Aware of America (CCAoA). 19 We defined healthcare workers as individuals belonging to the ACS categories of practitioners (e.g. physicians, nurses, technicians) or support staff (e.g. orderlies, aides, assistants).","Objectives: Evidence is conflicting regarding the potential benefits of influenza vaccination in patients with diabetes. As part of the PRISMA study (Hak E, et al. Arch Intern Med, 2005) we assessed the clinical effectiveness of influenza vaccination in adults with diabetes and specifically examined potential modification of effect by age and prior influenza vaccination. Methods: We conducted a case-control study nested in a large cohort of patients recommended for influenza vaccination during the 1999-2000 influenza A epidemic (n = 75,000). We selected cases and controls with a diagnosis of diabetes from the original study population (n = 9,238). Vaccination status was recorded by the general practitioner. The primary endpoint was the composite of all-cause mortality and hospitalization for diabetes events, acute respiratory or cardiovascular disease during the epidemic, and the separate components were secondary endpoints. We evaluated the effect of vaccination and the influence of prior vaccination by means of logistic regression analysis controlling for age, gender, health insurance coverage, prior health care use, medication use and co-morbid conditions. Results: We observed 131 hospitalizations and 61 deaths. In all, the combined endpoint was reduced by 56% (95% confidence interval: 36-70%), hospitalizations by 52% (95% CI 22 to 70%) and deaths by 58% (95% CI 13 to 80%. Among persons with diabetes aged 18 to 64 years we observed somewhat higher reductions in the primary endpoint than elderly persons with diabetes over 65 years of age (72% versus 39%). In those vaccinated for the first time, the primary endpoint was reduced by 47% (95% CI 0.2% to 72%) and in those who received prior vaccination the reduction was 58% (95% CI 4 to 81%). Conclusion: Adults with diabetes alike other recommended risk groups as healthy elderly persons and patients with cardiovascular or pulmonary disease benefit considerably from influenza vaccination and no difference in vaccine effectiveness was observed between first time and repeat vaccination.","For example, the peak value of I-status personnel is 10% at TI = 10, and the peak value of I-status personnel is 95% at TI = 40 and decreases to 0 at t = 45. .

It can be found that the implementation of population mobility control at two points in time, and the difference in the degree of population mobility control, the proportion of I-status users has changed significantly. A conclusion similar to that of the E-status is obtained, that is, in order to reduce the proportion of the I-status users, measures to reduce population mobility should be implemented as soon as possible. .

When t = 50, compared with the lowmeasure group (the percentage of D-status in almost all communities exceeds 50%), the range of the D-status ratio in the high-measure group is [0.5-1]. Areas above 100% (gray) appear at t = 50, which is because the random flow of people makes the number of people in some communities higher than the initial stage. This result further validates that \"the sooner, the higher the degree of implementation of the measures to reduce the movement of people, the better the effect of controlling the spread of the epidemic.\" This study further validates the concerns of international and domestic experts regarding asymptomatic transmission (ie, E-status in this article). This article suggests that as long as medical resources are available, E-status individuals or potential E-status individuals should be included in the scope of isolation and treatment. The government should promptly release information on the epidemic situation, as well as information on the areas and vehicles used by the infected people, to further encourage those who have been in contact with individuals in the I or E-status to go to nearby hospitals for timely inspection.","We now consider a more realistic population which consists of coupled sub-populations, so effectively a metapopulation model. The most obvious reason for this setup could be location/geographic or by age, but other alternatives exist including religion, ethnicity or socio-economic status. We again consider one-shot interventions that either target the entire population at once or that target individual sub-populations at different times. A typical plot of the prevalence level in each sub-populations is shown in figure 4 in the absence of intervention. The epidemic starts in sub-population two but it then spreads to all the other.","Because health is presented in modern economic relationships of markets both as a public and as a private consumer good, access to it sometimes depends on: (1) the level of income of citizens; (2) the magnitude of the risk and the nature and the severity of the disease, i.e., the size of the resulting expense; (3) the availability of health services in some areas; (4) the nature of human mobility due to age or disability in conjunction with formal or informal social or family structures; and (5) the type of insurance coverage.","As the novel coronavirus threatens the health of Americans and the US economy, 2 cash transfers have received broad bipartisan support in both the House and Senate as one 3 method to address the severe financial distress brought on by the pandemic (Grisales, 4 Snell, and Davis, 2020). In March 2020, members of the Republican and Democratic 5 parties introduced cash transfers as part of a coronavirus stimulus package, illustrating 6 that the concept of cash transfers and guaranteed income (GI) programs have moved out 7 of the research space and into the policy conversation (Grunwald, 2020) . Nonetheless, to 8 date, neither the proposed stimulus package nor other GI policy proposals discuss how 9 these influxes of cash will or will not interact with means tested benefits and income 10 thresholds, leaving some households at risk of preserving their financial stability at the 11 expense of their access to health insurance and other benefits (Identifying Author). In the 12 midst of an unprecedented crisis and a surge of GI experiments, the field of public health 13 and allied disciplines are ideally situated to lead the policy community in developing 14 models that assist policy makers in ensuring that cash transfer interventions and GI 15 experiments preserve benefits rather than produce new forms of inequality. This paper 16 uses the loss mitigation strategies and ethical framework employed by the Stockton The concept of combating poverty by providing Americans with a cash transfer or 22 GI based on economic need first entered policy debates in the 1960s (Steensland, 2008) . 23","Based on the fitted parameters, the simulation showed that it would take 14 days for people to transfer from status \u202b\u072f\u202c to status \u0731 . For those out of the system before been hospitalized, it would take 28 days to transfer from status ) raised up to 8,509 on Jan 26 th . With the default parameters, the epidemic in Wuhan was described by local status dynamic SEIO (MH) modeling. Illustrated in Figure 2a , patient zero was inferred to appear on Nov. 29 th , 2019. From that day to Jan 23 th , 2020, when less intervention was applied to prevent the epidemic, the number of infected people increased exponentially. After Jan 23 th , the circulation intensity of people in Wuhan decreased sharply after the city lockdown 19 . However, the people infected with symptoms, exposed and in hospitalization were estimated to be 1,682, 6,536 and 2,471 respectively on Jan 22 nd , 2020 and increased to 1,999, 7,676 and 2,877 respectively on Jan 23 rd , 2020 (Figure 2b) , which was a large population with infected people and would lead to the outbreaks of the epidemic in the early period even after the lockdown.","The majority of study participants were males (n=58, 68%), local residents aged 31\u201350 y (n=55, 63%) and making a living in grain and cash crop production. Small business (n=16, 18%), household livestock production (n=13, 15%) and other migrant and casual work (n=30, 34%) were the other main contributors to local incomes, and many participants reported multiple income sources (n=35, 40%). Without sharing detailed income or education information, participants who discussed socioeconomic status generally indicated low levels of education (e.g. \u2018I didn't go to school that much\u2019) or a low economic status (e.g. \u2018We are poor\u2019) (Table 1).","The 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7), the 7-item Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) and the 22-item Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) were used to evaluate depression, anxiety, insomnia and distress, respectively. The PHQ-9 is a self-report measure used to assess the severity of depression, with the total scores categorized as follows: minimal/no depression (0-4), mild depression (5-9), moderate depression (10-14), or severe depression (15-21) (Kocalevent et al., 2013) . The GAD-7 is a self-rated scale to evaluate the severity of anxiety and has good reliability and validity. The total scores are categorized as follows: minimal/no anxiety (0-4), mild anxiety (5-9), moderate anxiety (10-14), or severe anxiety (15-21) (L\u00f6we et al., 2008) . The ISI is a measure of insomnia severity that has been shown to be valid and reliable. The total scores are categorized as follows: normal (0-7), subthreshold (8-14), moderate insomnia (15-21), or severe insomnia (22-28) (Morin et al., 2011) . The IES-R is a self-report measure used to assess the response to a specific stressful life event and has extensive reliability and validity. The event used for this questionnaire was the occurrence of 2.2.6. Self-perceived health status Health status was determined by asking participants to compare their current health status to their health status before the outbreak of COVID-19: How do you perceive your current health status compared to your health status before the outbreak? (answer options included getting better, almost unchanged, worse, or much worse).","Inconsistent with the study of Zhao et al. 5 , we observed no significant difference in ACE2 expression in Caucasian lung tissue samples compared to Asian lung tissue samples in the RNAseq datasets (p-value=0.45, Fig 1A) . In the microarray datasets, a higher ACE2 expression was observed in Caucasian samples compared to Asian samples (p-value=0.001, Fig 1A) . Given that the GSE19804 microarray study focused on female nonsmokers while the GSE10072 dataset includes samples from both males and females and both smokers and non-smokers, we believe that the observed disparity may be due to other factors other than race, such as smoking, gender and unknown factors. Therefore, we performed multiple linear regression on multiple independent variables (age, gender, race, smoking status and platform) and found no significant difference between racial groups (p-value=0.36, Fig. 1B ).","Data on the demographic characteristics of respondents, including age, sex, marital status, living status, the status of influenza vaccination, and profession, were recorded.","Stepwise linear regression was performed using the total score of mental health status as the dependent variable and 17 items of personal information as independent variables. The 17 items include: hospital, department, occupation, gender, age, highest education level, work experience, level of expertise, marital status, any children, living status, whether you have participated in training for handling of public health emergencies, whether family members support your working on the front line against coronavirus, whether you have supported in affected areas in Hubei, designated hospitals, department of infectious diseases, fever clinics or emergency department, level of concern whether you and your family have been infected, degree of suspicion that you were infected when coronavirus-related symptoms occurred, and whether you have received medical observation recently. Values were assigned to independent variables using the method shown in Table 3 . The \u03b1 -values for importing and exporting a variable in the regression equation were set to 0.10 and 0.15, respectively. Factors affecting the mental health and status of medical personnel based on their significance from high to low are: the degree of suspicion that they were infected when the novel coronavirus-related symptoms occurred, the level of concern whether they and their family members have been infected, age, whether they have supported in affected areas in Hubei Province, designated hospitals, and other places for the novel coronavirus, and whether family members support them working on the front line (p &lt; 0.05).

With passage of the patient protection and Affordable Care Act (ppACA), widely called ObamaCare, workplaces faced employer mandates to provide healthcare benefits beginning January 1, 2015. In 2016, employers must report on a monthly basis their compliance with the law. The net effect of the measures is to increase costs for employers and employees for healthcare benefits, while increasing health insurance availability. Workplaces will evaluate the cost requirements to meet the law. Security services will cost more generally for personnel services due to high healthcare costs. Organizations will have to see how higher costs can be justified or how costs can be contained by adjusting personnel requirements.","The data collection revolves around two main surveys: a background survey and a symptoms survey. The background questionnaire is completed at registration, and contains questions about the user's postal code, gender, birth date, household, level of education, employment, chronic health conditions, smoking habits, etc. The symptoms questionnaire is a weekly survey with a list of symptoms that the users employ to describe their health status.","Calves further investigated regarding the course of diarrhea and the ability of IL-6 to predict the clinical outcome after 7 to 10 d. Therefore, they were divided into recovering and nonrecovering groups after collection of data. At the onset of diarrhea, IL-6 was significantly greater in recovering and nonrecovering animals. Because calf age differed between the 2 groups, age was evaluated additionally. In a multivariate logistic regression model none of the variables IL-6 and age and showed significance. A possible interaction between these 2 variables was not observed. However, the univariate logistic regression model for IL-6 showed a significance influence of this variable in predicting a prolonged course of diarrhea and was therefore regarded as the most reliable model in this investigation. The odds to develop a prolonged course of diarrhea increase by 14% for each unit of IL-6 and model could explain 34% of the variance. In literature, several other factors are discussed that increase the risk for diarrhea (Pare et al., 1993; Wiest and Klee, 1998; Bendali et al., 1999) . Birth weight and calf housing (e.g., open barn vs. closed barn) were identified as potential risk factors (Pare et al., 1993; Al Mawly et al., 2015) , whereas IgG serum concentrations seemed to have no effect (Pare et Scouring calves (n = 20) were grouped by their clinical recovery status 7 to 10 d after the onset of diarrhea (recovering group, n = 11; nonrecovering group, n = 9). The IL-6 serum concentrations at the onset of diarrhea were evaluated for reliability in identifying calves with a prolonged recovery period. The area under the curve (AUC) was 0.808 with a standard error under the nonparametric assumption of 0.120, an asymptomatic significance (null hypothesis true area = 0.5) of 0.02, a lower bound of the asymptomatic 95% confidence interval at 0.609, and an upper bound of the asymptomatic 95% confidence interval at 1.0.

Nonrecovering group: animals that did not clinically recover 7 to 10 d after the onset of diarrhea. , 1993; Meganck et al., 2015) . These parameters were not assessed in the study presented here, but could have been different in recovering and nonrecovering calves. Therefore, these parameters should be taken into consideration in future investigations, especially focusing on potential interactions between these parameters and IL-6.","is the (which was not peer-reviewed) The copyright holder for this preprint . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.05.20020107 doi: medRxiv preprint groups of age or gender after other variables (age/gender, race, smoking status and platforms) were adjusted (p-value=0.90 for age, p-value=0.35 for gender, Fig. 1B) .

Therefore, it is extremely important to find specific anti SARS-CoV-2 drugs and learn from the experience of Chinese health providers.","All laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV cases reported between June 13, 2012 and March 31, 2019 were compiled from the official websites of the Saudi Ministry of Health (SMOH) [33] and the WHO [34]. We undertook a detailed review of the MERS-CoV data and performed a range of checks for data consistency, completeness and fitness for the study purpose. We then developed a dataset with variables of interest for each individual with MERS-CoV. The dataset included the following: diagnosis date, gender, age, nationality, healthcare, employment status and source of infection, as well as the city, governorate and province of residence.","These two trials provide important information on the natural history of node-negative oestrogen-receptor-positive breast cancer, and offer insights into our ability to alter that natural history. Although node-negative patients are often referred to as low risk, it is clear from the 35% relapse rate in the placebo arm of NSABP B-14 that these patients are at significant risk for relapse. In that trial all patients benefited from tamoxifen use regardless of age or menopausal status, which translated into an overall survival benefit that was highest in the youngest cohort of patients. Less clear is which patients warrant chemotherapy in addition to tamoxifen. A survival benefit 5 has been seen with the addition of chemotherapy to tamoxifen in postmenopausal oestrogenreceptor-positive node-positive patients, but it is unclear whether this benefit can be extrapolated to all node-negative patients. NSABP B-20 showed significant benefits in terms of relapse-free survival in all age groups, but this resulted in a significant improvement in overall survival only in the youngest cohort. Clearly the expectations and limitations of chemotherapy must be discussed with patients, especially the elderly, because competing health concerns, such as heart disease, might outweigh the small potential benefit of adjuvant chemotherapy. Standard prognostic criteria, 6 and ongoing work with molecular profiling 7 may identify a subgroup of node-negative patients that has a particularly high risk for relapse and may benefit the most from adjuvant chemotherapy. This molecular profiling, with the current and planned Intergroup and Breast International Group trials, will provide insights into the effectiveness and indications for chemotherapy in node-negative and elderly patients, and is congruent with the statement made by Fisher et al that factors other than age and menopausal status must dictate systemic treatment.","The current study does have limitations. The response rate was low (41.8%) and although there were no significant differences when compared with the population age, gender, race, employment or family data, those with higher education were over-represented in our sample. A further limitation is that the study design elicits the public\u2019s preferences and trade-offs between known interventions and known outcomes of those interventions. However, at an early stage of an outbreak of a novel pathogen, policy makers face grave uncertainty about the outcomes of interventions because the characteristics of the pathogen\u2019s transmission routes and potential, the severity and symptoms of the disease it causes, and the public reaction is unpredictable. As a result, the decisions by policy makers must continue to be based on scientific advice and political imperatives. Surveys such as this one permit a better understanding of those political imperatives in emerging infectious disease outbreaks.","All of the factors that influence human exposure to an infectious agent depend on contact with sources of infection within the environment or promotion of person-to-person transmission. 104 The importance of the factors that influence exposure tends to change with host age, culture, geographic residence, season, and family status.","1. The adequacy and viability of the health system in order to meet health needs despite of potential shortages of resources (human, material, financial) and the absence of innovative organizational, management, and operation methods. 2.

One area in which MRI may indicate the severity of the problem is in the cognitive status of the patient. An increase in the area of the lesions in the cerebral hemispheres or thinning of the corpus callosum may correlate with poor cognitive function.","Results: Totally 89 patients were included in the two-year consecutive prospective observational study. The nasal swab surveillance showed 74 (83%) patients without S. aureus colonization, 11 (12.4%) patients with S. aureus colonization, and 4 (4.5%) patients colonized by MRSA. No specific background factors, such as age, underlying disease, patients' sources and so on, can be identified to predict their carriage status. The four patients with MRSA colonization, none of them was given anti-MRSA antibiotics empirically but their clinical response, including days of antibiotics and days of hospitalization, have no different from those with MSSA colonization and without S. aureus colonization. However, once the pus formation, we noted the pus culture result was correlated with their nasal carriage status. The limitation of our study was small case number in patient group of nasal MRSA colonization. Conclusion: In Taiwan, MRSA nasal carriage rate is not high (4.5%) in adult patient with cellulitis. No specific factor can be identified to predict a MRSA nasal carrier in this group of patients. However, whether a patient is a nasal MRSA carrier or not, there is no different in their treatment response to antibiotics, empiric antibiotics against MRSA is not needed.","In the epidemiology of infectious diseases, many factors are evaluated to determine their relationship or association with a specific disease. Statistical associations, both positive and negative, may represent a true causal relationship, a confounding relationship with another factor, or a chance occurrence. If more than one factor is statistically associated with infection or disease status in univariate (singlevariable) analyses, the relationship between individual factors and infection or disease status can be evaluated by multivariate regression analysis. 35 These procedures allow the investigator to simultaneously control for a combination of factors in the analysis and to determine whether any of the risk factors are associated with infection or disease status independently of other factors. Another critical way of distinguishing causation from confounding or chance is by assessing the biologic plausibility of the association. An unexpected statistical association found in conjunction with an epidemiologic study may result in new understanding of how agent transmission or disease occurs. The temptation to stretch the plausibility of biology to provide meaning to statistical results is a constant danger. However, such results may be a useful guide to evaluate new hypotheses in future studies.","The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.21.20026146 doi: medRxiv preprint employment status, were collected in our survey.

These broad risk factors alongside limited resources have indicated the need for community-based initiatives for surveillance and interventions [6, 7]. For ARI surveillance in particular, infections in the community are those that do not get reported clinically. Clinical data generally represents the most severe cases, and those from locations with access to healthcare institutions. In Nigeria, hospitals are visited only when symptoms are very severe. Thus, it is hypothesized that viral information from clinical sampling is insufficient to either capture disease incidence in general populations or its predictability from symptoms [8]. Efforts worldwide including in East and Southern Africa have been focused on developing community-based participatory disease surveillance methods [9\u201313]. Community-based approaches have been shown useful for learning more about emerging respiratory infections such as assessing under-reporting [14], types of viruses prevalent in communities [10], and prediction of epidemics [15].","Further extensions of this approach might be justifiable given the current extreme limitations on testing resources. For instance, testing efficiency can be increased at the expense of specificity by pooling people in close contact (ex. family groups, work units) into a single sample prior to group allocation or RNA extraction. This reduces test volume by a constant factor under the assumption that individuals in close contact have positively correlated infection status and that cluster identification is more vital to suppression than determining a particular individual's infection status. In addition, pooling samples from the same individual (sputum, nasopharyngeal swab, etc) will obtain similar benefits with essentially no loss of information.","As part of informed consent, potential recipients received a comprehensive 215 overview of the potential impact of GI on other benefits. Table 1 describes benefits (i.e., 216 financial aid, food assistance, health care, housing support) potentially impacted by GI 217 and recommendations that are part of an ongoing exchange between SEED staff, local 218 partners (e.g., the San Joaquin County Human Services Agency, Housing Authority of 219 the County of San Joaquin, legal counsel) and recipients. Those at risk of experiencing 220 any benefit reduction also received a one-page cost-analysis fact sheet that detailed the 221 amount of benefits that could potentially be impacted. At this stage, five recipients opted 222 out of SEED, and other households were randomly selected from the passive control 223 group to take their place. 224","For seed production, the emphasis is on eliminating pathogens from the elite germplasm that can be transmitted through seed or contaminate the seed surface, including viruses, bacteria, and fungi. In many cases, elite germplasm of seed crops is produced and maintained by private companies. With seed certification, genetic purity is often as great a concern as pathogen contamination. There are multiple levels in certification programs for seed crops, similar to those used for vegetatively propagated crops. The seed crops would clearly fit under the G terminology shown in Figure 1 , and in this case G would stand for generation in the true sense of the word. The four common levels in seed certification (AOSCA) include: Breeder Seed (seed controlled by the plant breeder, or the institution or company where the breeder works), Foundation Seed (propagated from Breeder Seed under conditions that retain genetic purity, identity, and health status), Registered Seed (propagated from Breeder or Foundation Seed under conditions that maintain genetic purity, identity, and health status), and Certified Seed (progeny of Breeder, Foundation or Registered Seed and grown under conditions that maintain genetic purity, identity, and health status). In addition to genetic purity, identity, and health status, seed certification also requires information on percentage germination, date of germination test, and percentage contamination with other seed.","It can be found that with the implementation of isolation measures at four time points, the I-status user has changed significantly. The change is reflected in that the sooner the isolation measures are implemented, the lower the proportion of I-status users remains, and the shorter the time it takes for the proportion of I-status users to decrease to zero.","Demographic and social data from the study participants included age, gender, education, and marital status.

A herd may have vaccinated because of a previous history of TGE or as insurance against severe clinical disease following introduction of TGE. Some evidence for the latter hypothesis is that 56 producers, who claimed freedom from TGE and reported no history of disease in the last 12 months, reported using TGE vaccine. Seropositivity in TGE vaccinated sows may have been caused by vaccination alone or by a combination of vaccination and field infection. Serum neutralization titers following vaccination are usually lower than postinfection titers and seldom exceed 1: 16 in the absence of natural exposure (Hill, 1988) . Because there was no unequivocal way to differentiate titers from vaccination from those due to natural exposure, vaccination status was included in logistic models. Also, the potential influence of vaccination on TGE seropositivity could have been better evaluated if the farm's TGE history over a longer period (3-5 years) were known and if the type of vaccine (killed or modified-live) had been recorded.","The term status is often used interchangeably with state, as in \"What is the status of that purchase order?\" The main difference is that status tends to be associated more with permanent entities (customers and vendors) whereas state tends to be used more with shorter-duration transactions. This explains why medium-duration entities, such as purchase orders and contracts, tend to have either term applied to them."],"title":["Mitigating loss of health insurance and means tested benefits

Recently, studies found that 2019-nCov and SARS-nCov share the same receptor, ACE2. In this study, we analyzed five large-scale bulk transcriptomic datasets of normal lung tissue and two single-cell transcriptomic datasets to investigate the disparities related to race, age, gender and smoking status in ACE2 gene expression and its distribution among cell types. We didn't find significant disparities in ACE2 gene expression between racial groups (Asian vs Caucasian), age groups (&gt;60 vs &lt;60) or gender groups (male vs female). However, we observed significantly higher ACE2 gene expression in former smoker's lung compared to non-smoker's lung. Also, we found higher ACE2 gene expression in Asian current smokers compared to non-smokers but not in Caucasian current smokers, which may indicate an existence of gene-smoking interac...","Background: So far, the psychological impact of COVID-19 epidemic among family members of Health care workers (HCWs) in China has been neglected. The present cross-sectional study aimed to investigate the mental health status and related factors of families of HCWs in Designated Hospitals in Ningbo, China. Method: Family members of HCWs working in five designated hospitals in Ningbo, China were recruited between February 10th and 20th, 2020. Information on demographic variables, the COVID-19-related events in the lives, knowledge of COVID-19 and the working status of family members (that is, HCWs) was collected using online self-administered questionnaires. The mental health status were assessed using the Chinese version of Patient Health Questionnare-9 (PHQ-9) and Chinese version of Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7 ). Multivariable logistic regression analyses were conducted to identify the main factors associated with the mental health conditions. Results: A total of 822 partici...","Abstract Farmers attempting to reduce first-calving age (FCA) need to understand which rearing management factors influence FCA and first-lactation milk production (FLP). Reduced FCA might be associated with lower FLP. This study describes the association between herd FCA, FLP, and several herd-level health and rearing management variables and describes the association between FCA and FLP at the cow level. It uses data from a 2010 survey of 100 Dutch dairy farms about general management, colostrum and milk feeding, housing, cleanliness, healthcare, disease, and breeding. It also used available data on FCA and 305-d FLP at both cow and herd level. The associations between median FCA and median FLP of the herd and herd-level health and rearing management variables were determined using multivariate regression analysis. The median FCA was associated with minimum age of first insemination, feeding of waste milk, and the amount of milk given preweaning. The median FLP was associated with me...","Objective: To compare the difference of SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody between male and female COVID-19 patients and figure out a possible explanation for different outcome between male and female patients. Methods: A total number of 331 patients confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were enrolled. The plasma of these patients were collected during hospitalization and were detected for SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody. Afterwards, the difference of IgG antibody between male and female patients was analyzed. Results: The level of IgG antibody in mild, general and recovering patients showed on difference between male and female. In severe status, the average IgG antibody level in female patients tended to be higher than that of in male patients. Compared with male patients, most of the female patients generated a relatively high level of SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody in severe status. In addition, the generation of IgG antibody in female tended to be stronger than male patients in disease early phase. Conclusions: T...","Abstract Certification programs have been developed to provide plant material that meets a predetermined level of plant health. The primary objectives of these programs are to limit pathogen incidence in plant material in order to minimize losses by growers and prevent movement of harmful pests and pathogens that may harm the environment. For many fruit and nut crops, orchards are expected to remain productive for years or decades; thus, starting with plants of high health status is essential. The components of certification programs in terms of plant health will be outlined, along with the benefits of harmonizing these programs where possible to facilitate plant movement without increasing trade in plant pathogens.","Abstract Zoonotic viral infections represent an important public health problem across the globe. Unlike infectious agents that are limited to humans, the presence of domestic and wild animal reservoirs and insect and arthropod vectors greatly complicate transmission dynamics and make control measures very difficult to implement. Some viral zoonoses are categorized as \u201cemerging infectious diseases\u201d because they are newly recognized or have shown significant changes in their geographic range and/or epidemiologic characteristics. This article provides updated information on the current status of the most important viral zoonotic diseases. The recent upsurge in Ebola virus infections in West Africa and the emergence of Zika virus in the Western Hemisphere are highlighted.","The present status of COVID\u201519 is analyzed and the end of the disease is forecasted. The peak of the epidemic is different in three regions, Wuhan, Hubei province except Wuhan, and mainland China except Hubei. In two regions except Wuhan, the peak of the epidemic passed ten days ago. If the trend until February 11 does not change, the disease may end by the end of February. In Wuhan, the epidemic reached a peak but the reported number of newly infected patients fluctuates largely. We need to know the reason for the big fluctuation to forecast the end of the disease.","Protection of healthcare workforce is of paramount relevance for the care of infected and non-infected patients in the setting of a pandemic such as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Healthcare workers are at increased risk to become infected because of contact to infected patients, infected co-workers and their community outside the hospital. The ideal organisational strategy to protect the healthcare workforce in a situation in which social distancing cannot be maintained at the workplace remains to be determined. In this study, we have mathematically modelled strategies for the employment of hospital workforce with the goal to simulate health and productivity of the workers. Therefore, deterministic models were extended to account for stochastic influences potentially occurring in rather small populations. The models were also designed to determine if desynchronization of medical teams by dichotomizing the workers may protect the workforce. Our studies model workforce productivit...","Exotic and emerging viral pathogens associated with high morbidity and mortality in humans are being identified annually with recent examples including Lujo virus in southern Africa, Severe Fever with Thrombocytopenia Syndrome virus in China and a SARS-like coronavirus in the Middle East. The sporadic nature of these infections hampers our understanding of these diseases and limits the opportunities to design appropriate medical countermeasures against them. Because of this, animal models are utilized to gain insight into the pathogenesis of disease with the overall goal of identifying potential targets for intervention and evaluating specific therapeutics and vaccines. For these reasons it is imperative that animal models of disease recapitulate the human condition as closely as possible in order to provide the best predictive data with respect to the potential efficacy in humans. In this article we review the current status of disease models for highly pathogenic and emerging viral p...","","Background The epidemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 was first reported in Wuhan, China, and now is spreading worldwide. The Chinese government responded to this epidemic with multiple public health policies including locking down the city of Wuhan, establishing multiple temporary hospitals, and prohibiting public gathering events. Here, we constructed a new real-time status dynamic model of SEIO (MH) to reveal the influence of national public health policies and to model the epidemic in Wuhan. Methods A real-time status dynamic model was proposed to model the population of Wuhan in status Susceptible (S), Exposed (E), Infected with symptoms (I), with Medical care (M), and Out of the system (O) daily. Model parameters were fitted according to the daily report of new infections from Jan. 27th, 2020 to Feb. 2nd, 2020. Using the fitted parameters, the epidemic under different conditions was simulated and compared with the current situation. Finding According to our study, the first patient is mos...","","Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) has recently emerged in the Middle East. Since 2012, there have been approximately 2,100 confirmed cases, with a 35% case fatality rate. Disease severity has been linked to patient health status, as people with chronic diseases or an immunocompromised status fare worse, although the mechanisms of disease have yet to be elucidated. We used the rhesus macaque model of mild MERS to investigate whether the immune response plays a role in the pathogenicity in relation to MERS-CoV shedding. Immunosuppressed macaques were inoculated with MERS-CoV and sampled daily for 6 days to assess their immune statues and to measure viral shedding and replication. Immunosuppressed macaques supported significantly higher levels of MERS-CoV replication in respiratory tissues and shed more virus, and virus disseminated to tissues outside of the respiratory tract, whereas viral RNA was confined to respiratory tissues in non-immunosuppressed animals. Desp...","Abstract The election of Tsai Ing-wen as President of the Republic of China (Taiwan) in 2016 reignited Beijing's quest to poach Taiwan's diplomatic allies. Between her election in January 2016 and reelection in January 2020, Taiwan has lost seven countries to China. After eight years of a \u201cdiplomatic truce\u201d under President Ma Ying-jeou, China re-started its multi-pronged strategy to pressure Taiwan into eventual unification, and one of the key tactics is to poach all of Taiwan's now-15 remaining diplomatic allies to eliminate its international legitimacy. This article seeks to explain what, if any, benefits formal diplomatic relations provide Taiwan and the ways in which Beijing induces countries to switch ties. It concludes by providing recommendations for what actions the United States can undertake to slow the impending completion of the \u201crace to zero.\u201d","Abstract Background After the declaration of COVID-19 pandemic on March 11th, 2020, local transmission chains starting in different countries including Canada are forcing governments to take decisions on public health interventions to mitigate the spread of the epidemic. Methods We conduct data-driven and model-free estimations for the growth rates of the COVID-19 epidemics in Italy and Canada, by fitting an exponential curve to the daily reported cases. We use these estimates to predict epidemic trends in Canada under different scenarios of public health interventions. Results In Italy, the initial growth rate (0.22) has reduced to 0.1 two weeks after the lockdown of the country on March 8th, 2020. This corresponds to an increase of the doubling time from about 3.15 to almost 7 days. In comparison, the growth rate in Canada has increased from 0.13 between March 1st and 13th, to 0.25 between March 13th to 22nd. This current growth rate corresponds to a doubling time of 2.7 days, and th...","During the current COVID-19 pandemic, testing kit and RNA extraction kit availability has become a major limiting factor in the ability to determine patient disease status and accurately quantify prevalence. Current testing strategies rely on individual tests of cases matching restrictive diagnostic criteria to detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA, limiting testing of asymptomatic and mild cases. Testing these individuals is one effective way to understand and reduce the spread of COVID-19. Here, we develop a pooled testing strategy to identify these low-risk individuals. Drawing on the well-studied group testing literature, modeling suggests practical changes to testing protocols which can reduce test costs and stretch a limited test kit supply. When most tests are negative, pooling reduces the total number of tests up to four-fold at 2% prevalence and eight-fold at 0.5% prevalence. At current SARS-CoV-2 prevalence, randomized group testing optimized per country could double the number of tested ind...","Despite major advances in epidemic preparedness, Africa remains uniquely susceptible to novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). According to the Infectious Disease Vulnerability Index,1 22 of the 25 countries most susceptible to an infectious disease outbreak are in Africa. The high prevalence of HIV, tuberculosis, and other pathogens might potentiate the severity of COVID-19 and contribute to diagnostic uncertainty. Health-care systems and human resources are already spread thin. And although the young age of the population (with more than half aged younger than 20 years) might prove protective, it also means that Africa has much to lose in terms of disability-adjusted life years. On Feb 27, 2020, the first case of COVID-19 in sub-Saharan Africa was reported in Nigeria, making spread in the region more probable.2 While preparing a response to COVID-19 outbreak in Uganda, we read Jinnong Zhang and colleagues' work with great interest.3 We commend the authors for distilling complex i...","Abstract The pandemic of new coronavirus disease COVID-19 is threatening our health, economy and life style. Collaborations across countries and sectors as a One Health World could be a milestone. We propose a general protocol, for setting timely active random surveillance of COVID-19, at the human community level, with systematic repeated detection efforts. Strengths and limitations are discussed. If considered applicable by public health, the protocol could evaluate the status of COVID-19 epidemics consistently and objectively.","Abstract Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a highly infectious disease caused by a novel coronavirus, and has become pandemic within a short period of time. Imaging plays an important role in the diagnosis, management and follow-up of patients with SARS. The current status of imaging in SARS is presented in this review.","Abstract The 90kDa ribosomal S6 kinases (p90RSKs) are a family of broadly expressed serine/threonine kinases with two kinase domains activated by extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase in response to many growth factors. Our recent study demonstrated that severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-coronavirus (CoV) infection of monkey kidney Vero E6 cells induces phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of signaling pathways, resulting in apoptosis. In the present study, we investigated the phosphorylation status of p90RSK, which is a well-known substrate of these signaling pathways, in SARS-CoV-infected cells. Vero E6 mainly expressed p90RSK1 and showed weak expression of p90RSK2. In the absence of viral infection, Ser221 in the N-terminal kinase domain was phosphorylated constitutively, whereas both Thr573 in the C-terminal kinase domain and Ser380 between the two kinase domains were not phosphorylated in confluent cells. Ser380, which has been reported to be involved in autophosph...","Background With evidence of sustained transmission in more than 190 countries, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been declared a global pandemic. As such, data are urgently needed about risk factors associated with clinical outcomes. Methods A retrospective chart review of 323 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in Wuhan was conducted. Patients were classified into three disease severity groups (non-severe, severe, and critical), based on their initial clinical presentation. Clinical outcomes were designated as favorable and unfavorable, based on disease progression and response to treatments. Logistic regression models were performed to identify factors associated with clinical outcomes, and logrank test was conducted for the association with clinical progression. Results Current standard treatments did not show significant improvement on patient outcomes in the study. By univariate logistic regression model, 27 risk factors were significantly associated with clinical outcomes. ...","Background What are the health and wellbeing conditions of people during the COVID-19 outbreak in China? The epidemiological reports now focus on the confirmed COVID-19 cases, and we aim to assess the health and wellbeing of normal adults living and working after one month of public health emergencies into the COVID-19 outbreak in China. Methods One month into the outbreak, on Feb 20/21, 2020, we sampled 369 adults on the eight dimensions of health (SF12), distress (K6), and life satisfaction in 64 cities that varied in their densities of coronavirus confirmed cases. The participants also reported their work status, whether they had chronic health issues, the number of hours they exercised per day in the past week. Findings In general, life of normal adults was severely disrupted. 33% of the participants had not left their home at all during the one-month period due to the restrictive measures to contain COVID-19 in China. 27% of the participants worked at office; 38% resorted to worki...","Abstract The people of rural and periurban India depend on backyard farming system for poultry meat and eggs. It is used by weaker sections of society, such as marginal farmers as insurance against crop failure, for ready cash and to ensure basic economic returns and the empowerment of women and children. However, backyard farming does not appear to be a promising strategy to achieve the poverty reduction until the production level is increased. The major constraint in increasing the production in backyard birds is microbial infection due to lack of biosecurity knowledge among the farmers. The mitigation of the microbial infection depends on the detection of the infection route and its prevention. The source of microbial infection (Salmonella, Escherichia coli) and their dissemination through the eggs in backyard flocks kept in different agroclimatic zones of West Bengal, a major egg producing state in India, was identified. The pattern of virulence gene specially associated with urina...","Importance: Risk factors associated with COVID-19, the viral pneumonia originating in Wuhan, China, in Dec 2019, require clarification so that medical resources can be prioritized for those at highest risk of severe COVID-19 complications. Infection with M. tuberculosis (MTB), the pathogen that causes TB and latently infects ~25% of the global population, may be a risk factor for SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe COVID-19 pneumonia. Objective: To determine if latent or active TB increase susceptibility to SARS-COV-19 infection and disease severity, and lead to more rapid development of COVID-19 pneumonia. Design: An observational case-control study of 36 confirmed COVID-19 cases from Shenyang, China, conducted in Feb 2020. Final date of follow-up: Feb 29, 2020. Cases were grouped according to COVID-19 pneumonia severity (mild/moderate, severe/critical), and MTB infection status compared. Comparisons were made with MTB infection data from another case-control study on bacterial/viral pneu...","This paper deals with an advanced analytical epidemic diffusion model which is capable to predict the status of epidemic impacts. This newly propose model well describes an epidemic growth and it could be widely applied into various topics including pathology, epidemiology, business and data sciences. The Advanced Analytical Epidemic Diffusion Model (AAEDM) is a dynamic diffusion prediction model which is theoretically intuitive and its tractable closed formula could be easily adapted into versatile Bigdata driven analytics including the machine learning system. This dynamic model is still an analytical model but the periods of prediction are segmented for adapting the values from the dataset when the data is available. The epidemiologically vital parameters which effect on the AAEDM are also introduced in this paper. The evaluation of this theoretical model based on the Covid-19 data in Korea has been accomplished with relative fair future prediction accuracies. Although this analytic...","Objective To determine the correlation between menstruation status/sex hormones and prognosis of COVID-19, and to identify potential protective factors for female patients. Design, Setting, and Participants A cross-sectional study of COVID-19 patients who were hospitalized at Tongji and Mobile Cabin Hospitals from Jan 28, 2020 to March 8, 2020. Sex differences in severity and composite endpoints (admission to intensive care unit (ICU), use of mechanical ventilation, or death) of COVID-19 patients were compared. The correlation analysis and cox/logistic regression modeling of menstruation status/sex hormones and prognosis were conducted. Correlation between cytokines related to immunity and inflammation and disease severity or estradiol (E2) was revealed.Results Chi square test indicated significant differences in distribution of composite endpoints (p&lt;0.01) and disease severity (p=0.05) between male and female patients (n=1902). 435 female COVID-19 patients with menstruation records we...","Summary The harrowing picture of emaciated terminally ill AIDS patients is a reminder of our lack of understanding of immunological mechanisms that normally control opportunistic infections. Many gastrointestinal pathogens in patients with AIDS are resistant to treatment and lead inexorably to weight loss and death. Although knowledge of the pathogenesis and clinical significance of weight loss has improved considerably, this has not yet led to a sustained effort to improve nutritional status during early stages of disease.","PURPOSE: This study represents the current epidemiological status of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) worldwide in the first three months of 2019. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Full details of the MERS-CoV cases available and published in the disease outbreak news on the WHO website were retrieved. Related details of laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV were extracted and analyzed by standard statistical methods. RESULTS: A total of 107 cases of MERS-CoV, including 18 deaths (overall case fatality rate (CFR), 16.8%; male-specific CFR was 17.5% [14/80] and female-specific CFR was 14.8% [4/27]) were reported to WHO from the National International Health Regulation Focal Points of Saudi Arabia and Oman. The overall mean age was 50\u00b117 years and 80 patients (74.8%) were male. The average time from the onset of the symptoms to the first hospitalization was 3\u00b13.3 days; from the first hospitalization to laboratory confirmation was 3.6\u00b16.5 days; from the onset of symptom to death was 17...","Background:Patients with the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) have different degrees of psychological pain, such as anxiety and depression, which may related to their prognosis. Psychological intervention can be conducted in different ways to improve psychological pain and improve the treatment effect. Objective:The present study aimed to investigate and analyze the psychological status of patients with COVID-19 during the course of illness, and to evaluate the effect and influencing factors of psychological crisis intervention, so as to explore the effective mode of clinical psychological intervention in acute patients under isolation environment. Methods:A total of 143 persons participated in the study, including 26 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 in the isolation ward (COVID-19 group), 87 patients with general pneumonia in the observation ward (General Pneumonia group) and 30 healthy volunteers (Normal group). All the patients in the ward received comprehensive psychological int...","Abstract Purpose The purpose of the study was (1) to identify the requirements for syndromic, disease surveillance and epidemiology systems arising from events such as the SARS outbreak in March 2003, and the deliberate spread of Bacillus anthracis, or anthrax, in the US in 2001; and (2) to use these specifications as input to the construction of a system intended to meet these requirements. An important goal was to provide information about the diffusion of a communicable disease without being dependent on centralised storage of information about individual patients or revealing patient-identifiable information. Methods The method applied is rooted in the engineering paradigm involving phases of analysis, system specification, design, implementation, and testing. The requirements were established from earlier projects\u2019 conclusions and analysis of disease outbreaks. The requirements were validated by a literature study of syndromic and disease surveillance systems. The system was teste...","From geographic mapping at different scales to location-based alerting services, geoinformatics plays an important role in the study and control of global outbreaks like severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). This paper reviews several geographic mapping efforts of SARS on the Internet that employ a variety of techniques like choropleth rendering, graduated circles, graduated pie charts, buffering, overlay analysis and animation. The aim of these mapping services is to educate the public (especially travellers to potentially at-risk areas) and assist public health authorities in analysing the spatial and temporal trends and patterns of SARS and in assessing/revising current control measures.","BACKGROUND: A novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) causing an outbreak of pneumonia in Wuhan, Hubei province of China was isolated in January 2020. This study aims to investigate its epidemiologic history, and analyzed the clinical characteristics, treatment regimens, and prognosis of patients infected with 2019-nCoV during this outbreak. METHODS: Clinical data from 137 2019-nCoV-infected patients admitted to the respiratory departments of nine tertiary hospitals in Hubei province from December 30, 2019 to January 24, 2020 were collected, including general status, clinical manifestations, laboratory test results, imaging characteristics, and treatment regimens. RESULTS: None of the 137 patients (61 males, 76 females, aged 20-83 years, mean age 55 \u00b1 16 years) had a definite history of exposure to Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market. Major initial symptoms included fever (112/137, 81.8%), coughing (66/137, 48.2%), and muscle pain or fatigue (44/137, 32.1%), with other, less typical initial symptoms...","Zoonotic viruses that emerge from wildlife and domesticated animals pose a serious threat to human and animal health. In many instances, mouse models have improved our understanding of the human immune response to infection; however, when dealing with emerging zoonotic diseases, they may be of limited use. This is particularly the case when the model fails to reproduce the disease status that is seen in the natural reservoir, transmission species or human host. In this Review, we discuss how researchers are placing more emphasis on the study of the immune response to zoonotic infections in the natural reservoir hosts and spillover species. Such studies will not only lead to a greater understanding of how these infections induce variable disease and immune responses in distinct species but also offer important insights into the evolution of mammalian immune systems. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The online version of this article (doi:10.1038/nri3551) contains supplementary material, which...","Abstract This chapter provides an overview of the basic theory of early warning for infectious diseases, including definitions of surveillance, early warning and prediction; the characteristics of early warning (surveillance, information for action, timeliness, insufficiency, and the uncertainty of information); a conceptual framework of an early warning system for infectious diseases (the target setting, data collection and analysis, disseminating early warning signals, response actions, and evaluation); classifying early warning based on the data sources (case-based, event-based, laboratory-based, or syndromic surveillance). The significance of early warning for infectious diseases, the status quo and research and application trends in the field are also highlighted.","Since the emergence of the first cases in Wuhan, China, the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection has been quickly spreading out to other provinces and neighboring countries. Estimation of the basic reproduction number by means of mathematical modeling can be helpful for determining the potential and severity of an outbreak and providing critical information for identifying the type of disease interventions and intensity. A deterministic compartmental model was devised based on the clinical progression of the disease, epidemiological status of the individuals, and intervention measures. The estimations based on likelihood and model analysis show that the control reproduction number may be as high as 6.47 (95% CI 5.71\u20137.23). Sensitivity analyses show that interventions, such as intensive contact tracing followed by quarantine and isolation, can effectively reduce the control reproduction number and transmission risk, with the effect of travel restriction adopted by Wuhan on 2019-nCoV ...","Abstract The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is derived from Wuhan city, Hubei province of China, has spread quickly in 72 countries to date. COVID-19 is caused by a novel coronavirus SARS-CoV2, previously 2019-nCoV. At present, the newly identified SARS-CoV2 has caused a large number of deaths with tens of thousands of confirmed cases worldwide, posing a serious threat to public health. However, there are no clinically approved vaccines or specific therapeutic drugs available for COVID-19. Intensive research on the newly emerged COVID-19 is urgently needed to elucidate their pathogenic mechanisms and epidemiological characteristics, and to identify potential drug targets, which will contribute to the development of effective prevention and treatment strategies. Hence, this review will focus on recent progress regarding the structure of SARS-CoV2 and characteristics of COVID-19, such as etiology, pathogenesis and epidemiological characteristics.","Prolonged viral shedding is associated with severe status and poor prognosis of COVID-19 patients. Unexpectedly, here we report a non-severe patient with the longest duration of viral shedding. According to the investigation on the clinical and epidemiological information of this case, we concluded that this type of virus might have a low toxicity and transmissibility, but have a prolonged infective ability and was hardly to be eliminated in the body with regular therapy. However, infusion of plasma from recovered patients showed high efficiency in elimination of this virus. Our findings might shed light on the management of COVID-19.","","Abstract The severe 2019 outbreak of novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), which was first reported in Wuhan, would be expected to impact the mental health of local medical and nursing staff and thus lead them to seek help. However, those outcomes have yet to be established using epidemiological data. To explore the mental health status of medical and nursing staff and the efficacy, or lack thereof, of critically connecting psychological needs to receiving psychological care, we conducted a quantitative study. This is the first paper on the mental health of medical and nursing staff in Wuhan. Notably, among 994 medical and nursing staff working in Wuhan, 36.9% had subthreshold mental health disturbances (mean PHQ-9: 2.4), 34.4% had mild disturbances (mean PHQ-9: 5.4), 22.4% had moderate disturbances (mean PHQ-9: 9.0), and 6.2% had severe disturbance (mean PHQ-9: 15.1) in the immediate wake of the viral epidemic. The noted burden fell particularly heavily on young women. Of all particip...","Background Emergency school closures are often used as public health interventions during infectious disease outbreaks in an attempt to minimise the spread of infection. However, if children continue to mix with others outside the home during the closures, these measures are unlikely to be effective. Objectives This review aimed to summarise existing literature on children's activities and contacts made outside the home during unplanned school closures. Methods We searched four databases from inception to February 2020 for relevant literature. Main findings were extracted. Results 3,343 citations were screened and 19 included in the review. Activities and social contacts appeared to decrease during closures but contact was still common. All studies reported children leaving the house or being looked after by non-household members. There was some evidence that older child age and parental disagreement with closure were predictive of children leaving the house, and mixed evidence regardi...","Abstract Health planning and policy seek to create a group of mutually interacting bodies to produce goods and services to meet the health needs of a population. Recent developments in the health status of the population are characterized by continuous improvement in life expectancy, chronic diseases which absorb 90% of total health care expenditure, differences in the causes of mortality (more than 70% mortality from cancer, heart and brain, and external causes). The new trends in health indicators define the current health policies and lead to the necessity of adapting the health system so as to meet the changing health needs of the population. Especially in the context of the changes in the epidemiological spectrum and the variability in the indices of morbidity and mortality, the focus is not only to further prolong life expectancy but also to improve life expectancy without chronic diseases and without disabilities and to reduce the avoidable mortality, the potential years of life...","This article reviews the current epidemiology and clinical presentation of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection and describes the preparedness plan of several countries. The MERS-CoV was first reported in 2012 and has since infected more than 1600 patients in 26 countries, mostly in Saudi Arabia and the Middle East. The epidemiology of the infection is compatible with multiple introductions of the virus into humans from an animal reservoir, probably dromedary camels. The clinical presentation ranges from no symptoms to severe pneumonitis and respiratory failure. Most confirmed cases so far were part of MERS-CoV clusters in hospital settings, affecting mainly middle-aged men and patients with a chronic disease or immuno-suppressed status. There is no vaccine or anti-viral medication available. Viral epidemics can occur anywhere in today\u2019s \u201cglobal village\u201d. MERS-CoV is a relatively new virus, and this work is intended to add to the still-sparse data on its ep...","Abstract An emerging infectious disease (EID) is defined as a disease caused by a pathogen that has not been observed previously within a population or geographic location. Viruses are a major cause of EIDs, particularly \u2212ssRNA viruses. Many variables are involved in the emergence or reemergence of viruses. These can be classified into human factors, environmental/ecological factors, and viral factors and include urbanization, globalization, weather and climate change, and the genetic composition of the virus. The great majority of emerging viral diseases are zoonoses, notably transmitted by arthropods and nonhuman mammals. Flaviviruses include several notable vector-transmitted viruses, while rodents and bats are thought to be the natural reservoirs of arenaviruses and filoviruses, respectively. This chapter discusses several notable outbreaks of emerging and reemerging viruses, including the 2014\u201315 outbreak of Ebolavirus in West Africa.","","Unprecedented measures have been adopted to control the rapid spread of the ongoing COVID-19 epidemic in China. People's adherence to control measures is affected by their knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) towards COVID-19. In this study, we investigated Chinese residents' KAP towards COVID-19 during the rapid rise period of the outbreak. An online sample of Chinese residents was successfully recruited via the authors' networks with residents and popular media in Hubei, China. A self-developed online KAP questionnaire was completed by the participants. The knowledge questionnaire consisted of 12 questions regarding the clinical characteristics and prevention of COVID-19. Assessments on residents' attitudes and practices towards COVID-19 included questions on confidence in winning the battle against COVID-19 and wearing masks when going out in recent days. Among the survey completers (n=6910), 65.7% were women, 63.5% held a bachelor degree or above, and 56.2% engaged in mental l...","COVID-19 is now widely spreading around the world as a global pandemic, whereas it had been effecitvely under control in China by March 15. In this report, we estimate the global tendency of COVID-19 and analyze the associated global epidemic risk, given that the status quo is continued without further measures being taken. The results show that the global R_0, excluding China, is estimated to be 2.63 (95% CI: 1.67 - 4.69). Seven countries, including Italy and Republic of Korea, have peak values over 10,000. And the peak arrival time of all these countries is after May 12, 2020 (95 % CI: April 1, 2020 - June 24, 2020). We predict that there are four regional clusters of the outbreak: Southeast Asia extending southward to Oceania, the Middle East, Western Europe and North America. Among them, Western Europe will become the major center of the outbreak. The peak values in Spain and Italy are estimated to be 232,661 and 108,062, respectively. The total number of peak values in Europe will...","The response to the novel coronavirus outbreak in China suggests that many of the lessons from the 2003 SARS epidemic have been implemented and the response improved as a consequence. Nevertheless some questions remain and not all lessons have been successful. The national and international response demonstrates the complex link between public health, science and politics when an outbreak threatens to impact on global economies and reputations. The unprecedented measures implemented in China are a bold attempt to control the outbreak \u2013 we need to understand their effectiveness to balance costs and benefits for similar events in the future.","Much of the uncertainty about the progression of the COVID-19 pandemic stems from questions about when and how non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPI) by governments, in particular social distancing measures, are implemented, to what extent the population complies with these measures, and how compliance changes through time. Further uncertainty comes from a lack of knowledge of the potential effects of removing interventions once the epidemic is declining. By combining an epidemiological model of COVID-19 for the United Kingdom with simple sub-models for these societal processes, this study aims to shed light on the conceivable trajectories that the pandemic might follow over the next 1.5 years. We show strong improvements in outcomes if governments review NPI more frequently whereas, in comparison, the stability of compliance has surprisingly small effects on cumulative mortality.
