They provide myriad benefits, like enabling would-be patients to live longer, healthier lives (33, 34) , and bearing yet-undervalued gains in productivity and positive externalities to society at large (35) (36) (37) . Although the low price of vaccines is meant to benefit individuals and regions with lower incomes, in the long run, it has had the opposite effect, causing them to be medically underserved due to a lack of vaccine investment. Pharmaceutical companies and investors are directing their resources to projects in which the estimated return on investment is more predictable and lucrative. Vaccine prices are currently set far below the prices of drugs that treat other serious conditions, such as cancer, despite the enormous societal value of vaccines in general, and those to ensure global health security in particular.","The remarkable ability of infectious agents to adapt to new environments and exploit the susceptibilities of their hosts will continue to complicate and obstruct eff orts for their control. In the USA, the largest gains will be achieved through focused eff orts to reduce high burden and high consequence diseases and to strengthen eff orts to promote early detection of and rapid response to emerging infections. Priorities for these eff orts include prevention measures with broad-reaching eff ects such as vaccines, multifaceted approaches to decrease antimicrobial resistance, and testing and education to reduce the further spread of preventable infections. In addition, new opportunities for control of infectious disease are envisioned through US health reforms, which are expanding access to care and improving health-care coordination for many underserved populations.","Societal disruption measures could include outcomes such as the overall duration of time that the intervention needs to be to achieve the associated reductions in morbidity and mortality. A challenge for pandemic response using NPIs is that, in a fully susceptible population, although NPIs may slow disease transmission while they are in place, once the intervention is lifted (or compliance with the intervention becomes low), the transmission of the pathogen rebounds rapidly (10, 12) . In the case of COVID-19, it may not be possible to minimize morbidity and mortality, and societal and economic disruption at the same time.","In December 2019, a cluster of pneumonia cases caused by a novel coronavirus were identified in Wuhan, China. In the months since, the now-termed COVID-19 pandemic has rapidly spread around the world, leading to hundreds of thousands of cases in over 160 countries [1] . The first evidence of community spread of SARS-Cov-2, the virus which causes COVID-19, in the United States appeared in February 2020. Since then, there have been widespread workplace, school, and business closures to dampen transmission [2] . Preceding this widespread policy response, individuals, informed by massive media coverage, engaged in voluntary behaviors such as increased handwashing and social distancing [3] . Such non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) are known 1 to play a significant role in diminishing transmission, and are expected to be particularly important against SARS-Cov-2 as the virus appears to transmit for up to two weeks before symptoms appear [4] . Indeed, NPIs have been very e\u21b5ective in reducing the potential number of COVID-19 cases in China [5, 6] . As the COVID-19 outbreak unfolds, it is important to empirically understand the e\u21b5ects of NPIs on infection spread, and characterize the potential interaction between COVID-19 and other circulating respiratory infections. As the spread of COVID-19 in the United States has been temporally coincidental with the influenza season, and both infections share the same transmission pathways and NPIs, we focus on influenza as a case study.","is the (which was not peer-reviewed) The copyright holder for this preprint . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.03.20029843 doi: medRxiv preprint help policy makers assess the potential benefits and costs of NPIs to contain COVID-19 outbreaks. Some previous studies have preliminarily explored the lockdown of Wuhan, [25] [26] [27] travel restrictions, 28-30 airport screening, 31, 32 and the isolation of cases and contact tracing for containing virus transmission, respectively. 33, 34 The conclusions of these studies are persuasive, there are still key knowledge gaps on the effectiveness of different interventions. 15 To fully justify the preparation, implementation, or cancellation of various NPIs, policy makers across the World need evidence as to the combination and timings of each, which remains lacking.","We suggest that the link between increased risk perception and decreased disease transmission is heightened protective behaviors through non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs). This conjecture is supported by past studies that have shown that risk perception is a strong predictor of preventative health behaviors [21] . However, the timing of this e\u21b5ect (early to mid February) is important to consider. The decrease in the observed US ILI peak occurred before widespread closures of public spaces and implementation of social distancing to mitigate COVID-19 transmission. Our results could indicate that the use of personal NPIs such as handwashing and voluntary social distancing may have been occurring before policy changes took place in March 2020. In a survey conducted in early February 2020, US respondents rated their risk perception of COVID-19 as a median score of 5 out of 10, and more than 90% of participants were aware of infection prevention measures [22] . Our mechanistic model suggests that an average of 5% reduction in transmission likelihood could result in the ILI dynamics observed of the 2019-2020 season. Past studies have shown that frequent, e\u21b5ective handwashing can result in a comparable moderate reduction in infections [23, 24, 25] . A meta-analysis of the e\u21b5ects of NPIs in reducing influenza transmission demonstrated that hand hygiene was significant in reducing influenza transmission, with an odds ratio of 0.62 [26] .","the lockdown was about 80%, with respect to a baseline set on January 1, 2020 (18) . Such level of social distancing was sufficient to achieve control of COVID-19. We can not tell yet for how long the observed reductions in mobility and social mixing in Italy will be sustained, and whether they will prove sufficient to contain the COVID-19 outbreak. However, our findings indicate that real-time monitoring of mobility changes following NPIs is feasible through the analysis of deidentified geo-positioning data and it might be used to guide intervention policy over the course of the outbreak.","As of February 28, 2020 the COVID-19 outbreak has caused 78,961 confirmed cases (2791 deaths) across China, with the majority seen in Wuhan City, and 4691 cases (67 deaths) reported in the other 51 countries. 1 Further spread has occurred to all populated continents of the World, with many anticipating that a pandemic is approaching. 2, 3 As an emerging disease, effective pharmaceutical interventions are not expected to be available for months, 4 and healthcare resources will be limited for treating all cases. Nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) are therefore essential components of the public health response to outbreaks. 1, [5] [6] [7] These include isolating ill persons, contact tracing, quarantine of exposed persons, travel restrictions, school and workplace closures, and cancellation of mass gathering events. [5] [6] [7] These containment measures aim to reduce transmission, thereby delaying the timing and reducing the size of the epidemic peak, buying time for preparations in the healthcare system, and enabling the potential for vaccines and drugs to be used later on. 5 For example, social distancing measures have been effective in past influenza epidemics by curbing human-to-human transmission and reducing morbidity and mortality. [8] [9] [10] Three major NPIs have been taken to mitigate the spread and reduce the outbreak size of COVID-19 across China. 11, 12 First, inter-city travel bans or restrictions have been taken to prevent further seeding the virus during the","In a recent editorial titled 'Epidemic science in real time', Fineberg and Wilson underscored the critical importance of 'conducting the right science and communicating expert judgment' to 'enable policies to be adjusted appropriately as an epidemic scenario unfolds' [44]. They emphasized that in times of diminishing public health resources, scientists from diverse disciplines - epidemiology, laboratory, social sciences - must work together to respond to immediate threats and follow through with research to understand key attributes of the affected populations and the disease process. The results of such research are needed to inform policy, to develop treatments and interventions, and to update and adjust recommendations as the state of knowledge changes.","Once the disease arrives into a given region, city, or municipality, containment measures are at first, limited to behavioral changes called non-pharmaceutical interventions or NPIs, directed essentially to diminish transmission by reducing contact between people. In order to model this, we modify system (15) to include a variable contact rate\u03b2 k (t), and omit migratory phenomena (see Appendix D for the model equations).","Changes in compliance : The literature indicates that overall compliance with NPI can decline through time but that changes are complex and difficult to predict. Besides, one should not assume compliance behaviour to decay uniformly throughout society since some sections of society will cease complying more easily and faster than others. To represent these effects and their intrinsic uncertainty, we superimpose the immediate effects of policy responses on d t with a random walk with drift for ln( d t ) with dynamics that slow down as d t approaches zero. Specifically we set d t+ 1 = min[1, d t+ \u00bd exp( -d t+ \u00bd \u03b4 ) ], where \u03b4 is a normally distributed random number with mean \u03bc = 1/120 and standard deviation \u03c3 = 1/30. This parameterization implies substantial compliance decline over a six-months period, but highly unpredictable change in compliance on the time scale of 1-2 months. We also consider the effect of varying the speed of compliance decline \u03bc.","Respiratory infections are the leading cause of death in low-or middle-income countries (LMICs) and account for an estimated four million deaths annually [1] . Before the recent emergence of SARS-CoV-2, much research focused on influenza, which causes worldwide annual epidemics of seasonal resulting in 3 to 5 million cases of severe illness, and approximately 250,000 to 500,000 deaths [2] . In the US, influenza causes on average of 226,000 hospitalizations and 3,000 to 49, 000 deaths each year [3, 4] . Control of influenza in children is an acute public health problem because attack rates (i.e., the proportion of the population infected) in unvaccinated children are estimated to average 12.7% [5] and exceed 30% during pandemic years [6] . Children also amplify the outbreak as they infect their peers and families, creating greater opportunities for further transmission in the community. [7, 8] For rapidly emerging outbreaks such as novel strains of influenza or SARS-CoV-2, pharmaceutical measures may be unavailable or less effective, and non-pharmaceutical intervention measures (NPIs) need to be used [9, 10] . NPIs are divided by the World Health Organization into categories of personal protection, social distancing, travel and environment measures [11] . However, when the WHO systematically reviewed all studies supporting each NPI for controlling pandemic influenza, it found gaps in the evidence base for many of the measures [11] . In this study, our goal is to use a computational model to examine the policy of symptom-based isolation -a form of social distancing. Under this NPI, individuals who are showing fever due to a respiratory infection are required to remain in isolation until their symptoms subside, normally followed by an additional period of one day free of fever (or antipyretic medications or steroids). The CDC currently recommends this NPI for controlling pandemic influenza and controlling influenza in schools [12, 13] . The buffer period of 1 day helps reduce transmission by keeping people in isolation when their fever symptoms temporarily subside. It also prevents transmission from viral shedding that often continues past the last episode of fever [14] . This NPI is often referred to as fever absenteeism or return-to-school policy in the context of schools.","coronavirus case numbers. Given what we know about European and Asian cases, we integrate these countries into our discussion in order to suggest appropriate NPIs for Canadian federal and provincial policymakers. Based on these models and predictions, we also question the reluctance of Canadian policy makers to learn from jurisdictions such as Taiwan and Hong Kong, where the COVID-19 outbreak appears to have been brought under control. 6 These countries have also extensively adopted face masks for the wider public, which along with hand hygiene are demonstrated to be effective against viral spread. 7, 8","The mitigation measures enacted as part of the response to the unfolding COVID-19 pandemic are unprecedented in their breadth and societal burden. A major challenge in this situation is to quantitatively assess in real-time the impact of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) such as mobility restrictions and social distancing, to better understand the ensuing reduction of mobility flows, individual mobility changes, and their impact on contact patterns. A recent study has investigated the effect of NPIs deployed in China to contain the COVID-19 outbreak, finding that some of them, such as early case detection and contact reduction, appear to be the most effective (18) .","The value of d t changes from day to day due to two effects: potential policy interventions imposing or relaxing NPI, and variation of compliance through time. We describe the effect of our sub-model for policy interventions in terms of intermediate values d t +1/2 , which are then modified in our model for compliance change to compute d t+ 1 . Figure 1 suggests that when COVID-19 breaks out, new policy measures are introduced by governments at irregular intervals, about once every three days in countries like Italy and the UK. In simulations, we therefore sampled each day a random number x uniformly distributed between 0 and 1 [notation x~Unif(0, 1)], and allowed d t+ \u00bd to differ from the previous value d t only if x &lt; p , with p = \u2153. In this case, we modelled the decision process leading to potential adjustments of NPI by the following two rules:","The outbreak of COVID-19 posed an emergency of international concern and challenges in the absence of specific therapeutic treatment and vaccine. On March 11, 2020 COVID-19 has been declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO). The nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) are necessary to prevent person-to-person transmission of COVID-19. So far, a series of measurements have been implemented in China.

Considering the delay in case reporting, our approach and findings can provide critical and early evidence for outbreak control decision-making.","On 20 January 2020, the Chinese government revised the law provisions concerning infectious diseases to add the 2019-nCoV as a class B agent (a pathogen that can cause an epidemic outbreak). On the same day, public health officials announced a further revision to classify the novel virus as a class A agent (a pathogen that can cause an epidemic in a short time). Some non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs), including intensive contact tracing followed by quarantine of individuals potentially exposed to the disease, and isolation of infected, symptomatic individuals, were implemented, but their effectiveness during the early stage is questionable. ","To our knowledge, this is the most comprehensive study to date on quantifying the relative effect of different NPIs and their timings for COVID-19 outbreak containment, based on human movement and disease data. Our findings show that NPIs, inter-city travel restrictions, social distancing and contact reductions, as well as early case detection and isolations, have substantially reduced COVID-19 transmission across China, with the effectiveness of different interventions varying. The early detection and isolation of cases was estimated to prevent more infections than travel restrictions and contact reductions, but integrated NPIs would achieve the strongest and most rapid effect. Our findings contribute to improved understanding of integrated NPI measures on COVID-19 containment and can help in tailoring control strategies across contexts.","Chinese health officials posted the full 2019-nCoV genome sequence on January 10, 2020, to inform the development of specific diagnostic tests for this emergent coronavirus (1). Within a week, CDC developed a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments\u2013approved real-time RT-PCR test that can diagnose 2019-nCoV respiratory samples from clinical specimens. On January 24, CDC publicly posted the assay protocol for this test (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-nCoV/lab/index.html). On January 4, 2020, the Food and Drug Administration issued an Emergency Use Authorization to enable emergency use of CDC\u2019s 2019-nCoV Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel. To date, this test has been limited to use at CDC laboratories. This authorization allows the use of the test at any CDC-qualified lab across the country. CDC is working closely with FDA and public health partners, including the American Public Health Laboratories, to rapidly share these tests domestically and internationally through CDC\u2019s International Reagent Resource (https://www.internationalreagentresource.org/). In addition, CDC uploaded the genome of the virus from the first reported cases in the United States to GenBank, the National Institutes of Health genetic sequence database of publicly available DNA sequences (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/). CDC also is growing the virus in cell culture, which is necessary for further studies, including for additional genetic characterization. Once isolated, the virus will be made available through BEI Resources (https://www.beiresources.org/) to assist research efforts.","After further external validation in different countries the model will enable better risk stratification and more targeted management of patients with COVID-19. With the nomogram, this model that is based on readily available parameters can help clinicians to stratify COVID-19 patients on diagnosis to use limited healthcare resources effectively and improve patient outcome.","Data from these sensors can be visualized on separate patient monitors or on the ventilator. During the initial set up, the respiratory rate, PEEP, FiO2 and inspiration:expiration time, and the sum of the VT for both patients is set on the ventilator. Then, the flow control valves can be titrated to provide the desired volume to each patient. The exhaled volume and minute ventilation alarms on the ventilator are set based on the sum of the exhaled tidal volumes from both patients. This alarm will enable the ventilator to notify clinicians in the case of any sudden changes in the volume delivered to each patient (e.g., shunt, occlusion or, disconnection of the endotracheal tube). PEEP valves in each patient's circuit should also be set to the maximum pressure allowable for that patient.

The effectiveness of the two-day policy is maintained even in the presence of 80% vaccine coverage and 50% efficacy. Increasing compliance with the policy from 60% to 75% compliance had a small effect (1-2% decrease in the attack rate) and is not effective without an explicit isolation policy. Measures to increase the attention to symptoms from 67% to 84% attention reduced the attack rate to a median 5% at 0 (this and the following reflect the baseline with no isolation days). Completely cutting off transmission during weekends reduced the attack rate by 16%. Dividing the population into groups of half the normal size reduced the attack rate by 16%. The two-day isolation policy was also found to be effective for large schools.","This pathogen represents a significant challenge for public health, pandemic planning, and healthcare systems. The SARS-CoV-2 virus is highly transmissible (4) (5) (6) (7) . It causes moderate to severe clinical outcomes in approximately 20% of all recognized infected individuals (5, 8, 9) . In the absence of a vaccine, public health responses have focused on the use of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) (10) . These NPIs include: (1) \"case-based\" measures such as testing, contact tracing, isolation, and quarantine, and (2) \"non-case-based\" measures such as reducing the probability of transmission given an effective contact (e.g. hand hygiene, and cough etiquette), and social distancing measures to reduce the contact rate in the population. Social distancing minimizes opportunities for person-to-person transmission of the virus to occur. These social distancing measures include some combination of school closure, teleworking, cancellation of group activities and events, and a general overall reduction in community contacts. While they are expected to be effective in reducing transmission of SARS-CoV-2, they are also associated with substantial economic costs and social disruption.","The copyright holder for this preprint . https://doi.org/10. 1101 though overall stress on hospitals does not increase much ( m &gt; 0.03 in 9.4% of runs). Overall, however, system behaviour is similar to the examples shown in Fig 2, except that policy changes tend to be more frequent. The system is rather robust to declining compliance, because new policy measures are rapidly put in place once a secondary outbreak commences.","Given that resources are limited for research and practice, we hope these pilot results may motivate further systematic investigations into how community-generated data can best be used in ARI surveillance. Results of this study can inform a larger study, representative across demographic and locations to systematically assess the etiology of infection and differences in clinical and community cohorts. A larger study will also enable accounting for potential confounders such as environmental risk factors. Finally, while it may be intuitive, findings from this pilot study shed light on the scope of differences in ARI patterns including different types and strains of circulating viruses. Also, because PCR was used for viral detection, the study was limited to detection of viruses in the primer sets. Given that these are the most up-to-date and common viruses, this approach was deemed sufficient for this initial investigation.","All countries should immediately activate the highest level of National Response Management protocols to ensure the all-of-government and allof-society approach needed to contain COVID-19 with non-pharmaceutical measures. This includes fully engaging the public on the seriousness of, and their role in, the response. Policy makers need to ensure that trained epidemiology teams are in place, along with quarantine facilities, revised hospital workflows, and laboratory processes (who to test, how, and in which laboratory). Surveillance needs to be expanded to test all patients with atypical pneumonias for COVID-19, and COVID-19 testing needs to be added to existing surveillance systems for influenza-like illness and severe acute respiratory infections. The demand on facilities, the number of test kits, personal protective equipment, and medication stockpiles should be forecast to enable scaleup. Health systems vary whereby people in under-resourced countries will be particularly at risk. Vulnerable countries will therefore need extraordinarily intensified support from other countries. WHO freely provides online resources that include training courses, downloadable standardised case report forms, guidance on clinical management and infection control, protection of health-care workers, ","Health planning and policy seek to create a group of mutually interacting bodies to produce goods and services to meet the health needs of a population. The investigation of the state of health of citizens often coincides with the field of health planning and policy because it tries to determine the qualitative and quantitative characteristics of the output of these goods and services. This is achieved through the theory of opportunity cost which aims at not wasting resources in order to allocate these resources to meet other socioeconomic needs. The investigation, therefore, of the nosology and epidemiology spectrum and population and demographic data highlights and continuously reflects on the type and quantity of goods and health services that must be produced. Many times, however, despite the scientific approach of this investigation, the market of health-care, but also the failures of planning and health system development, produce either services, such as medical services, far in excess of what is necessary, or pharmaceutical products or diagnostic centers or private clinics, creating strong induced demand and imbalance in demand and supply of the health-care market. In any case, if we do not investigate systematically the size and age structure of the population, its regional distribution, and especially the types of diseases and causes of death, the prevalence and incidence of disease, it is not possible to specify the necessary actions of health policies on a preventive and therapeutic level.","Note that a policy defines \"what will be done\", while a mechanism defines \"how to do something\", as given in [6] , and that \"The separation of policy from mechanism is important for flexibility.\" [6] . Only the epidemiologists in CDC determine when to enable/disable EDICTS and define the rules and patterns for ENID.","The NPIs deployed in China appear to be effectively containing the COVID-19","Given these considerations, we used a transmission dynamic model of COVID-19 to explore the potential impact of case-based, and non-case-based NPIs in the population of Ontario, Canada.","Given that effective COVID-19-specific pharmaceutical interventions and vaccines are not expected to be available for months, NPIs are essential components of the public health response to the ongoing outbreaks.","Social planning and health policy explore, on the one hand, the type and quantity of health services and goods needed by the population and on the other, the human, material, and financial resources, i.e., the necessary inputs for the system to operate as well as the outputs and outcomes. This is indispensable to the availability of resources and to the use of innovative methods to ensure: (1) the rationalization of health services; and (2) the planning of appropriate and specialized output for the operation of the health system and the equilibrium in the market of health-care.","Despite the possible promise of this NPI for both COVID-19 and influenza, it is unclear if symptom-based isolation would be truly effective in controlling outbreaks because the CDC-recommended one day policy might not be enough to achieve a meaningful reduction in transmission, and a high rate of asymptomatic infections and partial compliance might weaken the ability to implement the policy. When the attack rate is high, transmission might occur regardless of isolation and the policy might merely create a burden on the isolated individuals and their families, without a tangible public health benefit. If the policy is proven effective, it is not known whether the CDC-recommended one day of symptom-based isolation is sufficient, and if not, how many days would be most beneficial. At the outset of our project, we hypothesized that these policies would have a small beneficial effect on reducing attack rate, delay the peak of the outbreak and reduce the height of its peak. We did not expect these policies to reduce the overall incidence because there would be many other opportunities to become infected. Furthermore, practical barriers may reduce the strictness with which the policies are enforced, which would reduce the policies' effectiveness.","The compliance with the OHSE management review aspect in the higher education institution laboratories is 0%, that is, no laboratory performs management reviews. Overall, each laboratory has not applied the OHSEMS review due to the insufficient resources to manage OHSE in laboratories. The higher education institution should consider performing management reviews to ensure the OHSEMS has been implemented according to plan; then, if a deviation is observed, action can be immediately to make improvements. CONCLUSION The OHSEMS has been implemented in all laboratories in this higher education institution. As many as 15 laboratories (17%) have complied with more than 70% of the OHSEMS standards, and 35 laboratories (39%) have complied with 50%-70% of the standards. A strong policy and commitment aspect are already available in all laboratories in this higher education institution. Notably, several aspects should be improved, including the planning aspect, specifically the HIRADC element, and all elements of evaluation and management review.","The success of NPIs depended on the epidemiological characteristics of the disease as well as the effectiveness of the measures [4] . The previous studies suggested that the effectiveness of interventions was associated with the proportion of asymptomatic infection, transmissibility of the virus, and the intervention feasibility [4, 5] .","\u2022 The Foundation announced a new initiative to develop vaccines to tackle child mortality in the developing world, where preventable diseases such as malaria and pneumonia are a leading cause of death. This scheme, known as the Vaccine Discovery Partnership, will see the Foundation working alongside pharmaceutical companies. Sanofi and GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) are the first to sign up, and it is hoped that others will soon follow. A project with GSK is already under way, on building thermostability into vaccines to enable their safer delivery in countries with limited resources. By working with pharmaceutical companies the Foundation hopes to reduce the costs and risks associated with early\u2013stage vaccine research, saying that \u201cthis will be a win for everyone involved but most importantly for the children around the world who will get the life\u2013saving vaccines they need.\u201d (BMGF, 29 Oct 2013)","outbreak, but the efficacy of the different interventions varied, with the early case detection and contact reduction being the most effective. Moreover, deploying the NPIs early is also important to prevent further spread. Early and integrated NPI strategies should be prepared, adopted and adjusted to minimize health, social and economic impacts in affected regions around the World.","COVID-19 is a novel infectious disease that causes inflammation in the respiratory system. It is highly contagious and can spread rapidly. Chest imaging can be used both for diagnosis and to document the extent of the lesions and enable accurate observations of changes. We observed pure ground-glass opacity (GGO) in the computed tomography (CT) images of patients with COVID-19 who had no abnormalities on plain radiographs. Therefore, CT examination is necessary to diagnose COVID-19. In this study, we report the chest CT imaging findings of 53 patients admitted and treated in our hospital.","The COVID-19 outbreak has spread widely across China since December 2019, with many other countries affected. The containment strategy of integrated nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) including travel bans and restrictions, contact reductions and social distancing, early case identification and isolation have been rapidly deloyed across China to contain the outbreak, and the combination of these interventions appears to be effective. We ","Generally, the early detection and isolation of cases was estimated to quickly and substantially prevent more infections than contact reduction and social distancing across the country (5-fold versus 2.6-fold), but without the intervention of contact reductions, in the longer term, the epidemics would increase exponentially. Therefore, integrated NPIs would achieve the strongest and most rapid effect on COVID-19 outbreak containment ( Table 1 ).","The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03. 15.20035360 doi: medRxiv preprint (e.g. high dependency unit), earlier on, for patients at highest risk of severe infection. These can also be formalised within risk stratification tools to aid clinical decision-making, such as the CURB65 tool for community-acquired pneumonia (20) . As the number of hospitalised COVID-19 cases continues to increase, hospitals will increasingly need to ration limited resources and improve clinical pathways to effectively prioritise patients with greatest clinical need. This is important, as COVID-19 is already placing increased pressure on ICUs, and anticipation of future demand, based on local population characteristics, may enable more timely planning and resource mobilisation (21) . Identifying those at the highest risk will also facilitate better-informed discussions between clinicians, patients and patients' families about the anticipated clinical trajectory, allowing more accurate and timely advance care discussions to occur.","Infection control precautions are essential to prevent further spread of emerging infectious diseases and to keep the treating team, other patients, and family members safe. 8 Areas of increased precaution should be clearly marked and visual and audio guidance (where possible) should be provided to staff trying to enter these areas. Pre-existing security measures must be maintained (eg, swipe card and code access), and mask users must always check the seals before entry into any patient area. Additional security personnel to ensure staff and patient safety in what can be a difficult and emotionally charged environment might be necessary. The stations for personal protection devices must be strategically placed to enhance compliance. WHO recommends that health-care workers performing aerosol-generating procedures such as endotracheal intubation and bronchoscopy should do them in an adequately ventilated room-ie, with natural ventilation (airflow of at least 160 L/s per patient) or in negativepressure rooms (at least 12 air changes per h). When using mechanical ventilation devices, a controlled direction of airflow is required. Use of N95 or Fluid/Firm Particle-2 masks is essential and previous fit-testing is desirable. 44 ECMO centres should revisit their existing infection control guidelines and protocols and ensure that all members of the ECMO team receive adequate training. 44, 45 If ECMO needs to be initiated at another health centre, the team should either carry the PPE or PAPR resources with them or be familiar with using equipment at another hospital.

The factors determining how an individual's behaviour changes with respect to an epidemic threat will include the degree of perceived risk and the perceived benefits from a particular behavioural change (Yan et al. 2018) , cultural and religious beliefs, expectations and norms and the interaction between an individual and both traditional news media and social media influences. These will all vary between nations and so the degree of initial compliance and the rate of decline of compliance over time will vary and thus it is important to explore the potential impacts of this heterogeneity on the development of the epidemic.","The timings of intervention implementation are also critical. The number of cases could be dramatically reduced by 66%, 86%, and 95%, respectively, if the NPIs could be conducted one week, two weeks, and three weeks earlier than the actual timing across the country ( Figure 5) CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license It is made available under a author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.","Background: Hand Hygiene by using alcohol hand rub has been extensively promoted in our hospital since 2008. We had adopted all elements of the WHO multimodal promotion strategy of Hand hygiene including preparing resources, obtained baseline compliance rate, formal kick-off ceremony and serials education program, continued monitoring and feedback. We also developed ongoing action plan for promoting hand hygiene every year. The compliance rate had risen from 21% in 2008 to 76% in 2012. However, we found the compliance rate have reached the plateau during the period from 2012 to 2014 (76%, 73% and 74%). The objectives of the program were (1) to empower, engage, educate and train up Infection Control Link Nurse (ICLN) in Hand Hygiene promotion and supervision, (2) to recruit an ICLN from each ward and unit and appoint them as observer in hand hygiene practices, (3) to reinforce hand hygiene compliance and enhance safety culture.","This study has several limitations. It was based on confirmed cases, and by excluding suspected cases or mild cases may have under-estimated the rate of spread of the disease. We did not estimate the values of the parameters defining the transition rate from exposed to infectious, or infected to recovered, but fixed them at previously published values. This was a necessary decision because the clinical features of the disease are not yet fully understood, and may affect estimates. However, our intuition after fitting these models is that the maximum likelihood estimate of the force of infection naturally adjusts to fit the value of the recovery rate, and produces a broadly similar value of the basic reproduction number as a result. Furthermore, to adjust for the still-arbitrary nature of these estimates of key parameters, we used some methods that do not depend on any assumptions about these aspects of the disease process. Another limitation of this study is the uncertainty introduced by the use of multiple modeling methods, which we combined with a weighted average. However, we believe that by presenting varying methods with different assumptions along with a weighted average, we enable researchers and policy-makers to make judgements about the dangers of the epidemic without relying on any particular set of assumptions about a disease that is not yet well understood.","Based on near-real time human movement and disease data, here we conducted an observational and modelling study to develop a travel network-based modelling framework. We aimed to reconstruct COVID-19 spread across China and assess the effect of the three major groups of NPIs mentioned above. Given the expanding landscape of epidemics across the World, our findings contribute to improved understanding of the effect of NPI measures on COVID-19 containment and can help in tailoring control strategies across contexts.","of 2019, COVID-19 spread explosively across the globe and was officially declared a pandemic by the WHO on March 11, 2020. 1 In the United States, the number of confirmed cases has spiked from just 1 case between Jan. 20, 2020 to 4661 confirmed positives and 85 deaths as of March 16, 2020. 2 Washington state, the original epicenter of the US outbreak and the location of the first American case, has had 904 COVID19+ patients as of March 16, 2020. 3 Given its rapid spread and 3.4% mortality rate, 4 countries like Italy and China have been forced to ration limited healthcare resources, and there are concerns that the US may need to do so as well. 5 Person-to-person transmission by asymptomatic individuals and pre-symptomatic individuals during the up-to-14 day incubation period 6 may play a significant role in this pandemic. [7] [8] [9] [10] Infection transmission between COVID-19 patients and healthcare workers has also been documented. 11 Given the current status of the COVID-19 outbreak, the US Surgeon General, 12 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 13 American College of Surgeons (ACS), 14 American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA), and Anesthesia Patient Safety Foundation (APSF) 15 have recommended considering rescheduling or postponing some elective surgeries with the goal of conserving limited resources, such as ventilators and ICU beds, and mitigating the risk of \"exposing other inpatients, outpatients, and health care providers to the risk of contracting COVID-19\" from asymptomatic but infectious patients. 14 However, the American Hospital Association, the Federation of American Hospitals, the Association of American Medical Colleges, and the Children's Hospital Association have written a joint letter opposing the surgeon general's advice. 12 Multiple hospitals, including several major hospital systems in WA, are canceling or postponing elective surgery procedures, 16, 17 but there are other hospitals that have declared they will proceed with elective cases. 18 The goal of this study is to provide a quantitative analysis and model for preventable COVID-19 infections from elective outpatient or ambulatory surgery cases. Our model can also be adapted to analyze COVID-19 transmission in other healthcare settings. Furthermore, given the controversy over the appropriate handling of elective surgical cases during this pandemic, we hope that our results may have a positive impact on health policy and public health. Given much of the uncertainty regarding the pathophysiology and epidemiology of COVID-19, and the potential policy implications of our results, we chose to focus on lower bounds for preventable infections instead of upper bounds.","Despite nearly a century of healthcare innovation, a new virus still can bring the world to its knees. The COVID-19 pandemic highlights the inadequacy of many national public health infrastructures in addressing the needs of their citizens, but especially those with limited social, educational, and economic resources. When this present pandemic abates, clinicians, scholars, and policy makers will examine the outcomes, our limited preparedness, and once again identify recurring capacity disparities while proposing remediation plans.

Current testing strategies rely on individual tests of cases matching restrictive diagnostic criteria to detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA, limiting testing of asymptomatic and mild cases. Testing these individuals is one effective way to understand and reduce the spread of COVID-19. Here, we develop a pooled testing strategy to identify these low-risk individuals. Drawing on the well-studied group testing literature, modeling suggests practical changes to testing protocols which can reduce test costs and stretch a limited test kit supply. When most tests are negative, pooling reduces the total number of tests up to four-fold at 2% prevalence and eight-fold at 0.5% prevalence. At current SARS-CoV-2 prevalence, randomized group testing optimized per country could double the number of tested ind...","Much of the uncertainty about the progression of the COVID-19 pandemic stems from questions about when and how non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPI) by governments, in particular social distancing measures, are implemented, to what extent the population complies with these measures, and how compliance changes through time. Further uncertainty comes from a lack of knowledge of the potential effects of removing interventions once the epidemic is declining. By combining an epidemiological model of COVID-19 for the United Kingdom with simple sub-models for these societal processes, this study aims to shed light on the conceivable trajectories that the pandemic might follow over the next 1.5 years. We show strong improvements in outcomes if governments review NPI more frequently whereas, in comparison, the stability of compliance has surprisingly small effects on cumulative mortality. Assuming that mortality does considerably increase once a country's hospital capacity is breached, we show...","Respiratory viruses have emerged and re-emerged in humans for hundreds of years. In the recent past avian and animal influenza viruses have caused human disease ranging from conjunctivitis to respiratory illnesses, including the 2009\u201310 A(H1N1)pdm09 pandemic. Coronaviruses, human metapneumovirus (hMPV) and enteroviruses have also impacted humans globally. Since the likely public health impacts are common, plans and policies for intervention strategies can be developed, encompassing early detection through surveillance and diagnostics, as well as treatment and prevention through clinical and non-clinical interventions. The global comprehensiveness of these varies according to differing resources, competing health priorities and the causative agent, yet, irrespective of this, activities must be proportional to the threat. Pandemics and severe epidemics enable policies to be tested and gaps identified.","Laboratory researchers and students may expose to hazardous and toxic chemicals. Implementation of the Occupational Health, Safety, and Environment Management System (OHSEMS) has become a critical aspect in higher education. This study presents an overview of the evaluation of the implementation of the OHSEMS in higher education laboratories. The implementation of the OHSEMS is to prevent occupational accidents in the laboratory. The study design is a semiquantitative descriptive study. The aim of the study is to evaluate the implementation of the OHSEMS in higher education institution laboratories by evaluating the percentages of OHSEMS compliance in higher education laboratories. Five aspects are evaluated: occupational health, safety, and environment (OHSE) policy and commitment, planning, implementation, evaluation, and management review. The result shows that the average compliance with the OHSE policy and commitment aspect is 59.4% and for the planning, implementation, evaluation...","Background Paper-based diaries and self-report of symptom worsening in COPD may lead to underdetection of exacerbations. Epidemiologically, COPD exacerbations exhibit seasonal patterns peaking at year-end. We examined whether the use of a BlackBerry-based daily symptom diary would detect 95% or more of exacerbations and enable characterization of seasonal differences among them. Methods Fifty participants with GOLD (Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease) stage I to IV COPD began a community-based study in December 2007. Another 30 began in December 2008. Participants transmitted daily symptom diaries using a BlackBerry. Alerts were triggered when symptom changes, missed diary transmissions, or medical care for a respiratory problem occurred. Participant encounters were initiated if COPD exacerbations were suspected. Participants used their BlackBerrys to report returns to normal breathing. Results Participants transmitted 99.9% of 28,514 possible daily diaries. All 191...","Background: The COVID-19 outbreak containment strategies in China based on non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) appear to be effective. Quantitative research is still needed however to assess the efficacy of different candidate NPIs and their timings to guide ongoing and future responses to epidemics of this emerging disease across the World. Methods: We built a travel network-based susceptible-exposed-infectious-removed (SEIR) model to simulate the outbreak across cities in mainland China. We used epidemiological parameters estimated for the early stage of outbreak in Wuhan to parameterise the transmission before NPIs were implemented. To quantify the relative effect of various NPIs, daily changes of delay from illness onset to the first reported case in each county were used as a proxy for the improvement of case identification and isolation across the outbreak. Historical and near-real time human movement data, obtained from Baidu location-based service, were used to derive the i...","SUMMARY: In global health, critical challenges have arisen from infectious diseases, including the emergence and reemergence of old and new infectious diseases. Emergence and reemergence are accelerated by rapid human development, including numerous changes in demographics, populations, and the environment. This has also led to zoonoses in the changing human-animal ecosystem, which are impacted by a growing globalized society where pathogens do not recognize geopolitical borders. Within this context, neglected tropical infectious diseases have historically lacked adequate attention in international public health efforts, leading to insufficient prevention and treatment options. This subset of 17 infectious tropical diseases disproportionately impacts the world's poorest, represents a significant and underappreciated global disease burden, and is a major barrier to development efforts to alleviate poverty and improve human health. Neglected tropical diseases that are also categorized as...","Background We aimed to investigate the frequency of standard precautions (SPs) compliance and the factors affecting the compliance among nursing students (NSs). Methods A cross-sectional survey study guided by the health belief model was conducted in 2009. The study questionnaire is valid (content validity index, 0.81) and reliable (Cronbach \u03b1 range, 0.65-0.94). Results There were 678 questionnaires analyzed, with a response rate of 68.9%. The mean frequency score of SPs compliance was 4.38 \u00b1 0.40 out of 5. Tukey honest significant difference post hoc test indicated that year 2 and year 4 students had better SPs compliance than year 3 students. Further analysis using a univariate general linear model identified an interaction effect of perceived influence of nursing staff and year of study (F1,593 = 3.72; P &lt; .05). The 5 following predictors for SPs compliance were identified: knowledge of SPs, perceived barriers, adequacy of training, management support, and influence of nursing staff...","Models that enable the continent to better allocate scarce resources to better prepare and respond to the COVID-19 epidemic are crucial. The modelling study by Marius Gilbert and colleagues in The Lancet identifies each African country's risk of importation of COVID-19 from China, using data on the volume of air travel from three airports in provinces in China to African countries. Gilbert and colleagues use two indicators to determine the capacity of countries to detect and respond to cases: preparedness, using the WHO International Health Regulations Monitoring and Evaluation Framework; and vulnerability, using the Infectious Disease Vulnerability Index. Based on their analysis, Egypt, Algeria, and South Africa had the highest importation risk, and a moderate to high capacity to respond to outbreaks. Nigeria, Ethiopia, Sudan, Angola, Tanzania, Ghana, and Kenya had moderate risk with variable capacity and high vulnerability. In the model, the risk mainly originates from Guangdong, Fuj...","Summary A 33-year-old doctor contracted severe acute respiratory syndrome presenting with features of disseminated intravascular coagulopathy without changes in the chest radiograph initially. A CT scan of his chest showed marked lung changes. His condition improved with intravenous methylprednisolone 500 mg daily and ribavirin 1\u00b72 g orally thrice daily. The case illustrates the importance of a break in fever between the viraemic and lung inflammatory phases of the illness that occurs before radiographic changes and which may obscure diagnosis. Careful quarantine and follow-up of these patients are necessary. Coagulopathy is usually uncomplicated and early CT of the chest may elucidate hidden lung changes and facilitate a rapid diagnosis.","Background: The 2019 Coronavirus (COVID-19) has turned into a global pandemic with unprecedented challenges for the global community. Understanding the state of the disease and planning for future trajectories relies heavily on data on the spread and mortality. Yet official data coming from various countries are highly unreliable: symptoms similar to common cold in majority of cases and limited screening resources and delayed testing procedures may contribute to under-estimation of the burden of disease. Anecdotal and more limited data are available, but few have systematically combined those with official statistics into a coherent view of the epidemic. This study is a modeling-in-real-time of the emerging outbreak for understanding the state of the disease. Our focus is on the case of the spread of disease in Iran, as one of the epicenters of the disease in the first months of 2020. Method: We develop a simple dynamic model of the epidemic to provide a more reliable picture of the st...","Purpose: The COVID-19 death-rate in Italy continues to climb, surpassing that in every other country. We implement one of the first nationally representative surveys about this unprecedented public health crisis and use it to evaluate the Italian government's public health efforts and citizen responses. Findings: (1) Public health messaging is being heard. At this point, the Italian people understand how to keep themselves and others safe from the SARS-Cov-2 virus. This is true for all population groups we studied, with the partial exception of slightly lower compliance among young adults. Remarkably, even those who do not trust the government, and those who think the government has been untruthful about the crisis mostly believe the public health message and claim to be acting in accordance. (2) The quarantine is beginning to have serious negative effects on the population's mental health. Policy Recommendations: Public health messaging is being heard and understood. The focus now sho...","Abstract Health planning and policy seek to create a group of mutually interacting bodies to produce goods and services to meet the health needs of a population. Recent developments in the health status of the population are characterized by continuous improvement in life expectancy, chronic diseases which absorb 90% of total health care expenditure, differences in the causes of mortality (more than 70% mortality from cancer, heart and brain, and external causes). The new trends in health indicators define the current health policies and lead to the necessity of adapting the health system so as to meet the changing health needs of the population. Especially in the context of the changes in the epidemiological spectrum and the variability in the indices of morbidity and mortality, the focus is not only to further prolong life expectancy but also to improve life expectancy without chronic diseases and without disabilities and to reduce the avoidable mortality, the potential years of life...","Motivated by the rapid upsurge of COVID-19 cases in the United States beginning March 2020, we forecast the disease spread and assess the effectiveness of containment strategies by using an estalished network-driven epidemic dynamic model. Our model is initialized using the daily counts of active and confirmed COVID-19 cases across the US. Based on our model predictions for the March 14-16 timeframe, the national epidemic peak could be expected to arrive by early June, corresponding to a daily active count of \u2248 7% of the US population, if no containment plans are implemented. Epidemic peaks are expected to arrive in the states of Washington and New York by May 21 and 25, respectively. With a modest 25% reduction in COVID-19 transmissibility via community-level interventions, the epidemic progression could be delayed by up to 34 days. Wholesale interstate traffic restriction is ineffective in delaying the epidemic outbreak, but it does desynchronize the arrival of state-wise epidemic pe...","The novel coronavirus infection (COVID-19 or Coronavirus disease 2019) that emerged from Wuhan, Hubei province of China has spread to many countries worldwide. Efforts have been made to develop vaccines against human coronavirus (CoV) infections such as MERS and SARS in the past decades. However, to date, no licensed antiviral treatment or vaccine exists for MERS and SARS. Most of the efforts for developing CoV vaccines and drugs target the spike glycoprotein or S protein, the major inducer of neutralizing antibodies. Although a few candidates have shown efficacy in in vitro studies, not many have progressed to randomized animal or human trials, hence may have limited use to counter COVID-19 infection. This article highlights ongoing advances in designing vaccines and therapeutics to counter COVID-19 while also focusing on such experiences and advances as made with earlier SARS- and MERS-CoVs, which together could enable efforts to halt this emerging virus infection.","Objective To provide an overview of supply and demand issues in the vaccine industry and the policy options that have been implemented to resolve these issues. Data sources Medline, Policy File, and International Pharmaceutical Abstracts were searched to locate academic journal articles. Other sources reviewed included texts on the topics of vaccine history and policy, government agency reports, and reports from independent think tanks. Keywords included vaccines, immunizations, supply, demand, and policy. Study selection Search criteria were limited to English language and human studies. Articles pertaining to vaccine demand, supply, and public policy were selected and reviewed for inclusion. Data extraction By the authors. Data synthesis Vaccines are biologic medications, therefore making their development and production more difficult and costly compared with \u201csmall-molecule\u201d drugs. Research and development costs for vaccines can exceed $800 million, and development may require 10 y...","AbstractThe outbreak of a novel betacoronavirus (2019-nCov) represents a pandemic threat that has been declared a public health emergency of international concern. The CoV spike (S) glycoprotein is a key target for urgently needed vaccines, therapeutic antibodies, and diagnostics. To facilitate medical countermeasure (MCM) development we determined a 3.5 \u00c5-resolution cryo-EM structure of the 2019-nCoV S trimer in the prefusion conformation. The predominant state of the trimer has one of the three receptor-binding domains (RBDs) rotated up in a receptor-accessible conformation. We also show biophysical and structural evidence that the 2019-nCoV S binds ACE2 with higher affinity than SARS-CoV S. Additionally we tested several published SARS-CoV RBD-specific monoclonal antibodies and found that they do not have appreciable binding to nCoV-2019 S, suggesting antibody cross-reactivity may be limited between the two virus RBDs. The atomic-resolution structure of 2019-nCoV S should enable rap...","ABSTRACT Within weeks, COVID-19 has transformed our practice of palliative care and clinical medicine as we know it. Telemedicine has emerged as a critical technology to bring medical care to patients while attempting to reduce the transmission of COVID-19 among patients, families, and clinicians. It is also increasingly necessary to preserve scarce resources like personal protective equipment. In this article, we share just-in-time tips to support palliative care clinicians and program leaders in providing the best care possible by telemedicine. These quick, practical tips cover telemedicine set-up, patient considerations, and clinician considerations. Next steps include ensuring equitable access to affordable telemedicine technology for vulnerable populations through creative solutions and financing, and dedicated attention to telemedicine evaluation and quality improvement.","Problem: Due to the spread of SARS CoV-2 virus infection and COVID-2019 disease, there is an urgent need to analyze COVID-2019 epidemic perception in Poland. This would enable authorities for preparation of specific actions minimizing public health and economic risks. Methods: We study the perception of COVID-2019 epidemic in Polish society using quantitative analysis of its digital footprints on the Internet (on Twitter, Google, YouTube, Wikipedia and electronic media represented by Event Registry) from January 2020 to 12.03.2020 (before and after official introduction to Poland on 04.03.2020). To this end we utilize data mining, social network analysis, natural language processing techniques. Each examined internet platform was analyzed for representativeness and composition of the target group. Results: We identified three major cluster of the interest before disease introduction on the topic COVID-2019: China- and Italy-related peaks on all platforms, as well as a peak on social me...","Abstract The globe is currently in the midst of a COVID-19 pandemic resulting in significant morbidity and mortality. This pandemic has placed considerable stress on health care resources and providers. This document from the Canadian Association of Interventional Cardiology - Association Canadienne de Cardiologie d'intervention, specifically addresses the implications for the care of patients in the Cardiac Catheterization Laboratory (CCL) in Canada during the COVID-19 pandemic. The key principles of this document are to maintain essential interventional cardiovascular care while minimizing risks of COVID-19 to patients/staff and maintaining the overall healthcare resources. As the COVID-19 pandemic evolves, procedures will be increased or reduced based on the current level of restriction to health care services. While some consistency across the country is desirable, provincial and regional considerations will influence how these recommendations are implemented. We believe the framew...","The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is straining healthcare resources worldwide, prompting social distancing measures to reduce transmission intensity. The amount of social distancing needed to curb the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in the context of seasonally varying transmission remains unclear. Using a mathematical model, we assessed that one-time interventions will be insufficient to maintain COVID-19 prevalence within the critical care capacity of the United States. Seasonal variation in transmission will facilitate epidemic control during the summer months but could lead to an intense resurgence in the autumn. Intermittent distancing measures can maintain control of the epidemic, but without other interventions, these measures may be necessary into 2022. Increasing critical care capacity could reduce the duration of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic while ensuring that critically ill patients receive appropriate care.","SARS-CoV-2 has infected over 140,000 people as of March 14, 2020. We use a mathematical model to investigate the effectiveness of social distancing interventions lasting six weeks in a middle-sized city in the US. We explore four social distancing strategies by reducing the contacts of adults over 60 years old, adults over 60 years old and children, all adults (25, 75 or 95% compliance), and everyone in the population. Our results suggest that social distancing interventions can avert cases by 20% and hospitalizations and deaths by 90% even with modest compliance within adults as long as the intervention is kept in place, but the epidemic is set to rebound once the intervention is lifted. Our models suggest that social distancing interventions will buy crucial time but need to occur in conjunction with testing and contact tracing of all suspected cases to mitigate transmission of SARS-CoV-2.","COVID-19 is an acute respiratory disease that has been classified as a pandemic by the World Health Organization. Information regarding this particular disease is limited, however, it is known to have high mortality rates, particularly among individuals with preexisting medical conditions. Creating models to identify individuals who are at the greatest risk for severe complications due to COVID-19 will be useful to help for outreach campaigns in mitigating the diseases worst effects. While information specific to COVID-19 is limited, a model using complications due to other upper respiratory infections can be used as a proxy to help identify those individuals who are at the greatest risk. We present the results for three models predicting such complications, with each model having varying levels of predictive effectiveness at the expense of ease of implementation.","The 2009 influenza A (H1N1) pandemic highlighted the importance of quality hospital care of the severely ill, yet there is evidence that the impact of the 2009 pandemic was highest in low\u2010 and middle\u2010income countries with fewer resources. Recent data indicate that death and suffering from seasonal influenza and severe illness in general are increased in resource\u2010limited settings. However, there are limited clinical data and guidelines for the management of influenza and other severe illness in these settings. Life\u2010saving supportive care through syndromic case management is used successfully in high\u2010resource intensive care units and in global programs such as the Integrated Management of Childhood Illness (IMCI). While there are a variety of challenges to the management of the severely ill in resource\u2010limited settings, several new international initiatives have begun to develop syndromic management strategies for these environments, including the World Health Organization's Integrated M...","Public health preparedness requires effective surveillance of and rapid response to infectious disease outbreaks. Inclusion of research activities within the outbreak setting provides important opportunities to maximize limited resources, to enhance gains in scientific knowledge, and ultimately to increase levels of preparedness. With rapid advances in laboratory technologies, banking and analysis of human genomic specimens can be conducted as part of public health investigations, enabling valuable research well into the future.","Abstract Pathogenic viruses are viruses that can infect and replicate within human cells and cause diseases. The continuous emergence and re-emergence of pathogenic viruses has become a major threat to public health. Whenever pathogenic viruses emerge, their rapid detection is critical to enable implementation of specific control measures and the limitation of virus spread. Further molecular characterization to better understand these viruses is required for the development of diagnostic tests and countermeasures. Advances in molecular biology techniques have revolutionized the procedures for detection and characterization of pathogenic viruses. The development of PCR-based techniques together with DNA sequencing technology, have provided highly sensitive and specific methods to determine virus circulation. Pathogenic viruses potentially having global catastrophic consequences may emerge in regions where capacity for their detection and characterization is limited. Development of a loc...","On January 23, 2020, China imposed a quarantine on the city of Wuhan to contain the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak. Regardless of this measure the new infection has spread to several countries around the world. Here, we developed a method to study the dissemination of this infection by the airline routes and we give estimations of the time of arrival of the outbreaks to the different cities. In this work we show an analysis of the dispersion of this infection to other cities by airlines based on the classic model the Kermack and McKendrick complemented with diffusion on a graph composed of nodes which represent the cities and edges which represent the airline routes. We do several numerical simulations to estimate the date of arrival to different cities starting the infection at Wuhan, China and to show the robustness of the estimation respect to changes in the epidemiological parameters and to changes on the graph. We use Mexico City as an example. In this case, our estimate of the arrival time ...","We probe how genetic variability across the three major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I genes (human leukocyte antigen [HLA] A, B, and C) may affect susceptibility to and severity of severe acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus responsible for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). We execute a comprehensive in silico analysis of viral peptide-MHC class I binding affinity across all known HLA -A, -B, and -C genotypes for all SARS-CoV-2 peptides. We further explore the potential for cross-protective immunity conferred by prior exposure to four common human coronaviruses. The SARS-CoV-2 proteome is successfully sampled and presented by a diversity of HLA alleles. However, we found that HLA-B*46:01 had the fewest predicted binding peptides for SARS-CoV-2, suggesting individuals with this allele may be particularly vulnerable to COVID-19, as they were previously shown to be for SARS (1). Conversely, we found that HLA-B*15:03 showed the greatest capacity to present hig...","OBJECTIVES: To determine paediatric emergency department (ED) staff perceptions of the effectiveness and practice of infection control measures against a novel virulent pathogen. METHODS: All medical staff of the paediatric ED in a tertiary medical centre completed a written questionnaire near the onset of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak. Level of concern regarding SARS, and perceptions of effectiveness and use of infection control measures were assessed on a 5 point scale. Statistical analysis was performed using \u03c7(2) test and one way analysis of variance with significance at p&lt;0.05. RESULTS: Response rate was 97% (116/120). All scores were given out of 5 possible points. Using isolation rooms (mean score 4.6), wearing a mask when examining patients (4.5), and handwashing (4.5) were considered most effective. Staff physicians reported handwashing more than nurses and trainees (4.9 v 4.5 and 4.5, respectively; p&lt;0.05) while other measures were reported equally. Re...","Abstract Objective To identify drug interaction databases (DID) and assess the quality of their structures. Method A search was made of the literature for DID and a series of exclusion and structural quality criteria were defined (at least 4 quality criteria: classification according to severity, classification according to level of evidence, bibliographical reference data, description of clinical management, and 11 criteria used for weighting). The level of compliance of every DID with the criteria defined was analysed, together with the level of compliance of each criteria in each DID. Results A total of 54 DID were identified, 30 of which complied with exclusion criteria and 15 of which did not meet the minimum criteria. The rest of the criteria were evaluated in 9 DID: Botplus and Medinteract (100%), SEFH Guide, Lexi-interact and Medscape (89%), Hansten (83%), Micromedex and Stockley (78%), Drug Interactions Facts (68%). Ninety-two percent of the DID describe the mechanism of actio...","ABSTRACT BACKGROUND The COVID-19 epidemic, first emerged in Wuhan during December 2019, has spread globally. While the mass population movement for Chinese New Year has significantly influenced spreading the disease, little direct evidence exists about the relevance to epidemic and its control of population movement from Wuhan, local emergency response, and medical resources in China. METHODS Spearman's correlation analysis was performed between official data of confirmed COVID-19 cases from Jan 20th to Feb 19th, 2020 and real-time travel data and health resources data. RESULTS There were 74,675 confirmed COVID-19 cases in China by Feb 19th, 2020. The overall fatality rate was 2.84%, much higher in Hubei than in other regions (3.27% vs 0.73%). The index of population inflow from Hubei was positively correlated with total (Provincial r=0.9159, p&lt;0.001; City r=0.6311, p&lt;0.001) and primary cases (Provincial r=0.8702, p&lt;0.001; City r=0.6358, p&lt;0.001). The local health emergency measures (e...","Chinese government has taken strong measures in response to the epidemic of new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) from Jan.23, 2020. The number of confirmed infected individuals are still increasing rapidly. Estimating the accurate infected population and the future trend of epidemic spreading under control measures is significant and urgent. There have been reports external icon of spread from an infected patient with no symptoms to a close contact, which means the incubation individuals may has the possibility of infectiousness. However, the traditional transmission model, Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered (SEIR) model, assumes that the exposed individual is being infected but without infectiousness. Thus, the estimating infected populations based on SEIR model from the existing literatures seems too far more than the official reported data. Here, we inferred that the epidemic could be spread by exposed (incubation) individuals. Then, we provide a new Exposed-identified-Recovered (EIR) ...","Abstract This paper investigates whether the inclusion of social scientists in the UK policy network that responded to the Ebola crisis in Sierra Leone (2013\u201316) was a transformational moment in the use of interdisciplinary research. In contrast to the existing literature, that relies heavily on qualitative accounts of the epidemic and ethnography, this study tests the dynamics of the connections between critical actors with quantitative network analysis. This novel approach explores how individuals are embedded in social relationships and how this may affect the production and use of evidence. The meso-level analysis, conducted between March and June 2019, is based on the traces of individuals' engagement found in secondary sources. Source material includes policy and strategy documents, committee papers, meeting minutes and personal correspondence. Social network analysis software, UCINet, was used to analyse the data and Netdraw for the visualisation of the network. Far from being o...","Background: COVID-19 pandemic has developed rapidly and the ability to stratify the most vulnerable patients is vital. However, routinely used severity scoring systems are often low on diagnosis, even in non-survivors. Therefore, clinical prediction models for mortality are urgently required. Methods: We developed and internally validated a multivariable logistic regression model to predict inpatient mortality in COVID-19 positive patients using data collected retrospectively from Tongji Hospital, Wuhan (299 patients). External validation was conducted using a retrospective cohort from Jinyintan Hospital, Wuhan (145 patients). Nine variables commonly measured in these acute settings were considered for model development, including age, biomarkers and comorbidities. Backwards stepwise selection and bootstrap resampling were used for model development and internal validation. We assessed discrimination via the C statistic, and calibration using calibration-in-the-large, calibration slope...","To understand the time-dependent risk of infection on a cruise ship, the Diamond Princess, I estimated the incidence of infection with novel coronavirus (COVID-19). The epidemic curve of a total of 199 confirmed cases was drawn, classifying individuals into passengers with and without close contact and crew members. A backcalculation method was employed to estimate the incidence of infection. The peak time of infection was seen for the time period from 2 to 4 February 2020, and the incidence has abruptly declined afterwards. The estimated number of new infections among passengers without close contact was very small from 5 February on which a movement restriction policy was imposed. Without the intervention from 5 February, it was predicted that the cumulative incidence with and without close contact would have been as large as 1373 (95% CI: 570, 2176) and 766 (95% CI: 587, 946) cases, respectively, while these were kept to be 102 and 47 cases, respectively. Based on an analysis of ill...","The pace of pathogen discovery is increasing dramatically. This reflects not only factors that enable the appearance and globalization of new microbial infections but also improvements in methods for ascertainment. New molecular diagnostic platforms; investments in pathogen surveillance in wildlife, domestic animals and humans; and the advent of social media tools that mine the world wide web for clues to outbreaks of infectious disease are proving invaluable in early recognition of threats to public health. Additionally, models of microbial pathogenesis are becoming more complex, providing insights into the mechanisms by which microorganisms can contribute to chronic illnesses like cancer, peptic ulcer disease and mental illness. Here we review the contributions of each of these elements to infectious disease emergence and strategies for addressing the challenges of pathogen surveillance and discovery.","Abstract Purpose During a global pandemic the benefit of routine visits and treatment of cancer patients must be weighed against the risks to patients, staff, and society. Prostate cancer is one of the most common cancers Radiation Oncology departments treat, and efficient resource utilization is essential in the setting of a pandemic. Herein, we aim to establish recommendations and a framework by which to evaluate prostate radiotherapy management decisions. Patients and Methods Radiation Oncologists from the United States and United Kingdom rapidly conducted a systematic review and agreed upon recommendations to safely manage prostate cancer patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. A RADS framework was created: Remote visits, and Avoidance, Deferment, and Shortening of radiotherapy was applied to determine appropriate approaches. Results Recommendations are provided by National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) risk group, including clinical node positive, post-prostatectomy, oligomet...","In this work we construct a mathematical model for the transmission and spread of coronavirus disease 2019 or COVID-19. Our model features delay terms to account for (a) the time lapse or latency period between contracting the disease and displaying symptoms, and (b) the time lag in testing patients for the virus due to the limited numbers of testing facilities currently available. We find that the delay introduces a significant disparity between the actual and reported time-trajectories of cases in a particular region. Specifically, the reported case histories lag the actual histories by a few days. Hence, to minimize the spread of the disease, lockdowns and similarly drastic social isolation measures need to be imposed some time before the reported figures are approaching their peak values. We then account for the social reality that lockdowns can only be of a limited duration in view of practical considerations. We find that the most effective interval for imposing such a limited-ti...","The impact of COVID-19 pandemic on the global health and world's economy have been profound and unseen since the Spanish flu of 1918-19. As of now, many countries have been severely affected, partly because of slow responses to the crisis, ill-preparedness of their health system, and the fragile health infrastructure and the shortage of protective equipment. This note evaluates various scenarios, based on an estimation of number of identified and unidentified infected cases, and examines the effectiveness of different policy responses to contain this pandemic. Our result, based on an estimation of the model for Iran, show that in many instances the number of unidentified cases, including asymptomatic individuals, could be much bigger than the reported numbers. The results confirm that in such circumstances, social distancing alone cannot be an effective policy unless a large portion of the population confine themselves for an extended period of time, which is not only difficult to impl...","Abstract This paper describes a proposed Strategic Vaccine Facility (SVF) to provide a capability to the UK to deal with new and emerging disease threats. It would underpin the vaccine manufacturing industry by developing expertise and technology to enable rapid manufacture of small batches of vaccines for emergency use against agents, such as bioterrorist agents and emerging diseases. It would have a rare ability to work with dangerous pathogens under containment, allowing the production of inactivated and live vaccines, which would be difficult in a conventional plant. The facility's output will include vaccine candidates and manufacturing protocols for transfer to industry, small vaccine batches for emergency use or clinical trials, and vaccine reference standards. It would also be available for manufacturing small batches of experimental and public health vaccines for the UK and the developing world, allowing clinical trials to be undertaken against key diseases.","Abstract The global spread of COVID-19 is placing unprecedented demands on healthcare services. In this time of crisis, innovative and adaptive methods of practising will be required across all health professions. In order to maximise the use of current available resources, it is vital that existing services are comprehensively reviewed and full use is made of any unrealised potential among healthcare providers. Community pharmacy is one of a number of health professions that has a key role to play in responding to the current pandemic. As the scope of community pharmacy practice varies considerably across countries, it is important to examine ways in which the profession can assist with the public health response to COVID-19 and maintaining the continuity of healthcare services. This article seeks to highlight roles and activities that community pharmacists can undertake to help in relieving pressure on other areas of the health service, such as general practice. This information coul...","","","Abstract In response to SARS-CoV infection, neutralizing antibodies are generated against the Spike (S) protein. Determination of the active regions that allow viral escape from neutralization would enable the use of these antibodies for future passive immunotherapy. We immunized mice with UV-inactivated SARS-CoV to generate three anti-S monoclonal antibodies, and established several neutralization escape mutants with S protein. We identified several amino acid substitutions, including Y442F and V601G in the S1 domain and D757N and A834V in the S2 region. In the presence of each neutralizing antibody, double mutants with substitutions in both domains exhibited a greater growth advantage than those with only one substitution. Importantly, combining two monoclonal antibodies that target different epitopes effected almost complete suppression of wild type virus replication. Thus, for effective passive immunotherapy, it is important to use neutralizing antibodies that recognize both the S1...","Background Severe cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) rapidly develop acute respiratory distress leading to respiratory failure, with high short-term mortality rates. At present, there is no reliable risk stratification tool for non-severe COVID-19 patients at admission. We aimed to construct an effective model for early identifying cases at high risk of progression to severe COVID-19. Methods SARS-CoV-2 infected patients from one center in Wuhan city and two centers in Guangzhou city, China were included retrospectively. All patients with non-severe COVID-19 during hospitalization were followed for more than 15 days after admission. Patients who deteriorated to severe or critical COVID-19 and patients who kept non-severe state were assigned to the severe and non-severe group, respectively. We compared the demographic, clinical, and laboratory data between severe and non-severe group. Based on baseline data, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) algorithm and...","Abstract To help reveal the diversity and evolution of bat coronaviruses we collected 1067 bats from 21 species in China. A total of 73 coronaviruses (32 alphacoronaviruses and 41 betacoronaviruses) were identified in these bats, with an overall prevalence of 6.84%. All newly-identified betacoronaviruses were SARS-related Rhinolophus bat coronaviruses (SARSr-Rh-BatCoV). Importantly, with the exception of the S gene, the genome sequences of the SARSr-Rh-BatCoVs sampled in Guizhou province were closely related to SARS-related human coronavirus. Additionally, the newly-identified alphacoronaviruses exhibited high genetic diversity and some may represent novel species. Our phylogenetic analyses also provided insights into the transmission of these viruses among bat species, revealing a general clustering by geographic location rather than by bat species. Inter-species transmission among bats from the same genus was also commonplace in both the alphacoronaviruses and betacoronaviruses. Over...","Tang and colleagues, in this Journal, drew readers attention to emerging COVID19.1 We focused on the pregnant COVID19 patients. Given the maternal physiologic and immune function changes in pregnancy,2 pregnant individuals might face greater risk of getting infected by SARS-CoV-2 and might have more complicated clinical events. We described epidemiological, clinical characteristics, pregnancy and perinatal outcomes of all hospitalized pregnant patients diagnosed with COVID-19 in China. We identified all hospitalized pregnant patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection between December 8, 2019, and February 25, 2020 officially reported by the central government, in areas outside Wuhan, China. Information including age, geographic location, epidemiological history, prenatal course, maternal and newborn hospital course, discharge data and outcome were obtained by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and Local Health Commission. When necessary, we attempted to contact loc...","Ten years have elapsed since the World Health Organization issued its first global alert for an unexplained illness named severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). The anniversary provides an opportunity to reflect on the international response to this new global microbial threat. While global surveillance and response capacity for public health threats have been strengthened, critical gaps remain. Of 194 World Health Organization member states that signed on to the International Health Regulations (2005), &lt;20% had achieved compliance with the core capacities required by the deadline in June 2012. Lessons learned from the global SARS outbreak highlight the need to avoid complacency, strengthen efforts to improve global capacity to address the next pandemic using all available 21st century tools, and support research to develop new treatment options, countermeasures, and insights while striving to address the global inequities that are the root cause of many of these challenges.","AbstractFinding vaccine or specific antiviral treatment for global pandemic of virus diseases (such as the ongoing COVID-19) requires rapid analysis, annotation and evaluation of metagenomic libraries to enable a quick and efficient screening of nucleotide sequences. Traditional sequence alignment methods are not suitable and there is a need for fast alignment-free techniques for sequence analysis. Information theory and data compression algorithms provide a rich set of mathematical and computational tools to capture essential patterns in biological sequences. In 2013, our research group (Nagaraj et al., Eur. Phys. J. Special Topics 222(3-4), 2013) has proposed a novel measure known as Effort-To-Compress (ETC) based on the notion of compression-complexity to capture the information content of sequences. In this study, we propose a compression-complexity based distance measure for automatic identification of SARS coronavirus strains from a set of viruses using only short fragments of nu...","IAs of February 11, 2020, all prefecture-level cities in mainland China have reported confirmed cases of 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), but the city-level epidemical dynamics is unknown. The aim of this study is to model the current dynamics of 2019-nCoV at city level and predict the trend in the next 30 days under three possible scenarios in mainland China. We developed a spatially explicit epidemic model to consider the unique characteristics of the virus transmission in individual cities. Our model considered that the rate of virus transmission among local residents is different from those with Wuhan travel history due to the self-isolation policy. We introduced a decay rate to quantify the effort of each city to gradually control the disease spreading. We used mobile phone data to obtain the number of individuals in each city who have travel history to Wuhan. This city-level model was trained using confirmed cases up to February 10, 2020 and validated by new confirmed cases on..."],"title":["Evaluation of Group Testing for SARS-CoV-2 RNA","How will this continue?
