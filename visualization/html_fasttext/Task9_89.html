Currently, U.S. vaccine financing is a joint responsibility shared by the private and public sectors. As of 2002, more than one-half of the vaccines recommended for children were purchased through federal contract, 45 whereas vaccines for adults typically are covered by private insurance. Private health plans often have insurance coverage for vaccines. However, some children enrolled in private health plans do not have coverage for vaccines and are considered underinsured for immunization. 46 Finally, some studies have shown that health care provid-ers have concerns regarding the costs of purchasing and administering vaccines and their level of reimbursement from public and private insurers. 47 Providers must order and purchase many vaccines (e.g., influenza) months before they are administered, resulting in substantial capital outlay coupled with delayed reimbursement. 47 Recently, Freed et al. 48 conducted a survey exploring physicians' perspectives on reimbursement for childhood immunizations. Approximately one-half of the study respondents reported financial reasons and low profit margins from immunizations as factors affecting their purchase and administration of vaccines. These authors concluded that physicians who provide vaccines to children and adolescents are dissatisfied with third-party reimbursement levels and the increasing financial strain on their practices from immunizations. Thus, increasing vaccine prices, a greater number of vaccine doses, and declining provider reimbursement for these products appear to be factors constraining both patient and provider demand for these products.","In the most affected regions, the National Healthcare Service is close to collapse-the results of years of fragmentation and decades of finance cuts, privatisation, and deprivation of human and technical resources. The National Healthcare Service is regionally based, with local authorities responsible for the organisation and delivery of health services, leaving the Italian Government with a weak strategic leadership. Over the period 2010-19, the National Healthcare Service suffered financial cuts of more than \u20ac37 billion, a progressive privatisation of health-care services. Public health expenditure as a proportion of gross domestic product was 6\u00b76% for the years 2018-20 and is forecast to fall to 6\u00b74% in 2022. 2 The Lombardy region has the heaviest burden of the COVID-19 pandemic, with (as of March 19, 2020) 19 884 total cases of the disease, 2168 deaths, and 1006 patients requiring advanced respiratory support. At its standard operational level, Lombardy has a capacity of 724 intensive care beds. 3 To tackle the medical equipment shortage, Italian Civil Protection undertook a fast-track public procurement to secure 3800 respiratory ventilators, an additional 30 million protective masks, and 67 000 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) tests. 4 To avert the shortage of health workers produced by decades of inadequate recruitment practices, the Italian Government authorised regions to recruit 20 000 health workers, allocating \u20ac660 million for the purpose. 5 There are lessons to be learned from the current COVID-19 pandemic. First, the Italian decentralisation and fragmentation of health services seems to have restricted timely interventions and effectiveness, and stronger national coordination should be in place. Second, health-care systems capacity and financing need to be more flexible to take into account exceptional emergencies. Third, in response to emergencies, solid partnerships between the private and public sector should be institutionalised. Finally, recruitment of human resources must be planned and financed with a long-term vision. Consistent management choices and a strong political commitment are needed to create a more sustainable system for the long run.","For any country, eff ective control of infectious diseases is dependent on focused eff orts to decrease endemic infections in at-risk and susceptible populations, combined with strong epidemiological and laboratory capacity to detect and stop emerging threats. Inherent in these eff orts are well established links between clinical, public health, and research communities working with non-traditional partners such as industry, law enforcement, businesses, and the media. Although at their core these collaborations need to be established locally, such crucial partnerships have to extend across state, national, and international levels. Together, these alliances can form a global infrastructure and system to detect and control infectious diseases. With that aim, in February, 2014, the USA and other nations joined WHO, the Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations, and the World Organization for Animal Health in a new global health security agenda designed to enhance strategies to prevent, detect, and respond to threats of infectious disease. 123 Partner countries will work together to meet a series of objectives covering crucial issues aff ecting control of infectious disease such as antimicrobial resistance, biosafety and biosecurity, global disease detection and response networks, and emergency responses. Much emphasis has been placed on the aptly named perfect storm inherent in today's globalised world for rapid emergence and spread of infectious diseases. Despite this persistent challenge, extraordinary achievements in science and technology continue to bolster the capacity to recognise and respond to these threats. Scientifi cally, next-generation sequencing and state-of-the-art bioinformatics capabilities are transforming the practice of microbiology and the speed at which infectious pathogens can be detected and analysed. 85,124 These technologies provide a new level of information about infectious pathogens and therefore off er tremendous opportunities for public health eff orts to detect and control outbreaks, target antimicrobial resistance, and develop and refi ne treatments and vaccines. [125] [126] [127] Additionally, the increasing understanding of the role of human microbiomes in disease development and new links between infectious agents and chronic diseases opens new possibilities for disease prevention and treatment. 128 Advances in electronic communications have also been essential and have enabled rapid sharing of health and safety information and expertise by health-care and public health workers, researchers, law enforcement, the media, and private individuals. These communication capacities can facilitate and enhance research and public health partnerships worldwide, generating broad sharing of research fi ndings and health updates in near real time. The latest surge in health communications has come from social media tools, which are increasingly being used to extend the reach of public health information. To ensure that these rapidly changing scientifi c and technological advances are routinely used in public health is a crucial challenge and priority.","(3) those affected may be contagious during a prolonged asymptomatic incubation period, and many never develop symptoms distinctive from a mild flu, making it difficult to identify and isolate the infected before they pass the virus to others. (4) Broad public mandates for social distancing are also vital to help manage a key multiplier of COVID-19 fatality rates: a substantial fraction of patients require lengthy (on average 8 bed days) intensive care unit (ICU) support to survive acute respiratory distress, and uncontrolled spread of the disease is expected to generate at its peak far greater demand for ICU care than existing capacity can meet.(5; 2; 6) Public health experts have pleaded with officials to quickly mandate social distancing to flatten the curve of coronavirus infections -that is, reduce the peak caseload -before exponential case growth leads to hundreds of thousands or millions of deaths. In particular, it is important to keep peak levels low to prevent the fatality rate from rising to the levels seen in areas where hospitals are overwhelmed with cases. (7) In the United States, the emergence of the coronavirus has created a natural experiment in which elected officials face incredibly urgent and far-reaching policy decisions for which they typically have no personal experience or expertise, and for which the history of policy examples is either mere days old, or so dated as to be largely unknown except by public health experts. The most significant policy decisions of this kindboth in terms of their potential to mitigate the epidemic and their economic consequences -are mandates for social distancing through restrictions on public gatherings; closure or restriction of schools, restaurants, and other non-essential businesses; and orders for the public to stay at home. (8) Under the federal and state constitutions, the key actions fall to executives, and particularly to governors, whose powers in public health emergencies are typically singular and extensive.","At the end of the 1950s, a resurgent economy and the implications of Cold War protectionism vastly increased the importance of security as an organized business practice. Industry was serving the needs of military preparedness and expanding commercial inventiveness: both required adequate security measures, though of differing sorts. Such diverse interests in proprietary security were met, in 1955, with the founding of the American Society for Industrial Security, now ASIS International. 3 early members of ASIS were employed usually as loss control directors serving for-profit and institutional organizations. Typically, they would be concerned about physical security, emergency response planning and coordination, and internal investigations. Members who worked for industrial corporations that provided products, systems, services, and research for government, especially the military and intelligence community, faced extensive compliance requirements to protect information and production know-how from possible compromise. ASIS members in those early years included many retired military officers. Membership also consisted of retired police officers, special agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and other law enforcement organizations, and persons who became responsible for security without having had any previous formal preparation in the military or law enforcement.","Three types of data could potentially be used in real time to improve predictions by considering secondary case heterogeneity. First, contact tracing data whose objective is to identify people who may have come into contact with an infectious individual. While mostly a preventive measure to identify cases before complications, it directly informs us about potential secondary cases caused by a single individual, and therefore provides us with an estimate for G 1 (x). Both for generating accurate predictions of epidemic risk and controlling the outbreak, it is vital to begin contact tracing before numerous transmission chains become widely distributed across space [38, 39] Second, viral genome sequences provide information on both the timing of the outbreak [40] [41] [42] and structure of secondary cases [43] [44] [45] . For example, methods exist to reconstruct transmission trees for sampled sequences using simple mutational models to construct a likelihood for a specific transmission tree [46, 47] and translate coalescent rates into key epidemiological parameters [48] [49] [50] . Despite the potential for genome sequencing to revolutionize outbreak response, the global public health community still struggles to coordinate data sharing across international borders, between academic researchers, and with private companies [51] [52] [53] .","Other specific laws calling for increased commercial security measures were passed. Notable among these was the Bank Security Act of 1968. \u00a7 This law was passed because bank crimes had grown steadily during the decade. The increased incidence of bank robberies, burglaries, and extortions prompted Congress to require all federally chartered banking institutions to undertake particular security measures to reduce the risk of successful criminal acts. In retrospect, the measure in itself did not reduce the growing pattern of violent and property crimes against financial institutions covered by the Act: in fact, they kept increasing for years after passage of the law. \u00b6 modified years later to make requirements more reflective of changing circumstances. For example, the original law of 1968 produced regulations for Minimum Security Devices and Procedures (12CFR21). These included specific language related to antitheft technology, which became less relevant with the introduction of new and better cameras and recording media. By the 1990s, bankers possessed greater latitude with regards to designing security systems most appropriate for their needs. While the Bank Security Act is not directly associated with decreasing bank crime patterns, common sense argues that such institutions must implement reasonable security measures to protect employees and the public. perhaps without the vigorous measures that were instituted by this law, bank crime would have increased. This act is an example of the federal government passing a measure that demands a distinctive private sector security response. In the process this law aided the role of security management to grow as a management practice in a particular sphere, in this case financial industries. Other federal measures would follow.","Antimicrobial susceptibility of pneumococcal isolates causing bacteraemic community-acquired pneumonia in the public and private sectors in Gauteng, South Africa Objectives: Contradictory and very high rates of pneumococcal resistance have been reported previously from different surveillance studies conducted in South Africa. The aim of this study was to review susceptibility data of isolates from adult patients presenting with bacteremic pneumococcal communityacquired pneumonia (CAP), comparing cases in the public and private sectors in Gauteng, South Africa. Methods: We wished to recruit 100 consecutive adult patients with pneumococcal bacteraemia and CAP. Patients without radiographic evidence of pneumonia, or with other clinical diagnoses (e.g. meningitis) were excluded. Repeat isolates were excluded. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was done according to CLSI guidelines, using disc screening and MIC determination with agar dilution and E-tests. Results: 149 cases were recruited, 97 in the public and 52 in the private sector. Public sector patients were younger (median age 33 years vs. 45 years; p &lt; 0.001), with more HIV infection and less co-morbid illness. Cases in the private sector were more likely to have received antibiotics in the past 3 months. The overall rate of antimicrobial resistance was considerably lower than reported previously in South Africa. Resistance to penicillin was 16% in the public and 23% in the private sector (not significantly different). There were also no significant differences in the susceptibility of the isolates to ceftriaxone, chloramphenicol, tetracycline, rifampicin or ofloxacin. However significantly more resistance was seen in the private sector isolates to erythromycin (28% vs. 4%; P &lt; 0.001) and clindamycin (21% vs. 3%; p = 0.001). Conclusion: A number of clinical differences were seen in public vs. private sector patients with bacteraemic pneumococcal pneumonia in Gauteng, South Africa. Rates of antibiotic resistance were much lower than previously reported from South Africa. The only differences noted were higher rates of resistance to erythromycin and clindamycin in the private sector (possible erm gene mutation as mechanism of macrolide resistance).","Promptly after the SARS epidemic, the Chinese government accelerated the establishment of an effectual and national unified management system for public health emergencies and enacted two laws: the Regulation on Public Health Emergency and the Measures for the Administration of Information Reporting on Monitoring Public Health Emergencies and Epidemic Situation of Infectious Diseases [18, 19]. In addition to defining the standards and grades of public health emergencies, these laws support the construction of command systems and clarify the responsibilities and the leadership role of the chief executive of central and local governments previously held by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Accordingly, the executive capacity of the command systems has been much improved. Importantly, China also established an emergency information dissemination system to enable timely (within 2 hours), accurate, and comprehensive release of information. Moreover, both central and local governments are now expected to be prepared for a public health emergency response (e.g., techniques, personnel, materials, and management preparedness).","Beginning with a regional focus on a single parasite, the CDC has become the premier public health agency in the world, and its expertise has expanded in direct correlation with the expanding view of public health needs. The emerging concerns of the new centurygenomics, globalization, the built environment, information technology, global warming, emerging infections, violence, and so onwill require not only the traditional disciplines but also new expertise and new global partners, both public and private. What will remain the same at the CDC is the dedication to its mission in global public health and its adherence to the core values of accountability, integrity, and respect. The new century has already proven challenging and exciting, a situation that CDC anticipates eagerly.","Stockpiles. Stockpiles are, put simply, an artificial enhancement to current market demand levels in anticipation of periods when supply will be insufficient to meet demand. 2 Government funding of vendor-managed stockpiles of childhood vaccines ensures that some excess vaccine supply is always available to buffer supply problems when they occur. Currently, the United States has a large enough stockpile of smallpox vaccine to vaccinate every person in the country who might need it in the event of an emergency. 70 The government also expects to stockpile nearly 8 million doses of an investigational vaccine against pandemic influenza, and studies are under way to develop mechanisms that could stretch that supply to cover more than one-third of the population. 71 CDC also maintains a large anthrax vaccine stockpile. Advance market commitments. Advance market commitments involve donors who commit to buying yet-to-be-developed vaccines in bulk for poor nations if drug makers are able to deliver a vaccine that meets specifications and a price can be settled on in advance. 72 Supporters of advance market commitments range from the GAVI partners to Pope Benedict XVI. Donors have agreed to test this mechanism for a vaccine for pneumococcal disease. To date, the Gates Foundation, the United Kingdom, Italy, Canada, Norway, and Russia have committed a total of $1.5 billion for the project. Vaccine bonds. The United Kingdom has taken a lead in promoting an International Financing Facility for Immunization (IFFIm) 69 IFFIm has raised more than $1 billion in capital markets to immunize poor children in developing nations against Reviews VACCINE POLICY vaccine-preventable diseases. 73 IFFIm plans to invest $4 billion over the next decade to immunize 500 million people who would not otherwise be protected from diseases that no longer represent public health threats in developed countries. 73 The IFFIm mechanism concentrates on the funding for vaccine research by using long-term government commitments as security bonds issued in the capital markets. The cash received for the bonds then can be used for research and future purchase of vaccines. Whenever the bonds are issued, IFFIm pays bondholders a modest rate of interest. As money pledged by donor governments becomes available gradually over 30 years, these funds will be used to repay the capital value of the bonds. 69 IFFIm was able to double the resources GAVI has been able to allocate-$945.6 million in 2007 compared with $418.3 million in 2006. 74 Vaccine financing programs. Historically, the U.S. immunization system has been financed through public-private sector partnerships. The public sector purchases vaccines for approximately 55% of the birth cohort. 75 Section 317 (a federal discretionary grant program to all states), the Vaccines for Children (VFC) Act of 1993 (P.L. 103-66), and state funds are major public sector sources for vaccine financing. Private sector vaccine purchases are covered through private health insurance and account for 45% to 50% of the pediatric vaccines sold annually in the United States. 75 The federal government has played an evolving role in building the immunization structure in the United States. The earliest legislation pertaining to vaccine financing is the Social Security Act of 1935. Title V of this act pertains to immunization services for children and their mothers. In 1963, Congress enacted the Vaccine Assistance Act (Section 317 of the Public Health Service Act). This legislation provided grants to social service agencies and local health departments for immunization infrastructure and vaccine purchases. 41 However, barriers to immunization access still remained in some areas as a result of considerable variability in immunization efforts by state and local governments.","Kruk et al. 4 described health resilience as \"the capacity of health actors, institutions, and populations to prepare for and effectively respond to crises; maintain core functions when a crisis hits; and, informed by lessons learned during the crisis.\" To date, Taiwan has been able to react in an orderly and coherent fashion. Our ongoing action to control the spread has been the collaborative work of the private and public sector, key players at the national and local levels, and shared knowledge amongst different expertise ranging from transportation, immigration, economic affairs, labor, education, and healthcare.","The scope of community pharmacy practice varies considerably across countries, [9] [10] [11] and in some instances pharmacists' expertise is undoubtedly underutilised. Therefore, in the midst of a public health crisis of the current magnitude, it is important to examine roles and activities that community pharmacists can undertake to help in relieving pressure in other areas of the health service, such as general practice and emergency departments. This is particularly relevant as various health services are now being restricted (e.g. routine health https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sapharm.2020.03.015 Received 24 March 2020; Accepted 24 March 2020 checks and medication reviews, non-urgent elective surgeries) to free up resources to deal with the COVID-19 pandemic, 12,13 some of which community pharmacists could assist with. This article seeks to highlight additional roles and activities to those relating to the public health response (as outlined in Table 1 ) that can be undertaken by community pharmacists and could help to alleviate pressure on general practice and other areas of the health service.","Corporation, a not-for-profit organization working in the public interest as an operator of multiple federally funded research and development centers (FFRDCs). She is focused on the sustainability of the biodefense industrial base and the public-private partnerships that are vital to national and global health security. ","Since the 2001 anthrax alert in the United States (23 American case patients, 5 deaths, and approximately 2500 anthrax-suspect patients in France) and the international severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2003, an organization has been developed in France to address the clinical management of patients suspected of having an infectious disease (ID) related to a natural epidemic or an intentional biological risk (\"Epidemic and Biological Risk\"-EBR). The response to nuclear, radiological, biological, and chemical risks in France is organized through 12 civil zones of defense (2003 application decree). In each zone 1-2 hospitals are identified as a reference for these risks (16 reference hospitals, among which the military reference center of the Paris -\u00cele-de-France zone and the Guadeloupe-associated reference hospital were included) as presented in Fig. 1 [1] . For biological risks, each of these hospitals has a dedicated ID department, reference microbiology laboratory, zonal prehospital emergency medical service unit (SAMU center 15) including the medical regulation of emergency calls, and departments which include infection control unit, intensive care unit, and a pharmacy involved in the care of these patients. EBR alerts might lead to disruption within the public health sector and the society related to fear of transmission and to the potential negative socio-economic impacts [2] . Immediate access to ID expertise was requested by frontline healthcare workers (HCWs), especially SAMU Center 15 which is responsible for centralized medical calls in France. It is unlikely that EBR-suspect patients would present themselves directly to one of the reference centers identified by the health authorities; they would rather first consult other closer health facilities within the national health system. Therefore, the need for a multidisciplinary network to deliver the operational expertise to frontline HCWs for initial patient management (mainly SAMU Center 15, in-hospital emergency departments, and family physicians [FPs]) was urgent. The 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic highlighted the importance for timely delivery of appropriate care to patients and for informing the general population about means of protection. This reinforced the concept that the mid/long-term outcome of an epidemic depends heavily on adequate and coherent coordination of individual care and collective measures, decisions and actions undertaken during the initial phase of the alert. In 2009, a dedicated regional EBR Coordination unit (Coordination op\u00e9rationnelle du risque \u00e9pid\u00e9mique et biologique [COREB] ) was created in Paris -\u00cele-de-France. In 2012, the French Infectious Diseases Society (SPILF) established a national SPILF-COREB-Emergences (SCE) group to coordinate ID specialists' response to EBR in collaboration with other key stakeholders, such as other specialists and institutions.","As of 26 January 2020, 30 provinces have initiated a level-1 public health response to control COVID-19 [22]. A level-1 response means that during the occurrence of a particularly serious public health emergency, the provincial headquarters shall organize and coordinate the emergency response work within its administrative area according to the decision deployment and unified command of the State Council [22]. Fever observation rooms shall be set up at stations, airports, ports, and so on to detect the body temperature of passengers entering and leaving the area and implement observation/registration for the suspicious patients. The government under its jurisdiction shall, in accordance with the law, take compulsory measures to restrict all kinds of the congregation, and ensure the supply of living resources. They will also ensure the sufficient supply of masks, disinfectants, and other protective articles on the market, and standardize the market order. The strengthening of public health surveillance, hygiene knowledge publicity, and monitoring of public places and key groups is required. Comprehensive medical institutions and some specialized hospitals should be prepared to accept COVID-19 patients to ensure that severe and critical cases can be differentiated, diagnosed, and effectively treated in time. The health administration departments, public health departments, and medical institutions at all (province, city, county, district, township, and street) levels, and social organizations shall function in epidemic prevention and control and provide guidance for patients and close contact families for disease prevention [23].","Whilst strong epidemiology and surveillance systems are indispensable tools for the detection and monitoring of outbreaks and public health emergencies, strong primary care systems form the foundation of any emergency response. In the UK, primary care handles over 95% of all health system activity. WHO member states have repeatedly affirmed their commitment to developing their primary care systems with a view to training up community-based health professionals who are able to provide care across the spectrum of prevention, preparedness, response, and recovery. As the 'front door' of the health system, primary care professionals should be involved in planning and action for health emergency risk management. WONCA (the global professional body for family medicine) has actively championed the ways in which primary care can be supported to deliver care during population emergencies. National primary care bodies can coordinate with public health leads to cascade information to practitioners, communicate with the public, and collate health intelligence from the frontline primary care. 8 The Ebola crisis taught us a valuable lesson about what happens when an outbreak takes health workers away from core functions to focus on crisis response; the number of people who died from reduced access to usual care probably exceeded the number killed by the virus. 9 Strong health systems built on comprehensive primary care are able to integrate both functions, disseminating the emergency response resources and information required to community-level staff who have the breadth of training required to manage new suspected cases alongside routine family medicine. Decent access to primary health care is essential in health emergencies, and its infrastructure crucial for containment, 10 just as good access to high-quality primary care is at the foundation of any strong health system. 11","In order to reduce the risk of negative psychological outcomes caused by the COVID-19 outbreak and promote social stability, the National Health Commission of China (NHC) has integrated psychological crisis intervention into the general deployment of disease prevention. On the 27th January, 2020, the central health authority issued the 'Principles for Emergency Psychological Crisis Intervention for COVID-19 Pneumonia Epidemic' 19. The Principle addressed that the guidelines should be implemented under the guidance of trained mental health professionals. Expert teams at province, autonomous region, and municipality level should take up the lead and responsibility on psychological crisis intervention and related activities. The mental health-related national associations and academic societies are required to adopt emergency psychological crisis interventions, psychological counseling and establish psychological assistance expert groups to provide professional guidance and coordinate with health authorities.","Funding from the Public Health Agency of Canada to Dr. Darwyn Kobasa and Dr. Steven Theriault was used to complete this work. This research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public, commercial or not for profit sectors.","Mobilizing community leaders, artists, athletes, and local role models would help to convey a 190 unique message to the population, and to gather support from the wealthy that could provide 191 resources to expand the production of medical equipment.

It is a response to a dilemma: when health crises occur, many countries promise financial support but do not pay. The call for cash-on-demand intensified during the 2014-16 west African Ebola pandemic, and the World Bank issued the world's first pandemic bond in July, 2017, raising $425 million from private investors. The financial terms of the pandemic bond are complex, but, in short, large private investors (rather than nationstates) put money in up-front for 3 years. If a qualifying pandemic occurs during that time, some of the money is disbursed for pandemic response. Otherwise, the investors get their money back plus interest of 10% or more. 8 Everyone concerned with public health agrees that pre-committed pandemic funds are a good idea. However, growing uncertainty about how best to pay for health emergencies of international concern has brought previous health and humanitarian risk management strategies into question. In the past, governments and philanthropies mitigated all kinds of risks, from disease outbreaks to droughts. Since the 1970s, however, private sector involvement in civic problem-solving has increased. The pandemic bond is an iteration of the trend of turning to the private sector for global health and humanitarian funding solutions. The predominant ideologies of public health and the financial sectors, however, differ greatly.","Real-time RT-PCR is widely deployed in diagnostic virology. In the case of a public health emergency, proficient diagnostic laboratories can rely on this robust technology to establish new diagnostic tests within their routine services before pre-formulated assays become available. In addition to information on reagents, oligonucleotides and positive controls, laboratories working under quality control programmes need to rely on documentation of technical qualification of the assay formulation as well as data from external clinical evaluation tests. The provision of control RNA templates has been effectively implemented by the EVAg project that provides virus-related reagents from academic research collections [18]. SARS-CoV RNA was retrievable from EVAg before the present outbreak; specific products such as RNA transcripts for the here-described assays were first retrievable from the EVAg online catalogue on 14 January 2020 (https://www.european-virus-archive.com). Technical qualification data based on cell culture materials and synthetic constructs, as well as results from exclusivity testing on 75 clinical samples, were included in the first version of the diagnostic protocol provided to the WHO on 13 January 2020. Based on efficient collaboration in an informal network of laboratories, these data were augmented within 1 week comprise testing results based on a wide range of respiratory pathogens in clinical samples from natural infections. Comparable evaluation studies during regulatory qualification of in vitro diagnostic assays can take months for organisation, legal implementation and logistics and typically come after the peak of an outbreak has waned. The speed and effectiveness of the present deployment and evaluation effort were enabled by national and European research networks established in response to international health crises in recent years, demonstrating the enormous response capacity that can be released through coordinated action of academic and public laboratories [18-22]. This laboratory capacity not only supports immediate public health interventions but enables sites to enrol patients during rapid clinical research responses.","Macau confirmed its first case of the 2019-nCoV infection on 22 January 2020 1 and as of Feb 8, 2020, there were 10 confirmed cases in the city. 2 The 2019-nCoV is a novel strain of coronavirus that was first detected in the city of Wuhan, in the province of Hubei China. With cases confirmed earlier in its neighboring cities of Shenzhen and Zhuhai in mainland China, the small city is vulnerable to the spread of the virus and has escalated the health emergency preparedness and response arrangements soon after the reports about a cluster of pneumonia-like illnesses with unknown causes in Wuhan came into light in the end of December 2019. On January 5, 2020, the local government swiftly took the lead in coordinating and communicating actions across various sectors. 3 To support infection prevention and control overseen by the health department, departments of economy and finance, police service and customs, information, tourism, gaming, social welfare, consumer protection, municipal affairs, education formed partnerships to step up border control and surveillance, execute isolation and quarantine measures, promote personal and environmental hygiene, ensure medical and daily supply stability and monitor the pricing, deliver public and tourist education, and disseminate accurate up-to-date information on a unified platform. This echoed the recommendations made in the 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nConV): Strategic Preparedness and Response Plan published by the World Health Organization on February 3, 2020. 4 During the previous 6 weeks, the stages of \"preparedness\", \"high risk of imported cases\", \"imported cases\" and possibly \"local transmission\" in an infection outbreak had been experienced. The highest alert is now on to try to avoid or minimize the last stage of \"community transmission\", a highly challenging task considering the possible existence of super spreaders. 5 At a professional level, while many doctors and nurses were fighting the uphill battle in the frontline, pharmacists at community settings also played an important part in the prevention of the spread of the 2019-nCoV outbreak and contributed to the overall emergency management. Apart from ensuring the stable supply of key medicines and becoming the information hub about the coronavirus infection, being the most common first point of contact, community pharmacists were also charged with the responsibility of early detection and appropriate referral. They also played a key role in implementing the government arrangement of \"The Guaranteed Mask Supply for Macao Residents Scheme\" which highlighted the importance of public-private partnerships and data exchange at times of emergency. On January 30, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the emergence of 2019-nCoV a public health emergency of international concern calling on all countries to take urgent measures to contain the respiratory disease 6 as the spread has already extended to at least 24 countries. 7 It is speculated that pharmacists in many cities and countries are finding their ways to contribute to the collaborative forces in combating the spread of the virus. On February 5, 2020, the International Pharmaceutical Federation (FIP) issued the \"Coronavirus 2019-nCoV outbreak: Information and interim guidelines for pharmacists and the pharmacy workforce\" to provide relevant information and guidelines on coronavirus outbreaks for pharmacists and the pharmacy workforce. 8 This paper aimed to improve the understanding of community pharmacists' role in case of 2019-CoV outbreak by sharing the experiences in Macau in consultation with the FIP guideline.","The second building block is financing. Before the decree, central government adopted a series of financial measures to support the health system and protect businesses. It had allocated \u20ac2800 million to all regions for health services and created a new fund with \u20ac1000 million for priority health interventions. 4 However, these amounts need to be seen against the background of almost a decade of austerity from which the health system has yet to recover. 5 Third, in service delivery, the national Ministry of Health has developed a set of clinical protocols, published on its website. Additional advice is published by certain regions and updated, in some cases, on a daily basis. 6 Health facilities in the worst affected regions are struggling, with inadequate intensive care capacity and an insufficient number of ventilators in particular. Both Catalonia and Madrid 7 have cancelled non-emergency surgery and cleared beds where possible. COVID-19 telephone help lines have long delays or have simply collapsed in some regions. The new decree allows the regions to take over management of private health services while military installations will be used for public health purposes.","To efficiently cope with the 2019-nCoV outbreak, the Chinese Government has implemented rapid and comprehensive public health emergency interventions. To date, all of the 31 provincial-level regions in mainland China with confirmed 2019-nCoV cases have activated socalled level 1 public health emergency responses (ie, the highest level of emergency public health alerts and responses within the national public health management system). 6 The provincial governments are responsible for organising, coordinating, and handling all emergency public health treatments, disclosing information, and gathering emergency materials and facilities under the guidance of the State Council. For health-care sectors, in addition to public health interventions, dealing with public psychological barriers and performing psychological crisis intervention is included in the level 1 response. The National Health Commission has released guidelines for local authorities to promote psychological crisis intervention for patients, medical personnel, and people under medical observation during the 2019-nCoV outbreak. 7 Peking University is preparing a mental health handbook for the public that describes how to deal with stress and other psychological problems occurring due to the outbreak of 2019-nCoV. 8 The Chinese Government strives to improve the public's awareness of prevention and intervention strategies by providing daily updates about surveillance and active cases on websites and social media. Increasingly, psychologists and psychiatrists use the internet and social media (eg, WeChat, Weibo, etc) to share strategies for dealing with psychological stress. For example, experts from Peking University Sixth Hospital made six suggestions for the public to cope with mental stress. 9 These included assessing the accuracy of information disclosed, enhancing social support systems (eg, families and friends), eliminating stigma associated with the epidemic, maintaining a normal life under safe conditions, and using the psychosocial service system, particularly telephone-based and internet-based counselling for health-care staff, patients, family members, and the public. Numerous psychiatric hospitals, psychological counselling centres, and psychology departments within universities have launched specialised hotlines to provide psychological counselling services for people in need. 7 We believe that including mental health care in the national public health emergency system will empower China and the world during the campaign to contain and eradicate 2019-nCoV.","In addition to the many lessons that have been learned from the SARS epidemic numerous questions remain. Because this new coronavirus is sufficiently transmissible to cause a large epidemic, it requires that good, basic public health measures be in place. Questions remain about the accuracy of case reports, especially because in many instances the data are poor and instances of underdiagnosis and misdiagnosis are almost inevitable during an outbreak of a new disease. Other questions concern the evident heterogeneity in transmission, especially in light of the extreme instances of transmission in which single individuals apparently infected as many as 300 others. Yet another concern is whether global eradication of SARS can be established. 15 Table 4 . Concerns Identified by WHO as Result of SARS 1. Inadequate surge capacity in hospitals and public health systems 2. Healthcare providers themselves being the victims of the disease 3. Shortage of expert staff to coordinate national and global responses to a rapidly evolving public health emergency 4. In some cases, the need for hasty construction of new facilities; in other cases, hospitals being closed 5. The power of poorly understood infectious diseases to incite widespread public anxiety and fear, social unease, economic losses, and unwarranted discrimination","Much of what is considered social media is a volatile resource, yet a very valuable one. There is an understanding of the volatility of this non-peer reviewed medium but also a perception that social media is a place only for \"selfies\" and not science. Tweets can disappear to search after a short period, blog pages can come and go and be untraceably altered while online mainstream news stories, in some countries more than others, may suffer similar fates as they rapidly become old news. Despite that, internet-driven information has played a vital role in rapidly tracking and unearthing cases, clusters and outbreaks of disease in recent years. This has been the case for MERS globally. At this stage, many who follow infectious disease clusters, outbreaks and pandemics through social media are well informed by exposure to a distillation of the most recent events, reports, commentary and news stories from all over the world. Professionals who use this communication medium are clearly appreciated by their funding stakeholders, the public. Social media and blogs communicate with a much broader audience than is usually reached by the traditional scientific literature and they are more accessible to the local and global communities who contribute to the funds that researchers so dearly seek. Sometimes these forms of mass communication are useful to those seeking information about a disease outbreak in their own country. Sometimes they are entirely misleading. The public audience may not spend the time and mostly do not have the background expertise to interpret the densely presented, often slow to appear, scientific and public health literature. The space between the scientific literature and mainstream media is occupied by those science communicators who may, sometimes with and sometimes without relevant scientific training, be as up-to-date on their topics as the best academic epidemiologist. The President John F. Kennedy quote, \"One person can make a difference, and everyone should try\" seems an apt one to describe these dedicated people who, often without any paid incentives, devote their personal time, effort and money to better understand and communicate about infectious disease. Frequently updated data repositories such as the small FluTrackers group constantly compile, actively curate and condense worldwide news sources into threads of information that often assemble into patterns that can predict emerging infectious disease events well before they reach the mainstream media, and their line list of MERS-CoV detections (Ministry of Health, Saudi Arabia. 2014) has been a cornerstone of case numbering, detail and clarity; Crawford Kilian's H5N1 blog (Kilian, 2014) outstrips its name by providing links to other reliable sources as well as excerpts and highly eloquent and thought-provoking commentary on a range of microbial infectious disease stories, of which MERS-CoV is just one; Michael Coston's Avian Flu Diary (Coston, 2014 ) also focusses and comments on emerging infectious diseases augmented by astute and experienced public health commentary, resources and a large inventory of past posts that are used to good effect when creating new and informative ones; the Programme for Monitoring Emerging Diseases (ProMED) is an internet-based reporting system maintained by a panel of authoritative professionals and rapporteurs who prepare daily digests of the latest infectious disease happenings which they freely circulate using widely read emails (Program for Monitoring Emerging Diseases, 2014); for a more workforce-oriented view of MERS and infectious disease, Shane Granger's Random Analytics provides an excellent perspective of the less frequently discussed impact of infectious diseases on humans (Granger, 2012) ; my own blog, Virology Down Under seeks to distill some of the more complex virology-related happenings and present data on emerging viral disease in a more graphical, accessible and open access way (Mackay, 1997 (Mackay, , 2013 ; Maia Majumder who applies an engineering systems expertise to the epidemiology of the disease (Majumder, 2014) . These are just a few resources and each is part of an interconnected web of other sources, contacts and personal experience that exist on the internet; they have all chased and tracked the emergence of MERS-CoV as doggedly as a professional science writer. Each resource is as distinct yet complimentary source of information that together are sometimes referred to as flublogia. While it is often overlooked and perhaps underestimated by some professional scientists and clinicians, flublogia compiles or uses publicly available, deidentified data and adds publicly relevant interpretation which is greatly appreciated, much more widely read and far, far more often cited than anything seen in the professional scientific literature. It is also a factual source of such information Salathe et al., 2013) .","Just two days after the emergency panel at the ASA, Jeremy Farrar, Director of the Wellcome Trust, convened a meeting of around 30 public health specialists and researchers, including Leach, on the UK's response to the epidemic. Discussions took place on the funding and organisation of the anthropological response. The Government was already drawing on the expertise and capacity of Public Health England (PHE), the Ministry of Defence (MOD) and the Department of Health (DoH), to drive its response but social scientists had no seat at the table. The Government's Chief Medical Officer (CMO) Sally Davies called a meeting of the Ebola Scientific Assessment and Response Group (ESARG), on the 19th September, focused on issues which included community transmission of Ebola. Leach's inclusion as the sole anthropologist was largely thanks to Farrar and Chris Whitty, DFID's Chief Scientific Advisor (M Leach, 2014). There was already broad acceptance of the need for the response to focus on community engagement and the WHO had been issuing guidance on how to engage and what kind of messaging to use for those living in the worst affected areas (WHO, 2014c) . In their account of these events three of the central actors from the UK's anthropological community describe how momentum gathered quickly and that: \"it felt as if we were pushing at an open door\" (F. Martineau et al., 2017, 481) .","1. Leaders of major law enforcement and private security organizations should make a formal commitment to cooperation. The goal will be for \"the implementation of sustainable public-private partnerships\" to mitigate terrorism, public disorder, and crime. 2. DHS or DoJ or both should fund research and training on relevant legislation, private security, and law enforcement in public security cooperation. 3. DHS or DoJ or both should create an advisory council to oversee day-to-day implementation issues of law enforcement/private security partnerships. 4. DHS or DoJ or both, plus other organizations, should convene key practitioners to move this agenda forward. 5. Local partnerships should set priorities and address key problems as identified by this summit.","Significant contributions to global health and infectious disease control have also been made through private-sector support. A leading example is the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (www .gatesfoundation.org), a privately funded effort begun in 2000 focused on reducing health disparities across the world and helping to address the global health challenges outlined by the 2000 Millennium Development Goals (www.un.org/millenniumgoals). Priorities for the Gates Foundation include efforts to reduce HIV infection/AIDS, malaria, tuberculosis, vaccine-preventable diseases, diarrheal diseases, pneumonia, and neglected infectious diseases. Other important global health initiatives supported by both government and nongovernment donors include the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunizations (GAVI Alliance; www.gavialliance.org) and the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria (www.theglobalfund.org). Two large U.S.-led efforts, the President's Malaria Initiative (PMI; www .fightingmalaria.gov) and the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR; www.pepfar.gov) provide targeted prevention and treatment support in countries most heavily affected by these leading killers. In particular, the impact of PEPFAR has been dramatic. Begun in 2004, the program requires country ownership and results-based efforts with goals for sustainability. In 2011 alone, PEPFAR supported treatment of nearly 4 million people, supported antiretroviral therapy for more than 1.5 HIV-infected pregnant women to prevent perinatal infection, and supported diagnostic testing for more than 40 million individuals. 509 Although national and global partnerships are critical to controlling infectious disease threats, local clinical, public health, and laboratory capacity remains the cornerstone for initial disease recognition and response. In the early 1980s, concerns by staff in the CDC's","Although public attention often focuses on CDC's infectious diseases and preparedness activities, most Americans will die from chronic diseases, such as heart disease, cancer, chronic lower respiratory diseases, and stroke. Common underlying risk factors for these conditions include tobacco use, uncontrolled hypertension, poor diet, physical inactivity, and high blood cholesterol. Surveillance systems supported by CDC, including the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, and the National Health Interview Survey, measure the prevalence of these conditions and risk factors and track these data over time. The Million Hearts Initiative, led by CDC and including other federal partners, aims to prevent 1 million heart attacks and strokes between 2012 and 2017 through a combination of public health interventions (reduction of smoking and intake of trans fat and sodium) and clinical interventions (improved blood pressure control and hypertension management, increasing aspirin use for high-risk individuals). CDC also leads the National Diabetes Prevention Program, a public-private partnership to prevent or delay the onset of type 2 diabetes in persons with pre-diabetes.","Plant pathogens are recognized as major constraints to agriculture production worldwide. Most fruit and nut crops; major food crops such as potato, cassava, sweet potatoes; and many ornamentals are vegetatively propagated, using cuttings, tubers, or rhizomes. More recently, tissue culture propagation has become a major component of mass propagation for many of these crops. Elaborate protocols are used to eliminate targeted pathogens from one or a few infected plants to provide a source of plant material free of these pathogens (Mink et al., 1998; Laimer and Barba, 2011) . Plants entering a certification program are often advanced selections, cultivars, or varieties developed in breeding programs. In some cases breeders work closely with the cleanup programs and get plants into the testing and cleanup phase before cultivar release, in an effort to have certified plants available at the time of release. Another source of material entering certification programs are 'heritage' cultivarscultivars that have not been used for many years but are maintained at germplasm repositories. As requests for these cultivars have increased, there is a need to confirm that they meet current certification standards before commercial nurseries are willing to add them to their production systems. In the United States, there is an effort to have new cultivars coming into the country, as well as those developed in-country go through one of the 'clean plant centers' that have been developed over the past 50 years. Increased funding for these programs at the federal level since 2009 has provided for capacity building and the ability to process materials in a more timely manner to meet the needs for food production. These plants are tested for target pathogens before they enter into a G1 block, then a certification program and made available for production. In many cases, the G1 block is maintained by federal, provincial, or state government agencies, or some type of government/private entity, though recently private companies are maintaining their own proprietary G1 germplasm. These plants are tested on a predetermined schedule to monitor for reinfection, in addition, these blocks are retested if a new virus is discovered in the crop that may have been missed with the testing procedures used previously.","One solution is to authorize ambulance transport for these patients from their homes to hemodialysis facilities, but this would likely require substantial support from the state and federal governments given local regulations and recent cuts in reimbursement for non-emergency basic life support transports to and from dialysis facilities. 14 Optimally, collaboration can be enhanced between dialysis facilities and current transportation services to improve driver education, enhance infection prevention, and strengthen communication regarding managing risk of COVID-19 transmission and potential exposures.","This research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public, commercial, or not-for profit sectors.","This research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors.","This research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors.

Africa needs to continue its upward trajectory of activities so as to align public health resources, scientific expertise and experience, and political commitment so that any future infectious disease outbreaks can be stopped before they become an epidemic in Africa. Africa needs more investments into ONE-HEALTH collaborative activities across the continent in order to meet the challenges of current and future public health threats (Kock R,et al 2019; Petersen E et al, 2019; Talisuna AO et al, 2020; Hui DS et al, 2020; Zumla A et al, 2016) . A whole new young generation of enthusiastic, committed and dedicated African public health workers, epidemiologists, researchers, healthcare workers and laboratory personnel have emerged over the past 5 years, and they need to be supported by security of funding to build their careers and sustain their take forward their research and training portfolios. The future of Africa's public health security relies on them. Increased governmental and donor investments are required to advance locally led, world-class public health work with surveillance, data and analytics capabilities and further expanding state-of-the-art laboratory capacities with more J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f trained personnel to sustain capacity to rapidly respond to outbreaks at their source. A wellplanned long-term strategy from the Africa Union will add major value for consolidating African leadership of public health capacity building, training and research.","\u2022 The non\u2013profit International Medica Foundation has developed the first rotavirus vaccine suitable for newborn babies. The vaccine\u2013preventable rotavirus can cause life\u2013threatening diarrhoea. In developing countries, it is more common amongst babies and younger children compared to developed countries. In China alone, it causes 4900 deaths and 329 000 hospitalisations of children and infants, causing more than half a million deaths worldwide. Existing rotavirus vaccinations are expensive to produce, transport and store, carry higher risks of intestinal blockages, and are unsuitable for newborn babies. The new vaccination overcomes these problems, and is suitable for global use. They have been sub\u2013licensed to Shanghai BravoBio Co. Ltd of China, a private biotechnology company based in Shanghai, for use in China. The Foundation is now seeking more private sector partners to extend global coverage. (WSJ, 27 Jun 2013)","Shortly thereafter, at the end of January 2016, the Kikwete Panel finalized its own report titled \u201cProtecting Humanity from Future Health Crises\u201d, recommending a final set of 27 measures to avert a future global pandemic, specifically noting that the risk of a highly pathogenic influenza virus was a chief concern [42]. Recommendations from the panel carry on similar themes to prior panel recommendations and are grouped into national, regional/sub-regional, and international-level recommendations, as well as sub-themes of development and health, R&amp;D, financing, and follow-up and implementation recommendations. Chief among them included forming a Centre for Emergency Preparedness and Response within WHO, advancing full implementation of the IHR, securing appropriate financing for the WHO Centre and IHR compliance, and having WHO oversee the establishment of a fund and priority list to support R&amp;D for neglected communicable diseases [42]. In addition, the panel strongly emphasized the need for a clear line of command within the UN system to coordinate a global response to a health and humanitarian emergency and more bodly  recommended the establishment of a High-level Council on Global Public Health Crises housed within the UN General Assembly [42]. Similar to the Interim Panel and CGHRF, the Kikwete Panel offered its strong endorsement of WHO as the \u201csingle\u201d global health leader, but also noted that should the WHO fail to successfully reform or be empowered by its member states, that an \u201calternate\u201d UN institutional response mechanism(s) might be necessary [42].","In conclusion, it still remains a challenging task to fight the 2019-nCoV of unknown origin and mysterious biological features, and to control an outbreak of COVID-19 with such a high R0, a long incubation period and a short serial interval, by limited treatment and prevention measures. Lessons learned from the MERS and SARS outbreaks can provide valuable insight into how to handle the current pandemic. The successful public health outbreak response tactics of Chinese government, such as hand hygiene, wearing masks, isolation, quarantine, social distancing, and community containment, can be copied by other countries according to their national situation. As the pandemic is still ongoing and expanding, experiences and research literatures from China and other countries will increase. The 2019-nCoV should be monitored of any possible gene variation of antigenic drift or antigenic conversion, to avoid another round of outbreak. Another lessons from this pandemic will be awe for nature and love for life. Funding Source: This research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors.","One of the critical lessons from the SARS experience was the absolute necessity to be able to coordinate the international resources that are available in an outbreak and to get them focussed on identifying priorities and solving problems. The WHO established the means to do this for SARS and it has since been further developed and integrated into global preparedness, especially after the West Africa Ebola epidemic. Organisations such as the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN), the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), the Global Research Collaboration For Infectious Disease Preparedness (GloPID-R) and the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID) have been supported by the WHO Research Blueprint and its Global Coordinating Mechanism to provide a forum where those with the expertise and capacity to contribute to managing new threats can come together both between and during outbreaks to develop innovative solutions to emerging problems. This global coordination has been active in the novel coronavirus outbreak. WHO's response system includes three virtual groups based on those developed for SARS to collate real time information to inform real time guidelines, and a first candidate vaccine is ready for laboratory testing within 4 weeks of the virus being identified.","2. Distancing through cancellation of events and suspension of educational/commercial/religious activities: a. \" school_closure \": A policy that closes school and other educational services in that area. b. \" business_closure \": A policy that closes all offices, non-essential businesses, and non-essential commercial activities in that area. \"Non-essential\" services are defined by area. c. \" religious_closure\" : A policy that prohibits gatherings at a place of worship, specifically targeting locations that are epicenters of COVID-19 outbreak. See the section on Korean policy for more information on this policy variable. d. \" work_from_home \": A policy that requires people to work remotely. This policy may also include encouraging workers to take holiday/paid time off. e. \" event_cancel \": A policy that cancels a specific pre-scheduled large event (e.g. parade, sporting event, etc). This is different from prohibiting all events over a certain size. f. \" no_gathering \": A policy that prohibits any type of public or private gathering.","Translation of research evidence to programme and policy agenda has been a major constraint to ensure evidence-based practices. Genereux, Lafontaine and Eukelbosh [15] identified some key determinants that facilitate knowledge-to-action strategies for better community health risk preparedness. The team argued that blending traditional and modern approaches, fostering community engagement, cultivating relationships, investing in preparedness and recovery, putting knowledge into practice, and availability of human and financial resources are key successful factors for integrating expertise and research in disaster management practice. Yet, a lack of emergency preparedness often exacerbates the underlying community health risks in resource-deficit minority-based areas in times of crisis and emergencies. Ho, Chan, Lam et al. [16] showed indicators capturing perceived water security in the non-emergency/normal period might not be associated with Health-EDRM preparedness attitude and coping ability in a water-stressed rural context of PRC China. Chan, Lam, Lo et al. [17] showed food-labelling and perceptions of food-related health risk might be influenced by face-to-face health education interventions and should be considered as a core emergency preparedness and health risk reduction management strategy to strengthen bottom-up resilience in minority communities. Kamara, Akombi, Agho et al. [18] conducted a systematic review of resilience and well-being evidence in southern Africa and showed disaster risk reduction interventions that were based only on Western modelled or scientific warning systems might undervalue traditional warning insights and undermine intrinsic and community capacities. To strengthen resilience and well-being outcomes, efforts should be invested to ensure household, community/indigenous knowledge, and government-level capabilities are harnessed. Public health planning models might be instrumental in facilitating the planning for Health-EDRM-related risk reduction efforts in both emergency and non-emergency situations [19,20].","In reflection of the above principles, led by Acute Care Surgeons with familiarity in Disaster Preparedness and Public Health, in conjunction with the incident command structure, and in an effort to keep in mind a prolonged surge of COVID-19 patients, the following Surgery Department COVID-19 Response Plan was created (Table 1 ). This has now been disseminated and adapted to each facility, subspecialty surgical service, and is being pivoted to other specialties such as Pulmonary Critical Care and Internal Medicine within Atrium Health. Key in understanding the response level is your individual facilities incident command response level which follows similar structure set by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). 4, 12 However, new to this schema is ConditionZero which indicates patient surge and acuity beyond the capacity of the infrastructure and manpower available, a scenario currently being experienced in Italy, Iran, and progressively around the world. Advancement to higher tiers should follow incident command structure, but may also be required within individual specialties, departments, or divisions plans given manpower and resource depletion.","Financial incentives. Large, government-funded research and academic institutions play a vital role in basic vaccine research. Public funding of vaccine discovery and early developmental efforts coupled with tax subsidies to private firms can reduce manufacturers' upfront financial outlays substantially and alter return on investment calculations for vaccine research favorably. 2,28 For example, NIH sponsors approximately one-third of all vaccine-related basic research. Most of this funding is in the form of grants to academic institutions and health-related agencies.","Whereas focus on emerging and reemerging infections is paramount, requiring ongoing vigilance and a globally linked infrastructure, priority attention must remain on reducing high-burden infections that account for the majority of disease and disability caused by microbial agents. 5, 6 These efforts should ideally work in tandem, enabling rapid recognition and effective response to emerging infections and other public health emergencies along with implementation of new and proven measures to reduce the burden of endemic infectious diseases and advance global health equity. established in 2000 to address threats from epidemic-prone and emerging infectious threats. GOARN provides an operational framework to ensure the availability of skills, expertise, and resources needed to keep the international community aware of and ready to respond to potential outbreaks. 507 In the aftermath of the 2003 SARS outbreak, the global public health community completed work on new International Health Regulations (IHR), an international treaty that gives the WHO authority over and places requirements on its member states for detecting, reporting, and controlling infectious diseases. 508 Adopted by the World Health Assembly in 2005 and made effective in 2007, the new regulations require prompt reporting of all public health emergencies of international concern, expanding beyond infectious diseases to include events resulting from biological, chemical, or radionuclear threats as well as natural disasters. In addition to reporting of public health emergencies of international concern, the regulations require member states to notify the WHO of a single case of smallpox; poliomyelitis due to wild-type poliovirus; SARS; and human influenza caused by a new subtype. With the goal of controlling health threats at the local level, the new regulations allow for the use of surveillance information beyond official state notification and have established new requirements for member states to support existing global surveillance and response systems and to develop proactive systems for strengthening national and international capacities.","Financial innovation in humanitarian aid is increasing. The next version of the PEF is in development at the World Bank. Other pre-financed models, such as the African Risk Capacity (ARC) mutual sovereign drought insurance pool, use similar parametric modelling mechanisms to trigger release of funds. When ARC's modelling underestimated the number of drought-vulnerable people in Malawi in 2016, its board eventually approved policy exceptions to allow compensatory payouts. However, the PEF has no such flexibility, because it is bound by the bond contract issued to investors. 12 New parametric-based instruments are being developed. The Famine Action Mechanism (FAM) is a new multilateral organisation partnership with Amazon, Microsoft, Google, and the insurance sector. In theory, it will use artificial intelligence to identify impending food crises and trigger the release of the Bank's $1\u00b75 billion in earmarked funds to avert famine through early response. If the PEF and ARC raise concerns about triggering aid through blackboxed technical schemes, concerns will inevitably multiply as profit-driven private technology giants become stakeholders in humanitarian outcomes."],"title":["Vaccine supply, demand, and policy: A primer","The Italian health system and the COVID-19 challenge","Challenges of infectious diseases in the USA","Pandemic Politics: Timing State-Level Social Distancing Responses to COVID-19","2 Core Competencies to Create Effective Protection Programs","Beyond R0: the importance of contact tracing when predicting epidemics","2 Core Competencies to Create Effective Protection Programs","S8 \u2013 S47 and O50 \u2013 O440","Pains and Gains from China's Experiences with Emerging Epidemics: From SARS to H7N9","Centers for Disease Control","Vaccine supply, demand, and policy: A primer","Putting resiliency of a health system to the test: COVID-19 in Taiwan","On the frontline against COVID-19: Community pharmacists\u2019 contribution during a public health crisis","Financing Vaccines for Global Health Security","The French Infectious Diseases Society's readiness and response to epidemic or biological risk\u2013the current situation following the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus and Ebola virus disease alerts","Characteristics of and Public Health Responses to the Coronavirus Disease 2019 Outbreak in China","The coronavirus outbreak: the central role of primary care in emergency preparedness and response","Progression of Mental Health Services during the COVID-19 Outbreak in China","Rapid one-step construction of a Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) infectious clone system by homologous recombination","Demand for hospitalization services for COVID-19 patients in Brazil","Will financial innovation transform pandemic response?","Detection of 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) by real-time RT-PCR","Community pharmacist in public health emergencies: Quick to action against the coronavirus 2019-nCoV outbreak","The resilience of the Spanish health system against the COVID-19 pandemic","2019-nCoV epidemic: address mental health care to empower society","Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS): a review of the history, epidemiology, prevention, and concerns for the future","Middle East respiratory syndrome: An emerging coronavirus infection tracked by the crowd","A disconnected policy network: The UK's response to the Sierra Leone Ebola epidemic","2 Core Competencies to Create Effective Protection Programs","14 Emerging and Reemerging Infectious Disease Threats","Centers for Disease Control","Pathogen-Tested Planting Material","Hemodialysis and COVID-19: An Achilles\u2019 Heel in the Pandemic Healthcare Response in the United States","Coronavirus Disease 2019: Coronaviruses and Blood Safety","Comparison of clinical characteristics of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) as experienced in Taiwan","Prevalence and predictors of PTSS during COVID-19 Outbreak in China Hardest-hit Areas: Gender differences matter","Glycoinformatics approach for identifying target positions to inhibit initial binding of SARS-CoV-2 S1 protein to the host cell","Early chest computed tomography to diagnose COVID-19 from suspected patients: A multicenter retrospective study","Working through the COVID-19 outbreak: Rapid review and recommendations for MSK and allied heath personnel","Is Africa prepared for tackling the COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) epidemic.

These infections have little commercial potential and are not a high priority for the pharmaceutical industry. However, the academic community has been active in this area for many years. The challenge is how to take this academic virology knowledge into a drug discovery and development domain. One approach is the use of consortia and public\u2013private partnerships \u2013 this article highlights ongoing efforts in the USA. Public funds, such as those from government sources, can support research efforts that do not to appear to have commercial value. The key to success is finding a way to combine the different cultural and operational values and reward systems into a productive collaboration to identify new antivirals.","This year marks the 15th anniversary of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in Canada and the 100th anniversary of the 1918 Spanish influenza pandemic. These, and other recent public health events, provide an opportunity for us to review and reflect on the evolution of Canada\u2019s public health emergency response over the past 15 years\u2014from SARS, to the 2009 H1N1 pandemic influenza, to Ebola virus and Zika virus disease. Key lessons have been learned and milestones achieved that have shaped and sharpened our response approach and structures. While SARS was a wake-up-call to strengthen infection prevention and control capacity in health care settings and led to the formation of the Public Health Agency of Canada, it also strengthened our Federal/Provincial/Territorial (FPT) senior-level governance and led to agreements for pan-Canadian mutual aid and infectious disease information sharing. As well, our collective public health laboratory capacity has been strengthened through ongoing ...","Surveillance is essential for communicable disease prevention and control. Traditional notification of demographic and clinical information, about individuals with selected (notifiable) infectious diseases, allows appropriate public health action and is protected by public health and privacy legislation, but is slow and insensitive. Big data\u2013based electronic surveillance, by commercial bodies and government agencies (for profit or population control), which draws on a plethora of internet- and mobile device\u2013based sources, has been widely accepted, if not universally welcomed. Similar anonymous digital sources also contain syndromic information, which can be analysed, using customised algorithms, to rapidly predict infectious disease outbreaks, but the data are nonspecific and predictions sometimes misleading. However, public health authorities could use these online sources, in combination with de-identified personal health data, to provide more accurate and earlier warning of infectio...","To learn how outbreaks of infectious disease are detected and to describe the entities and information systems that together function to identify outbreaks in the U.S., the authors drew on multiple sources of information to create a description of existing surveillance systems and how they interact to detect outbreaks. The results of this analysis were summarized in a system diagram. The authors reviewed a sample of recent outbreaks to determine how they were detected, with reference to the system diagram. The de facto U.S. system for detection of outbreaks consists of five components: the clinical health care system, local/state health agencies, federal agencies, academic/professional organizations, and collaborating governmental organizations. Primary data collection occurs at the level of clinical health care systems and local health agencies. The review of a convenience sample of outbreaks showed that all five components of the system participated in aggregating, analyzing, and sha...","COVID-19 threatens to overwhelm hospital facilities throughout the United States. We created an interactive, quantitative model that forecasts demand for COVID-19 related hospitalization based on county-level population characteristics, data from the literature on COVID-19, and data from online repositories. Using this information as well as user inputs, the model estimates a time series of demand for intensive care beds and acute care beds as well as the availability of those beds. The online model is designed to be intuitive and interactive so that local leaders with limited technical or epidemiological expertise may make decisions based on a variety of scenarios. This complements high-level models designed for public consumption and technically sophisticated models designed for use by epidemiologists. The model is actively being used by several academic medical centers and policy makers, and we believe that broader access will continue to aid community and hospital leaders in their ...","On December 31, 2019, Chinese health officials reported a cluster of cases of acute respiratory illness in persons associated with the Hunan seafood and animal market in the city of Wuhan, Hubei Province, in central China. On January 7, 2020, Chinese health officials confirmed that a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) was associated with this initial cluster (1). As of February 4, 2020, a total of 20,471 confirmed cases, including 2,788 (13.6%) with severe illness,* and 425 deaths (2.1%) had been reported by the National Health Commission of China (2). Cases have also been reported in 26 locations outside of mainland China, including documentation of some person-to-person transmission and one death (2). As of February 4, 11 cases had been reported in the United States. On January 30, the World Health Organization (WHO) Director-General declared that the 2019-nCoV outbreak constitutes a Public Health Emergency of International Concern.(\u2020) On January 31, the U.S. Department of Health and Huma...","As of March 5, 2020, there has been sustained local transmission of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Hong Kong, Singapore, and Japan.1 Containment strategies seem to have prevented smaller transmission chains from amplifying into widespread community transmission. The health systems in these locations have generally been able to adapt,2 , 3 but their resilience could be affected if the COVID-19 epidemic continues for many more months and increasing numbers of people require services. We outline some of the core dimensions of these resilient health systems4 and their responses to the COVID-19 epidemic. First, after variable periods of adaptation, the three locations took actions to manage the outbreak of a new pathogen. Surveillance systems were readjusted to identify potential cases while public health staff identified their contacts. National laboratory networks developed diagnostic tests once the COVID-19 genetic sequences were published5 and laboratory testing capacity was inc...","The rapid spread of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) presents China with a critical challenge. As normal capacity of the Chinese hospitals is exceeded, healthcare professionals struggling to manage this unprecedented crisis face the difficult question of how best to coordinate the medical resources used in highly separated locations. Responding rapidly to this crisis, the National Telemedicine Center of China (NTCC), located in Zhengzhou, Henan Province, has established the Emergency Telemedicine Consultation System (ETCS), a telemedicine-enabled outbreak alert and response network. ETCS is built upon a doctor-to-doctor (D2D) approach, in which health services can be accessed remotely through terminals across hospitals. The system architecture of ETCS comprises three major architectural layers: (1) telemedicine service platform layer, (2) telemedicine cloud layer, and (3) telemedicine service application layer. Our ETCS has demonstrated substantial benefits in terms of the effective...","BACKGROUND: The ongoing outbreak of the recently emerged novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) poses a challenge for public health laboratories as virus isolates are unavailable while there is growing evidence that the outbreak is more widespread than initially thought, and international spread through travellers does already occur. AIM: We aimed to develop and deploy robust diagnostic methodology for use in public health laboratory settings without having virus material available. METHODS: Here we present a validated diagnostic workflow for 2019-nCoV, its design relying on close genetic relatedness of 2019-nCoV with SARS coronavirus, making use of synthetic nucleic acid technology. RESULTS: The workflow reliably detects 2019-nCoV, and further discriminates 2019-nCoV from SARS-CoV. Through coordination between academic and public laboratories, we confirmed assay exclusivity based on 297 original clinical specimens containing a full spectrum of human respiratory viruses. Control material is mad...","Overview Feline coronavirus infection is ubiquitous in domestic cats, and is particularly common where conditions are crowded. While most FCoV-infected cats are healthy or display only a mild enteritis, some go on to develop feline infectious peritonitis, a disease that is especially common in young cats and multi-cat environments. Up to 12% of FCoV-infected cats may succumb to FIP, with stress predisposing to the development of disease. Disease signs The \u2018wet\u2019 or effusive form, characterised by polyserositis (abdominal and/or thoracic effusion) and vasculitis, and the \u2018dry\u2019 or non-effusive form (pyogranulomatous lesions in organs) reflect clinical extremes of a continuum. The clinical picture of FIP is highly variable, depending on the distribution of the vasculitis and pyogranulomatous lesions. Fever refractory to antibiotics, lethargy, anorexia and weight loss are common non-specific signs. Ascites is the most obvious manifestation of the effusive form. Diagnosis The aetiological di...","Abstract Objective To provide a general description of the roles and contributions of three pharmacists from the Regulatory Affairs program (RA) at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) who are involved in emergency preparedness and response activities, including the 2009 pandemic influenza A (H1N1) public health emergency. Setting Atlanta, GA. Practice description RA consists of a staff of nine members, three of whom are pharmacists. The mission of RA is to support CDC's preparedness and emergency response activities and to ensure regulatory compliance for critical medical countermeasures against potential threats from natural, chemical, biological, radiological, or nuclear events. Conclusion RA was well involved in the response to the H1N1 outbreak through numerous activities, such as submitting multiple Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) requests to the Food and Drug Administration, including those for medical countermeasures to be deployed from the Strategic National ...","","Abstract The goal of syndromic surveillance is the earlier detection of epidemics, allowing a timelier public health response than is possible using traditional surveillance methods. Syndromic surveillance application for public health purposes has changed over time and reflects a dynamic evolution from the collection, interpretation of data with dissemination of data to those who need to act, to a more holistic approach that incorporates response as a core component of the surveillance system. Recent infectious disease threats, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), avian influenza (H5N1) and pandemic influenza (H1N1), have all highlighted the need for countries to be rapidly aware of the spread of infectious diseases within a region and across the globe. The International Health Regulations (IHR) obligation to report public health emergencies of international concern has raised the importance of early outbreak detection and response. The emphasis in syndromic surveillance ...","Abstract Context In 2012, the French Infectious Diseases Society (French acronym SPILF) initiated the \u201cCoordination of epidemic and biological risk\u201d (SPILF-COREB - Emergences [SCE]) group to support the readiness and response of healthcare workers (HCWs) to new alerts. Objective To present the SCE group, its functioning, and the main support it provided for frontline HCWs. Methods A multidisciplinary group of heads of infectious disease departments from reference hospitals was created to build a network of clinical expertise for care, training, and research in the field of epidemic and biological risk (EBR). The network developed a set of standardized operational procedures (SOPs) to guide interventions to manage EBR-suspect patients. Results A working group created the SOP aimed at frontline HCWs taking care of patients. Priority was given to the development of a generic procedure, which was then adapted according to the current alert. Five key steps were identified and hierarchized: ...","Abstract This paper describes a proposed Strategic Vaccine Facility (SVF) to provide a capability to the UK to deal with new and emerging disease threats. It would underpin the vaccine manufacturing industry by developing expertise and technology to enable rapid manufacture of small batches of vaccines for emergency use against agents, such as bioterrorist agents and emerging diseases. It would have a rare ability to work with dangerous pathogens under containment, allowing the production of inactivated and live vaccines, which would be difficult in a conventional plant. The facility's output will include vaccine candidates and manufacturing protocols for transfer to industry, small vaccine batches for emergency use or clinical trials, and vaccine reference standards. It would also be available for manufacturing small batches of experimental and public health vaccines for the UK and the developing world, allowing clinical trials to be undertaken against key diseases.","Timely detection of novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection cases is crucial to interrupt the spread of this virus. We assessed the required expertise and capacity for molecular detection of 2019-nCoV in specialised laboratories in 30 European Union/European Economic Area (EU/EEA) countries. Thirty-eight laboratories in 24 EU/EEA countries had diagnostic tests available by 29 January 2020. A coverage of all EU/EEA countries was expected by mid-February. Availability of primers/probes, positive controls and personnel were main implementation barriers.","Recent outbreaks of infectious pathogens such as Zika, Ebola, and COVID-19 have underscored the need for the dependable availability of vaccines against emerging infectious diseases (EIDs). The cost and risk of R&amp;D programs and uniquely unpredictable demand for EID vaccines have discouraged vaccine developers, and government and nonprofit agencies have been unable to provide timely or sufficient incentives for their development and sustained supply. We analyze the economic returns of a portfolio of EID vaccine assets, and find that under realistic financing assumptions, the expected returns are significantly negative, implying that the private sector is unlikely to address this need without public-sector intervention. We have sized the financing deficit for this portfolio and propose several potential solutions, including price increases, enhanced public-private partnerships, and subscription models through which individuals would pay annual fees to obtain access to a portfolio of vacc...","Two months after the emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the possibility of established and widespread community transmission in the European Union and European Economic Area (EU/EEA) is becoming more likely. We provide scenarios for use in preparedness for a possible widespread epidemic. The EU/EEA is moving towards the \u2018limited sustained transmission\u2019 phase. We propose actions to prepare for potential mitigation phases and coordinate efforts to protect the health of citizens.","Importance: As with other traumatic events, pandemics such as coronavirus-19 (COVID-19) may precipitate or exacerbate psychiatric symptoms such as anxiety and depression, while potentially interfering with health systems' capacity to treat such symptoms. Objective: To quantify the impact of increasing COVID-19 infection on extent of psychiatric assessment across 5 Eastern Massachusetts hospitals. Design: In silico cohort using narrative clinical notes generated between 1/2/2020 and 3/25/2020 Setting: Emergency department and outpatient settings from 2 academic medical centers and 3 community hospitals Participants: All individuals age 13 and older presenting to emergency department or outpatient clinics Main Outcome or Measure: Documentation of psychiatric symptoms reflecting depression, anxiety, psychosis, or suicide, and documentation of violence, was drawn from previously-validated term lists. Results: A total of 2,483,159 outpatient and 205,957 emergency department visit notes were...","Ten years have elapsed since the World Health Organization issued its first global alert for an unexplained illness named severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). The anniversary provides an opportunity to reflect on the international response to this new global microbial threat. While global surveillance and response capacity for public health threats have been strengthened, critical gaps remain. Of 194 World Health Organization member states that signed on to the International Health Regulations (2005), &lt;20% had achieved compliance with the core capacities required by the deadline in June 2012. Lessons learned from the global SARS outbreak highlight the need to avoid complacency, strengthen efforts to improve global capacity to address the next pandemic using all available 21st century tools, and support research to develop new treatment options, countermeasures, and insights while striving to address the global inequities that are the root cause of many of these challenges.","Abstract Background: Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is an emerging infection caused by a novel coronavirus known as SARS-CoV, characterized by an over-exuberant immune response with lung lymphomononuclear cells infiltration and proliferation that may account for tissue damage more than the direct effect of viral replication. This study is aimed at investigating the capability of SARS-CoV to activate IFN-\u03b1 and -\u03b3 expression in lymphomonocytes (PBMC) from healthy donors, evaluating whether viral replication is necessary for this activation. Results: SARS-CoV virus is able to induce both IFN-\u03b1 and -\u03b3 mRNA accumulation and protein release in a dose-dependent manner, MOI 10 being the most effective. The time course curve indicated that IFN-\u03b1 mRNA induction peaked at 24 h.p.i,. whereas IFN-\u03b3 mRNA was still increasing at 48 h.p.i. Released IFN (both types) reached a plateau after 24\u201348 h.p.i. and remained rather stable over a 5-day period. A transient peak of negative strand viral R...","ABSTRACT \u2022 ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY and improved surgical techniques have led to new therapeutic uses for allografts. \u2022 DISEASE TRANSMISSION via allograft tissue transplants has prompted federal intervention in the tissue banking industry and resulted in federal regulations. \u2022 NEW STANDARDS from the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations became effective July 1,2005, and apply to all hospitals that store or implant allograft tissues. These standards include mandatory policies on all aspects of hospital transplantation programs, including tissue ordering, receipt, storage, issuance, and record keeping. AORN J 82 (November 2005) 806\u2013814.","Abstract The 2019-nCoV infection that is caused by a novel strain of coronavirus was first detected in China in the end of December 2019 and declared a public health emergency of international concern by the World Health Organization on January 30, 2020. Community pharmacists in one of the first areas that had confirmed cases of the viral infection, Macau, joined the collaborative force in supporting the local health emergency preparedness and response arrangements. This paper aimed to improve the understanding of community pharmacists\u2019 role in case of 2019-CoV outbreak based on the practical experiences in consultation with the recommendations made by the International Pharmaceutical Federation on the Coronavirus 2019-nCoV outbreak.","COVID-19 is now a pandemic and many of the affected countries face severe shortages of hospital resources. In Brazil, the first case was reported on February 26. As the number of cases grows in the country, there is a concern that the health system may become overwhelmed, resulting in shortages of hospital beds, intensive care unit beds, and mechanical ventilators. The timing of shortage is likely to vary geographically depending on the observed onset and pace of transmission observed, on the availability of resources, and on the actions implemented. Here we consider the daily number of cases reported in municipalities in Brazil to simulate twelve alternative scenarios of the likely timing of shortage, based on parameters consistently reported for China and Italy, on rates of hospital occupancy for other health conditions observed in Brazil in 2019, and on assumptions of allocation of patients in public and private facilities. Results show that hospital services could start to experien...","","A novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) originating in Wuhan, China presents a potential respiratory viral pandemic to the world population. Current efforts are focused on containment and quarantine of infected individuals. Ultimately, the outbreak could be controlled with a protective vaccine to prevent 2019-nCoV infection. While vaccine research should be pursued intensely, there exists today no therapy to treat 2019-nCoV upon infection, despite an urgent need to find options to help these patients and preclude potential death. Herein, I review the potential options to treat 2019-nCoV in patients, with an emphasis on the necessity for speed and timeliness in developing new and effective therapies in this outbreak. I consider the options of drug repurposing, developing neutralizing monoclonal antibody therapy, and an oligonucleotide strategy targeting the viral RNA genome, emphasizing the promise and pitfalls of these approaches. Finally, I advocate for the fastest strategy to develop a treat...","Social distancing policies are critical but economically painful measures to flatten the curve against emergent infectious diseases. As the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19 spread throughout the United States in early 2020, the federal government issued social distancing recommendations but left to the states the most difficult and consequential decisions restricting behavior, such as canceling events, closing schools and businesses, and issuing stay-at-home orders. We present an original dataset of state-level social distancing policy responses to the epidemic and explore how political partisanship, COVID-19 caseload, and policy diffusion explain the timing of governors' decisions to mandate social distancing. An event history analysis of five social distancing policies across all fifty states reveals the most important predictors are political: all else equal, Republican governors and governors from states with more Trump supporters were slower to adopt social distancing polici...","Summary Background Public health measures to prevent, detect, and respond to events are essential to control public health risks, including infectious disease outbreaks, as highlighted in the International Health Regulations (IHR). In light of the outbreak of 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), we aimed to review existing health security capacities against public health risks and events. Methods We used 18 indicators from the IHR State Party Annual Reporting (SPAR) tool and associated data from national SPAR reports to develop five indices: (1) prevent, (2) detect, (3) respond, (4) enabling function, and (5) operational readiness. We used SPAR 2018 data for all of the indicators and categorised countries into five levels across the indices, in which level 1 indicated the lowest level of national capacity and level 5 the highest. We also analysed data at the regional level (using the six geographical WHO regions). Findings Of 182 countries, 52 (28%) had prevent capacities at leve...","Summary Background Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), first detected in China in December, 2019. In January, 2020, state, local, and federal public health agencies investigated the first case of COVID-19 in Illinois, USA. Methods Patients with confirmed COVID-19 were defined as those with a positive SARS-CoV-2 test. Contacts were people with exposure to a patient with COVID-19 on or after the patient's symptom onset date. Contacts underwent active symptom monitoring for 14 days following their last exposure. Contacts who developed fever, cough, or shortness of breath became persons under investigation and were tested for SARS-CoV-2. A convenience sample of 32 asymptomatic health-care personnel contacts were also tested. Findings Patient 1\u2014a woman in her 60s\u2014returned from China in mid-January, 2020. One week later, she was hospitalised with pneumonia and tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Her husband (Pat...","Abstract Health planning and policy seek to create a group of mutually interacting bodies to produce goods and services to meet the health needs of a population. Recent developments in the health status of the population are characterized by continuous improvement in life expectancy, chronic diseases which absorb 90% of total health care expenditure, differences in the causes of mortality (more than 70% mortality from cancer, heart and brain, and external causes). The new trends in health indicators define the current health policies and lead to the necessity of adapting the health system so as to meet the changing health needs of the population. Especially in the context of the changes in the epidemiological spectrum and the variability in the indices of morbidity and mortality, the focus is not only to further prolong life expectancy but also to improve life expectancy without chronic diseases and without disabilities and to reduce the avoidable mortality, the potential years of life...","The health authorities reported that 3,019 Chinese health workers were infected with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), of whom, ten died. This article explored relevant reasons and offered suggestions to reduce the risk of infection and provide emergency psychological response for this population.","Abstract The outbreak of the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has caused more than 100,000 people infected and thousands of deaths. Currently, the number of infections and deaths is still increasing rapidly. COVID-19 seriously threatens human health, production, life, social functioning and international relations. In the fight against COVID-19, Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and big data technologies have played an important role in many aspects, including the rapid aggregation of multi-source big data, rapid visualization of epidemic information, spatial tracking of confirmed cases, prediction of regional transmission, spatial segmentation of the epidemic risk and prevention level, balancing and management of the supply and demand of material resources, and social-emotional guidance and panic elimination, which provided solid spatial information support for decision-making, measures formulation, and effectiveness assessment of COVID-19 prevention and control. GIS has d...","Disease outbreaks of international public health importance continue to occur regularly; detecting and tracking significant new public health threats in countries that cannot or might not report such events to the global health community is a challenge. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s (CDC) Global Disease Detection (GDD) Operations Center, established in early 2007, monitors infectious and non-infectious public health events to identify new or unexplained global public health threats and better position CDC to respond, if public health assistance is requested or required. At any one time, the GDD Operations Center actively monitors approximately 30\u201340 such public health threats; here we provide our perspective on five of the top global infectious disease threats that we were watching in 2012: (1) avian influenza A (H5N1), (2) cholera, (3) wild poliovirus, (4) enterovirus-71, and (5) extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis.","Using a previously developed agent-based artificial intelligence simulation platform (EnerPol) coupled with Big Data, the evolution and containment of COVID-19 in Switzerland is examined. The EnerPol platform has been used in a broad range of case studies in different sectors in all of Europe, USA, Japan, South Korea and sub Saharan Africa over the last 10 years. In the present study, the entire Swiss population (8.57 million people), including cross-border commuters, and the entire Swiss public and private transport network that is simulated to assess transmission of the COVID-19 virus. The individual contacts within the population, and possible transmission pathways, are established from a simulation of daily activities that are calibrated with micro-census data. Various governmental interventions with regards to closures and social distancing are also implemented. The epidemiology of the COVID-19 virus is based on publicly available statistical data and adapted to Swiss demographics...","BACKGROUND: As the 2014 Ebola virus disease outbreak (EVD) transitions to its post-endemic phase, its impact on the future of global public health, particularly the World Health Organization (WHO), is the subject of continued debate. Criticism of WHO\u2019s performance grew louder in the outbreak\u2019s wake, placing this international health UN-specialized agency in the difficult position of navigating a complex series of reform recommendations put forth by different stakeholders. Decisions on WHO governance reform and the broader role of the United Nations could very well shape the future landscape of 21st century global health and how the international community responds to health emergencies. DISCUSSION: In order to better understand the implications of the EVD outbreak on global health and infectious disease governance, this debate article critically examines a series of reports issued by four high-level commissions/panels convened to specifically assess WHO\u2019s performance post-Ebola. Collec...","Since its emergence and detection in Wuhan, China in late 2019, the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has spread to nearly every country around the world, resulting in hundreds of thousands of infections to date. The virus was first detected in the Pacific Northwest region of the United States in January, 2020, with subsequent COVID-19 outbreaks detected in all 50 states by early March. To uncover the sources of SARS-CoV-2 introductions and patterns of spread within the U.S., we sequenced nine viral genomes from early reported COVID-19 patients in Connecticut. Our phylogenetic analysis places the majority of these genomes with viruses sequenced from Washington state. By coupling our genomic data with domestic and international travel patterns, we show that early SARS-CoV-2 transmission in Connecticut was likely driven by domestic introductions. Moreover, the risk of domestic importation to Connecticut exceeded that of international importation by mid-March regardless of our estimated impact...","A cross-sectional anonymous survey was administered to all directory-listed physicians within a network of three large teaching hospitals that provided care to SARS patients in Toronto. One hundred ninety-three physicians participated, 23% of whom provided direct care to SARS patients. A significantly higher rate of psychological distress was seen among physicians providing direct care to SARS patients (45.7%) than among those not providing direct care (17.7%), and physicians providing direct care reported feeling more stigmatized. Several physicians (10.9%) reported entering the hospital despite experiencing identified SARS symptoms. The most frequent SARS concerns were about the care of non-SARS patients following suspension of nonessential services and loss of physician income.","Summary Objective Public health surveillance applications are central to the collection, analysis and dissemination of disease and health information. As these applications evolve and mature, it is evident that many of these applications must address similar requirements, such as policies, security and flexibility. It is important a software architecture is created to meet these requirements. Methods We outline the requirements for a public health surveillance application, and define a set of common components to address these requirements. These components are configured to produce services used in the development of public health applications. Results A layered software architecture, the ALPHA architecture, has been developed to support the development of public health applications. The architecture has been used to build eleven surveillance applications for the Public Health Agency of Canada in the areas of disease surveillance, survey, distributed data collection and inventory mana...","ABSTRACT BACKGROUND The COVID-19 epidemic, first emerged in Wuhan during December 2019, has spread globally. While the mass population movement for Chinese New Year has significantly influenced spreading the disease, little direct evidence exists about the relevance to epidemic and its control of population movement from Wuhan, local emergency response, and medical resources in China. METHODS Spearman's correlation analysis was performed between official data of confirmed COVID-19 cases from Jan 20th to Feb 19th, 2020 and real-time travel data and health resources data. RESULTS There were 74,675 confirmed COVID-19 cases in China by Feb 19th, 2020. The overall fatality rate was 2.84%, much higher in Hubei than in other regions (3.27% vs 0.73%). The index of population inflow from Hubei was positively correlated with total (Provincial r=0.9159, p&lt;0.001; City r=0.6311, p&lt;0.001) and primary cases (Provincial r=0.8702, p&lt;0.001; City r=0.6358, p&lt;0.001). The local health emergency measures (e...","News broke on Feb 27, 2020, that an Italian citizen was Nigeria's first case of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The individual had landed at Lagos airport 2 days earlier on a flight from northern Italy, and had subsequently travelled from Lagos to Ogun State, western Nigeria, where he became ill and was promptly isolated. He is currently being treated for mild symptoms of COVID-19 in a hospital in Lagos. Upon identifying the index case, National Emergency Operations Centres were immediately activated to trace his contacts. By March 9, 2020, 27 suspected cases had been identified across five states (Edo, Lagos, Ogun, Federal Capital Territory, and Kano), of which two were confirmed to be positive (ie, the index case and a contact), with no deaths.1 216 contacts were linked to the index case, 136 of whom are being followed up. Similar to COVID-19, the Ebola epidemic of 2014 was imported through Lagos airport. Within weeks, 19 people were diagnosed with Ebola across two states of Nig...","BACKGROUND: The Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus is a serious and emerging issue in Saudi Arabia and the world. A response was required to reduce possible disease transmission between the hospital and university. College of Nursing academic staff developed a programme in response to the educational and emotional needs of participants. METHODS: A MERS-CoV Task Force responded to the rapidly unfolding epidemic. The aim was to find out what nursing staff and nursing students in the college knew about MERS- CoV. While most gaps in knowledge were addressed after an intense information seminar, other learning needs were identified and responded to. The Task Force developed mandatory information sessions for all nursing faculty, students and staff. All staff were informed by email, letters and posters. There are 28 faculty staff, 84 support staff and 480 students in the College of Nursing. The information settings all took place within the College of Nursing, Princess Nourah Un...","Abstract Since December 2019, more than 79,000 people have been diagnosed with infection of the Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). A large number of medical staff was sent to Wuhan city and Hubei province to aid COVID-19 control. Psychological stress, especially vicarious traumatization caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, should not be ignored. To address this concern, the study employed a total of 214 general public and 526 nurses (i.e., 234 front-line nurses and 292 non-front-line nurses) to evaluate vicarious traumatization scores via a mobile app-based questionnaire. Front-line nurses are engaged in the process of providing care for patients with COVID-19. The results showed that the vicarious traumatization scores for front-line nurses including scores for physiological and psychological responses, were significantly lower than those of non-front-line nurses (P &lt; 0.001). Interestingly, the vicarious traumatization scores of the general public were significantly higher than those o...","Abstract This paper investigates whether the inclusion of social scientists in the UK policy network that responded to the Ebola crisis in Sierra Leone (2013\u201316) was a transformational moment in the use of interdisciplinary research. In contrast to the existing literature, that relies heavily on qualitative accounts of the epidemic and ethnography, this study tests the dynamics of the connections between critical actors with quantitative network analysis. This novel approach explores how individuals are embedded in social relationships and how this may affect the production and use of evidence. The meso-level analysis, conducted between March and June 2019, is based on the traces of individuals' engagement found in secondary sources. Source material includes policy and strategy documents, committee papers, meeting minutes and personal correspondence. Social network analysis software, UCINet, was used to analyse the data and Netdraw for the visualisation of the network. Far from being o...","Abstract The outbreak of COVID-19, a respiratory disease from a novel coronavirus that was first detected in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China is now a public health emergency and fast approaching a pandemic. Singapore, as a major international transportation hub in Asia, is one of the worst hit countries of COVID-19. With the advent of local transmission of cases, we share our preparation and response planning for the operating room from the National Heart Centre Singapore, the largest cardiothoracic tertiary center in Singapore. Protection of staff and patients, environmental concerns as well as other logistic and equipment issues must be considered.","Background Emergency school closures are often used as public health interventions during infectious disease outbreaks in an attempt to minimise the spread of infection. However, if children continue to mix with others outside the home during the closures, these measures are unlikely to be effective. Objectives This review aimed to summarise existing literature on children's activities and contacts made outside the home during unplanned school closures. Methods We searched four databases from inception to February 2020 for relevant literature. Main findings were extracted. Results 3,343 citations were screened and 19 included in the review. Activities and social contacts appeared to decrease during closures but contact was still common. All studies reported children leaving the house or being looked after by non-household members. There was some evidence that older child age and parental disagreement with closure were predictive of children leaving the house, and mixed evidence regardi...","Public disclosure from Chinese local Health Commissions show that male and mid-aged index patients are the major source of virus from outside to the households. This implies that two important actions should be taken in disease control. First considers the kindergarten and school closure time. Local kindergarten and primary schools should postpone their admission and regular operation, to at least not earlier than local secondary schools. Second, workplace hygiene is of particular important in the next phase of disease control. As travel restrictions within China are being gradually lifted, we suggest that workplace hygiene should be taken serious care in the next month or two.","Abstract Management researchers and management practitioners increasingly appear to be talking past each other. A solution lies in understanding that interactive management education has an important role to play in bridging this divide, but for some reason this mode of academic exchange is often forgotten. Our paper broadens the stakeholder value perspective to explore how and why the interests of researchers and practitioners have diverged, before going on to present illustrative cases of programs attempting to bridge such differences. Current conditions suggest that the dissonance between different cycle-times of research and practice is not sustainable with the inevitable outcome of a shrinking commons. Generating new knowledge and propagating it rapidly through education and teaching-practice is an important way of disseminating higher-order research and findings. In a world where academic relevance is under threat, enabling academics to better cross such a divide is critical. Mar...","The COVID-19 pandemic is overwhelming healthcare systems worldwide. A significant portion of COVID-19 patients develop pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), necessitating ventilator support. Some health systems do not have the capacity to accommodate this surge in ventilator demand, leading to shortages and inevitable mortality. Some clinicians have, of necessity, jerry-rigged ventilators to support multiple patients, but these devices lack protected air streams or individualized controls for each patient. Moreover, some have not been tested under conditions of ARDS. We have developed the Individualized System for Augmenting Ventilator Efficacy (iSAVE), a rapidly deployable platform to more safely use a single ventilator to simultaneously support multiple critically-ill patients. The iSAVE enables patient-specific volume and pressure control and incorporates safety features to mitigate cross-contamination between patients and flow changes due to patient interdepende...","This case study is the first to be developed in the Middle East region to document what happened during the response to the 2013 MERS outbreak in Qatar. It provides a description of key epidemiologic events and news released from a prime daily newspaper and main Emergency Risk Communication (ERC) actions that were undertaken by public health authorities. Using the Crisis and Emergency Risk Communication (CERC) theoretical framework, the study analyzes how the performed ERC strategies during the first days of the outbreak might have contributed to the outbreak management. Methods: MERS-CoV related events were chronologically tracked, together with the relevant stories that were published in a major newspaper over the course of three distinct phases of the epidemic. The collected media stories were then assessed against the practiced emergency risk communication (ERC) activities during the same time frame. Results: The Crisis &amp; Emergency Risk Communication (CERC) framework was partially ...","Abstract Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) was initially isolated from a patient who was admitted to a private hospital in the Western part of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in 2012. Subsequently, MERS-CoV resulted in many sporadic cases, multiple intrafamilial transmission, and major outbreaks in healthcare settings. Of all the cases reported within the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, 38% of the cases were primary, 45% were healthcare-associated infection, and 14% were household infections. The clinical spectrum of the MERS-CoV infection ranges from asymptomatic infections, mild or moderately symptomatic cases, and severe disease requiring intensive care unit admissions and may result in death. Within healthcare settings, transmissions of MERS-CoV are facilitated by overcrowding, poor infection control measures, unrecognized infections, and superspreader phenomenon. Currently, there is no approved therapy for MERS-CoV and there are no vaccines."],"title":["Consortia\u2019s critical role in developing medical countermeasures for re-emerging viral infections: a USA perspective","Fifteen years post-SARS: Key milestones in Canada\u2019s public health emergency response","Communicable Disease Surveillance Ethics in the Age of Big Data and New Technology","How outbreaks of infectious disease are detected: a review of surveillance systems and outbreaks.","A model to forecast regional demand for COVID-19 related hospital beds","Initial Public Health Response and Interim Clinical Guidance for the 2019 Novel Coronavirus Outbreak \u2014 United States, December 31, 2019\u2013February 4, 2020","Are high-performing health systems resilient against the COVID-19 epidemic?","From Isolation to Coordination: How Can Telemedicine Help Combat the COVID-19 Outbreak?","Detection of 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) by real-time RT-PCR","Feline infectious peritonitis.
