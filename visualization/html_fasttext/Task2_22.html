Control aims can be broadly categorised as either suppression or mitigation. Suppression aims to keep cases to an absolute minimum for as long as possible. Mitigation aims to allow a controlled outbreak to occur, with the aim of preventing significant overloads on healthcare systems and gradually allowing the population to develop herd immunity. Both types of strategy are fraught with uncertainty. Suppression strategies can succeed in delaying an outbreak, but only for as long as such control measures can be sustained. Once controls are eased or restricted, an epidemic is likely to follow as no herd immunity has been acquired. The success or failure of mitigation strategies can depend sensitively on the timing and efficacy of control measures, and require the ability to bring rapidly growing outbrea...","Various epidemic prevention and control measures aimed at reducing person-to-person contact has paid a certain cost while controlling the epidemic. So accurate evaluation of these measures helps to maximize the effectiveness of prevention and control while minimizing social costs. In this paper, we develop the model in Dirk Brockmann and Dirk Helbing (2013) to theoretically explain the impact mechanism of traffic control and social distancing measures on the spread of the epidemic, and empirically tests the effect of the two measures in China at the present stage using econometric approach. We found that both traffic control and social distancing measures have played a very good role in controlling the development of the epidemic. Nationally, social distancing measures are better than traffic control measures; the two measures are complementary and their combined action will play a better epidemic prevention effect; Traffic control and social distancing do not work everywhere. Traffic ...","What has happened in China shows that quarantine, social distancing, and isolation of infected populations can contain the epidemic.1 This impact of the COVID-19 response in China is encouraging for the many countries where COVID-19 is beginning to spread. However, it is unclear whether other countries can implement the stringent measures China eventually adopted. Singapore and Hong Kong, both of which had severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemics in 2002\u201303, provide hope and many lessons to other countries. In both places, COVID-19 has been managed well to date, despite early cases, by early government action and through social distancing measures taken by individuals. The course of an epidemic is defined by a series of key factors, some of which are poorly understood at present for COVID-19. The basic reproduction number (R0), which defines the mean number of secondary cases generated by one primary case when the population is largely susceptible to infection, determines the...","OBJECTIVES: To determine paediatric emergency department (ED) staff perceptions of the effectiveness and practice of infection control measures against a novel virulent pathogen. METHODS: All medical staff of the paediatric ED in a tertiary medical centre completed a written questionnaire near the onset of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak. Level of concern regarding SARS, and perceptions of effectiveness and use of infection control measures were assessed on a 5 point scale. Statistical analysis was performed using \u03c7(2) test and one way analysis of variance with significance at p&lt;0.05. RESULTS: Response rate was 97% (116/120). All scores were given out of 5 possible points. Using isolation rooms (mean score 4.6), wearing a mask when examining patients (4.5), and handwashing (4.5) were considered most effective. Staff physicians reported handwashing more than nurses and trainees (4.9 v 4.5 and 4.5, respectively; p&lt;0.05) while other measures were reported equally. Re...","Abstract Background After the declaration of COVID-19 pandemic on March 11th, 2020, local transmission chains starting in different countries including Canada are forcing governments to take decisions on public health interventions to mitigate the spread of the epidemic. Methods We conduct data-driven and model-free estimations for the growth rates of the COVID-19 epidemics in Italy and Canada, by fitting an exponential curve to the daily reported cases. We use these estimates to predict epidemic trends in Canada under different scenarios of public health interventions. Results In Italy, the initial growth rate (0.22) has reduced to 0.1 two weeks after the lockdown of the country on March 8th, 2020. This corresponds to an increase of the doubling time from about 3.15 to almost 7 days. In comparison, the growth rate in Canada has increased from 0.13 between March 1st and 13th, to 0.25 between March 13th to 22nd. This current growth rate corresponds to a doubling time of 2.7 days, and th...","Relevant pandemic-spread scenario simulations provide guiding principles for containment and mitigation policy developments. Here we devise a simple model to predict the effectiveness of different mitigation strategies. The model consists of a set of simple differential equations considering the population size, reported and unreported infections, reported and unreported recoveries and the number of Covid-19-inflicted deaths. For simplification, we assume that Covid-19 survivors are immune (e.g. mutations are not considered) and that the virus can only be passed on by persons with undetected infections. While the latter assumption is a simplification (it is neglected that e.g. hospital staff may be infected by detected patients with symptoms), it was introduced here to keep the model as simple as possible. Moreover, the current version of the model does not account for age-dependent differences in the death rates, but considers higher mortality rates due to temporary shortage of intens...","Abstract Mass gathering (MG) medicine emerged against the backdrop of the 2009 pandemic H1N1 Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) when the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) hosted the largest annual mass gathering of over 3 million pilgrims from 180 plus countries. However, the events surrounding the latest threat to global health, the PHEIC COVID-19, may be sufficient to highlight the role of mass gatherings, mass migration, and other forms of dense gatherings of people on the emergence, sustenance, and transmission of novel pathogens. The COVID-19 spread illustrates the role of MGs in exacerbation of the scope of pandemics. Cancellation or suspension of MGs would be critical to pandemic mitigation. It is unlikely that medical countermeasures are available during the early phase of pandemics. Therefore, mitigation of its impact, rather than containment and control becomes a priority during pandemics. As the most systematically studied MG-related respiratory disease dat...","To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate the facemask shortage during the novel coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19) outbreak in China. We have summarized in detail the management strategies implemented by the Chinese governments during the outbreaks. By considering three scenarios for the outbreak development, we simulated the facemasks availability from late-December 2019 to late-April 2020 and estimated the duration of sufficient facemask supplies. Our findings showed that if the COVID-19 outbreak occurred only in Wuhan city or Hubei province, facemask shortage would not appear with the existing public health measures. However, if the outbreak occurred in the whole of China, a shortage of facemask could be substantial assuming no alternative public health measures. Supplies of facemasks in the whole of China would have been sufficient for both healthcare workers and the general population if the COVID-19 outbreak only occurred in Wuhan city or Hubei province....","We estimate the growth in demand for ICU beds in Chicago during the emerging COVID-19 epidemic, using state-of-the-art computer simulations calibrated for the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The questions we address are these: (1) Will the ICU capacity in Chicago be exceeded, and if so by how much? (2) Can strong mitigation strategies, such as lockdown or shelter in place order, prevent the overflow of capacity? (3) When should such strategies be implemented? Our answers are as follows: (1) The ICU capacity may be exceeded by a large amount, probably by a factor of ten. (2) Strong mitigation can avert this emergency situation potentially, but even that will not work if implemented too late. (3) If the strong mitigation precedes April 1st, then the growth of COVID-19 can be controlled and the ICU capacity could be adequate. The earlier the strong mitigation is implemented, the greater the probability that it will be successful. After around April 1 2020, any strong mitigation will not avert the emerg...","OBJECTIVE: To assess the public health risk to Singapore posed by the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) outbreak in the Republic of Korea in 2015. METHODS: The likelihood of importation of MERS cases and the magnitude of the public health impact in Singapore were assessed to determine overall risk. Literature on the epidemiology and contextual factors associated with MERS coronavirus infection was collected and reviewed. Connectivity between the Republic of Korea and Singapore was analysed. Public health measures implemented by the two countries were reviewed. RESULTS: The epidemiology of the 2015 MERS outbreak in the Republic of Korea remained similar to the MERS outbreaks in Saudi Arabia. In addition, strong infection control and response measures were effective in controlling the outbreak. In view of the air traffic between Singapore and MERS-affected areas, importation of MERS cases into Singapore is possible. Nonetheless, the risk of a serious public health impact to Singapo...","Abstract Human coronavirus, hCoV-19, is highly pathogenic with severe pneumonia associated with rapid virus replication. Arising in Wuhan China December 2019, the current COVID-19 epidemic has rapidly grown with person-to-person infection expanding to become a global health emergency now on pandemic scale. In mitigation of this current COVID-19 pandemic, according to Anderson et al. 2020 [1], governments will not be able to minimise both deaths from COVID-19 and the economic impact of viral spread. Keeping mortality as low as possible will be the highest priority for individuals; hence governments must put in place measures to ameliorate the inevitable economic downturn. The current global picture shows small chains of transmission in many countries and large chains resulting in extensive spread in a few countries, such as Italy, Iran, South Korea, and Japan. Most countries are likely to have spread of COVID-19, at least in the early stages, before any mitigation measures have an impac...","First, although COVID-19 is spread by the airborne route, air disinfection of cities and communities is not known to be effective for disease control and needs to be stopped. The widespread practice of spraying disinfectant and alcohol in the sky, on roads, vehicles, and personnel has no value; moreover, large quantities of alcohol and disinfectant are potentially harmful to humans and should be avoided.3 , 4 Second, in the use of personal protective equipment, we should try to distinguish different risk factors, adopt different epidemic prevention measures, and reduce the waste of personal protective equipment, as these resources are already in short supply. Although surgical masks are in widespread use by the general population, there is no evidence that these masks prevent the acquisition of COVID-19, although they might slightly reduce the spread from an infected patient. High-filtration masks such as N95 masks and protective clothing (goggles and gowns) should be used in hospitals...","Surveillance is essential for communicable disease prevention and control. Traditional notification of demographic and clinical information, about individuals with selected (notifiable) infectious diseases, allows appropriate public health action and is protected by public health and privacy legislation, but is slow and insensitive. Big data\u2013based electronic surveillance, by commercial bodies and government agencies (for profit or population control), which draws on a plethora of internet- and mobile device\u2013based sources, has been widely accepted, if not universally welcomed. Similar anonymous digital sources also contain syndromic information, which can be analysed, using customised algorithms, to rapidly predict infectious disease outbreaks, but the data are nonspecific and predictions sometimes misleading. However, public health authorities could use these online sources, in combination with de-identified personal health data, to provide more accurate and earlier warning of infectio...","ABSTRACT BACKGROUND The COVID-19 epidemic, first emerged in Wuhan during December 2019, has spread globally. While the mass population movement for Chinese New Year has significantly influenced spreading the disease, little direct evidence exists about the relevance to epidemic and its control of population movement from Wuhan, local emergency response, and medical resources in China. METHODS Spearman's correlation analysis was performed between official data of confirmed COVID-19 cases from Jan 20th to Feb 19th, 2020 and real-time travel data and health resources data. RESULTS There were 74,675 confirmed COVID-19 cases in China by Feb 19th, 2020. The overall fatality rate was 2.84%, much higher in Hubei than in other regions (3.27% vs 0.73%). The index of population inflow from Hubei was positively correlated with total (Provincial r=0.9159, p&lt;0.001; City r=0.6311, p&lt;0.001) and primary cases (Provincial r=0.8702, p&lt;0.001; City r=0.6358, p&lt;0.001). The local health emergency measures (e...","Summary Background Public health measures to prevent, detect, and respond to events are essential to control public health risks, including infectious disease outbreaks, as highlighted in the International Health Regulations (IHR). In light of the outbreak of 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), we aimed to review existing health security capacities against public health risks and events. Methods We used 18 indicators from the IHR State Party Annual Reporting (SPAR) tool and associated data from national SPAR reports to develop five indices: (1) prevent, (2) detect, (3) respond, (4) enabling function, and (5) operational readiness. We used SPAR 2018 data for all of the indicators and categorised countries into five levels across the indices, in which level 1 indicated the lowest level of national capacity and level 5 the highest. We also analysed data at the regional level (using the six geographical WHO regions). Findings Of 182 countries, 52 (28%) had prevent capacities at leve...","Objective: Establishing a social contact data sharing initiative and an interactive tool to assess mitigation strategies for COVID-19. Results: We organized data sharing of published social contact surveys via online repositories and formatting guidelines. We analyzed this social contact data in terms of weighted social contact matrices, next generation matrices, relative incidence and R0. We incorporated location-specific isolation measures (e.g. school closure or telework) and capture their effect on transmission dynamics. All methods have been implemented in an online application based on R Shiny and applied to COVID-19 with age-specific susceptibility and infectiousness. Using our online tool with the available social contact data, we illustrate that social distancing could have a considerable impact on reducing transmission for COVID-19. The effect itself depends on assumptions made about disease-specific characteristics and the choice of intervention(s). Keywords: social contact ...","Background: Since the new coronavirus epidemic in China in December 2019, information and discussions about COVID-19 have spread rapidly on the Internet and have quickly become the focus of worldwide attention, especially on social media. Objective: This study aims to investigate and analyze the public's attention to COVID-19-related events in China at the beginning of the COVID-19 epidemic in China (December 31, 2019, to February 20, 2020) through the Sina Microblog hot search list. Methods: We collected topics related to the COVID-19 epidemic on the Sina Microblog hot search list from December 31, 2019, to February 20, 2020 and described the trend of public attention on COVID-19 epidemic-related topics. ROST CM6.0 (ROST Content Mining System Version 6.0) was used to analyze the collected text for word segmentation, word frequency, and sentiment analysis. We further described the hot topic keywords and sentiment trends of public attention. We used VOSviewer to implement a visual clust...","BACKGROUND: Strategies are urgently needed to mitigate the risk of zoonotic disease emergence in southern China, where pathogens with zoonotic potential are known to circulate in wild animal populations. However, the risk factors leading to emergence are poorly understood, which presents a challenge in developing appropriate mitigation strategies for local communities. METHODS: Residents in rural communities of Yunnan, Guangxi and Guangdong provinces were recruited and enrolled in this study. Data were collected through ethnographic interviews and field observations, and thematically coded and analysed to identify both risk and protective factors for zoonotic disease emergence at the individual, community and policy levels. RESULTS: Eighty-eight ethnographic interviews and 55 field observations were conducted at nine selected sites. Frequent human\u2013animal interactions and low levels of environmental biosecurity in local communities were identified as risks for zoonotic disease emergence...","Abstract To overcome the limitations of the state-of-the-art influenza surveillance systems in Europe, we established in 2008 a European-wide consortium aimed at introducing an innovative information and communication technology approach for a web-based surveillance system across different European countries, called Influenzanet. The system, based on earlier efforts in The Netherlands and Portugal, works with the participation of the population in each country to collect real-time information on the distribution of influenza-like illness cases through web surveys administered to volunteers reporting their symptoms (or lack of symptoms) every week during the influenza season. Such a large European-wide web-based monitoring infrastructure is intended to rapidly identify public health emergencies, contribute to understanding global trends, inform data-driven forecast models to assess the impact on the population, optimize the allocation of resources, and help in devising mitigation and co...","Background: On 12 March, the World Health Organization Director-General declared that \"the threat of a global pandemic has become a reality\", and the disease caused by the novel coronavirus, known as COVID-19, has become a global concern. Chinese efforts in curbing the virus have widely been recognized. Even the WHO has lauded the efforts of the Chinese government and advised the world to learn from China in fighting the disease. Since the outbreak of COVID-19, to curb the spread of the epidemic, the Chinese government has implemented unprecedented prevention interventions at the nationwide level. Currently, the outbreak in Wuhan is changing in a positive direction and has been effectively controlled. However, it is not clear what these measures were and how these measures changed to curb the outbreak of COVID-19 quickly. This study explored the characteristics and identified that China's control strategies have changed the epidemiological curve of rapidly rising new confirmed cases of...","Background: We evaluated how non-pharmaceutical interventions could be used to control the COVID-19 pandemic and reduce the burden on the healthcare system. Methods: Using an age-structured compartmental model of COVID-19 transmission in the population of Ontario, Canada, we compared a base case with limited testing, isolation, and quarantine to scenarios with: enhanced case finding; restrictive social distancing measures; or a combination of enhanced case finding and less restrictive social distancing. Interventions were either implemented for fixed durations or dynamically cycled on and off, based on projected ICU bed occupancy. We present median and credible intervals (CrI) from 100 replicates per scenario using a two-year time horizon. Results: We estimated that 56% (95% CrI: 42-63%) of the Ontario population would be infected over the course of the epidemic in the base case. At the epidemic peak, we projected 107,000 (95% CrI: 60,760-149,000) cases in hospital and 55,500 (95% CrI:...","We sought to estimate the ascertainment ratio of SARS-CoV-2 infection in Wuhan, China, using a modified Bayesian SEIR model with publicly reported case data. We estimated it at 0.465% (95%CI: 0.464-0.466%), implying that the outbreak in Wuhan was abated by depletion of susceptibles, rather than public health action alone. This suggests a high-transmissibility/low-severity profile for the current pandemic and raises doubt about whether suppression, rather than mitigation, is a feasible goal.","Human infections with a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) were first identified via syndromic surveillance in December of 2019 in Wuhan China. Since identification, infections (coronavirus disease-2019; COVID-19) caused by this novel pathogen have spread globally, with more than 180,000 confirmed cases as of March 16, 2020. Effective public health interventions, including social distancing, contact tracing, and isolation/quarantine rely on the rapid and accurate identification of confirmed cases. However, testing capacity (having sufficient tests and laboratory throughput) to support these non-pharmaceutical interventions remains a challenge for containment and mitigation of COVID-19 infections. We undertook a sentinel event strategy (where single health events signal emerging trends) to estimate the incidence of COVID-19 in the US. Data from a recent national conference, the Conservative Political Action Conference, (CPAC) near Washington, DC and from the outbreak in Wuhan, China were us...","On December 31, 2019, Chinese health officials reported a cluster of cases of acute respiratory illness in persons associated with the Hunan seafood and animal market in the city of Wuhan, Hubei Province, in central China. On January 7, 2020, Chinese health officials confirmed that a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) was associated with this initial cluster (1). As of February 4, 2020, a total of 20,471 confirmed cases, including 2,788 (13.6%) with severe illness,* and 425 deaths (2.1%) had been reported by the National Health Commission of China (2). Cases have also been reported in 26 locations outside of mainland China, including documentation of some person-to-person transmission and one death (2). As of February 4, 11 cases had been reported in the United States. On January 30, the World Health Organization (WHO) Director-General declared that the 2019-nCoV outbreak constitutes a Public Health Emergency of International Concern.(\u2020) On January 31, the U.S. Department of Health and Huma...","Abstract The emergence of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic presents an unprecedented health communications challenge. Healthcare providers should reinforce behaviors that limit the spread of the pandemic, including social distancing and remaining in the home whenever possible. Formal communications toolkits may not be prepared in a timely fashion. Community pharmacists can reinforce mitigation behaviors by applying the health belief model (HBM). This commentary provides an overview of the HBM and offers suggestions on how community pharmacists can use it as a guide to patient communication in these uncertain contexts.","As an emerging infectious disease, the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has developed into a global pandemic. During the initial spreading of the virus in China, we demonstrated the ensemble Kalman filter performed well as a short-term predictor of the daily cases reported in Wuhan City. Second, we used an individual-level network-based model to reconstruct the epidemic dynamics in Hubei Province at its early stage and examine the effectiveness of non-pharmaceutical interventions on the epidemic spreading with various scenarios. Our simulation results show that without continued control measures, the epidemic in Hubei Province could have become persistent. Only by continuing to decrease the infection rate through 1) protective measures and 2) social distancing can the actual epidemic trajectory that happened in Hubei Province be reconstructed in simulation. Finally, we simulate the COVID-19 transmission with non-Markovian processes and show how these models produce different epidemi...","Background: Although the COVID-19 has been well controlled in China, it is rapidly spreading outside China that may lead to catastrophic results globally without implementation of necessary mitigation measures. Because the COVID-19 outbreak has made comprehensive and profound impacts on the world, an accurate prediction of its epidemic trend is significant. Although many studies have predicted the COVID-19 epidemic trend, most of these studies have used the early stage data and focused on the China cases. Methods: We predicted the COVID-19 epidemic trend in China and across the world using the machine learning approach. We first built the models for predicting the daily numbers of cumulative confirmed cases (CCCs), new cases (NCs), and death cases (DCs) of COVID-19 in China based on the data from Jan 20, 2020, to Mar 1, 2020. Furthermore, we built the models, derived from the models for the China cases, for predicting the epidemic trend across the world (outside China). Findings: The C...","","Disease outbreaks of international public health importance continue to occur regularly; detecting and tracking significant new public health threats in countries that cannot or might not report such events to the global health community is a challenge. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s (CDC) Global Disease Detection (GDD) Operations Center, established in early 2007, monitors infectious and non-infectious public health events to identify new or unexplained global public health threats and better position CDC to respond, if public health assistance is requested or required. At any one time, the GDD Operations Center actively monitors approximately 30\u201340 such public health threats; here we provide our perspective on five of the top global infectious disease threats that we were watching in 2012: (1) avian influenza A (H5N1), (2) cholera, (3) wild poliovirus, (4) enterovirus-71, and (5) extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis.","Background The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was first reported in China, which caused a respiratory disease known as Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). Since its discovery, the virus has spread to over 100 countries and claimed more than 4000 deaths. This study aimed to assess the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of various response public health measures. Method The stochastic agent-based model was used to simulate the process of COVID-19 outbreak in scenario I (imported one case) and II (imported four cases) with a series of public health measures, involving the personal protection, isolation-and-quarantine, gathering restriction, and community containment. The virtual community was constructed following the susceptible-latent-infectious-recovered framework. The epidemiological and economic parameters derived from the previous literature and field investigation. The main outcomes included avoided infectors, cost-effectiveness ratios (CERs), and i...","BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has been identified as the cause of an outbreak of respiratory illness in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China beginning in December 2019. As of 31 January 2020, this epidemic had spread to 19 countries with 11 791 confirmed cases, including 213 deaths. The World Health Organization has declared it a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. METHODS: A scoping review was conducted following the methodological framework suggested by Arksey and O\u2019Malley. In this scoping review, 65 research articles published before 31 January 2020 were analyzed and discussed to better understand the epidemiology, causes, clinical diagnosis, prevention and control of this virus. The research domains, dates of publication, journal language, authors\u2019 affiliations, and methodological characteristics were included in the analysis. All the findings and statements in this review regarding the outbreak are based on published information as listed in the references. ...","Background The novel coronavirus COVID19 has been classified by the World Health Organisation as a pandemic due to its worldwide spread. The ability of countries to contain and control transmission is critical in the absence of a vaccine. We evaluated a range of social distancing measures to determine which strategies are most effective in reducing the peak daily infection rate, and consequential pressure on the health care system. Methods Using COVID19 transmission data from the outbreak source in Hubei Province, China, collected prior to activation of containment measures, we adapted an established individual based simulation model of the city of Newcastle, Australia, population 272,409. Simulation of virus transmission in this community model without interventions provided a baseline from which to compare alternative social distancing strategies. The infection history of each individual was determined, as was the time infected. From this model generated data, the rate of growth in c...","This year marks the 15th anniversary of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in Canada and the 100th anniversary of the 1918 Spanish influenza pandemic. These, and other recent public health events, provide an opportunity for us to review and reflect on the evolution of Canada\u2019s public health emergency response over the past 15 years\u2014from SARS, to the 2009 H1N1 pandemic influenza, to Ebola virus and Zika virus disease. Key lessons have been learned and milestones achieved that have shaped and sharpened our response approach and structures. While SARS was a wake-up-call to strengthen infection prevention and control capacity in health care settings and led to the formation of the Public Health Agency of Canada, it also strengthened our Federal/Provincial/Territorial (FPT) senior-level governance and led to agreements for pan-Canadian mutual aid and infectious disease information sharing. As well, our collective public health laboratory capacity has been strengthened through ongoing ...","RAPID COMMUNICATION 22 March 2020 Estimating excess 1- year mortality from COVID-19 according to underlying conditions and age in England: a rapid analysis using NHS health records in 3.8 million adults Background: The medical, health service, societal and economic impact of the COVID-19 emergency has unknown effects on overall population mortality. Previous models of population mortality are based on death over days among infected people, nearly all of whom (to date at least) have underlying conditions. Models have not incorporated information on high risk conditions or their longer term background (pre-COVID-19) mortality. We estimated the excess number of deaths over 1 year under different COVID-19 incidence rates and differing mortality impacts. Methods: Using population based linked primary and secondary care electronic health records in England (HDR UK - CALIBER), we report the prevalence of underlying conditions defined by UK Public Health England COVID-19 guidelines (16 March 2...","Abstract Feed for livestock animals have been under increased scrutiny as a vector for pathogenic bacteria leading to human illnesses. Control of these pathogenic bacteria in animal feeds can be controlled via physical and chemical means. Physical methods can include thermal processing, including irradiation, pelleting, and extrusion. Chemical mitigation can be accomplished through the inclusion of various additives, including formaldehyde, organic acids, essential oils, or medium chain fatty acids. While physical and chemical interventions can help mitigate risk of pathogens contaminating finished animal feeds, the implementation of a biosecurity plan at the feed mill can help prevent pathogens from entering or spreading throughout the facility.","Two months after the emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the possibility of established and widespread community transmission in the European Union and European Economic Area (EU/EEA) is becoming more likely. We provide scenarios for use in preparedness for a possible widespread epidemic. The EU/EEA is moving towards the \u2018limited sustained transmission\u2019 phase. We propose actions to prepare for potential mitigation phases and coordinate efforts to protect the health of citizens.","We present here several variants of a mathematical model to explore three main issues related to SARS-CoV-2 spread in scenarios similar to those present in Mexico and elsewhere in Latin America. We explore the consequences for travel inside a given region, in this case Mexico, particularly focusing on airplane transportation but attempting to give a gross approximation to terrestrial movement since this is the main form of population movement across geographical areas in the country; then we proceed to study the effect of behavioral changes required to lower transmission by lowering the contact rate and infection probability and lastly, we explore the consequences of disease spread in a population subject to social isolation.These models are not suitable for predictive purposes although some rough predictions can be extracted from them. They are presented as a tool that can serve to explore plausible scenarios of spread and impact, effectiveness and consequences of contention and mitig...","Being aware and implementing the latest and best scientific evidence in infection control and health care epidemiology is critical to enhancing patient outcomes. In this review, the latest published scientific data in health care epidemiology and patient safety were reviewed for the period May 2003-May 2004. Medline reviews and reviews of infection control and infectious diseases journals were used for this period. The latest guidelines and publications on antimicrobial resistance, nursing or infection control professional staffing, West Nile virus, and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) are included. Awareness of these and other important infection control publications is essential if the latest measures are to be implemented to prevent and control health care-associated infections.","The emergence of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection in 2012 resulted in an increased concern of the spread of the infection globally. MERS-CoV infection had previously caused multiple health-care-associated outbreaks and resulted in transmission of the virus within families. Community onset MERS-CoV cases continue to occur. Dromedary camels are currently the most likely animal to be linked to human MERS-CoV cases. Serologic tests showed significant infection in adult camels compared to juvenile camels. The control of MERS-CoV infection relies on prompt identification of cases within health care facilities, with institutions applying appropriate infection control measures. In addition, determining the exact route of transmission from camels to humans would further add to the control measures of MERS-CoV infection.","Abstract The epidemic of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) first broke out in Wuhan in December 2019, and reached its peak in Wuhan in February 2020. It became a major public health challenge for China, and evolved into a global pandemic in March 2020. For radiation oncology departments, the COVID-19 pandemic presents a unique challenge for disease protection and prevention for both patients and staff, owing to the weakened immune systems of cancer patients and the need to deliver timely and uninterrupted radiotherapy. At the Hubei Cancer Hospital, the only hospital in Wuhan that specializes in oncology, we organized an emergency infection control team to lead special efforts to combat COVID-19 during this challenging time. Under its lead, the following measures were implemented in the radiation oncology department: the radiotherapy clinic was divided into different infection control zones with varying levels of protection; special staff and patient infection control training session...","The 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) pneumonia, believed to have originated in a wet market in Wuhan, Hubei province, China at the end of 2019, has gained intense attention nationwide and globally. To lower the risk of further disease transmission, the authority in Wuhan suspended public transport indefinitely from Jan 23, 2020; similar measures were adopted soon in many other cities in China. As of Jan 25, 2020, 30 Chinese provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions covering over 1\u00b73 billion people have initiated first-level responses to major public health emergencies. A range of measures has been urgently adopted,1,2 such as early identification and isolation of suspected and diagnosed cases, contact tracing and monitoring, collection of clinical data and biological samples from patients, dissemination of regional and national diagnostic criteria and expert treatment consensus, establishment of isolation units and hospitals, and prompt provision of medical supplies and exter...","An outbreak of clusters of viral pneumonia due to a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV/SARS-CoV-2) happened in Wuhan, Hubei Province in China in December 2019. Since the outbreak, several groups reported estimated R0 of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) and generated valuable prediction for the early phase of this outbreak. After implementation of strict prevention and control measures in China, new estimation is needed. An infectious disease dynamics SEIR (Susceptible, Exposed, Infectious, and Removed) model was applied to estimate the epidemic trend in Wuhan, China under two assumptions of Rt. In the first assumption, Rt was assumed to maintain over 1. The estimated number of infections would continue to increase throughout February without any indication of dropping with Rt = 1.9, 2.6, or 3.1. The number of infections would reach 11,044, 70,258, and 227,989, respectively, by 29 February 2020. In the second assumption, Rt was assumed to gradually decrease at different phases from high le...","Abstract Only a month after the outbreak of pneumonia caused by 2019-nCoV, more than forty-thousand people were infected. This put enormous pressure on the Chinese government, medical healthcare provider, and the general public, but also made the international community deeply nervous. On the 25th day after the outbreak, the Chinese government implemented strict traffic restrictions on the area where the 2019-nCoV had originated\u2014Hubei province, whose capital city is Wuhan. Ten days later, the rate of increase of cases in Hubei showed a significant difference (p = 0.0001) compared with the total rate of increase in other provinces of China. These preliminary data suggest the effectiveness of a traffic restriction policy for this pandemic thus far. At the same time, solid financial support and improved research ability, along with network communication technology, also greatly facilitated the application of epidemic prevention measures. These measures were motivated by the need to provid...","SummaryBackgroundThe 2019 new coronavirus, \u201c2019-nCoV\u201d, was discovered from Wuhan Viral Pneumonia cases in December 2019, and was named by the World Health Organization on January 12, 2020. In the early stage, people knows little about the 2019-nCoV virus was not clear, and the spread period was encountering China\u2019s annual spring migration, which made the epidemic spread rapidly from Wuhan to almost all provinces in China.MethodsThis study builds a SEIRD model that considers the movement of people across regions, revealing the effects of three measures on controlling the spread of the epidemic.Based on MATLAB R2017a, computational experiments were performed to simulate the epidemic prevention and control measures.FindingsThe research results show that current prevention and control measures in China are very necessary. This study further validates the concerns of international and domestic experts regarding asymptomatic transmission (E-status).InterpretationThe results of this study ar...","Infections with 2019-nCoV can spread from person to person, and in the earliest phase of the outbreak the basic reproductive number was estimated to be around 2.2, assuming a mean serial interval of 7.5 days [2]. The serial interval was not precisely estimated, and a potentially shorter mean serial interval would have corresponded to a slightly lower basic reproductive number. Control measures and changes in population behaviour later in January should have reduced the effective reproductive number. However, it is too early to estimate whether the effective reproductive number has been reduced to below the critical threshold of 1 because cases currently being detected and reported would have mostly been infected in mid- to late-January. Average delays between infection and illness onset have been estimated at around 5\u20136 days, with an upper limit of around 11-14 days [2,5], and delays from illness onset to laboratory confirmation added a further 10 days on average [2].","Summary Objective Public health surveillance applications are central to the collection, analysis and dissemination of disease and health information. As these applications evolve and mature, it is evident that many of these applications must address similar requirements, such as policies, security and flexibility. It is important a software architecture is created to meet these requirements. Methods We outline the requirements for a public health surveillance application, and define a set of common components to address these requirements. These components are configured to produce services used in the development of public health applications. Results A layered software architecture, the ALPHA architecture, has been developed to support the development of public health applications. The architecture has been used to build eleven surveillance applications for the Public Health Agency of Canada in the areas of disease surveillance, survey, distributed data collection and inventory mana...","Background: The impact of COVID-19 has been profound, and the public health challenge seem to be the most serious regarding respiratory viruses since the 1918 H1N1 influenza pandemic. In the absence of effective vaccine or biomedical treatment, the basic rules of public health measures have not changed, namely public distancing. Methods: We analyzed epidemiological investigation reports during the first month of the outbreak in Israel. In addition, we present a deterministic compartment model and simulations of several scenarios emphasizing quarantine and isolation policies given their efficiency. Results: We identify an abrupt change from controlled epidemic regime to an exponential growth (R_0= 2.19) in light of the actual policy-makers decisions and public behavior in Israel. Our analysis show that before the abrupt change, the new cases trend was due to returning citizens infected abroad. The abrupt change followed a holiday in which social distancing was clearly inefficient and ma...","Abstract The goal of syndromic surveillance is the earlier detection of epidemics, allowing a timelier public health response than is possible using traditional surveillance methods. Syndromic surveillance application for public health purposes has changed over time and reflects a dynamic evolution from the collection, interpretation of data with dissemination of data to those who need to act, to a more holistic approach that incorporates response as a core component of the surveillance system. Recent infectious disease threats, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), avian influenza (H5N1) and pandemic influenza (H1N1), have all highlighted the need for countries to be rapidly aware of the spread of infectious diseases within a region and across the globe. The International Health Regulations (IHR) obligation to report public health emergencies of international concern has raised the importance of early outbreak detection and response. The emphasis in syndromic surveillance ...","Background: In December 2019, an outbreak of novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) emerged in Wuhan, China and has swiftly spread to other parts of China and a number of oversea countries. Our aim is to evaluate the effectiveness of the evolution of interventions and self-protection measures, estimate the risk of partial lifting control measures and predict the epidemic trend of the virus in mainland China excluding Hubei province based on the published data and a novel mathematical model. Methods: A novel COVID-19 transmission dynamic model incorporating the intervention measures implemented in China is proposed. We parameterize the model by using the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method and estimate the control reproduction number Rc, as well as the effective daily reproduction ratio Re(t), of the disease transmission in mainland China excluding Hubei province. Results: The estimation outcomes indicate that the control reproduction number is 3.36 (95% CI 3.20-3.64) and Re(t) has dro...","Purpose: The COVID-19 death-rate in Italy continues to climb, surpassing that in every other country.

The shortterm cost of containment will be far lower than the longterm cost of noncontainment. However, closures of institutions and public places, and restrictions in travel and trade, cannot be maintained indefinitely. Countries have to face the reality that individualcase containment might not be possible in the long run, and there might be the need to move from containment to mitigation, balancing the costs and benefits of public health measures. Even if our public health measures are not able to fully contain the spread of COVID19 because of the virus characteristics, they will still be effective in delaying the onset of widespread community trans mission, reducing peak incidence and its impact on public services, and decreasing the overall attack rate. In addition, minimising the size of the outbreak or suppressing its peak can reduce global deaths by providing health systems with the opportunity to scale up and respond, and to slow down the global spread until effective vaccines become available.","Mitigation strategies allow the disease to spread then apply control to reduce the peak allowing hospitals to be less overwhelmed. In general mitigation requires an initial period of weak control to allow the epidemic to establish, then an extended period (3-4 months) of very strong control. This can be followed by periods when control measures can be loosened, but strong control needs to be re-established when cases increase towards hospital capacity. One way to approach this is alternating periods of strong control (shaded blue, Rc=0.75) and weak control (unshaded, Rc =1.75) as shown in the graphs. Fig. 4 to succeed requires control measures sufficiently strong to force Rc below 1. It remains completely unknown whether a scenario such as that shown in Fig. 4 is achievable in practice in New Zealand or any comparable country. Fig. 2 shows that the only countries that have so far succeeded in getting the effective reproduction number less than 1 are China and South Korea. In those countries, this has been achieved by extremely intensive measures, including mandatory and strictly enforced quarantine, huge amounts of resources devoted to contact tracing, electronic surveillance of citizens' movements, etc. In other countries, including those that have instigating major lockdowns such as Italy, there is as yet insufficient evidence that this has reduced Rc to 1 (Fig. 2) .","Mitigation strategies, which aim to allow the epidemic to go ahead at a controlled rate, keep demand on healthcare systems under capacity, and deliver herd immunity, are a tempting approach for the control of Covid-19. However, model results show that for these to be successful requires the ability to reduce transmission to a level where the effective reproduction number Rc is close to or below 1. It remains unknown whether this will be achievable in practice in New Zealand. There is no evidence that it has yet been achieved in comparable, western democracies, including those that have instigated major lockdowns such as Italy. The only regimes that have conclusively achieved this level of control are China and South Korea. In these countries, this has been achieved by extremely intensive measures, including mandatory and strictly enforced quarantine, huge amounts of resources devoted to contact tracing, electronic surveillance of citizens' movements, etc. In addition, successful mitigation requires periods of these intensive control measures to be continued for up to 2.5 years before the population acquires a sufficient level of herd immunity. This could be an underestimate as these models do not include population turnover via birth-death, which will become significant over this time frame and may act to reduce the build-up of herd immunity. Furthermore, correct timing of strong control measures is crucial to successfully keeping healthcare systems from being overloaded. Small uncertainties in case trajectories could lead to drastically overshooting hospital and ICU capacity. If hospitalisation and/or ICU admission rates are in reality higher than assumed here, e.g. closer to the CDC (2020) estimates (Table 1) , then mitigation strategies aimed at keeping ICU load under become even more difficult. Expanding New Zealand's ICU capacity would alleviate this somewhat, and would be a sensible precaution in any case.","Another part of the literature assesses the effectiveness and the scope of application of public health policies. Rothstein &amp; Talbott (2007) found that to make quarantine to be the most effective measure for limiting the spread of infection, compliance with quarantine regulations should be encouraged, that is, providing job security and income replacement. Wang et al. (2012) found that In the case of short reaction time, intra-population, such as patient isolation, are more effective than inter-population such as travel restrictions. Jefferson (2008) pandemic influenza (H1N1) and found those were effective to some extent. Rashid (2015) researched the public health policy of the 2009 pandemic influenza and concluded that the school closure, whether positive or passive, seemed to be moderately effective and acceptable in reducing the spread of influenza and delaying the peak of the epidemic, but it is related to high expenses of secondary school. Voluntary isolation and quarantine at home are also effective and acceptable measures, but it takes the risk of intra-household transmission from index cases to contacts. Workplace-related interventions, such as work closure and work at home, are also moderately effective and acceptable, but it may have negatively impact on economy. Internal mobility restriction is only effective when extremely high restrictions (50% of travel) are imposed and mass gatherings which happened within 10 days before the epidemic peak is likely to increase the risk of transmission of influenzas. Rothstein (2015) compared the effectiveness of public health policies to intervene with infectious diseases, among which quarantine is one of the most aggressive and controversial measures that public health officials can take when trying to control an outbreak. Serious legal and ethical concerns have been raised because of restrictions on the movement of potentially large numbers of people (Fidler et al., 2007) . During the SARS epidemic in 2003, quarantine was widely used in several Asian countries and Canada, and it played a role in ending the epidemic. Similarly, during the 2014 Ebola outbreak in West Africa, social distancing measures, including quarantine, had become a major containment strategy. The paradox of quarantine and other social distancing measures is that they may effectively resist the outbreak of disease, but the scope of application is too wide, leading to various social hazards, including economic disruption, physical isolation and even violence. Quarantine is the first public health tool to control infectious diseases and remains a legitimate and valuable public health strategy because it has a significant impact on civil liberties, economic activity and social cohesion, so officials must be extra careful about the possibility of abusing quarantine authority (Rothstein, 2015) .","The mitigation scenarios shown in Figs. 4-5 assume that a fixed proportion (1.25%) of all current infections are in ICU at any given time. In reality, there is a time lag between infections becoming symptomatic (compartment Iu) and become severe enough to require ICU admission. To better reflect this, we assumed that no unconfirmed cases are in ICU and a fixed proportion of confirmed cases are in ICU. The proportion of confirmed cases in ICU was set at a level that gives the same overall proportion of ICU cases in the long run. The main consequence of this change to the model is that there is longer time lag before the strong control measures start to reduce the number of new infections, which means that cases overshoot hospital capacity (Fig. 6a) . If strong control is sufficiently effective (Rc=0.75), this problem can be offset by triggering strong earlier, when ICU reaches 50% of capacity rather than 100% of capacity (Fig. 6b) . As before, if strong control is less effective than hoped for (only reducing Rc to 1.5),the mitigation strategy fails as hospital capacity is completely overwhelmed and the mortality rate doubles (Fig. 6c ).","The recent outbreak of Covid-19 in Wuhan, China has led to a pandemic with significant impacts on public-health and economy across the globe. As the number of infected people increases in a community, public health policies move away from containment of the outbreak to mitigation strategies such as social distancing and isolation, with considerable detrimental effects on public life and the economy. While less restrictive mitigation strategies would be desirable, alternative choices are limited due to a lack of resources and technologies. To better understand the potential effects of a particular mitigation strategy, we must assess the underlying factors that impact the spread of the outbreak, and therefore mathematical models integrating the relevant underlying mechanisms are a good tool.","Coincident with the March 13 declaration of a national emergency (14) , social-distancing measures went into effect across the US (15) . Our estimate of several thousand active SARS-CoV-2 infections at that time suggests that large-scale mitigation efforts, rather than reactionary measures (29), were indeed necessary. Even after those efforts eventually begin to reverse increases in SARS-CoV-2 transmission in the US, our results show that a downturn in COVID-19 deaths would not be expected to appear until several weeks later. Analyses of the impact of large-scale mitigation efforts in China (30, 31) provide reason for optimism that those measures can be effective.","COVID-19 presents a unique challenge to public health. Effective mitigation of the disease will require nontrivial efforts from a significant fraction of the world population, including social distancing and avoiding unnecessary interactions with others. No matter how stringently these measures are recommended, a fraction of people may not believe that they can or should act in ways that will limit the threat. The HBM is a model that has been used to study behaviors related to preventing or mitigating disease. It conceptualizes beliefs about disease as being comprised of the perception of the threat as severe and relevant, the perception of benefits of and barriers to acting, and the perception of one's intrinsic ability to act. As trusted, community-facing healthcare professionals, pharmacists are uniquely suited to bring about change in patient behaviors.Community pharmacists using HBM to reinforce COVID-19 mitigation behaviors should appropriately emphasize the severity and susceptibility of the threat, emphasize barriers to acting, help patients identify ways to overcome barriers to acting, and reinforce self-efficacy beliefs.","We simulated two types of control strategy: suppression and mitigation. Both types of strategy were modelled by reduction in the transmission coefficient, resulting in a proportional reduction in the reproduction number with control (Rc). This is a very simple control model which assumes that transmission rates from pre-symptomatic, unconfirmed symptomatic and confirmed symptomatic infections are all reduced by a constant factor. This describes society-wide control interventions, such as social distancing, hygiene measures, and lockdowns. It does not account for control measures that specifically target confirmed cases, such as case isolation. These could be modelled by a larger reduction in transmission rates for confirmed cases; we did not attempt this but it could be included in future model refinements to investigate the dependence of control efficacy on testing. The magnitude of the reduction in Rc was calibrated by comparisons with international data on case trajectories ( Fig. 2 ) and modelling studies for the UK and US outbreaks (Ferguson et al 2020) . The latter study assumed that interventions would have a similar impacts as they do with seasonal influenza. We then simulated suppression strategies by a fixed reduction in Rc for a period of 400 days. We simulated mitigation strategies by dynamic changes in Rc aimed at keeping the demand on the healthcare system under capacity (i.e. current infections under 40,000). In all cases, control began at t = 42 days after exposure of the initial seed infections. Table 1 . Estimates for the hospitalisation rate, ICU admission rate and case fatality rate (CFR) for New Zealand. These were calculated from the age-specific rates published by CDC (2020) combined with the age structure of New Zealand's population (StatsNZ). These values assume that NZ has a similar healthcare system, rates of underlying health conditions, and Covid-19 testing rates as the US. Note that our model uses lower values than these estimates, which is reasonable because the model parameters represent rates per infection, which will be lower than rates per confirmed case if some infections are asymptomatic, subclinical or otherwise undiagnosed. ","We have seen that containment in China, Singapore, 3 and Hong Kong is possible, but we have also seen settings where control was lost. Remarkably, South Korea lost control and regained it with no lockdown and simply strong application of the above principles, enhanced by using novel digital technologies for contact tracing. 4 The consequences of noncontainment will be measured in lives lost and socioeconomic disruption, which will be far worse than the cost of rigorously implemented containment combined with mitigation efforts. \"Containment of COVID-19 is feasible and must remain the top priority for all countries\", WHO's Director-General said at a media briefing on COVID-19 on March 2, 2020. 5 WHO still does not waver from this message. China implemented extraordinary public health measures at great socioeconomic cost, moving swiftly and decisively to ensure early identification of cases, prompt laboratory testing, facility-based isolation of all cases, contact tracing, and quarantine. 2 In the community, mobility was at a near standstill, with social distancing implemented at a grand scale. China's massive transmission rates called for extreme measures, and the measures were successful.","To respond to COVID-19, many countries are using a combination of containment and mitigation activities with the intention of delaying major surges of patients and levelling the demand for hospital beds, while protecting the most vulnerable from infection, including elderly people and those with comorbidities. Activities to accomplish these goals vary and are based on national risk assessments that many times include estimated numbers of patients requiring hospitalisation and availability of hospital beds and ventilation support. Most national response strategies include varying levels of contact tracing and self-isolation or quarantine; promotion of public health measures, including handwashing, respiratory etiquette, and social distancing; preparation of health systems for a surge of severely ill patients who require isolation, oxygen, and mechanical ventilation; strengthening health facility infection prevention and control, with special attention to nursing home facilities; and postponement or cancellation of large-scale public gatherings.","c. Figure 5 . Mitigation strategies in which strong control (shaded blue time periods) fails to reduce the effective reproduction number Rc below 1. (a) Strong control is Rc = 1.2, trigger for strong control is when ICU reaches capacity; (b) Strong control is Rc = 1.2, trigger for strong control is when ICU reaches 50% capacity; (c) Strong control is Rc = 1.5, trigger for strong control is when ICU reaches 50% capacity. Weak control is (Rc =1.75) and the trigger for ending strong control is at 50% of the trigger for initiating strong control in all cases.","In less than four months, the outbreak has rapidly escalated from a World Health In the midst of this chaotic pandemic, the health care systems and its providers are endangered. In particular, front-line health care workers -emergency medicine physicians, intensivists, anesthesiologists, nurses, and many others -have continued to care for massive surges of COVID-19 patients in the setting of health systems illprepared for the level of disease severity with dangerous, worldwide shortages of personal protective equipment (PPE) and protocols that might attenuate health worker risk overwhelmed. Over 9,000 health care workers have developed infection internationally including 3,400 in China and over 6, 200 in Italy, as well as hundreds of infections in United States personnel. 4 During this time of a global health emergency, rapid communication, international collaboration, and transparency are critical to better inform and adapt the guidance of precautionary measures when new evidence becomes available. Countries around the world have responded in different ways in managing risk to ophthalmologists and patients in the absence of signs or symptoms of COVID-19. Preparedness through risk mitigation strategies for the public, patient and providers are warranted and should be informed by available evidence and our collective, global experience. The gaps in evidence that we face also need to be addressed during this pandemic to guide international consensus and inform preparedness measures for future outbreaks. Limiting ambulatory care services to time-sensitive or urgent conditions, particularly in high-volume specialties such as ophthalmology, have also been recommended to reduce the potential for transmission in the community and physician offices. However, measures within the clinic are also needed to mitigate risk for patients with urgent or emergent complaints, and routine evaluations as the outbreak abates.","The model further suggests that the public response to the epidemic and the containment measures put in place by the Chinese administration were effective despite the increase in confirmed cases. That this behavior was universally observed in all provinces also indicates that mitigation strategies were universally effective. Based on our analysis, we argue that the implemented containment strategies should stay in effect for a longer time than the incubation period after the saturation in confirmed cases sets in for this particular outbreak.","The copyright holder for this preprint . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.26.20044677 doi: medRxiv preprint Mitigation. Mitigation strategies were simulated as a combination of a low level of control (case isolation and household quarantine, reducing Rc to 1.75) with periods of high control as required to try and keep the number of cases under hospital capacity. There are various ways this could be achieved. One approach is a \"switching\" strategy ( Fig. 4) in which strong controls are imposed when hospital capacity is close to full (shaded blue areas in Fig. 4) and relaxed when there is spare hospital capacity available. The scenario shown in Fig. 4 requires the strong control periods to reduce Rc below 1 (Rc = 0.75 during periods in strong control in Fig. 4 ). Strong control is initiated when the number of ICU cases reaches capacity, and is lifted when the number of ICU cases drops to 50% of capacity. This is comparable to the scenario tested by Ferguson et al (2020) , where weak control means Rc=1.75 (representing case isolation and household quarantine in the Ferguson et al (2020) model) and strong control means Rc=0.75 (representing the above measures plus populationwide social distancing in Ferguson et al (2020)). Periods of alternating strong/weak control are required to continue for approximately 750 days to prevent hospital capacity from being exceeded.","If and when local transmission begins in a particular location, a variety of community mitigation measures can be implemented by health authorities to reduce transmission and thus reduce the growth rate of an epidemic, reduce the height of the epidemic peak and the peak demand on healthcare services, as well as reduce the total number of infected persons [21]. A number of social distancing measures have already been implemented in Chinese cities in the past few weeks including school and workplace closures. It should now be an urgent priority to quantify the effects of these measures and specifically whether they can reduce the effective reproductive number below 1, because this will guide the response strategies in other locations. During the 1918/19 influenza pandemic, cities in the United States, which implemented the most aggressive and sustained community measures were the most successful ones in mitigating the impact of that pandemic [22].","In recent times, our ability to control epidemic outbreaks has been, to a high degree, facilitated not only by advances in modern science (new cures, new drugs, and cooperative infrastructures for disease control and surveillance), but also by the worldwide spread of new technologies such as computers and smartphones, which allow more than 2 billion persons worldwide to have access to the Internet. This represents an unprecedented opportunity to collect and communicate health-related information in real time and with high geographical resolution, including individuals who do not have contact with the healthcare system. Real-time surveillance data are crucial for rapidly identifying public health emergencies, optimizing the allocation of resources to respond to them, and devising mitigation and containment measures.","The course of an epidemic is defined by a series of key factors, some of which are poorly understood at present for COVID-19. The basic reproduction number (R 0 ), which defines the mean number of secondary cases generated by one primary case when the population is largely susceptible to infection, determines the overall number of people who are likely to be infected, or more precisely the area under the epidemic curve. For an epidemic to take hold, the value of R 0 must be greater than unity in value. A simple calculation gives the fraction likely to be infected without mitigation. This fraction is roughly 1-1/R 0 . With R 0 values for COVID-19 in China around 2\u00b75 in the early stages of the epidemic, 2 we calculate that approximately 60% of the population would become infected. This is a very worst-case scenario for a number of reasons. We are uncertain about transmission in children, some communities are remote and unlikely to be exposed, voluntary social distancing by individuals and communities will have an impact, and mitigation efforts, such as the measures put in place in China, greatly reduce transmission. As an epidemic progresses, the effective reproduction number (R) declines until it falls below unity in value when the epidemic peaks and then decays, either due to the exhaustion of people susceptible to infection or the impact of control measures.","During the SARS epidemic in mainland China, various interventions were implemented to contain the outbreak. 20 Overall, the measures taken were certainly effective, given the fact that the epidemic was fully controlled within 200 days after the first case emerged. The method of Wallinga and Teunis, 21 with quantifications from Lipsitch et al, 22 was used to estimate R t , the effective or net reproduction number, which helps to determine which interventions were most important; R t is defined as the mean number of secondary cases infected by one primary case with symptom onset on day t. This number changes during the course of an epidemic, particularly as a result of effective control measures. If R t is larger than the threshold value of 1, a sustained chain of transmission will occur, eventually leading to a major epidemic. If this number is maintained below 1, then transmission may still continue, but the number of secondary cases is not sufficient to replace the primary cases, leading to a gradual fade out of the epidemic. Fig. 3 shows R t over time for mainland China, along with the timing of nine important events and public health control measures. The graph is characterized by a fluctuating pattern and wide confidence interval early in the epidemic, which can be explained by the initial low number of cases used in the calculations and the relatively more important impact of so-called \"super-spreading events.\" In Guangdong Province, where the epidemic started, standard control measures, such as isolation and contact tracing (arrow 2), seem to already have helped to largely interrupt transmission in this province. However, during the period from day 80 to day 140, the number of new SARS cases steadily increased, due to the spread to and within other parts of China (i.e., mainly Beijing and its surrounding provinces). The first official report of an outbreak in Guangdong Province (arrow 3) and the WHO global alerts (arrow 4) were by no means reflected in a consistent reduction of R t . Additionally, the first interventions in Beijing were not effective enough to cause any downward trend in the transmission (arrow 5). It was only around April 11 to April 14, 2003 , that the Chinese authorities gained full control of all activities to combat SARS, with national, unambiguous, rational, widely followed guidelines and control measures, under central guidance (arrow 6). Immediately, the reproduction number decreased dramatically and consistently. Within 1 week, R t was below 1. Strikingly, this marked decrease after the period from April 11 to April 14, 2003 , was consistently present in the patterns of R t for all heavily affected areas in mainland China. 23 The stringent control measures to prevent human contacts (arrow 7), including the decision to cancel the public holiday of May 1 (arrow 8), were all initiated after R t was below 1 (i.e., when the epidemic was already dying off), again consistently for all areas in mainland China. Given the information available at the time, the most stringent interventions were rational because it was not clear to which extent the epidemic was under control. However, looking retrospectively, we can now conclude that these measures, which severely affected public life, contributed little to the factual containment of the SARS epidemic; the essential moment had occurred earlier. That being said, the late interventions may still have played a role in speeding up the elimination of SARS. Additionally, cancelling the public holidaywhen millions of people travel long distances to visit their family-may have prevented (smaller) outbreaks in yet unaffected locations.","Our calculation shows that the just-in-time scenario accomplishes this and that the window for such a strong mitigation will soon be closed. Of course, one cannot be sure that the dates and course of the epidemic are going to follow the precise predictions we have made. There are inevitable uncertainties in making predictions for such a powerful phenomenon as an epidemic. However, whether the outcomes predicted by our scenarios occur on exactly the dates given here, and with exactly the numbers provided here, they will occur as we have predicted. The window that we have predicted is rather short, perhaps two weeks at the longest. Thus to be safe, the mitigation measures should be implemented as soon as possible, while they will be effective; at the same time, for humanitarian reasons, the societal implications of lockdown require appropriate arrangements to be made for the city's population, as has already done for the mitigation efforts to date.","The effective control of the epidemic depends not only on the selection of prevention and control measures of the authority but also on the performance of the public. Therefore, in this section, we further use Baidu Search Index to explore the influence of the public's access to information, protection awareness, and public confidence on the implementation effect of traffic control and social distancing measures. Fast and effective information dissemination can greatly reduce the information asymmetry of the public and to raise public awareness of the epidemic. We use the Baidu search index of \"COVID-19\" to characterize the degree of information spread among the public. A higher search index means that the public has learned about the novel coronavirus earlier and paid more attention to it; the public's protection awareness and positive attitude will allow them to better carry out the measures, which can absolutely improve the effectiveness of policy implementation. Here, we use the Baidu search index of \"the correct way of wearing a mask\" to characterize protection awareness of the public.","Influenza, a major respiratory disease, poses great risks to global health. Influenza epidemics and pandemics are responsible for 250 000-500 000 deaths each year (www.who.int/mediacentre/ factsheets/fs211/en/) and &gt;50 million fatalities worldwide in the past century (www.cdc.gov/flu/pandemic-resources/ basics/past-pandemics.html), respectively. The next influenza pandemic is estimated to cause $60 million deaths [1] . Ideally, vaccination within 2 months of the outbreak can provide effective protection [2] . However, because several months are necessary for vaccine development and administration, the infection risk is heightened during the non-vaccine period. This is further supported by the outcomes of 2002-2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak that originated in China, in which the disease was transmitted globally within few weeks, but the first vaccine Phase I clinical study began a year after the outbreak [3] . Logistically, an effective pandemic preparedness plan should include both vaccination and alternative mitigation methods (pharmaceuticalantiviral; non-pharmaceuticalisolation, administrative control, personal protective measures). Therefore, respiratory protection devices are a key non-pharmaceutical intervention that is essential to the global strategy for pandemic readiness.","Beyond its direct application to Singapore, our work holds a wider relevance on how governments and global health authorities can use such methods to inform better management of epidemics and pandemics. It has been argued that, during the influenza pandemic in 2009, the failure of WHO and government health agencies was not so much in their assessment of the severity of the threat or what interventions might be effective against it, but in being able to effectively communicate the risk and the benefits of select mitigation strategies.60 61 Prior assessment of population level preferences could help identify thresholds of epidemic severity which could serve as triggers for the implementation of more disruptive measures. In addition, information from such surveys could be used to explain the rationale for particular decisions, with hierarchical cluster analysis used to support the targeting of different messages to audiences with different values. Whereas surveys have been performed retrospectively to gauge support for government responses to specific circumstances like the SARS-CoV outbreaks in 2003 and influenza pandemic in 2009,62 63 our method is the first conjoint analysis that quantifies public support for government interventions over a realistic range of outbreak scenarios and parameters.","\u2022 Risk assessment must be coordinated and integrated with the host country's national risk assessment \u2022 Comprehensive risk assessment (with input from public health authorities) reviewed and updated regularly assessment. If a decision is made to proceed with MG events, risk mitigation measures should be put in place, consistent with WHO guidance on social distancing for COVID-19, 16 and the rationale for the decision should be clearly explained and communicated to the public.","An interesting example in this direction comes from the Canton Ticino, 7 the canton in Switzerland bordering to Lombardy. On March the 12 th , the Canton Ticino has adopted measures aimed at contrasting the diffusion of the virus which are explicitly aimed at protecting the elderly and atrisk populations. To this aim, the resolution 1262 8 \"strongly discourages\" people over 65 (and those categories at risk of incurring serious complications that can endanger their lives) to \"look after children, participate in public or private events, use public transportation, except for medical and professional needs or for the purchase of basic necessities, and attend public exercise.\" Further research to test how population age structure, intergenerational contacts, and social distancing measures interact to best mitigate risk is needed. 6 https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/11/science/coronavirus-curve-mitigation-infection.html 7 We thank Prof. Luca Crivelli for this suggestion. 8 https://www4.ti.ch/fileadmin/DSS/DSP/UMC/malattie_infettive/Coronavirus/1262.pdf .

We calculate total societal costs of the pandemic and corresponding non-pharmaceutical measures. These costs include three components: costs of mortality, costs of illness and costs of reduced economic activity due to mitigation and precautionary demand.","In Figure 2 and Table 1 , we show the results of simulating the effects of strong mitigation on the demand for ICU beds in Chicago. We ran two simulations with the parameter R0 = 0.9, probably the least severe mitigation that one can do which is guaranteed to eventually end the COVID-19 epidemic. In one simulation (the \"late mitigation\" scenario), shown by the red curve, the mitigation was fully implemented by April 20 th 2020. In the other, shown by the blue curve (the \"just-in-time mitigation\" scenario), the mitigation was fully implemented by April 1 st 2020. The implementation of the mitigations was assumed to ramp up gradually over a period of time, and the strong steps already taken in Illinois are part of this mitigation and included in the calculation. Further mitigations are no doubt possible, and strong mitigation would be the final additional step.","In this section, we will describe the whole process of a epidemic under assumption that the government has implemented effective control measures, which can be divided into four stages, i.e. \"outbreak period\", \"controlled period\", \"mitigation period\" and \"convergence period\" successively. And we will quantify the iconic features for each stage, which corresponds to the two turning points and two \"zero\" points, respectively.","Seventh, if widespread community transmission is established, there should then be consideration of a transition to include mitigation activities, especially if contact tracing becomes ineffective or overwhelming and an inefficient use of resources. Examples of mitigation activities include cancelling public gatherings, school closure, remote working, home isolation, observation of the health of symptomatic individuals supported by telephone or online health consultation, and provision of essential life support such as oxygen supplies, mechanical ventilators and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) equipment.","The timing of activation of social distancing measures is a challenge facing public health authorities, balancing what needs to be done with what is feasible, and this will vary between countries. Our modelling gives initial guidance on the relative benefit of a range of mitigation strategies. As the COVID-19 pandemic develops more subtle strategies will need to be evaluated, such as the phased introduction of additional measures if it is found that existing strategies are ineffective in reducing daily case numbers. Similarly, modelling will be required to determine optimal strategies to phase the ending of interventions once the epidemic peak has passed. Models such as that presented here will have a key role in analysing these evolving situations.","We therefore tested the consequences of uncertainty in the effectiveness of strong control measures (Fig. 5) , and in the timing of the trigger for initiating strong control (Fig. 6 ). If strong control only reduces Rc to 1.2, following the same strong/weak protocol as in Fig. 4 does not succeed in keeping (Fig. 5a) , although it does still achieve a major reduction in peak size and overall mortality relative to the uncontrolled case. The outcome can be improved slightly by triggering strong control earlier (Fig.  5b , strong control initiated when ICU cases reach 50% of capacity). If strong control only reduces Rc to 1.5 (Fig. 5c) , even with the earlier trigger, the mitigation strategy fails as hospital capacity is substantially exceeded and the population mortality increases to 1.0% (almost double that for Fig. 4) .","WHO's risk assessment tool enables organisers to methodically review key considerations and risk management steps for hosting an event, assess risks with a weighted-system approach, and factor in risk reduction through various mitigation measures. The COVID-19 Risk Assessment for MGs 14 builds on existing guidance for MGs. The standard risk questions for a MG involve assessment of how well prepared and equipped the host country health system is to detect an usual health event, such as a disease outbreak, and to respond quickly and effectively to the event if it happens. The new risk assessment tool adds an element to assess the additional risk from the MG in relation to . This risk assessment includes questions on the range of countries participants will come from, the prevalence and transmission pattern of COVID-19 in these countries and in the host country, the extent of social interactions that is likely to arise at the MG, and the demographic profile of participants. The COVID-19 Risk Assessment for MGs tool then involves consideration of the possible mitigation actions that could be put in place at the MG to reduce the risk against a list of questions about the host's understanding of, and preparedness for, COVID-19 response measures.","For many countries around the world, the focus of public health officers in the context of COVID-19 epidemic has 256 shifted from containment to mitigation and delay. Our study provides new insights for designing effective outbreak 257 control strategies. We show that hand-washing, mask-wearing, and social distancing adopted by disease-aware 258 individuals are all viable strategies for delaying the epidemic peak, flattening the epidemic curve and reducing the 259 attack rate. We show that the rate at which disease awareness spreads has a strong impact on how self-imposed CC-BY 4.0 International license It is made available under a author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.","This cost-benefit analysis calculates monetary estimates of total costs for three different approaches. The laissez-faire implies doing nothing. The herd immunity approach applies non-pharmaceutical measures to keep the number of new cases at the maximum of healthcare capacity. The third aggressive approach uses the most aggressive non-pharmaceutical suppression and mitigation measures to reduce the number of new cases and then tries to eliminate the virus through extensive testing, case tracking and case isolation. We use the results of epidemiological modeling (Ferguson et al, 2020) for the first two approaches and our conservative estimates based on existing data for the third approach to project the number of infections, number of critical cases and the number of deaths. We then calculate costs of mitigation measures and of the disease itself for total output and add these costs to the costs of lives lost estimated through the value of statistical life approach.","A major advantage of suppression strategies as opposed to mitigation is that early suppression buys time. This has two key benefits: (1) it may be possible to delay the epidemic for long enough that a vaccine and/or effective treatment become widely available in NZ; and (2) it allows NZ to learn from rapidly unfolding events in other countries. This could include learning which mitigation strategies are most successful, and how to ensure timing of control interventions is robust to uncertainty.","Evidence-based guidelines alone in complex humanitarian crises may not suffice during the emergence of the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Without the adaptation of existing standards, mitigation plans will fall short of health and human rights obligations in outbreak response. Crisis-affected community engagement is integral in pandemic planning, in order to maximize the real-world effectiveness of efficacious interventions. Transparent and credible information-sharing mechanisms are increasingly essential when pandemics threaten vulnerable populations [10]. Diplomacy bridging long-standing mistrust of public health and biomedical interventions and facilitating engagement with contentious actors is a necessary component of effective health governance in complex crisis settings [2]. Interventions tailored to the needs of crisis-affected populations, delivered with transparent information, in the context of inclusive governance practices, are urgently needed in the global response to the COVID-19 pandemic.","Despite these limitations, this study showed that providing outpatients with information about the efficacy of control measures to prevent nosocomial SARS infection might have a statistically significant and substantial impact on the outpatients' intention to continue outpatient visits at the hospital. We believe that every health authority has a responsibility to implement a comprehensive and effective communication strategy to share information about SARS with the public [23] . Based on a comprehensive insight into the needs and perceptions of the public for SARS, health authorities have to provide appropriate information about SARS care to both health care providers and the public. This study showed that respondents who were scared about nosocomial SARS infection were five times less likely to continue outpatient visits than those who were not scared by it, even after they read the information about the efficacy of the SARS infection control in the hospital. Health authorities should thus properly provide both general information about SARS and information about the efficacy of control measures for nosocomial SARS infection prevention to the public so that they can easily understand the value and meaning of the information.","week is comparable to that in Italy before its lockdown, it can be concluded that in absence of an immediate escalation in public health interventions, approximately 15,000 cases could be expected by the end of the month. Canada can capitalize on the \"Italian experience\": the epidemic growth rate in Italy has been significantly reduced after implementing and enforcing the closure of all non-essential activities. If the measures taken by the Canadian government would allow to reduce immediately the growth rate by half, the case number could be reduced to about 4,000 by the end of the month (this estimate does not incorporate any case influx from the USA). It is anyway of fundamental importance to consider the delay, which may be as large as two weeks, before intervention measures have a concrete mitigation effect.","as transmission and recovery rate, the model introduces effective quarantine measures that act on both, symptomatic infected individuals as well as susceptible individuals. We show that depleting both \"ends\" of the transmission interactions that involve an infectious and a susceptible individual naturally yields a sub-exponential, algebraic increase in confirmed cases. This behavior is qualitatively different from the behavior expected in a scenario in which only infecteds are targets of containment strategies to reduce transmission. In this case one expects either a stable exponential growth at a lower rate or an exponential decay if mitigation is sufficiently effective.","Even in presence of the above limitations, the analysis of the Wuhan 2019-nCoV outbreak and the modeling assessment of the effects of travel limitations could be instrumental to national and international agencies for public health response planning. We show that by January 23 2020, the epidemic had already spread to other cities within China. The travel quarantine around Wuhan has only modestly delayed the epidemic spread to other areas of China. This is in agreement with separate studies on the diffusion of the 2019-nCoV virus in China (29; 21; 30). The model indicates that while the Wuhan travel ban was initially effective at reducing international case importations, the number of cases observed outside China will resume its growth after 2-3 weeks from cases that originated elsewhere. Furthermore, the modeling study shows that additional travel limitations up to 90% of the traffic have a modest effect unless paired with public health interventions and behavioral changes that achieve a considerable reduction in the disease transmissibility (31). The above results provides data with potential uses for the definition of optimized containment schemes and mitigation policies that includes the local and international dimension of the 2019-nCoV epidemic.","is the (which was not peer-reviewed) The copyright holder for this preprint . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.30.20048264 doi: medRxiv preprint dependent on public health interventions including social distancing measures, isolation of the infected, 225 delayed school openings, and extensive testing of potential contacts of confirmed cases.

For example, the cooperation process among the concerned National Authorities is not detailed, since no systematic procedure on the information sharing among National SPOC has been provided yet (EMA and HMA, 2019a,b) . At the moment, only EMA's decision tree specific for shortages due to GMP non-compliance/quality defects is publicly available (EMA, 2013). Moreover, no procedures to triage the shortage impact on patient's health were detailed in the guidelines, leaving plenty of room to the Member States in defining the measures to assess the information notified by the MAH and mitigate the risk of shortages. However, there is a strong need for proper and effective risk-assessment and problemsolving strategies to reduce nationwide shortages without wasting money and time. In the absence of a harmonized triage procedure, there is the risk of increasing the workload for MAHs and Regulatory Authorities to manage shortages with a low impact on public health, even though they are already mitigated and managed effectively at dispensing level. As reported by the Royal Dutch Pharmacists Association Farmanco\u00ae platform, the continuity of treatments is ensured in about 90% of the medicine shortage cases by the medicine substitution with therapeutic alternatives (PGEU, 2019). When more than one country is involved in a shortage, the situation is even more critical. For example, the same medicinal product may be triaged in different matters by competent National Authorities and different mitigation plan may be required to the MAHs. This hypothesis is particularly relevant for comarketing products produced by the same contractor or medicinal products authorized by decentralized or mutual recognition procedures. The involved SPOC may not be able to assess the shortage crisis quickly and to coordinate the mitigation strategies in a useful matter. Consequently, the efforts of MAH/contractor in restoring the National supply may be slowed down by different National obligations that contrast each other. For example, in the presence of reduced manufacturing capacity, the obligation for MAH to maintain a preventive stockpiling in some countries (e.g., Switzerland) may worsen the product availability in the other involved markets. Another critical issue, which has not been adequately tackled by the guidelines yet, is the management of product shortages induced by raw materials unavailability. Indeed, the ongoing/expected shortages of raw material may cause, for a ripple effect, shortages of medicinal products in several countries without MAHs can predict or notify them in advance. Economic globalization promotes the delocalization and gathering of manufacturing sites of pharmaceutical raw materials, impacting on the resilience of the pharmaceutical supply chain of many medicinal products to the shortage. For example, between 2008 and 2009, the so-called \"Great Acetonitrile Shortage\" caused shortages of several drug substances, for which synthesis the solvent was used, and drug products (PDA, 2014). Sartans and immunoglobulins give other examples. In the former case, after the discovery of cancerogenic impurities in sartans (i.e. valsartan, losartan irbesartan) produced by some manufacturers, the blockage of the drug substances' production and multiple medicines' recalls caused severe shortages in most of the European countries (EMA, 2019b). In the latter case, shortages are due to a low-manufacturing capacity in comparison to the growing demand of immunoglobulins. Although the immunoglobulins use has been tripled worldwide in the past 20 years, their production is limited by the availability of human plasma, from which the immunoglobulins are extracted and purified (Carrock Sewell et al., 2014) . In this context, several National Authorities (e.g., France, Germany, UK) have published priority rankings and guidelines for the use of immunoglobulins in clinical practice to reduce the shortage risks and rationalize the patients' access to therapies. In all these cases, the notification process proposed by the EMA/HMA guideline seems not sufficient to detect the risk of shortage since the MAHs are not aware of the resilience of its raw material suppliers to shortage and, therefore, they are not able to monitor effectively raw materials suppliers and predict failures in their manufacturing chain. For these products, more centralized coordination of the risk control strategies by the EMA and, consequently, a more efficient sharing of information among National Regulatory Authorities are needed to better mitigation of shortage impact at a national level and to fulfil the needs of all the patients.","To establish effective communication between health authorities and the public, health authorities must take into account both the channels through which they can convey information most effectively and the timing when the information provided will have the most advantageous effect [23] . General information about SARS and control measures for SARS transmission has been reported in newspapers and TV news. Nevertheless, this study revealed that one-third of respondents changed their mind after they read information about efficacy of SARS control in the hospital. Therefore, in terms of channels, mass media, such as newspaper and television, play the major role in communicating with the public. However, the mass media is a two-edged sword; sometimes the public are relieved that they have less chance to catch SARS in hospital due to a news story, and sometimes they are scared about susceptibility to SARS infection. Thus, health authorities should establish an effective communication system which avoids an epidemic of fear due to poor communication between health authorities and the mass media and the public.","The study provides a deterministic mathematical model to analyse and predict characteristics of an infectious disease spreading in an extremely large population with strong prevention and control measures. The model depends purely on statistic data of categorised epidemic cases reported in public. We apply the model to the emergence of COVID-19 in China. Although the model is not yet perfect, it is effective, robust and consistent as long as there is no sudden change in control measures. Comparing with the classic SIR model, we extract the basic reproduction number, R 0 , and make predictions on the time when the effective reproduction number will become less than one and on the total number of confirmed cases in the end. Our study indicates that it is essential to take effective control measures as early as possible for curbing an infectious disease and it is important to report epidemic data precisely and timely for epidemiological modelling. In the era of globalisation, an infectious disease can spread as far as any individual can reach on the earth, that makes the whole world population to be susceptible. As COVID-19 has spread around the world, we anticipate our method can be adapted in modelling the spread and help public health authorities make policy decisions.","The copyright holder for this preprint . https://doi.org/10. 1101 /2020 was implemented in Wuhan. 3 days later, on January 23, Wuhan city was closed. 2 days later, on January 25, all provinces in China except Tibet triggered a level 1 public health emergency response. As can be seen from figure 2A, 2B, 3A and 3B, the peak of daily new laboratory-confirmed cases in mainland China and Hubei province were on February 9, approximately 14 days (one quarantine observation period) after the public health emergency response, which indicates that the public health measures proved to be effective. The peak in other provinces appeared earlier, approximately on February 5. The possible reason is that the epidemic outside Hubei Province is less serious and easier to control. We can see that the first-grade prevention policy (on January 20) hadn't been carried out until 20 days after the outbreak (on Dec 31). After the SARS epidemic in 2003, Chinas public health system has received attention, but problems that emerged during the initial stage of the COVID-19 epidemic indicated that it still lacks the ability to respond quickly to unexpected infectious diseases and public health emergencies. There is still much room for improvement in the prevention and control system for major public health emergencies (Ding et al. 2020 ).",".

Social distancing measures imposed by state authorities can hardly be fine-tuned enough to hit this critical interval precisely. Furthermore, herd immunity within these intervals is at best 15% percent of the population and would hence not provide sufficient protection for a second epidemic wave. The main reason for the narrowness of the mitigation interval as well as for the low critical value R min is the household structure. Infections within the households for patients with mild progression can hardly be avoided and therefore a small number of infection links between the households can already make the epidemic overcritical. In the subcritical domain we observe a strong dependence of time till extinction on the outreproduction number R*. Reasonable extinction times are only achievable for very low values below 1/3 secondary infections outside of households. We conclude that instead, an extinction strategy implemented by quick, effective 11 .

By understanding the mechanisms of emergence, outbreak management plans can be developed and risk mitigation processes can be implemented. Once identified, risk reduction strategies can be implemented through education of the general public, doctors, veterinarians and policy makers [77] . Measures such as the wearing of appropriate protective equipment (PPE) when caring for patients or animals and restriction on the sale and consumption of game meat would reduce the risks of transmission of bat-borne viruses.","We explain our conclusion here. First, under Article 43.2, countries cannot implement additional health measures exclusively as a precaution but must rather ground their decision making in \"scientific principles\", \"scientific evidence\", and \"advice from WHO\". 1 Many of the travel restrictions being implemented during the COVID-19 outbreak are not supported by science or WHO. Travel restrictions for these kinds of viruses have been challenged by public health researchers, [4] [5] [6] and WHO has advised against travel restrictions, arguing they cause more harm than good. 7, 8 Second, under Article 43.1 any additional health measures implemented by countries \"shall not be more restrictive of international traffic and not more invasive or intrusive to persons than reasonably available alternatives\". 1 In this case, even if travel restrictions did work, there are so many other more effective measures that countries can take to protect their citizens. WHO has issued COVID-19 technical guidance on several such measures, including risk communication, surveillance, patient management, and screening at ports of entry and exit. 9 Third, and most importantly, Article 3.1 strictly requires all additional health measures to be implemented \"with full respect for the dignity, human rights and fundamental freedoms of persons\", 1 which in turn must reflect the international law principles of necessity, legitimacy, and proportionality that govern limitations to and derogations from rights and freedoms. 10 Under no circumstances should public health or foreign policy decisions be based on the racism and xenophobia that are now being directed at Chinese people and those of Asian descent. 11 Many of the travel restrictions implemented by dozens of countries during the COVID-19 outbreak are therefore violations of the IHR. 12 Yet, perhaps even more troubling, is that at least two-thirds of these countries have not reported their additional health measures to WHO, 12 response to public health emergencies and prevents countries from holding each other accountable for their obligations under the IHR. Some countries argue that they would rather be safe than sorry. But evidence belies the claim that illegal travel restrictions make countries safer. [4] [5] [6] In the short term, travel restrictions prevent supplies from getting into affected areas, slow down the international public health response, stigmatise entire populations, and disproportionately harm the most vulnerable among us. In the longer term, countries selecting which international laws to follow encourages other countries to do the same, which in turn undermines the broader rules-based world order. Effective global governance is not possible when countries cannot depend on each other to comply with international agreements. 13 Of course, the IHR is far from perfect. For example, the IHR only governs countries, not corporations and other non-governmental actors. Thus, some countries are finding themselves with de-facto travel restrictions when airlines stop flying to places affected by COVID-19."],"title":["Can we contain the COVID-19 outbreak with the same measures as for SARS?","Suppression and Mitigation Strategies for Control of COVID-19 in New Zealand","Suppression and Mitigation Strategies for Control of COVID-19 in New Zealand","Which Measures are Effective in Containing COVID-19?
