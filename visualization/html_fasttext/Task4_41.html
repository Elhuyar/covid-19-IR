In this study, we investigate whether platelet count could differentiate between COVID-19 patients with or without severe disease. Additionally, we evaluate if thrombocytopenia is associated with severe COVID-19. Methods An electronic search in Medline, Scopus and Web of Science was performed to identify studies reporting data on platelet count in COVID-19 patients. A meta-analysis was performed, with calculation of weighted mean difference (WMD) of platelet number in COVID-19 patients with or without severe disease and odds ratio (OR) of thrombocytopenia for severe form of COVID-19. Results Nine studies with 1779 COVID-19 patients, 399 (22.4%) with severe disease, were included in the meta-analysis. The pooled analysis revealed that platelet count was significantly lower in patients with more severe COVID-19 (WMD \u221231 ...","","Abstract Due to serotype variations among different avian infectious bronchitis viruses isolated in Tunisia since 2000, protection of chicks, especially broiler flocks, with Mass H120 vaccine often fails. Therefore, association of CR88 (793B type) with H120 vaccines was used for better response. Challenge experiments were then conducted to evaluate tracheal and renal cross-protection in chickens immunized via nasal and eye drops. Conferred protection was measured by clinical signs and macroscopic lesions observed, based on scores attributed according to their severities. The results showed a low protection conferred by H120 alone, as vaccination did not reduce tracheal and kidney lesions (70% scored as 3) after TN20/00 virus challenge, which also led to 10% mortality. Conversely, the challenge results indicated that the combination of the 2 strains (H120/CR88) allow high protection. Based on the results of the challenge experiments, a vaccination protocol coupling CR88 to H120 was appl...","COVID-19 has spread to most countries in the world. Puzzlingly, the impact of the disease is different in different countries. These differences are attributed to differences in cultural norms, mitigation efforts, and health infrastructure. Here we propose that national differences in COVID-19 impact could be partially explained by the different national policies respect to Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) childhood vaccination. BCG vaccination has been reported to offer broad protection to respiratory infections. We compared large number of countries BCG vaccination policies with the morbidity and mortality for COVID-19. We found that countries without universal policies of BCG vaccination (Italy, Nederland, USA) have been more severely affected compared to countries with universal and long-standing BCG policies. Countries that have a late start of universal BCG policy (Iran, 1984) had high mortality, consistent with the idea that BCG protects the vaccinated elderly population. We also ...","Abstract Purpose During a global pandemic the benefit of routine visits and treatment of cancer patients must be weighed against the risks to patients, staff, and society. Prostate cancer is one of the most common cancers Radiation Oncology departments treat, and efficient resource utilization is essential in the setting of a pandemic. Herein, we aim to establish recommendations and a framework by which to evaluate prostate radiotherapy management decisions. Patients and Methods Radiation Oncologists from the United States and United Kingdom rapidly conducted a systematic review and agreed upon recommendations to safely manage prostate cancer patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. A RADS framework was created: Remote visits, and Avoidance, Deferment, and Shortening of radiotherapy was applied to determine appropriate approaches. Results Recommendations are provided by National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) risk group, including clinical node positive, post-prostatectomy, oligomet...","Compared with other mammals, bats harbor more zoonotic viruses per species and do not demonstrate signs of disease on infection with these viruses. To counteract infections with viruses, bats have evolved enhanced mechanisms to limit virus replication and immunopathology. However, molecular and cellular drivers of antiviral responses in bats largely remain an enigma. In this study, we demonstrate that a serine residue in IRF3 is positively selected for in multiple bat species. IRF3 is a central regulator of innate antiviral responses in mammals. Replacing the serine residue in bat IRF3 with the human leucine residue decreased antiviral protection in bat cells, whereas the addition of this serine residue in human IRF3 significantly enhanced antiviral protection in human cells. Our study provides genetic and functional evidence for enhanced IRF3-mediated antiviral responses in bats and adds support to speculations that bats have positively selected for multiple adaptations in their antiv...","Abstract An enhanced polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay to detect the coronavirus associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV) was developed in which a target gene pre-amplification step preceded TaqMan real-time fluorescent PCR. Clinical samples were collected from 120 patients diagnosed as suspected or probable SARS cases and analyzed by conventional PCR followed by agarose gel electrophoresis, conventional TaqMan real-time PCR, and our enhanced TaqMan real-time PCR assays. An amplicon of the size expected from SARS-CoV was obtained from 28/120 samples using the enhanced real-time PCR method. Conventional PCR and real-time PCR alone identified fewer SARS-CoV positive cases. Results were confirmed by viral culture in 3/28 cases. The limit of detection of the enhanced real-time PCR method was 102-fold higher than the standard real-time PCR assay and 107-fold higher than conventional PCR methods. The increased sensitivity of the assay may help control the spread of th...","Summary The Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) has infected over 1600 individuals with nearly 600 deaths since it was first identified in human populations in 2012. No antiviral therapies or vaccines are available for its treatment or prophylaxis. Approaches to the development of MERS vaccines are discussed herein, including a summary of previous efforts to develop vaccines useful against human and non-human coronaviruses. A striking feature of MERS is the important role that camels have in transmission. Camel vaccination may be a novel approach to preventing human infection.","Abstract Two novel coronaviruses have emerged to cause severe disease in humans. While bats may be the primary reservoir for both viruses, SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) likely crossed into humans from civets in China, and MERS coronavirus (MERS-CoV) has been transmitted from camels in the Middle East. Unlike SARS-CoV that resolved within a year, continued introductions of MERS-CoV present an on-going public health threat. Animal models are needed to evaluate countermeasures against emerging viruses. With SARS-CoV, several animal species were permissive to infection. In contrast, most laboratory animals are refractory or only semi-permissive to infection with MERS-CoV. This host-range restriction is largely determined by sequence heterogeneity in the MERS-CoV receptor. We describe animal models developed to study coronaviruses, with a focus on host-range restriction at the level of the viral receptor and discuss approaches to consider in developing a model to evaluate countermeasures agai...","Abstract An important effort has been performed after the emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic in 2003 to diagnose and prevent virus spreading. Several types of vaccines have been developed including inactivated viruses, subunit vaccines, virus-like particles (VLPs), DNA vaccines, heterologous expression systems, and vaccines derived from SARS-CoV genome by reverse genetics. This review describes several aspects essential to develop SARS-CoV vaccines, such as the correlates of protection, virus serotypes, vaccination side effects, and bio-safeguards that can be engineered into recombinant vaccine approaches based on the SARS-CoV genome. The production of effective and safe vaccines to prevent SARS has led to the development of promising vaccine candidates, in contrast to the design of vaccines for other coronaviruses, that in general has been less successful. After preclinical trials in animal models, efficacy and safety evaluation of the most promising vaccin...","Abstract We argue that enhanced Traffic Control Bundling (eTCB) can interrupt the community-hospital-community transmission cycle, thereby limiting COVID-19\u2019s impact. Enhanced TCB is an expansion of the traditional TCB that proved highly effective during Taiwan\u2019s 2003 SARS outbreak. TCB\u2019s success derived from ensuring that Health Care Workers (HCWs) and patients were protected from fomite, contact and droplet transmission within hospitals. Although TCB proved successful during SARS, achieving a similar level of success with the COVID-19 outbreak requires adapting TCB to the unique manifestations of this new disease. These manifestations include asymptomatic infection, a hyper-affinity to ACE2 receptors resulting in high transmissibility, false negatives, and an incubation period of up to 22 days. Enhanced TCB incorporates the necessary adaptations. In particular, eTCB includes expanding the TCB transition zone to incorporate a new sector \u2013 the quarantine ward. This ward houses patients...","Abstract The causative agent of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) was identified as a coronavirus (CoV) following the outbreak of 2002\u20132003. There are currently no licensed vaccines or treatments for SARS-CoV infections. Potential prevention and control strategies that show promise in vitro must be evaluated in animal models. The aged BALB/c mouse model for SARS supports a high level of viral replication in association with clinical illness and disease that mimics SARS in the elderly. We tested two preventive strategies, vaccination and passive transfer of serum antibody, to determine the extent of protection achieved against SARS-CoV challenge in this model. These approaches were able to achieve or induce antibody titers sufficient to reduce viral load, protect from weight loss and reduce or eliminate histopathologic changes in the lungs of aged mice. This study validates the utility of the aged BALB/c mouse model for evaluation of the efficacy of vaccines and immunoprophylaxis...","The purpose of this article is to reach all those who find it difficult to become well informed about the repercussions of a lockdown strategy to tackle the COVID-19 pandemic and to spark discussion and thought. Here we use simple stochastic simulations to evaluate different approaches taken to tackle the crisis, along with the efficiency they will hold and the number of casualties they may incur. It is clear that the less strict the social distancing the more time it will take for life to return to normal, and the more lives will be at risk. This is shown through simulations formed by an open sourced code, which allows evaluation of the outcomes from different intervention scenarios or conditions.","OBJECTIVE: The current study was intended to evaluate the knowledge and awareness toward Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) of pilgrims from Saudi Arabia and from different Arabian countries. METHODS: A prospective study was conducted among pilgrims from Saudi Arabia and those from other Arab nations. A total number of 2120 participants including 736 Saudi pilgrims (436 males and 300 females) and 1384 non-Saudi Arabian pilgrims (1384; 909 males and 475 females) were included in the study. The responses of the participants were descriptively analyzed. Pearson correlation coefficient was used to screen the possible correlations among different variables. The differences in the responses between the two groups were evaluated using Mann\u2013Whitney analysis. RESULTS: The responses of the Saudi pilgrims showed statistically significant results in comparison to non-Saudi pilgrims in answering all questions except those related to the presence of efficient vaccination or trea...","To understand the severity of infection for a given disease, it is common epidemiological practice to estimate the case fatality risk, defined as the risk of death among cases. However, there are three technical obstacles that should be addressed to appropriately measure this risk. First, division of the cumulative number of deaths by that of cases tends to underestimate the actual risk because deaths that will occur have not yet observed, and so the delay in time from illness onset to death must be addressed. Second, the observed dataset of reported cases represents only a proportion of all infected individuals and there can be a substantial number of asymptomatic and mildly infected individuals who are never diagnosed. Third, ascertainment bias and risk of death among all those infected would be smaller when estimated using shorter virus detection windows and less sensitive diagnostic laboratory tests. In the ongoing COVID-19 epidemic, health authorities must cope with the uncertaint...","The increasing burden of emerging infectious diseases worldwide confronts us with numerous challenges, including the imperative to design research and responses that are commensurate to understanding the complex social and ecological contexts in which infectious diseases occur. A diverse group of scientists met in Hawaii in March 2005 to discuss the linked social and ecological contexts in which infectious diseases emerge. A subset of the meeting was a group that focused on \u201ctransdisciplinary approaches\u201d to integrating knowledge across and beyond academic disciplines in order to improve prevention and control of emerging infections. This article is based on the discussions of that group. Here, we outline the epidemiological legacy that has dominated infectious disease research and control up until now, and introduce the role of new, transdisciplinary and systems-based approaches to emerging infectious diseases. We describe four cases of transboundary health issues and use them to discu...","SARS coronavirus encodes non-structural protein 13 (nsP13), a nucleic acid helicase/NTPase belonging to superfamily 1 helicase, which efficiently unwinds both partial-duplex RNA and DNA. In this study, unwinding of DNA substrates that had different duplex lengths and 5\u2032-overhangs was examined under single-turnover reaction conditions in the presence of excess enzyme. The amount of DNA unwound decreased significantly as the length of the duplex increased, indicating a poor in vitro processivity. However, the quantity of duplex DNA unwound increased as the length of the single-stranded 5\u2032-tail increased for the 50-bp duplex. This enhanced processivity was also observed for duplex DNA that had a longer single-stranded gap in between. These results demonstrate that nsP13 requires the presence of a long 5\u2032-overhang to unwind longer DNA duplexes. In addition, enhanced DNA unwinding was observed for gapped DNA substrates that had a 5\u2032-overhang, indicating that the translocated nsP13 molecules...","Abstract Background: A novel coronavirus was recently identified as the aetiological agent of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). Molecular assays currently available for detection of SARS-coronavirus (SARS-Cov) have low sensitivity during the early stage of the illness. Objective: To develop and evaluate a sensitive diagnostic test for SARS by optimizing the viral RNA extraction methods and by applying real-time quantitative RT-PCR technology. Study design: 50 nasopharyngeal aspirate (NPA) samples collected from days 1\u20133 of disease onset from SARS patients in whom SARS CoV infections was subsequently serologically confirmed and 30 negative control samples were studied. Samples were tested by: (1) our first generation conventional RT-PCR assay with a routine RNA extraction method (Lancet 361 (2003) 1319), (2) our first generation conventional RT-PCR assay with a modified RNA extraction method, (3) a real-time quantitative RT-PCR assay with a modified RNA extraction method. Result...","Abstract Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus (MERS-CoV) was originally identified in Saudi Arabia in 2012. It has caused MERS outbreaks with high mortality in the Middle East and Europe, raising a serious concern about its pandemic potential. Therefore, development of effective vaccines is crucial for preventing its further spread and future pandemic. Our previous study has shown that subcutaneous (s.c.) vaccination of a recombinant protein containing receptor-binding domain (RBD) of MERS-CoV S fused with Fc of human IgG (RBD-Fc) induced strong systemic neutralizing antibody responses in vaccinated mice. Here, we compared local and systemic immune responses induced by RBD-Fc via intranasal (i.n.) and s.c. immunization pathways. We found that i.n. vaccination of MERS-CoV RBD-Fc induced systemic humoral immune responses comparable to those induced by s.c. vaccination, including neutralizing antibodies, but more robust systemic cellular immune responses and significantly h...","Any plan for stopping the ongoing 2019-nCov epidemic must be based on a quantitative understanding of the proportion of the at-risk population that needs to be protected by effective control measures in order for transmission to decline sufficiently and quickly enough for the epidemic to end. Using an SEIR-type transmission model, we contrasted two alternate strategies by modeling the proportion of the population that needs to be protected from infection by one-time vaccination (assuming 100% effectiveness) or by testing with isolation and treatment of individuals within six, 24, or 48 hours of symptom onset. If R is currently 2.2, vaccination at the herd immunity coverage of 55% would drive R just below 1, but transmission could persist for years. Over 80% of coverage is required to end the epidemic in 6 months with population-wide vaccination. The epidemic could be ended in just under a year if testing with isolation and treatment reached 80% of symptomatically infected patients with...","The 2009 influenza A (H1N1) pandemic highlighted the importance of quality hospital care of the severely ill, yet there is evidence that the impact of the 2009 pandemic was highest in low\u2010 and middle\u2010income countries with fewer resources. Recent data indicate that death and suffering from seasonal influenza and severe illness in general are increased in resource\u2010limited settings. However, there are limited clinical data and guidelines for the management of influenza and other severe illness in these settings. Life\u2010saving supportive care through syndromic case management is used successfully in high\u2010resource intensive care units and in global programs such as the Integrated Management of Childhood Illness (IMCI). While there are a variety of challenges to the management of the severely ill in resource\u2010limited settings, several new international initiatives have begun to develop syndromic management strategies for these environments, including the World Health Organization's Integrated M...","We conducted a comparative study of COVID-19 epidemic in three different settings: mainland China, the Guangdong province of China and South Korea, by formulating two disease transmission dynamics models incorporating epidemic characteristics and setting-specific interventions, and fitting the models to multi-source data to identify initial and effective reproduction numbers and evaluate effectiveness of interventions. We estimated the initial basic reproduction number for South Korea, the Guangdong province and mainland China as 2.6 (95% confidence interval (CI): (2.5, 2.7)), 3.0 (95%CI: (2.6, 3.3)) and 3.8 (95%CI: (3.5,4.2)), respectively, given a serial interval with mean of 5 days with standard deviation of 3 days. We found that the effective reproduction number for the Guangdong province and mainland China has fallen below the threshold 1 since February 8th and 18th respectively, while the effective reproduction number for South Korea remains high, suggesting that the intervention...","Abstract Concept of \u201crisk analysis\u201d in food safety management needs to be understood to assess, manage, and communicate risks for proper implementation of food safety policies, food laws, and standards, in a country. Science-based approaches, which are an integral part of risk analysis to improve modern food safety systems, are intimately linked to processes such as good quality practices. Risk analysis strengthens the ability of traditional food safety systems to meet current challenges. Risk analysis is just one part of an effective food safety system. Other components of food safety system like food safety policies, food legislation, food inspection, laboratory analysis, epidemiological surveillance of food-borne diseases, monitoring systems for chemical and microbiological contamination in foods, and information, education and communication, also need to be improved continuously. \u201cFood safety controls\u201d are now being replaced by \u201crisk-based controls\u201d in all stages of food production...","Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is caused by a novel coronavirus (CoV), SARS-CoV. In previous studies, we showed that a SARS-CoV spike (S) glycoprotein-based modified vaccinia Ankara (MVA-S) vaccine could induce strong neutralizing antibody (Nab) response which might have played a critical role in protecting Chinese rhesus monkeys from the pathogenic viral challenge. To date, however, it remains unknown what the minimal level of Nab is required to achieve sterile immunity in humans. It is therefore important to explore techniques to maximize the level of Nab response in vivo. Here, we evaluate various vaccination regimens using combinations of DNA-S, MVA-S, and adenovirus type 5 (Ad5-S) vaccines. We show that in vaccinated mice and rabbits, a heterologous MVA-S prime with Ad5-S boost regimen induces the highest and most persistent level of Nab response when compared with other combinations. Interestingly, the initial level of Nab after prime does not necessarily predict the ma...","Abstract Introduction Breast radiotherapy accounts for a significant proportion of patient volume in contemporary radiation oncology practice. In the setting of anticipated resource constraints and widespread community infection with SARS-CoV-2 during the COVID-19 pandemic, measures for balancing both infectious and oncologic risk among patients and providers must be carefully considered. Here, we present evidence-based guidelines for omitting or abbreviating breast cancer radiotherapy, where appropriate, in an effort to mitigate risk to patients and optimize resource utilization. Methods Multidisciplinary breast cancer experts at a high-volume comprehensive cancer center convened contingency planning meetings over the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic to review the relevant literature and establish recommendations for the application of hypofractionated and abbreviated breast radiation regimens. Results Substantial evidence exists to support omitting radiation among certain favorabl...","Background: We evaluated how non-pharmaceutical interventions could be used to control the COVID-19 pandemic and reduce the burden on the healthcare system. Methods: Using an age-structured compartmental model of COVID-19 transmission in the population of Ontario, Canada, we compared a base case with limited testing, isolation, and quarantine to scenarios with: enhanced case finding; restrictive social distancing measures; or a combination of enhanced case finding and less restrictive social distancing. Interventions were either implemented for fixed durations or dynamically cycled on and off, based on projected ICU bed occupancy. We present median and credible intervals (CrI) from 100 replicates per scenario using a two-year time horizon. Results: We estimated that 56% (95% CrI: 42-63%) of the Ontario population would be infected over the course of the epidemic in the base case. At the epidemic peak, we projected 107,000 (95% CrI: 60,760-149,000) cases in hospital and 55,500 (95% CrI:...","Abstract The induction of antigen specific memory CD8+ T cells in vivo is very important to new vaccines against infectious diseases. In the present study, we aimed to evaluate the immune responses of peptide-specific CD8+ T cells induced by HLA-A*0201 restricted severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) S epitopes plus CpG oligodeoxynucleotide (CpG ODN), PolyI:C and R848 as adjuvants. Furthermore, the generation, distribution and phenotype of long-lasting peptide-specific memory CD8+ T cells were assessed by ELISA, ELISPOT and flow cytometry. Our results showed that antigen specific CD8+ T cells were elicited by HLA-A*0201 restricted SARS-CoV S epitopes. Furthermore, the frequency of peptide-specific CD8+ T cells was dramatically increased after both prime and boost immunization with peptides plus CpG ODN, whereas slight enhancements were induced following boost vaccination with peptides plus PolyI:C or R848. SARS-CoV S peptide-specific IFN-\u03b3+CD8+ T cells wer...","ABSTRACTCOVID-19 has caused a major epidemic worldwide, however, much is yet to be known about the epidemiology and evolution of the virus. One reason is that the challenges underneath sequencing HCoV-19 directly from clinical samples have not been completely tackled. Here we illustrate the application of amplicon and hybrid capture (capture)-based sequencing, as well as ultra-high-throughput metatranscriptomic (meta) sequencing in retrieving complete genomes, inter-individual and intra-individual variations of HCoV-19 from clinical samples covering a range of sample types and viral load. We also examine and compare the bias, sensitivity, accuracy, and other characteristics of these approaches in a comprehensive manner. This is, to date, the first work systematically implements amplicon and capture approaches in sequencing HCoV-19, as well as the first comparative study across methods. Our work offers practical solutions for genome sequencing and analyses of HCoV-19 and other emerging ...","R\u00e9sum\u00e9 Plusieurs pathologies autrefois mortelles au sein des \u00e9levages porcins ont disparu de notre territoire, mais de nombreuses maladies polysyst\u00e9miques subsistent. Si l\u2019antibioth\u00e9rapie s\u2019av\u00e8re parfois efficace, la vaccination permet de pr\u00e9venir un certain nombre de pathologies alors qu\u2019il n\u2019existe aucun traitement pr\u00e9ventif ni curatif pour d\u2019autres. Par ailleurs, tous les organes du porc sont susceptibles d\u2019\u00eatre la cible d\u2019agents pathog\u00e8nes. L\u00e0 encore, des vaccins et des traitements antibiotiques sont disponibles. Summary Several pathologies which were once mortal within pig farms have disappeared from our territory, numerous polysystemic diseases remain. If antibiotherapy is sometimes effective, vaccination can prevent a certain number of pathologies while there is no preventive of curative treatment for others. Moreover, all the pig's organs are susceptible to being targeted by pathogenic agents. Here again, vaccines and antibiotic treatments are available.","The emergence of new pathogens, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and Ebola virus, poses serious challenges to global public health and highlights the urgent need for novel antiviral approaches. Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) have been successfully used to treat various diseases, particularly cancer and immunological disorders. Antigen-specific mAbs have been isolated using several different approaches, including hybridoma, transgenic mice, phage display, yeast display, and single B-cell isolation. Consequently, an increasing number of mAbs, which exhibit high potency against emerging viruses in vitro and in animal models of infection, have been developed. In this paper, we summarize historical trends and recent developments in mAb discovery, compare the advantages and disadvantages of various approaches to mAb production, and discuss the potential use of such strategies for the development of antivi...","BACKGROUND: Rapid triaging, as in the current COVID-19 pandemic, focuses on age and pre-existing medical conditions. In contrast, preoperative assessments use cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) to categorise patients to higher and lower risk independent of diagnostic labels. Since CPET is not feasible in population-based settings, our aims included evaluation of a triage/screening tool for cardiorespiratory risk. METHODS: CPET-derived anaerobic thresholds were evaluated retrospectively in 26 patients with pulmonary arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) who represent a challenging group to risk-categorise. Pulmonary AVM-induced hypoxaemia secondary to intrapulmonary right-to-left shunts, anaemia from underlying hereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasia and metabolic equivalents derived from the 13-point Veterans Specific Activity Questionnaire (VSAQ) were evaluated as part of routine clinical care. Pre-planned analyses evaluated associations and modelling of the anaerobic threshold and p...","Abstract This chapter reviews the main viral pathogens of the respiratory tract, the immune responses they induce, currently available vaccines, and vaccines that are in development to control them. The main viruses responsible for acute respiratory infection in people include respiratory syncytial, influenza, human parainfluenza, human metapneumo-, human rhino-, corona-, and adenoviruses. Licensed vaccines are available only for influenza virus, with vaccines against the other pathogens either in clinical trials or in preclinical stages of development. The majority of studies evaluating respiratory virus vaccines measure serum antibody responses, because, although both cellular and humoral responses contribute to the clearance of a primary infection, neutralizing antibodies are known to protect against secondary infection. Humoral responses can be readily detected after vaccination with inactivated or subunit vaccines; however, fewer individuals seroconvert after vaccination with live...","Background: China has experienced an outbreak of a novel human coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) since December 2019, and it was announced a worldwide pandemic in March 2020. There is limited evidence on the mortality risk effect of pre-existing comorbidity for clinical disease (coronavirus disease 2019 [COVID-19]), which has important implications for early treatment. Objective: To evaluate the risk of the common preexisting comorbidities, including hypertension, coronary heart diseases (CHD), respiratory diseases and diabetes on COVID-19 mortality, and provide clinical suggestions accordingly. Method: This study used a nested case-control design to assess the impact of pre-existing comorbidities on the hazard of COVID-19 in mainland China. A total of 321 publicly reported confirmed cases (146 cases and 175 controls) with trackable time-to-death information and history of comorbidities were collected between December 18th, 2019 and March 8th, 20...","Background: Community responses are important for outbreak management during the early phase when non-pharmaceutical interventions are the major preventive options. Therefore, this study aims to examine the psychological and behavioral responses of the community during the early phase of the COVID-19 epidemic in Hong Kong. Method: A cross-sectional online survey was launched within 36 hours after confirmed COVID-19 cases were first reported. Councilors of all 452 district council constituency areas were approached for survey dissemination. Respondent demographics, anxiety level, risk perception, sources to retrieve COVID-19 information, actual adoption and perceived efficacy of precautionary measures were collected. Result: Analysis from 1715 complete responses indicated high perceived susceptibility (89%) and high perceived severity (97%). Most respondents were worried about COVID-19 (97%), and had their daily routines disrupted (slightly/greatly: 98%). The anxiety level, measured by ...","Abstract Extracellular superoxide dismutase (EcSOD) is the only extracellular scavenger of superoxide anion (O2 .-) with unique binding capacity to cell surface and extracellular matrix through its heparin-binding domain. Enhanced EcSOD activity prevents oxidative stress and damage, which are fundamental in a variety of disease pathologies. In this review we will discuss the findings in humans and animal studies supporting the benefits of EcSOD induced by exercise training in reducing oxidative stress in various tissues. In particularly, we will highlight the importance of skeletal muscle EcSOD, which is induced by endurance exercise and redistributed through the circulation to the peripheral tissues, as a molecular transducer of exercise training to confer protection against oxidative stress and damage in various disease conditions.","The Brighton Collaboration Viral Vector Vaccines Safety Working Group (V3SWG) was formed to evaluate the safety and characteristics of live, recombinant viral vector vaccines. A recent publication by the V3SWG described live, attenuated, recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (rVSV) as a chimeric virus vaccine for HIV-1 (Clarke et al., 2016). The rVSV vector system is being explored as a platform for development of multiple vaccines. This paper reviews the molecular and biological features of the rVSV vector system, followed by a template with details on the safety and characteristics of a rVSV vaccine against Zaire ebolavirus (ZEBOV). The rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine is a live, replication competent vector in which the VSV glycoprotein (G) gene is replaced with the glycoprotein (GP) gene of ZEBOV. Multiple copies of GP are expressed and assembled into the viral envelope responsible for inducing protective immunity. The vaccine (designated V920) was originally constructed by the National Microbi...","Recent outbreaks of infectious pathogens such as Zika, Ebola, and COVID-19 have underscored the need for the dependable availability of vaccines against emerging infectious diseases (EIDs). The cost and risk of R&amp;D programs and uniquely unpredictable demand for EID vaccines have discouraged vaccine developers, and government and nonprofit agencies have been unable to provide timely or sufficient incentives for their development and sustained supply. We analyze the economic returns of a portfolio of EID vaccine assets, and find that under realistic financing assumptions, the expected returns are significantly negative, implying that the private sector is unlikely to address this need without public-sector intervention. We have sized the financing deficit for this portfolio and propose several potential solutions, including price increases, enhanced public-private partnerships, and subscription models through which individuals would pay annual fees to obtain access to a portfolio of vacc...","","Abstract Structure-based design, synthesis, and biological evaluation of a series of peptidomimetic severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus chymotrypsin-like protease inhibitors are described. These inhibitors were designed and synthesized based upon our X-ray crystal structure of inhibitor 1 bound to SARS-CoV 3CLpro. Incorporation of Boc-Ser as the P4-ligand resulted in enhanced SARS-CoV 3CLpro inhibitory activity. Structural analysis of the inhibitor-bound X-ray structure revealed high binding affinity toward the enzyme.","Outbreaks of infection can be devastating for individuals and societies. In this review, we examine the applications of new high-throughput sequencing approaches to the identification and characterization of outbreaks, focusing on the application of whole-genome sequencing (WGS) to outbreaks of bacterial infection. We describe traditional epidemiological analysis and show how WGS can be informative at multiple steps in outbreak investigation, as evidenced by many recent studies. We conclude that high-throughput sequencing approaches can make a significant contribution to the investigation of outbreaks of bacterial infection and that the integration of WGS with epidemiological investigation, diagnostic assays and antimicrobial susceptibility testing will precipitate radical changes in clinical microbiology and infectious disease epidemiology in the near future. However, several challenges remain before WGS can be routinely used in outbreak investigation and clinical practice.","Overview Feline coronavirus infection is ubiquitous in domestic cats, and is particularly common where conditions are crowded. While most FCoV-infected cats are healthy or display only a mild enteritis, some go on to develop feline infectious peritonitis, a disease that is especially common in young cats and multi-cat environments. Up to 12% of FCoV-infected cats may succumb to FIP, with stress predisposing to the development of disease. Disease signs The \u2018wet\u2019 or effusive form, characterised by polyserositis (abdominal and/or thoracic effusion) and vasculitis, and the \u2018dry\u2019 or non-effusive form (pyogranulomatous lesions in organs) reflect clinical extremes of a continuum. The clinical picture of FIP is highly variable, depending on the distribution of the vasculitis and pyogranulomatous lesions. Fever refractory to antibiotics, lethargy, anorexia and weight loss are common non-specific signs. Ascites is the most obvious manifestation of the effusive form. Diagnosis The aetiological di...","Most pathogens initiate their infections at the human mucosal surface. Therefore, mucosal vaccination, especially through oral or intranasal administration routes, is highly desired for infectious diseases. Meanwhile, protein-based antigens provide a safer alternative to the whole pathogen or DNA based ones in vaccine development. However, the unique biopharmaceutical hurdles that intranasally or orally delivered protein vaccines need to overcome before they reach the sites of targeting, the relatively low immunogenicity, as well as the low stability of the protein antigens, require thoughtful and fine-tuned mucosal vaccine formulations, including the selection of immunostimulants, the identification of the suitable vaccine delivery system, and the determination of the exact composition and manufacturing conditions. This review aims to provide an up-to-date survey of the protein antigen-based vaccine formulation development, including the usage of immunostimulants and the optimization ...","The paper evaluates total inclusive costs of three public health approaches to address the COVID-19 epidemic in the US based on epidemiological projections in Ferguson et al (2020). We calculate and add costs of lost productivity and costs of mortality measured through the value of statistical life. We find that the aggressive approach which involves strict suppression measures and a drastic reduction of economic activity for three months with extensive testing and case tracking afterwards results in the lowest total costs for the society. The approach of doing no non-pharmaceutical measures results in the lowest total costs if the infection fatality rate falls below 0.15%.","Summary Background The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic has spread from China to 25 countries. Local cycles of transmission have already occurred in 12 countries after case importation. In Africa, Egypt has so far confirmed one case. The management and control of COVID-19 importations heavily rely on a country's health capacity. Here we evaluate the preparedness and vulnerability of African countries against their risk of importation of COVID-19. Methods We used data on the volume of air travel departing from airports in the infected provinces in China and directed to Africa to estimate the risk of importation per country. We determined the country's capacity to detect and respond to cases with two indicators: preparedness, using the WHO International Health Regulations Monitoring and Evaluation Framework; and vulnerability, using the Infectious Disease Vulnerability Index. Countries were clustered according to the Chinese regions contributing most to their risk. Find...","The novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) epidemic has spread to 23 countries from China. Local cycles of transmission already occurred in 7 countries following case importation. No African country has reported cases yet. The management and control of 2019-nCoV introductions heavily relies on the public health capacity of a country. Here we evaluate the preparedness and vulnerability of African countries against their risk of importation of 2019-nCoV. We used data on air travel volumes departing from airports in the infected provinces in China and directed to Africa to estimate the risk of introduction per country. We determined the countries capacity to detect and respond to cases with two indicators: preparedness, using the WHO International Health Regulation Monitoring and Evaluation Framework; and vulnerability, with the Infectious Disease Vulnerability Index. Countries were clustered according to the Chinese regions contributing the most to their risk. Findings: Countries at the highest i...","BACKGROUND: Public health risks associated to infection by human coronaviruses remain considerable and vaccination is a key option for preventing the resurgence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV). We have previously reported that antibodies elicited by a SARS-CoV vaccine candidate based on recombinant, full-length SARS-CoV Spike-protein trimers, trigger infection of immune cell lines. These observations prompted us to investigate the molecular mechanisms and responses to antibody-mediated infection in human macrophages. METHODS: We have used primary human immune cells to evaluate their susceptibility to infection by SARS-CoV in the presence of anti-Spike antibodies. Fluorescence microscopy and real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) were utilized to assess occurrence and consequences of infection. To gain insight into the underlying molecular mechanism, we performed mutational analysis with a series of truncated and chime...","Abstract The development of strategies to augment the immunogenicity of DNA vaccines is critical for improving their clinical utility. One such strategy involves using the different immune routes with DNA vaccines. In the present study, the immunogenicity of SARS-CoV nucleocapsid DNA vaccine, induced by using the current routine vaccination routes (intramuscularly, by electroporation, or orally using live-attenuated Salmonella typhimurium), was compared in mouse model. The comparison between the three vaccination routes indicated that immunization intramuscularly induced a moderate T cell response and antibody response. Mice administrated by electroporation induced the highest antibody response among the three immunization groups and a mid-level of cellular response. In contrast, the orally DNA vaccine evoked vigorous T cell response and a weak antibody production. These results indicated that the distinct types of immune responses were generated by the different routes of DNA immuniza...","R\u00e9sum\u00e9 Aujourd\u2019hui, nous disposons de donn\u00e9es suffisantes qui confortent l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat d\u2019utiliser des bact\u00e9ries lactiques (BL), notamment des souches des lactocoques et lactobacilles, pour le d\u00e9veloppement de nouvelles strat\u00e9gies de vaccination mucosale.

The EnerPol platform has been used in a broad range of case studies in different sectors in all of Europe, USA, Japan, South Korea and sub Saharan Africa over the last 10 years. In the present study, the entire Swiss population (8.57 million people), including cross-border commuters, and the entire Swiss public and private transport network that is simulated to assess transmission of the COVID-19 virus. The individual contacts within the population, and possible transmission pathways, are established from a simulation of daily activities that are calibrated with micro-census data. Various governmental interventions with regards to closures and social distancing are also implemented. The epidemiology of the COVID-19 virus is based on publicly available statistical data and adapted to Swiss demographics...","Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is characterized by substantial acute pulmonary inflammation with a high mortality rate. Despite the identification of SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) as the etiologic agent of SARS, a thorough understanding of the underlying disease pathogenesis has been hampered by the lack of a suitable animal model that recapitulates the human disease. Intranasal (i.n.) infection of A/J mice with the CoV mouse hepatitis virus strain 1 (MHV-1) induces an acute respiratory disease with a high lethality rate that shares several pathological similarities with SARS-CoV infection in humans. In this study, we examined virus replication and the character of pulmonary inflammation induced by MHV-1 infection in susceptible (A/J, C3H/HeJ, and BALB/c) and resistant (C57BL/6) strains of mice. Virus replication and distribution did not correlate with the relative susceptibilities of A/J, BALB/c, C3H/HeJ, and C57BL/6 mice.

We clearly showed that the administration of the N DNA vaccine candidate via different immunization routes could induce a qualitatively different immune response profile (Hu et al. 2009). Here, we have shown that intramuscularly vaccination with SARS-CoV N DNA can elicit SARS-CoV N-specific humoral and cellular immune responses, and these responses could be significantly enhanced by co-administrating an IL-2-expressing vector. Thus, the ability of the DNA immune strategy to enhance cellular and humoral immune responses has been confirmed in two distinct systems.","Objectives: Determine antibody responses against vacunal strains; identify antibody protector levels against each one of the strains; detection of seroconvertion protection level in the study population and identify differences of the response in the different high-risk groups. Methods: To evaluate the humoral immune response by Influenza vaccination in high-risk groups, we conducted a prospective longitudinal descriptive study. Haemagglutination inhibition test was used to determine antibody levels against the three strains included in the vaccine. Results and conclusions: The studied population had antibodies before vaccination against all the strains at the vaccine, which is because of the circulation of similar strains in the season and is in concordance with international reports. Prevaccination GMTs agree with those results. We detected a high percent of protection against the three strains as a response to vaccination; GMTs increased to values higher than 40. The three groups included in the study (asthmatic, diabetic and hypersthenes) had a good response to vaccination and diabetics are better responders than the other two groups, with 100% of protection against two strains of the vaccine (AH3N2 and B). Objectives: Cirrhosis is a major chronic disease in many Asian countries. An estimate of the prevalence of cirrhosis cases in Korea is around 460,000 cases and constitutes 15% among 6 major chronic diseases in Korea. Though WHO does not include cirrhotic patients among influenza vaccine-target groups, they have been considered as one of the priority groups in Korea. However, available data on the impact of influenza in liver cirrhosis is extremely limited up to now. Therefore, we decided to evaluate the efficacy of influenza vaccine in chronic liver disease, and intended to study the clinical outcomes of influenza in patients with liver cirrhosis.","Better knowledge of States' operational modes in dealing with risk makes it possible to better understand their interventions and to better adapt the scientific response. The notion of risk has, little by little, become political, and the State uses risk to govern. Risk management is therefore at the very heart of the State. Recent public health crises have led to risk's taking on a new form, that of the unknown, by the fact of the unpredictability of its appearance and evolution. An interaction between scientific and political approaches to risk is absolutely necessary, in order to better evaluate at-risk situations according to modern methods such as structured decisionmaking, and to better handle risk-management tools. The changing nature of risks calls for the emergence of a new form of governance, which puts the individual back into the center of the State's action, as well as the confronting of arguments with expert committees. Civil society's participation in risk management should be developed, and observation should once again play its part in crisis response. Younger generations might also take greater part in responding to current crises.","The basic reproduction number is the average number of secondary infections due to an infective during the infectious period when everyone else in the population is susceptible [22] . It can depict the transmission risk in the early phase of disease transmission. With the spreading of the COVID-19, increasingly intensive intervention measures have been implemented and people gradually enhanced self-protection. In order to quantity the daily reproduction number and evaluate the transmission risk changing over time, inspired by Tang et al. [13] , the initial contact rate c 0 in the formula of R c is replaced by the aforementioned time-dependent contact rate c(t) to reflect the changes of intervention measures and people's behaviors. Thereby, we define","Interim results from the Ebola \u00e7a suffit phase III trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of rVSV-ZEBOV in an unblinded, cluster-randomized trial in Guinea are encouraging and consistent with vaccine efficacy. The trial utilized a ring vaccination design in which individuals at high risk of infection (contacts and contacts-of-contacts of a lab confirmed case of EVD) were randomized as a cluster to receive either immediate vaccination with rVSV-ZEBOV or delayed vaccination 21 days later. There were no cases of EVD with symptom onset &gt;10 days following randomization in the group receiving immediate vaccination (48 clusters with 2014 subjects) whereas the authors reported 16 cases of EVD in subjects randomized to delayed vaccination (42 clusters with 2380 subjects). 28 The pathway to licensure of new vaccines requires evidence of vaccine safety and efficacy in clinical trials. For infectious pathogens that emerge sporadically and with low incidence, such as Ebola, the ability to perform randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded efficacy trials remains a limiting factor. The hard fought decline in EVD cases in West Africa is welcome and will hopefully lead to complete control of the epidemic without rebound or reemergence. However, the decline will likely preclude efforts to evaluate vaccine efficacy of other vaccine candidates during this outbreak. For the cAd3-EBO vaccine, it remains unknown if a path to licensure is feasible in the absence of human efficacy data. Regulators will need to consider if supportive evidence from preclinical NHP challenge models, safety data in on-going human trials, and use of alternative surrogate immunogenicity endpoints is adequate to move forward with licensing.","When comparing WiDNdisorder to other methods, it is important to bear in mind that WiDNdisorder was designed to make quick and robust predictions. As a result, it is comprised of 2 DNs and does not use additional sequence-derived evolutionary information (e.g., position-specific scoring matrix, anchored multiple sequence alignment). Both DISOPRED3 and DNdisorder make use of this extra information, and both methods also make use of several predictors (i.e., DNdisorder is a boosted ensemble of 175 DNs and DISOPRED3 is comprised of three complementary methods). This leads to better performance, but the prediction times are much longer, and it would be difficult to apply these approaches at the genomic scale. Still, WiDNdisorder compares well with both DISOPRED3 and DNdisorder in terms of balanced accuracy and Sw on both the CASP10 and DO1111_TEST datasets. In terms of AUC, WiDNdisorder lagged behind DISOPRED3 and PrDOS-CNF (i.e., one of the best methods from CASP10). When considering other approaches, which are not consensus methods nor use evolutionary information, such as ESpritz, WiDNdisorder is quite competitive and outpaced ESpritz on the DO1111_TEST dataset. It is possible that this performance could be further enhanced by combining it with additional deep networks or other fast approaches to create a small ensemble or consensus predictors.","Due to the new technologies available for surveillance, assay development, vaccine design, animal modeling, and manufacturing, the scientific aspects of vaccine development are not limiting our ability to prepare for emerging viral diseases. The major factors that need to be addressed include (1) the political will to provide the resources necessary to conduct the epidemiology and laboratory work needed to support vaccine development, (2) new business models to create an infrastructure for advanced vaccine development that does not require profit motive, and (3) creative regulatory processes and clinical trial designs to evaluate products for efficacy during outbreaks that are by nature sporadic and causing social chaos. Importantly, achieving solid efficacy data that can support licensure is critical so products can be more readily available during future epidemics. Novel approaches to vaccine design may significantly shorten vaccine development timelines and increase the frequency of success. New technologies that have rapidly evolved over the last 5-10 years make atomic level antigen design feasible and provide mechanisms for rapid, iterative improvements in antigenicity and immunogenicity of candidate vaccines. In particular, high throughput sequencing provides a starting point for vaccine antigens and helps to define the extent of genetic variability. Relatively inexpensive gene synthesis, the ease of isolating and characterizing human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against target antigens, the ability to define structures of vaccine antigens in complex with mAbs with desirable functional properties, and the development of assays that evaluate immunogenicity of vaccines in animal models, provide the foundation for rapid development of highly characterized candidate vaccines and their advancement into clinical evaluation. The figure illustrates the steps taken in the case of MERS CoV to rapidly develop the tools needed to generate candidate vaccines. Advanced knowledge of effective vaccine approaches for a particular virus family together with these modern development and design approaches may significantly shorten the time needed to prepare vaccines for field testing in the setting of a new pandemic threat.","Ebola is a highly virulent pathogen from the family Filoviridae. Ebolavirus is an enveloped, negative-strand RNA virus whose genome encodes 7 structural proteins including a transmembrane glycoprotein that mediates viral entry into host cells. 4 The surface glycoprotein (GP) mediates viral attachment and entry and is the primary antigenic target for vaccine development. Five species of Ebola have been identified including Zaire (the cause of the 2014 West African epidemic), Sudan, Bundibugyo, Tai Forest, and Reston. Ebola virus disease (EVD) was first recognized in two distinct outbreaks in the Ebola River Valley of the Democratic Republic of Congo (formerly Zaire) and in Sudan in 1976. 5, 6 EVD emerged again in 1994 in Gabon and in 1995 in an outbreak involving 315 people in Kikwit, Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). Since then, sporadic outbreaks have occurred in equatorial Africa, especially the DRC, Republic of Congo, Gabon, Uganda, and Sudan with fatality rates averaging over 50%. 7, 8 After an incubation period of 2-21 days, onset of EVD is manifested by fevers, chills, malaise, and myalgias with onset of gastrointestinal symptoms including nausea, vomiting and diarrhea by days 3-5. 8, 9 When fatal, death typically occurs by days 7-12 and can be characterized by hypovolemic shock and multiorgan failure. 8, 9 The disease is transmitted human-to-human through direct contact with infected bodily fluids through mucosal surfaces and breaks in the skin. 8 In Mar. of 2014, Guinea's Ministry of Health was notified of a highly pathogenic, febrile illness circulating in Gueckedou and Macenta. An epidemiologic evaluation ensued and samples from hospitalized patients were sent to BSL4 labs in France and Germany. Ebola was confirmed by either polymerase chain reaction (PCR), electron microscopy, or from isolation in cell culture. 10 Viral RNA was extracted, sequenced, and compared to available Ebola sequences in GenBank enabling phylogenetic analysis. An Ebola strain was identified with 97% similarity to previously collected Ebola strains in the DRC and Gabon. In turn, the outbreak was traced to a single index case, a 2-year-old boy who died in Dec. 2013 in Gueckedou. The epidemic of EVD that followed has accounted for more cases than all prior EVD outbreaks combined. As of Jul. 2015, over 28,000 suspected and confirmed cases and more than 11,000 deaths have been reported with the majority of cases occurring in the West African countries of Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone. 11 The World Health Organization (WHO) declared the epidemic a public health emergency of international concern in Aug. of 2014. And as the outbreak emerged, the international community responded with an unprecedented effort to accelerate Ebola vaccine development. 12 Prior to 2014, the largest single Ebola outbreak was 425 infections leading to 224 deaths. 13 The Vaccine Research Center within the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases performed a series of phase I clinical trials between 2003 and 2009 to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of GP antigen constructs. These included a DNA vaccine encoding a transmembrane-deleted, secreted version of the glycoprotein, a recombinant human adenovirus serotype 5 (rAd5) vectored vaccine encoding the Ebola GP with one amino acid mutation, and subsequently a DNA vaccine encoding the full-length, wild-type (WT) GP. [14] [15] [16] These phase I studies showed the WT full-length GP was safe and well tolerated. In parallel, studies to define the immunological correlates of protection and optimal antigen delivery approaches were evaluated in nonhuman primates (NHP). In addition to the important role for antibodies targeting GP, it was found that CD8 T cellmediated immunity was found to be critical for vaccine efficacy in NHP. 17 It was also found that antivector immunity would diminish vaccine potency particularly for the induction of CD8 T cells. Because of the high seroprevalence of Ad5, rare serotype adenovirus vectors were explored including human rAd26 and rAd35 vectors, and chimpanzee-derived rAd vectors. 18 Chimpanzee adenovirus serotype 3 (abbreviated as ChAd3 or cAd3) encoding the wild-type glycoproteins from both the Ebola Zaire and Sudan species was ultimately chosen as the candidate vaccine vector because of its low seroprevalence and its similar potency and pattern of innate immune response induction to Ad5. This vector was originally produced by Okairos which is now owned by GlaxoSmithKline (GSK). Vector potency comparable to rAd5 was considered to be important for rapid induction of both antibody and CD8 T cells with a single dose. This would facilitate use of the cAd3-Ebola GP vaccine in an outbreak setting using a ring vaccination strategy to achieve rapid short term protection for those at highest risk of infection. Both Zaire and Sudan GP were included in the initial vaccine to protect against both Zaire and Sudan, the most common species responsible for EVD. This replication-defective vaccine, now called cAd3-EBO, provided 100% protection to nonhuman primates 5 weeks following vaccination in an otherwise lethal Ebola challenge model, and partial protection (50%) to lethal challenge 10 months following vaccination. The cAd3-EBO was also shown to effectively prime for a modified Vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA)-vectored vaccine boost encoding the same glycoprotein inserts, improving survival from lethal Ebola challenge to 100% at 10-months postboost. 19 The combination of cAd3-MVA prime-boost produces a much higher magnitude response and might provide more durable protection to health care workers, ambulance drivers, burial workers, and others with ongoing risk of Ebola exposure.","Vaccination against viral infections has saved millions of lives by protecting many individuals from diseases such as measles, rubella, mumps, and polio. However, there is a growing need not only to develop improved vaccines against such acute infections but also to generate therapeutic vaccines which can stimulate specific immune responses to persistent viruses such as the human immunodeficiency virus or the human hepatitis C virus (1, 2). Likewise, novel approaches for vaccination against tumors which counteract the immunosuppression associated with cancer are needed (3). There is compelling evidence that CD8+ cytotoxic T cells are crucial players in the protective immune response against viral infections and tumors (4). Novel vaccine approaches should thus be rigorously evaluated for their ability to maximally expand antigen-specific CD8+ T cells, to induce their optimal differentiation into effector CD8+ T cells, and to elicit long-lasting protective memory (4).","Vaccines. Vaccination could be used to prevent infection or to reduce disease severity, viral shedding and thereby transmission, thus helping to control MERS outbreaks. Several vaccination strategies were developed against SARS-CoV and tested in animals, such as an inactivated virus, a live-attenuated virus, viral vectors, subunit vaccines, recombinant proteins and DNA vaccines135,136. Similar approaches have been used for the development of experimental MERS-CoV vaccines137. To date, three MERS-CoV vaccines have been evaluated in non-human primates. In one study, rhesus macaques were primed with DNA encoding the spike protein, followed by boosts with spike DNA and with recombinant protein consisting of the spike subunit containing the receptor-binding domain, or primed and boosted once with the subunit protein. Both approaches reduced pathological changes in lung function in animals that were infected with MERS-CoV 19 weeks after the last vaccination138. Moreover, three vaccinations with a recombinantly expressed protein that contains the receptor-binding domain of the spike protein reduced viral loads and lung pathology in rhesus macaques that were infected 2 weeks after the last vaccination139. Three DNA vaccinations with a construct encoding the full-length spike sequence reduced viral loads and pathology in the lungs after challenge with MERS-CoV 5 weeks after the last vaccination140.","Our goal was to evaluate commonly used assessment criteria, and examine the potential role for a rapid 70 assessment tool that could distinguish lower risk individuals in an emergency setting, based on usual 71 cardiorespiratory status. The detailed study aims were to explore which variables may be associated 72 with cardiorespiratory risk defined by the anaerobic threshold in order to inform triage and develop 73 approaches to help guide pre-exposure [23] or pre-operative [1] [2] [3] [4] 10] ","Because of the economic importance of CoV infection to livestock and domestic animals, a variety of live-attenuated and killed CoV vaccines have been tested in animals. Vaccines have been developed against IBV, TGEV, CCoV, and FIPV. However, these vaccines do not seem to provide complete protection from wild-type virus infection. In some cases, the wild-type CoV rapidly evolves to escape neutralization by vaccine-induced antibodies. In studies of vaccinated chickens, a live-attenuated IBV vaccine has been shown to undergo RNA recombination with wild-type virus to generate vaccine escape mutants. Killed virus vaccines may also be problematic for some CoV infections. Vaccination of cats with a killed FIPV vaccine has been shown to exacerbate disease when cats are challenged with wild-type virus. Therefore, extensive studies will be required to carefully evaluate candidate vaccines for SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV. A variety of approaches are currently under investigation for developing CoV vaccines, including analysis of killed virus vaccines, live-attenuated virus vaccines, and viral vector vaccines (such as modified vaccine virus Ankara, canarypox, alphavirus, and adenovirus vectors). Studies have shown that removing the envelope (E) protein from either SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV is an effective approach for generating a live attenuated virus vaccine. In the absence of this structural protein, the virus replicates to lower titers in the lungs of mice, but still induces an immune response that is protective from challenge with wild type virus. The development of improved animal models for human coronaviruses will be essential for evaluating any candidate vaccines. Transgenic mice expressing human ACE-2 (for SARS-CoV) can be used as a model system for SARS, however the pathogenesis in ACE-2 expressing transgenic mice does not fully mimic the pathogenesis seen during SARS-CoV infection in humans. CoVs can be adapted for replication in small animal models. Passaging SARS-CoV in mice led to the generation of a mouse-adapted strain, SARS CoV-MA15, which induces a lethal respiratory tract infection of mice. CoV vaccine studies will benefit from an improved understanding of conserved viral epitopes that can be targeted for vaccine development.","Consequently, it may be useful to design an alternative assay protocol for the target and then rescreen the entire library or, less laboriously, only the initial hits with the alternative format. 13 Depending on the particular screening protocol used, it may be informative to test the compound set for interference with the assay readout. For instance, Jenkins and colleagues used a fluorescence-based HTS to identify angiogenin inhibitors. 13 The initial set of hits was re-plated with activated fluorescent substrate to evaluate the hits for interference with the fluorescent readout; strikingly, 73% of the hits were found to interfere. 13 Screening for chemical reactivity may also be productive. The ability of the same screening hit to inhibit diverse receptors, as described above, may be the first sign of reactivity. Time-dependent behavior may also suggest an irreversible reaction. More directly, some authors have found it useful to repeat the screening assay in the presence of dithiothreitol (DTT) to evaluate hits for thiol reactivity. 15, 30 Alternatively, mass spectrometry (MS) has been used to evaluate compounds for adduct formation. 15 Less glamorously but no less importantly, it is often useful to evaluate the purity of screening hits because the observed activity may be due to a contaminant. A variety of approaches are possible; most simply, a new solution of the compound can be prepared from fresh powder or with powder from a different lot. 15 Alternatively, the compound can be repurified and then reassayed. 15 For a more rigorous analysis, HPLC or MS can be employed to detect impurities. 12 ","CD4\u00fe T cells play a major role in the immunopathogenesis of vaccineenhanced RSV disease [34] . A marked increase in Th2-type cytokine expression (IL-5, IL-13, IL-10) and a reduction in IL-12 expression occurred in mice that were immunized with the formalin-inactivated vaccine, indicating a swing toward Th2 in the genesis of enhanced inflammation [35] . The presence of IL-5 correlated with an eosinophilic infiltration in the mouse lung. In contrast, priming with live RSV resulted in a Th1 pattern of cytokine production and prevented subsequent enhanced disease [36] . A recent study in mice suggests that immune complexes that fix complement also play a key role in the pathogenesis of enhanced disease; the augmented disease in mice is mediated by these immune complexes and abrogated in complement component C3 and B cell-deficient mice [37] . The bronchoconstriction component of the enhanced disease seems to be mediated by complement, whereas the enhanced pneumonia component of disease depends on Th2 effects.","To evaluate the performance of these approaches in comparison to Symptoma, we classified the combined COVID-19 and BMJ cases of Table 1 that have at least one COVID-19 symptom (n=394) with all four simple approaches. A case is classified as COVID-19 positive if the probability of COVID-19 is at least 5% higher than the probability for influenza, common cold or hay fever. As Symptoma weights COVID-19 against more than 20,000 diseases we use the definition as stated within the Methods.","Because HPIV-3 pathogenesis is probably largely caused by the inflammatory response to infection, the findings that specific alterations in HN protein correlate with enhanced pathology and that HN may play a role in eliciting inflammatory responses suggest that approaches to modulating the inflammatory response may ameliorate disease ( Fig. 2A) .","Paediatric influenza: severity and need for protection A. Linde (Solna, SE) Children are the engines of influenza epidemics in interpandemic years. They have no or limited immunity to circulating virus strains, and therefore the age-specific attack rate is highest among children. Twenty to twenty-five per cent of young children may contract the disease yearly. The main complication is otitis media, and 5-8 children per100 are prescribed antibiotics yearly indirectly due to influenza. The risk for hospitalisation is highest in children below 2 years of age, and has been estimated to be 103/105 person months. Main reasons for hospitalisation are suspected septicaemia, lower respiratory tract infection, asthma/bronchitis and febrile seizures. Influenza infection is normally self-limiting in children, but fatalities occur. Children with severe heart and/or lung disease or other severely debilitating disease belong to risk groups of severe influenza like adults. During the influenza season 2003-2004 more than 140 children were reported dead due to influenza in the US, and in Japan there has been several cases of lethal encphalopathia in influenza-infected children during recent years. Most of the dead children did not belong to any known risk group. Influenza may thus be a severe disease among children, and children below three years of age are most vulnerable. The ordinary influenza vaccine is more reactogenic in children that adults, and vaccination of children demands two doses. With a good strain match, vaccination has a protective efficacy of 70-90%, and it may reduce the incidence of otitis media with around 30%. In the US vaccination of children of 0.6 to 23 months has been recommended since 1993. The measure is regarded cost-effective, and it may also be diminish the spread of influenza to the elderly. Despite this, no European country recommends general influenza vaccination of children, and even the rate of vaccination of vulnerable children at risk of complicated disease is low. One reason may be an unproven fear that vaccination may prevent the development of basic immunity against influenza. Intranasal vaccination with live, cold-adapted virus has proven to induce similar heterolgous immunity to drifted influenza strains as wild-type infection in children, and a large study of the vaccine has recently been conducted in Europe. The outcome has not been published (Jan 2006), but if successful it may be an attractive option for prevention of the consequences of influenza in children.","The primary target populations for RSV vaccination are young infants and the elderly, because hospitalization rates are the highest in these age groups and 78% of RSV-related deaths occur in individuals over 65 years of age (Thompson et al., 2003) . There is a large body of evidence that protection against infection is conferred mainly by neutralizing antibodies (Collins and Melero, 2011) ; however, multiple doses of vaccine might be necessary in young infants, because of the immature immune system and the presence of maternal antibodies. In addition, protective immunity mounted during infection does not protect against subsequent reinfection. Reinfections are common and are independent of antigenic changes in the virus (Collins and Melero, 2011) . These factors present challenges to RSV vaccination and, as yet, vaccines have not been licensed. This section discusses clinical trial data from various approaches to RSV vaccination.","Although much has been learnt of the SARS in the two years since its discovery, aspects of the pathogenesis of the disease are still not fully understood. This is because there are no further human cases of SARS and because there is no animal model that accurately reflects the human disease (reviewed in [1]). Although the kinetics and protective role of the host antibody responses are better defined, the roles of the adaptive cell-mediated and the innate immune responses to SARS are still being unravelled. Empirical approaches to vaccine development are progressing rapidly but it remains important to better elucidate the mechanisms of disease pathogenesis so as to minimize the risk of being unpleasantly surprised by unintended consequences of vaccination.","Immunomodulators (i.e., corticosteroids, intravenous immunoglobulins, thymosin, and anti-TNF) were empirically used for the treatment of SARS during the initial epidemic. The correlation between viral load and clinical outcome suggests that suppression of viral replication by effective antiviral drugs should be the key to preventing morbidity and mortality. Numerous potential antiviral agents have been identified using different approaches. In vitro susceptibility test results demonstrate that IFN-alpha and IFNbeta have some potential activity. Ribavirin has good activity when tested in human Caco-2 cells despite its lack of activity in Vero cells. The viral proteases are important targets for the development of antiviral drugs. Protease inhibitors like nelfinavir, glycyrrhizin, chloroquine, and many others as well as many herbal formulations have been found to possess some antiviral activity against SARS-CoV in vitro. In addition, the use of nitric oxide (S-nitro-N-acetylpenicillamine) inhalation as an experimental form of rescue therapy for SARS appeared to have inhibitory activity against SARS-CoV. Screening of chemical libraries has identified several inhibitors of the viral protease and helicase. Identification of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as an obligatory cellular receptor for Table 2 Risk categories for the emergence of SARS Emergence of SARS-CoV-like viruses from wildlife or other animal reservoirs -Countries/areas identified as source(s) of the epidemic in 2002-03 in southern China or areas with an increased likelihood of animal-to-human transmission of SARS-CoV-like viruses from wildlife or other animal reservoirs. Emergence or introduction of SARS-CoV from laboratories or international travel -Countries/areas at potentially higher risk of SARS-CoV emergence or introduction due to the presence of laboratories in which SARS-CoV or SARS-CoVlike viruses are being studied or in which clinical specimens infected with SARS-CoV are being processed or stored. OR -Countries/areas with entry of large numbers of persons from areas in which wildlife or other animal reservoirs of SARS-CoV-like viruses are found. Low risk of SARS-CoV emergence or introduction -Countries/areas that never reported cases or reported only imported cases during the 2002-03 epidemic, and that do not conduct research using live SARS-CoV-like viruses or store clinical samples from SARS cases. SARS-CoV contributed to understanding of the SARS-CoV entry process, and helped to characterize two targets of antiviral therapeutics: the SARS-CoV spike protein and ACE2. However, most of the chemicals or approaches have not been evaluated in human or animal models. Various approaches toward producing a vaccine against SARS have been pursued, including the use of inactivated SARS-CoV, plasmid DNA, and adenovirus vectors. One obvious problem any vaccine would face is whom it should be given to, in the absence of SARS-CoV transmission. However, waiting until a renewed outbreak occurs before commencing vaccination means that precious weeks would be lost until individuals at risk become immune.","A phase II/III clinical trial (NCT02378753) was initiated in Guinea in March 2015 assessing vaccine efficacy upon vaccination using one dose of 2 \u00d7 107 PFU in a cluster randomization design with a ring vaccination approach (Table 1). Participants, including individuals at high risk, were assigned to clusters that were randomly subjected to immediate and delayed vaccination (21 days later). The study report demonstrated promising results (74, 75). No cases of Ebola virus disease with symptom onset at least 10 days after randomization were detectable in the immediate vaccination group, while 16 cases of Ebola virus disease from seven clusters occurred in the delayed vaccination group, demonstrating 100% vaccination efficacy. Of 43 serious events registered upon vaccination, only one was judged to be causally related to vaccination. Given these results, rVSV ZEBOV is currently the most promising candidate for a licensed vaccine against Ebola virus.","Initial attempts to develop vaccines for the prevention of parainfluenza viruses involved use of formalin-inactivated virus. However, these vaccines failed to provide protection in field trials carried out in the 1960s, despite being modestly immunogenic. In contrast to RSV vaccines, the use of formalin-inactivated parainfluenza vaccine was not associated with enhanced disease on subsequent infection. Several approaches have been explored subsequently, including use of live attenuated viruses and recombinant subunit vaccines. Clinical trials of these are ongoing.","Testing was assumed to move individuals with non-severe symptoms from the infectious to isolated compartments. Isolated cases were assumed to have reduced transmission compared to non-isolated cases. Social distancing measures were assumed to reduce the number of contacts per day across the entire population. Details of parameters that were varied under different interventions are included in Table 2 . For the base case, we assumed that there was a degree of testing and isolation occurring and that a proportion of exposed cases were quarantined. We then added in additional control measures: (i) enhanced testing and contact tracing; (ii) restrictive social distancing measures; and (iii) a combination of enhanced testing and contract tracing, along with less restrictive social distancing than in (ii). We considered two approaches to implementing interventions: (i) fixed durations and (ii) a dynamic approach with interventions turned on and off based on the number of cases requiring ICU care in the population. We focused on ICU capacity, since this is expected to be most limited resource during the COVID-19 epidemic. Prior to emergence of COVID-19, Ontario had approximately 1300 ICU beds with associated ventilators; but 90% were occupied by individuals with non-. CC-BY-NC 4.0 International license It is made available under a author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.","Enhanced interest in SV40 lay in the fact that it and the closely related mouse polyomavirus caused tumors in rodents. It was hoped that detailed analysis of tumor viruses would shed light on the genesis of common human cancers and suggest new approaches to prevent and treat cancer.","Production of new commercial vaccines against new IBV variants is generally not beneficial to the concerned biological firms because of the high expenses and the period required for their product validation [16] ; besides, the relationship between protection and serotype is often hard to evaluate for the choice of the right vaccine serotype [24, 25] . For these reasons, assessing antigenic relationships among field and vaccine IBV strains must be accomplished by standard methods that mainly include laboratory cross-challenge studies in chickens. In the current study, protection conferred by the H120 vaccine (Massachusetts group) against the Tunisian TN20/00 variant was evaluated. In addition, the protection offered by the vaccine was compared with the protection provided by the CR88 variant vaccine (793B type) alone or in association with the H120 vaccine, under laboratory conditions. In addition, a field study was carried out to evaluate the efficacy of a vaccination protocol based on the administration of H120 vaccine at 1 d followed by a second vaccination with the CR88 strain at 14 d old. The antigenic relatedness between the CR88 and the TN20/00 serotypes in addition to their renal tropism were the main factors for using the CR88 vaccine strain in the current study. Bouroga\u00e2 et al. [14] demonstrated by phylogenetic studies that the CR88 vaccine was closely related to the Tunisian field variants, especially the TN20/00 variant.","The above observations strongly suggest that IL-2 can enhance not only the humoral immune response but also the cell-mediated response triggered by DNA vaccination. The co-injection of the IL-2 gene during DNA immunization enhanced the development of Th1 and Th2 cells with the predominant Th1 cells. Our results are consistent with a previous report, which showed that the co-expression of the immune-stimulatory IL-2 could increase the immune response of coxsackievirus B3 principally towards Th1 (Henke et al. 2004). Conversely, Chow reported that the co-injection of the IL-2 gene during DNA immunization studies enhanced the development of Th1 cells, while the Th2 activation was not affected (Chow et al. 1998), which is in not agreement with our results. However, these different results could have been due to the different nature of the antigens used in the respective studies.","These data clearly indicate that a double inactivated whole virus vaccine is a promising candidate for an effective human vaccine. The use of two inactivation steps based on different mechanisms of infection will ensure safety with respect to residual infectious virus. However, it has been reported that vaccination with a feline coronavirus vaccine resulted in antibody induced enhancement of infection [27, 28] . No suggestion of such a phenomenon could be induced from the challenge studies reported here or in other studies where protection was achieved by induction of neutralising antibodies with MVA [13] or parainfluenza [8] vectored spike protein live viral vaccines. However, vaccine induced enhancement of coronavirus infection will require further study as there have been reports that vaccination of ferrets with rMVA expressing SARS-CoV S protein was associated with enhanced hepatitis [29, 30] .","The development of coronavirus reverse genetic systems has greatly enhanced our understanding of coronavirus replication and pathogenesis. This is particularly true in regard to illuminating the functions of viral proteins that interact with host proteins that are part of the host response to infection. We briefly review the various reverse genetic systems that are available for the different coronaviruses. For more detailed information about the various approaches that have been employed, the reader can consult several excellent reviews Enjuanes et al., 2005; Masters, 2006; Masters and Rottier, 2005; Thiel and Siddell, 2005) and the primary literature on each reverse genetic system. The large size of the coronavirus genome, 27-32 kb, presented serious obstacles to developing reverse genetic systems similar to those used for smaller positive sense RNA viruses, where a cDNA clone of the genome is transcribed in vitro and the RNA product is transfected into permissive cells to regenerate infectious virus. These obstacles were due to both the large size of cDNAs corresponding to complete coronavirus genomes, and to the instability of various portions of coronavirus replicase genes when cloned into conventional E. coli plasmid vectors (Almazan et al., 2000; Yount et al., 2000) . This delayed the development of reverse genetic systems for these viruses for a number of years following the completion of the first coronavirus sequence (Boursnell et al., 1987) and resulted in the development of alternatives to more conventional plasmid-based approaches.","According to CAC (2013), determination of risk assessment policy should be included as a specific component of risk management. Risk assessment policy should be established as per the principles of FSMS by risk managers in advance of risk assessment, in consultation with risk assessors and all other interested parties. This procedure aims at ensuring that risk assessment is systematic, complete, unbiased, and transparent. The mandate given by risk managers to risk assessors should be as clear as possible. Where necessary, risk managers should ask risk assessors to evaluate the potential changes in risk resulting from different risk management options in accordance with risk assessment policy.","One concern of vaccination in humans is vaccine-mediated enhancement of disease, a process in which the disease following infection is more severe in vaccinated individuals than in unvaccinated individuals. Although this was observed in only a small subset of vaccine studies that were carried out for SARS-CoV136 and has not yet been observed in any of the published MERS-CoV vaccine studies, it is an important concern. Moreover, it is unclear who to vaccinate against MERS-CoV, as healthy individuals seem to be at little risk of severe disease. Older patients or patients with underlying disease, who have the highest risk of severe MERS, would be important target populations. However, vaccination in such patients can be problematic owing to their poor immune responses, as has been established for influenza virus141. In addition, vaccination of people with a high risk of exposure to MERS-CoV, such as health care workers, slaughterhouse workers and camel herders, is advisable142.","All of these approaches, which increase the stability of the recombinant, while effective under laboratory conditions, undermine the concept of limited survivability', which is an important characteristic of GILSP organisms. Indeed, from the viewpoint of industrial safety, the most reassuring characteristic of the majority of GMOs is their very poor chance of survival in any environment in competition with plasmid-free species. Any genetic manipulation of a host/vector system which forces an increase in stability through enhanced plasmid maintenance is probably, therefore, not the best strategy.","In the Latin America and Caribbean region, seasonal influenza causes high morbidity placing a substantial economic burden on healthcare systems and society. 12 Data on the burden of influenza disease for Brazil are limited, most likely due to underreporting. 12 Between 2000 and 2008, data from the influenza surveillance system in Brazil revealed that influenza-like illness (ILI) led to a total of 4.39-16.92% of hospital consultations, and in 2008, of all positive reported influenza cases, 43.29% (95% CI: 37.59-49.13) were influenza B. 12 The Ministry of Health (MoH, \"Minist\u00e9rio da Sa\u00fade\") of Brazil promotes annual national influenza vaccination campaigns. Over the years, there has been a gradual expansion of the recommended groups for annual influenza immunization in Brazil. 13 Since 1999, influenza vaccination was introduced for elderly people aged above 65 years and other groups vulnerable to complications (patients with co-morbidities). In the year 2000, individuals 60 years or older were included for vaccination. 14, 15 During 2011-2012, in addition to elderly people, vaccination was extended to children aged six months to those aged below two years, pregnant women, healthcare professionals, and indigenous people. In 2013, women after child birth, individuals with chronic disease and transplant, and individuals in detention facilities were included for annual influenza vaccination. In 2014, children aged 2-4 years were also included in the recommended target at-risk groups for vaccination. The information system of National Immunization Program for Brazil (\"Programa Nacional de Imuniza\u00e7 \u00e3o\") 13 reported that across all target vaccination groups, overall mean vaccination coverage of 86.8% was reached in 2014. 13 During all influenza vaccination campaigns in Brazil, trivalent vaccines were used according to WHO recommended vaccine composition for South hemisphere. 16 Although high vaccination coverage levels have been reached in these target vaccination groups, little is known about the effectiveness of vaccination programs in Brazil. 14, 17 A number of factors, in particular vaccine coverage, is known to influence the effectiveness of influenza vaccination programs. However, the Brazilian MoH data shows vaccine coverage to be high in almost all years since the introduction of vaccination. Importantly, the extent to which the vaccine recommended influenza B virus lineage matches the influenza virus lineage circulating in the population during an influenza season is known to impact the effectiveness of seasonal influenza vaccination programs. 14 Data on laboratory surveillance of the influenza B virus in Brazil are limited, specifically data on the burden of disease and circulation patterns of influenza B lineages. The present integrative review of publicly available data aims to consolidate findings on the pattern of influenza B occurrence in Brazil to have a better understanding of influenza B epidemiology and its relevance to seasonal vaccine composition.","Appropriate public health responses are dependent on high-quality knowledge and awareness about important aspects of the disease. Whenever facing an outbreak, there is always a need for health education programs to raise the public awareness with regular evaluation of the level of knowledge to fill gaps of deficient or lack of information. MERS-CoV is a good case in point that constituted a real panic to populations. Preparing population adequately for this threat involves action on many fronts, including enhancing the public awareness toward the basic knowledge about the disease that is one key pillar of an enhanced outbreak investigation, response, and control system. We argue that our thinking should converge on the public awareness and we should address the gaps of all disciplines of the disease. The initial public health response to the MERS-CoV have been poorly calibrated owing to early estimates of the case fatality rate.14 What was initially thought to be a potential threat and severe novel coronavirus turned out to be no more severe than an average respiratory infection.15,16 The current study aimed to evaluate the level of knowledge and awareness of the Saudi and non-Saudi-Arabian pilgrims regarding the MERS-CoV.","Various approaches toward producing a vaccine against SARS have been pursued, including the use of inactivated SARS-CoV, plasmid DNA, and adenovirus vectors. One obvious problem any vaccine would face is whom it should be given to, in the absence of SARS-CoV transmission. However, waiting until a renewed outbreak occurs before commencing vaccination means that precious weeks would be lost until individuals at risk become immune.","Ironically, in view of public unease about adverse environmental impacts of genetic engineering, many of the most promising developments in r-DNA technology are in the area of environmental protection and control. The development of microorganisms with new or improved degradative capacities offers new approaches to toxic waste disposal (Dwyer et ai, 1988: Liaw and Srinivasan, 1990) , oil pollution (Reddy et al., 1989) and effluent treatment (Sojka and Ying, 1987) . Enhanced recovery of metals (Romeyer et al, 1988) and oil (Springham, 1984) is a potential use for GMOs which has environmental, as well as economic implications.","Prevention of respiratory syncytial virus disease: active immunization RSV vaccine development has been hampered in the past decades by the complex factors described earlier, the concerns that resulted from the history of the early formalin-inactivated vaccine trials, and the limited support for study of pediatric respiratory viruses and vaccine development [38, 39] . Livecandidate attenuated RSV vaccines were never observed to cause enhanced RSV disease, and intranasal vaccination with live virus vaccines elicit better mucosal immunity than parenterally administered inactivated virus vaccines. Therefore, developing live attenuated vaccines for RSV-na\u0131\u00a8ve populations, including infants, is a priority. However, live attenuated vaccines pose the challenge of finding a balance between overattenuation, with subsequent induction of inefficient immunologic responses, and underattenuation, which may result in disease especially in younger infants. It is therefore heartening to report that recent advances in molecular virology have allowed a live attenuated vaccine candidate to be developed that is well tolerated in infants and protects against challenge [40] .","Objectives: Evidence is conflicting regarding the potential benefits of influenza vaccination in patients with diabetes. As part of the PRISMA study (Hak E, et al. Arch Intern Med, 2005) we assessed the clinical effectiveness of influenza vaccination in adults with diabetes and specifically examined potential modification of effect by age and prior influenza vaccination. Methods: We conducted a case-control study nested in a large cohort of patients recommended for influenza vaccination during the 1999-2000 influenza A epidemic (n = 75,000). We selected cases and controls with a diagnosis of diabetes from the original study population (n = 9,238). Vaccination status was recorded by the general practitioner. The primary endpoint was the composite of all-cause mortality and hospitalization for diabetes events, acute respiratory or cardiovascular disease during the epidemic, and the separate components were secondary endpoints. We evaluated the effect of vaccination and the influence of prior vaccination by means of logistic regression analysis controlling for age, gender, health insurance coverage, prior health care use, medication use and co-morbid conditions. Results: We observed 131 hospitalizations and 61 deaths. In all, the combined endpoint was reduced by 56% (95% confidence interval: 36-70%), hospitalizations by 52% (95% CI 22 to 70%) and deaths by 58% (95% CI 13 to 80%. Among persons with diabetes aged 18 to 64 years we observed somewhat higher reductions in the primary endpoint than elderly persons with diabetes over 65 years of age (72% versus 39%). In those vaccinated for the first time, the primary endpoint was reduced by 47% (95% CI 0.2% to 72%) and in those who received prior vaccination the reduction was 58% (95% CI 4 to 81%). Conclusion: Adults with diabetes alike other recommended risk groups as healthy elderly persons and patients with cardiovascular or pulmonary disease benefit considerably from influenza vaccination and no difference in vaccine effectiveness was observed between first time and repeat vaccination.","To assess the production of cytokines by lymphocytes of Tg mice following SARS-CoV S DNA prime and HLA-A*0201 restricted peptides boost vaccination, HLA-A*0201/K b Tg mice were randomly divided into three groups to be immunized with cognate DNA plus peptides, DNA alone and PBS as control respectively. 7-10 d after boost vaccination, mice were sacrificed and cells were prepared from lymph nodes, spleens and lungs. The cells were stimulated with or without peptide-loaded DCs to assess HLA-A*0201 restricted peptide-specific immune responses. The levels of IFN-\u2425, TNF-\u2423 and IL-2 in the cell-free culture supernatants were determined by ELISA. The results revealed that very low levels of IFN-\u2425 were detected when lymphocytes were cultured in medium alone. Interestingly, addition of peptide-loaded DCs to cell culture systems markedly enhanced the production of IFN-\u2425 in all of the organs from DNA plus peptides immunized mice (Fig. 1A ). There is only modest IFN-\u2425 production in splenocytes from DNA alone immunized mice (P &lt; 0.01) and the levels of IFN-\u2425 in PBS control groups were undetectable. Besides, there were TNF-\u2423 and IL-2 produced by lymphocytes from Tg mice immunized with SARS S DNA and HLA-A*0201 restricted peptides following cognate peptide stimulation in vitro. The results showed that the highest level of TNF-\u2423 was detected in lungs which were non-lymphoid tissues (P &lt; 0.05). The production of IL-2 in spleens (P &lt; 0.001) and lymph nodes (P &lt; 0.05) was little stronger than it in lungs (Fig. 1B) . Taken together, these data indicated that striking cytokine production was induced both in lymphoid and non-lymphoid lymphocytes stimulated with HLA-A*0201 restricted peptides in Tg mice following SARS S DNA plus HLA-A*0201 restricted peptides vaccination.","While loss clearly helped increase the formation of security programs in banking and aviation, many other industries were developing security programs without the force of directive legislation. For example, no legislation requires the retail industry to engage in security measures; however, substantial measurable losses in retailing have produced a cadre of managers who evaluate losses and forcefully seek to mitigate them. The same holds true for other aspects of commerce and industry -public, private, and not-forprofit sectors alike. Nonaviation transporters, distributors, mining and processing facilities, and a myriad of service organizations have all enhanced their security policies and systems.","These reports indicate that countering the quiescent, anti-inflammatory state of AM is critical for developing a protective immune response; our results indicate that infection with SARS-CoV reverses this quiescent state inefficiently. We used three approaches to support this conclusion. First, pre-treatment of MA15-infected mice with clodronate depleted AM, resulting in enhanced activation and migration of rDCs, which in turn led to the development of a vigorous and protective virus-specific T cell response in the lung (Fig. 2 and 3). The activation and migration of rDCs at early times p.i. are critical for the timely initiation of anti-SARS-CoV T cell responses. Consistent with this, treatment with clodronate at day 2 p.i. was not protective (Fig. 1), because rDC migration to the DLNs is largely complete by 48 hours p.i. ((Fig. 2 D) and [12]). Depletion at day 2 p.i. resulted in more severe disease, suggesting that in SARS-CoV-infected mice, virus-specific T cells require additional DC stimulation in the lungs, as occurs in influenza A-infected animals [16].","DNA vaccines have attracting increased attention due to multiple advantages over conventional vaccines. Attempts to improve the vaccines immune effects focus on enhancing DNA delivery and employing novel immunoadjuvants [29, 31, 37] . Electroporation has emerged as an effective method for delivering DNA vaccines, significantly enhancing immune responses. Previously, some experiments have shown that electroporation improved the immunogenicity of DNA vaccines in mice, guinea pigs, rabbits, and rhesus macaques [39] [40] [41] . In this study, we observed the antigen-specific antibody level induced by electroporation vaccination was higher than that have been seen in other two DNA vaccination studies. This phenomenon could be explained as following: firstly, the application of short electrical pulses to the target tissue, renders the cell membrane transiently permeable to DNA and other molecules. Secondly, the muscle could be damage at the site where the electroporation took place. Although the damage observed is minor since very little of the muscle mass is affected, the damaged cells in electroporation will release of \"danger signals\" and attract antigen-presenting cells and other immune cells, which resulted in increased DNA uptake, leading to enhanced protein expression in treated muscle cells. Hence, the electroporation may work as an adjuvant to increase the immune response against the Ag produced.","Vaccination remains, at present, the main way of preventing epidemic influenza A and B viruses but, at least more recently vaccination has been confined to groups at special risk of mortality from influenza. The earlier widespread use of live attenuated vaccine in the USSR has now declined somewhat and most countries only produce enough vaccine to immunize some lo(% of the population. Again, more recently, this vaccine has tended to be inactivated whole virus or subunit vaccine (reviewed by Selby, 1976) . These (whole virus) vaccines have been produced for the past 4 decades and with improving technologies of ultra-centrifugation and gel filtration are now relatively pure virus proteins. HA antigen content is well controlled by single radial diffusion techniques (Wood et al., 1977) but it must be admitted that many problems remain to be solved. Some of these are discussed in more detail below, whilst the reader is also referred to Chapter 2 where some more modern approaches of gene cloning are discussed and to Chapter 17 where some problems of antigenic and genetic variation are outlined (see also Table 7 .34). Laboratory studies have established clearly that HA and NA antigens contain the main antigenic determinants of the virus responsible for inducing protective immunity (reviewed in Potter and Oxford, 1979) . Passive antibody to HA and NA protects mice against lethal infection with influenza A virus, as well as immunization with HA and NA antigens. lmmunization or passive immunity with antibody to M or N P for example has no protective effect (Virelizier et al., 1976, Fazekas de St. Groth and Graham, (Schild et al., 1983) Gething, 1981","Typing: from species to clones (Symposium arranged with ESGEM) S11 tetanus and varicella zoster virus in patients immunosuppressed by disease or treatment (1) . Aims: To assess the vaccination history and exposure to vaccine preventable diseases in IBD patients on immunosuppression prior to the establishment of a chronic inflammatory diseases assessment clinic. Method: We conducted a prospective survey of consecutive IBD patients on immunosuppressant medications. A thorough vaccination history was obtained and blood samples were taken to assess past exposure and vaccination status. Results: A total of 70 IBD patients were assessed (53% Crohn's disease, 33% Ulcerative Colitis, 4% Indeterminate). History of immunosuppressant use included; Azathioprine (51%), Prednisolone (44%) and Methotrexate (2%), Anti-TNF (6%). 91% of patients did not receive their annual influenza vaccination and 80% had never been vaccinated. 97% of patients were not adequately vaccinated against pneumococcus and 86% had never been vaccinated. Varicella Zoster Virus IgG was detected in 100% of patients, 43% had a previous history of chickenpox and 11% had a previous history of shingles. 94% of patients were not vaccinated against hepatitis B, 3% had chronic hepatitis B infection and only 3% were vaccinated. Conclusion: This study indicates that vaccination uptake amongst IBD patients on immunosuppressant regimens is extremely poor. Current Irish guidelines recommend vaccination in these patients. Ignoring these guidelines puts patients at risk of preventable diseases. The establishment of a designated infectious disease assessment clinic will commence to address vaccination requirements and provide healthcare advice pertaining to infectious complications of immunosuppressive therapies in particular biological agents. We intend to expand this service to other medical specialties utilising these immunosuppressive regimens.","Although the National Swine Survey database provided a good opportunity to evaluate many herd-level management and demographic risk factors that were associated with TGE seropositivity in the United States, some data that we needed were not available nor was it possible because of confidentiality to obtain the missing data retrospectively. The crosssectional study design and lack of detailed questions on TGE history prevented us from determining how long herds had been infected, the reasons if any for TGE vaccination, and whether sows were vaccinated with live or killed vaccines. In addition, seropositivity in some herds may have been attributable to PRCV rather than TGE infection. Despite these limitations, the findings of the study support current knowledge of risk factors for TGE seropositivity. Large female breeding herd size (at least 500 sows) and the source and number of purchased pigs were found to be significantly associated with TGE seropositivity. The association with large herd size remained after many management variables were controlled for in the analysis.","As with RSV, vaccination of macaques and mice with inactivated HMPV led to disease enhancement after challenge and a strong Th2-type immune response associated with a lack of neutralizing antibodies (Herfst et al., 2008a; Hamelin et al., 2007) . Therefore, alternative approaches have been evaluated, including soluble protein-based subunit vaccines, live attenuated vaccines, or DNA vaccines encoding viral proteins.","A more economical and achievable strategy than traditional approaches to vaccine development and deployment would be to focus on manufacturing small stockpiles of vaccine using a common platform technology. ChAd vectored vaccines provide a good example of a suitable vaccine platform, which has been identified as one of significant interest by the WHO R&amp;D Blueprint process. The overall strategy would be to generate suitable stockpiles for emergency response use having previously demonstrated safety and immunogenicity of each vaccine up to Phase II trials in the target geographical regions. These products could be stored in relevant locations for each disease and, in the event of an outbreak emerging, could be deployed in a ring vaccination program similar to that employed in a Phase III trial in Guinea of the rVSV ZEBOV vaccine during the West African Ebola outbreak.18 Such a deployment would need to be made under the provisions of policies for use of unapproved medicinal products, such as the FDA Expanded Access program, also known as \u201ccompassionate use\u201d, or other emergency use legislation. This would require fulfilment of certain conditions including that no comparable or satisfactory therapy is available, that the risk of harm from the vaccine is not greater than the risk of disease and that there is sufficient evidence of the safety and effectiveness of the product to support its use in the given circumstances.46 In this context, a vaccine for an outbreak pathogen, based on a well-developed platform, such as ChAd vectors, with evidence of efficacy from a relevant animal model would be likely to gain approval for use in a limited setting. Based on research, manufacturing and clinical trial costs for the ChAd3 vectored vaccine developed for Ebola, vaccines might be stockpiled for just $50 million per disease, representing a fraction of the cost of bringing a vaccine through to licensure. Deployment would provide the efficacy data in humans required for approval by a national regulator, increasing the likelihood of the vaccine progressing through the later stages of development.","High levels of protein expression and solubility are two major requirements of successful recombinant protein production (Esposito and Chatterjee 2006) . However, recombinant protein production is a challenging process. Almost half of recombinant proteins fail to be expressed and half of the successfully expressed proteins are insoluble ( http://targetdb.rcsb.org/metrics/ ). These failures hamper protein research, with particular implications for structural, functional and pharmaceutical studies that require soluble and concentrated protein solutions (Kramer et al. 2012; Hou et al. 2018) . Therefore, solubility prediction and protein engineering for enhanced solubility is an active area of research. Notable protein engineering approaches include mutagenesis, truncation (i.e., expression of partial protein sequences), or fusion with a solubility-enhancing tag (Waldo 2003; Esposito and Chatterjee 2006; Trevino, Martin Scholtz, and Nick Pace 2007; Chan et al. 2010; Kramer et al. 2012; Costa et al. 2014 ) .","Human disease from H5N1 mainly affects children and young adults, making the high mortality especially remarkable. Among reported cases, the median age has been 18 years with a range of 3 months to 81 years. 64, 141 Less than 10% of reported cases have occurred Since late 2003, the virus has spread widely and has been found in 63 countries in Africa, Asia, and Europe, with more than 7000 avian outbreaks reported to the World Organisation for Animal Health. 128 HPAI H5N1 is believed to have spread through multiple modes, including bird migration, international trade in poultry and poultry products, and illegal bird transport, although the relative contribution of these modes is unclear. 111, 129, 130 A variety of strategies, including depopulation, enhanced biosecurity and sanitary measures, and poultry vaccination, have been employed in veterinary settings to control and prevent HPAI H5N1. 120, 131, 132 However, owing to the widespread distribution of this virus, its continuous evolution into multiple lineages, poultry husbandry practices in many parts of Asia, its presence in wild birds and waterfowl, and the human and financial resources needed to implement control measures, the success of these strategies has been variable. 133 Because studies in several countries have demonstrated a strong correlation between the detection of H5N1 outbreaks in poultry and the location and timing of human disease, veterinary public health measures to control the virus must remain an integral part of efforts to reduce the risk to humans from H5N1 and other avian influenza viruses. 134, 135 From 2003 through the end of 2012, the WHO has recorded 610 human cases of H5N1 in 15 countries, with 360 (59%) of these cases being fatal-an unprecedented case-fatality rate for influenza. 136 It has been argued that the observed case-fatality rate may appear artificially high owing to restrictive case definitions and surveillance methods that miss milder and asymptomatic infections. 137 However, H5N1 serosurveys, even in high-risk poultry workers, tend to yield low seroprevalence, and this argument has been challenged. [137] [138] [139] [140] Furthermore, the case-fatality rate has not changed appreciably over time (Fig. 14-5) ","groove (termed A-F pockets) define a repertoire of 10 4 -10 6 peptide antigens that can be recognized 48 by each HLA allotype (9, 10). Several machine-learning methods have been developed to predict 49 the likelihood that a target peptide will bind to a given allele (reviewed in (11)). Generally these 50 methods make use of available data sets in the Immune Epitope Database (12) to train artificial 51 neural networks that predict peptide processing, binding and display, and their performance varies 52 depending on peptide length and HLA allele representation in the database. Structure-based 53 approaches have also been proposed to model the bound peptide conformation de novo (reviewed 54 in (13)). These approaches utilize various algorithms to optimize the backbone and side chain 55 degrees of freedom of the peptide/MHC structure according to an all-atom scoring function, 56 derived from physical principles (14-16), that can be further enhanced using modified scoring 57 terms (17) or mean field theory (18). While these methods do not rely on large training data sets, 58 their performance is affected by bottlenecks in sampling of different backbone conformations, and 59 any possible structural adaptations of the HLA peptide-binding groove. 60 Predicting the bound peptide conformation whose N-and C-termini are anchored within a fixed-61 length groove is a tractable modeling problem that can be addressed using standard comparative suggesting that a similar principle can be applied to produce models of candidate epitopes directly 72 from the proteome of a pathogen of interest. Here, we apply RosettaMHC to all HLA-A*02:01 73 epitopes predicted directly from the ~30 kbp SARS-CoV-2 genome, and make our models publicly 74 available through an online database. The computed binding energies of our models can be used 75 as an additional validation layer to select high-affinity epitopes from large peptide sets. As detailed 76 epitope mapping data from high-throughput tetramer staining (23-25) and T cell functional 77 screens (26) become available, the models presented here can provide a toehold for understanding 78 links between pMHC-I antigen structure and immunogenicity, with actionable value for the 79 development of peptide vaccines to combat the disease. 80 author/funder.

These differences are largely based on the viral structure, mode of transmission and cell entry, and host immunology and thus provide the foundation for the clinical presentation, virulence, and medical therapeutics of these viral infections. Therefore, a basic knowledge of the more common ICU viral respiratory pathogens will provide a framework for the clinical and research approaches for these infections. This review will focus on the basic epidemiology, virology, and host immune response for a few common or high-impact viral respiratory pathogens in the ICU: influenza, respiratory syncitial virus (RSV), SARS, varicella-zoster virus (VZV), adenovirus, cytomegalovirus (CMV), and viral hemorrhagic fever (VHF) (Table 1). With this basic foundation, clinical care, public health, and medical therapeutics for these viruses will be enhanced from the laboratory to the bedside."],"title":["Enhancing immune responses against SARS-CoV nucleocapsid DNA vaccine by co-inoculating interleukin-2 expressing vector in mice","S8 \u2013 S47 and O50 \u2013 O440","Need for integrative thinking to fight against emerging infectious diseases.
