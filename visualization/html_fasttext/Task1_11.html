In our previous study, immunization of mice with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS CoV) spike (S) DNA vaccine could induce both humoral and cellular immunity in response to a pool of entire overlapping S peptides. Identification of functional dominant epitopes in SARS CoV S protein for T cells is crucial for further understanding of cellular immune responses elicited by SARS CoV S DNA vaccine. In present study, mice were immunized with SARS CoV S DNA vaccine. Subsequently, a pool of 17\u201319 mers overlapped SARS CoV S peptides, which served as immunogens, were scanned to identify the specific epitopes for T cells. Two H-2d restricted CD4+ T epitopes, N60 (S435\u2013444) and P152 (S1111\u20131127), and two H-2d restricted CD8+ T cell epitopes, N50 (S365\u2013374) and P141 (S1031\u20131047) were identified by three different methods, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), enzyme linked immunospot assay (ELISP...","Abstract Progressive immune-associated injury is a hallmark of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). Viral evasion of innate immunity, hypercytokinemia and systemic immunopathology in the SARS coronavirus (SARS CoV) infected host have been suggested as possible mechanisms for the cause of severe pathology and morbidity in SARS patients. The molecular and cellular basis for how SARS CoV impacts the host immune system resulting in severe SARS, however, has not been elucidated. The variable clinical course of SARS may be the result of complex programs of host responses against the infectious agent. Therefore, the systematic analysis of innate and adaptive immune responses to SARS CoV is imperative in building as complete an immunological model as possible of host immunity and inflammatory responses during illness. Here we review recent advances in SARS immunopathogenesis research and present a summary of our findings regarding host responses in SARS patients. We contend that dysregula...","Zoonotic viruses that emerge from wildlife and domesticated animals pose a serious threat to human and animal health. In many instances, mouse models have improved our understanding of the human immune response to infection; however, when dealing with emerging zoonotic diseases, they may be of limited use. This is particularly the case when the model fails to reproduce the disease status that is seen in the natural reservoir, transmission species or human host. In this Review, we discuss how researchers are placing more emphasis on the study of the immune response to zoonotic infections in the natural reservoir hosts and spillover species. Such studies will not only lead to a greater understanding of how these infections induce variable disease and immune responses in distinct species but also offer important insights into the evolution of mammalian immune systems. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The online version of this article (doi:10.1038/nri3551) contains supplementary material, which...","Abstract The contribution of cell-mediated immunity to protective immunity against virulent transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) infection conferred by primary porcine respiratry coronavirus (PRCV) or TGEV exposure was assessed in pigs that were challenged with TGEV 24 days after a primary oronasal inoculation with PRCV or TGEV when 11 days old. PRCV exposure induced partial protection against TGEV challenge in suckling pigs based upon a decreased number of diarrhea cases (42% vs. 90% in age-matched control pigs), limited virus shedding in feces, and increases in virus-neutralizing serum antibody titers; in contrast, all 11-day-old pigs inoculated with TGEV were completely protected after challenge. Weaned pigs were also studied to eliminate any possibility that lactogenic immunity from contact PRCV-exposed sows contributed to protection against TGEV. Once weaned, none of the PRCV-exposed or age-matched control pigs had diarrhea after TGEV challenge; moreover, both groups exhibit...","The WHO has declared SARS-CoV-2 outbreak a public health emergency of international concern. However, to date, there was hardly any study in characterizing the immune responses, especially adaptive immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection. In this study, we collected blood from COVID-19 patients who have recently become virus-free and therefore were discharged, and analyzed their SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody and T cell responses. We observed SARS-CoV-2-specific humoral and cellular immunity in the patients. Both were detected in newly discharged patients, suggesting both participate in immune-mediated protection to viral infection. However, follow-up patients (2 weeks post discharge) exhibited high titers of IgG antibodies, but with low levels of virus-specific T cells, suggesting that they may enter a quiescent state. Our work has thus provided a basis for further analysis of protective immunity to SARS-CoV-2, and understanding the pathogenesis of COVID-19, especially in the severe ca...","Public health measures have successfully identified and contained outbreaks of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus (SARS-CoV)(1,2,3,4,5), but concerns remain over the possibility of future recurrences. Finding a vaccine for this virus therefore remains a high priority. Here, we show that a DNA vaccine encoding the spike (S) glycoprotein of the SARS-CoV induces T cell and neutralizing antibody responses, as well as protective immunity, in a mouse model. Alternative forms of S were analysed by DNA immunization. These expression vectors induced robust immune responses mediated by CD4 and CD8 cells, as well as significant antibody titres, measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Moreover, antibody responses in mice vaccinated with an expression vector encoding a form of S that includes its transmembrane domain elicited neutralizing antibodies. Viral replication was reduced by more than six orders of magnitude in the lungs of mice vaccinated with these S plasmid D...","Abstract SARS-coronavirus (SARS-CoV) has recently been identified as the causative agent of SARS. We constructed a series of recombinant DIs (rDIs), a highly attenuated vaccinia strain, expressing a gene encoding four structural proteins (E, M, N and S) of SARS-CoV individually or simultaneously. These rDIs elicited SARS-CoV-specific serum IgG antibody and T-cell responses in vaccinated mice following intranasal or subcutaneous administration. Mice that were subcutaneously vaccinated with rDIs expressing S protein with or without other structural proteins induced a high level of serum neutralizing IgG antibodies and demonstrated marked protective immunity against SARS-CoV challenge in the absence of a mucosal IgA response. These results indicate that the potent immune response elicited by subcutaneous injection of rDIs containing S is able to control mucosal infection by SARS-CoV. Thus, replication-deficient DIs constructs hold promise for the development of a safe and potent SARS vacc...","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak is an ongoing global health emergence, but the pathogenesis remains unclear. We revealed blood cell immune response profiles using 5' mRNA, TCR and BCR V(D)J transcriptome analysis with single-cell resolution. Data from 134,620 PBMCs and 83,387 TCR and 12,601 BCR clones was obtained, and 56 blood cell subtypes and 23 new cell marker genes were identified from 16 participants. The number of specific subtypes of immune cells changed significantly when compared patients with controls. Activation of the interferon-MAPK pathway is the major defense mechanism, but MAPK transcription signaling is inhibited in cured patients. TCR and BCR V(D)J recombination is highly diverse in generating different antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, the interferon-MAPK pathway and TCR- and BCR-produced antibodies play important roles in the COVID-19 immune response. Immune deficiency or immune over-response may result in the condition of patients with COV...","Abstract Cytotoxic CD8+ T lymphocytes (CTLs) play an important role in antiviral immunity. Several human HLA-A*0201 restricted CTL epitopes of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) spike (S) protein have been identified in HLA-A*0201 transgenic (Tg) mice, but the mechanisms and properties of immune responses are still not well understood. In this study, HLA-A*0201 Tg mice were primed intramuscularly with SARS S DNA and boosted subcutaneously with HLA-A*0201 restricted peptides. The lymphocytes from draining lymph nodes, spleens and lungs were stimulated with the cognate peptides. Three different methods (ELISA, ELISPOT and FACS) were used to evaluate the immune responses during short and long periods of time after immunization. Results showed that peptide-specific CD8+ T cells secreted IFN-\u03b3, TNF-\u03b1 and IL-2 and expressed CD107a/b on cell surface. IFN-\u03b3+CD8+ T cells and CD107a/b+CD8+ T cells distributed throughout the lymphoid and non-lymphoid tissues, but the frequency of peptide-sp...","AbstractThe 2013-2016 West Africa EBOV epidemic was the biggest EBOV outbreak to date. An analysis of virus-specific CD8+ T-cell immunity in 30 survivors showed that 26 of those individuals had a CD8+ response to at least one EBOV protein. The dominant response (25/26 subjects) was specific to the EBOV nucleocapsid protein (NP). It has been suggested that epitopes on the EBOV NP could form an important part of an effective T-cell vaccine for Ebola Zaire. We show that a 9-amino-acid peptide NP44-52 (YQVNNLEEI) located in a conserved region of EBOV NP provides protection against morbidity and mortality after mouse adapted EBOV challenge. A single vaccination in a C57BL/6 mouse using an adjuvanted microsphere peptide vaccine formulation containing NP44-52 is enough to confer immunity in mice. Our work suggests that a peptide vaccine based on CD8+ T-cell immunity in EBOV survivors is conceptually sound and feasible. Nucleocapsid proteins within COVID-19 contain multiple class I epitopes wi...","Abstract Establishing immunological memory in female piglets at a young age with PRCV was effective in inducing a secondary immune response to a limiting dose of virulent TGEV given orally 13\u201318 days prior to farrowing. Subsequently, because of passive antibody transfer, the offspring of these primed gilts were more efficient in surviving a lethal TGEV challenge. An average survival rate of 89% occurred in 6 litters of piglets from primed gilts that were boosted with 2.8\u00d7106 plaque forming units (PFU) of TGEV whereas 76% of the piglets survived in three litters that suckled primed gilts boosted with 3.0\u00d7105 PFU of TGEV. Non-primed gilts given identical pre-farrowing doses of TGEV had litter survival rates of 63 and 55%, respectively. Moreover, both groups of litters from primed gilts suffered less clinical illness (as measured by the extent of weight loss post-challenge) than control litters. Priming of the piglets as neonates and boosting the pregnant gilts produced an anamnestic syst...","Abstract A novel approach modifying cells to express viral markers to elicit protective immunity responses (decoy cellular vaccination) in the prevention of COVID-19 disease is currently being explored. Our approach entails utilizing SARS-CoV-2 Spike antigen-expressing, non-replicating cells as carriers and presenters of immunogenic antigens, so called \u201cI-cells\u201d. By using irradiated cells as presenting vehicles of SARS-CoV-2 viral antigens(s) in a cellular context, these presented viral proteins can be recognized by the host immune system, thus, an efficient protective immune response might be elicited. Another advantage of this strategy is that the manufacturing process is scalable and yields uniform cell products allowing for \u201coff-the-shelf\u201d frozen supply availability. To prevent engraftment and proliferation of the cells after administration, the cells will be irradiated post-harvesting abolishing in vivo replication potential. Specifically, immunoreactive Spike-1 proteins from SARS...","Abstract The role of cell-mediated immunity in human SARS-CoV infection is still not well understood. In this study, we found that memory T-cell responses against the spike (S) protein were persistent for more than 1 year after SARS-CoV infection by detecting the production of IFN-\u03b3 using ELISA and ELISpot assays. Flow cytometric analysis showed that both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were involved in cellular responses against SARS-CoV infection. Interestingly, most of SARS-CoV S-specific memory CD4+ T cells were central memory cells expressing CD45RO+ CCR7+ CD62L\u2212. However, the majority of memory CD8+ T cells revealed effector memory phenotype expressing CD45RO\u2212 CCR7\u2212 CD62L\u2212. Thus, our study provides the evidence that SARS-CoV infection in humans can induce cellular immune response that is persistent for a long period of time. These data may have an important implication in the possibility of designing effective vaccine against SARS-CoV infection, specifically in defining T-cell populations ...","Abstract The development of strategies to augment the immunogenicity of DNA vaccines is critical for improving their clinical utility. One such strategy involves using the different immune routes with DNA vaccines. In the present study, the immunogenicity of SARS-CoV nucleocapsid DNA vaccine, induced by using the current routine vaccination routes (intramuscularly, by electroporation, or orally using live-attenuated Salmonella typhimurium), was compared in mouse model. The comparison between the three vaccination routes indicated that immunization intramuscularly induced a moderate T cell response and antibody response. Mice administrated by electroporation induced the highest antibody response among the three immunization groups and a mid-level of cellular response. In contrast, the orally DNA vaccine evoked vigorous T cell response and a weak antibody production. These results indicated that the distinct types of immune responses were generated by the different routes of DNA immuniza...","BACKGROUND: Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) emerged in later February 2003, as a new epidemic form of life-threatening infection caused by a novel coronavirus. However, the immune-pathogenesis of SARS is poorly understood. To understand the host response to this pathogen, we investigated the gene expression profiles of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) derived from SARS patients, and compared with healthy controls. RESULTS: The number of differentially expressed genes was found to be 186 under stringent filtering criteria of microarray data analysis. Several genes were highly up-regulated in patients with SARS, such as, the genes coding for Lactoferrin, S100A9 and Lipocalin 2. The real-time PCR method verified the results of the gene array analysis and showed that those genes that were up-regulated as determined by microarray analysis were also found to be comparatively up-regulated by real-time PCR analysis. CONCLUSIONS: This differential gene expression profiling of...","The spread of a novel pathogenic infectious agent eliciting protective immunity is typically characterised by three distinct phases: (I) an initial phase of slow accumulation of new infections (often undetectable), (II) a second phase of rapid growth in cases of infection, disease and death, and (III) an eventual slow down of transmission due to the depletion of susceptible individuals, typically leading to the termination of the (first) epidemic wave. Before the implementation of control measures (e.g. social distancing, travel bans, etc) and under the assumption that infection elicits protective immunity, epidemiological theory indicates that the ongoing epidemic of SARS-CoV-2 will conform to this pattern. Here, we calibrate a susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) model to data on cumulative reported SARS-CoV-2 associated deaths from the United Kingdom (UK) and Italy under the assumption that such deaths are well reported events that occur only in a vulnerable fraction of the populati...","Background: A recently emerging respiratory disease named coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has quickly spread across the world. This disease is initiated by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) and uncontrolled cytokine storm, but it remains unknown as to whether a robust antibody response is related to clinical deterioration and poor outcome in laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients. Methods: Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM antibodies were determined by chemiluminescence analysis (CLIA) in COVID-19 patients from a single center in Wuhan. Median IgG and IgM levels in acute and convalescent-phase sera (within 35 days) for all included patients were calculated and compared among severe and nonsevere patients. Immune response phenotyping based on late IgG levels and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) was characterized to stratify patients with different disease severities and outcome. Laboratory parameters in patients with different immune response phenotypes and ...","Abstract The immune spectrum of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is poorly understood. To define the dynamics of the immune spectrum in SARS, serum levels of cytokines, chemokines, immunoglobulins, complement and specific antibodies against SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) were assayed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and phenotypes of peripheral lymphocytes were analyzed by flow cytometry in 95 SARS-infected patients. Results showed that interleukin (IL)-10 and transforming growth factor \u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2) were continuously up-regulated during the entirety of SARS. Regulated on activation normally T cell-expressed and secreted (RANTES) levels were decreased, while monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) was elevated in acute patients. Immunoglobulins and complement were elevated during the first month of SARS. Both serum-positive rates and titers of specific IgM and IgG antibodies responding to SARS-CoV peaked at days 41\u201360 from the onset of SARS. CD4+ and CD8+ T ...","Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is caused by a novel coronavirus (CoV), SARS-CoV. In previous studies, we showed that a SARS-CoV spike (S) glycoprotein-based modified vaccinia Ankara (MVA-S) vaccine could induce strong neutralizing antibody (Nab) response which might have played a critical role in protecting Chinese rhesus monkeys from the pathogenic viral challenge. To date, however, it remains unknown what the minimal level of Nab is required to achieve sterile immunity in humans. It is therefore important to explore techniques to maximize the level of Nab response in vivo. Here, we evaluate various vaccination regimens using combinations of DNA-S, MVA-S, and adenovirus type 5 (Ad5-S) vaccines. We show that in vaccinated mice and rabbits, a heterologous MVA-S prime with Ad5-S boost regimen induces the highest and most persistent level of Nab response when compared with other combinations. Interestingly, the initial level of Nab after prime does not necessarily predict the ma...","The immunogenicity of SARS-CoV nucleocapsid DNA vaccine and the immunoregulatory activity of interleukin-2 (IL-2) were investigated. DNA vaccine plasmids, pcDNA-N and pcDNA-IL2, were constructed and inoculated into BALB/c mice with or without pcDNA-IL2 by intramuscular injection. Cellular and humoral immune responses were assessed by indirect ELISA, lymphocyte proliferation assays, ELISPOT and FACS. The nucleocapsid DNA vaccine had good immunogenicity and can induce specific humoral and cellular immunity in BALB/c mice, while IL-2 plays an immunoadjuvant role and enhances specific immune responses. This study provides a frame of reference for the design of DNA vaccines against SARS-CoV.","Novel SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has caused a pandemic condition world-wide and has been declared as public health emergency of International concern by WHO in a very short span of time. The community transmission of this highly infectious virus has severely affected various parts of China, Italy, Spain and USA among others. The prophylactic solution against SARS-CoV-2 infection is challenging due to the high mutation rate of its RNA genome. Herein, we exploited a next generation vaccinology approach to construct a multi-epitope vaccine candidate against SARS-CoV-2 with high antigenicity, safety and efficacy to combat this deadly infectious agent. The whole proteome was scrutinized for the screening of highly conserved, antigenic, non-allergen and non-toxic epitopes having high population coverage that can elicit both humoral and cellular mediated immune response against COVID-19 infection. These epitopes along with four different adjuvants were utilized to construct a multi-epitope...","Respiratory disease caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) pneumonia first emerged in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, in December 2019 and spread rapidly to other provinces and other countries. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the receptor for SARS-CoV and has been suggested to be also the receptor for 2019-nCoV. Paradoxically, ACE2 expression in the lung protects mice from SARS-CoV spike protein induced lung injury by attenuating the renin-angiotensin system. In the intestine, ACE2 also suppresses intestinal inflammation by maintaining amino acid homeostasis, antimicrobial peptide expression and ecology of the gut microbiome. Upon analysis of single cell-RNA sequencing data from control subjects and those with colitis or inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), we found that ACE2 expression in the colonocytes was positively associated with genes regulating viral infection, innate and cellular immunity, but was negatively associated with viral transcription, protein translati...","BACKGROUND: The recent emergence of a novel coronavirus in the Middle East (designated MERS-CoV) is a reminder of the zoonotic and pathogenic potential of emerging coronaviruses in humans. Clinical features of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) include atypical pneumonia and progressive respiratory failure that is highly reminiscent of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) caused by SARS-CoV. The host response is a key component of highly pathogenic respiratory virus infection. Here, we computationally analyzed gene expression changes in a human airway epithelial cell line infected with two genetically distinct MERS-CoV strains obtained from human patients, MERS-CoV SA 1 and MERS-CoV Eng 1. RESULTS: Using topological techniques, including persistence homology and filtered clustering, we performed a comparative transcriptional analysis of human Calu-3 cell host responses to the different MERS-CoV strains, with MERS-CoV Eng 1 inducing early kinetic changes, between 3 and 12 hours...","The 2014\u201315 Ebola outbreak in West Africa highlighted the potential for large disease outbreaks caused by emerging pathogens and has generated considerable focus on preparedness for future epidemics. Here we discuss drivers, strategies and practical considerations for developing vaccines against outbreak pathogens. Chimpanzee adenoviral (ChAd) vectors have been developed as vaccine candidates for multiple infectious diseases and prostate cancer. ChAd vectors are safe and induce antigen-specific cellular and humoral immunity in all age groups, as well as circumventing the problem of pre-existing immunity encountered with human Ad vectors. For these reasons, such viral vectors provide an attractive platform for stockpiling vaccines for emergency deployment in response to a threatened outbreak of an emerging pathogen. Work is already underway to develop vaccines against a number of other outbreak pathogens and we will also review progress on these approaches here, particularly for Lassa f...","The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, etiological agent of recently named Coronavirus infected disease (COVID-19) by WHO, has caused more than 2, 000 deaths worldwide since its emergency in Wuhan City, Hubei province, China, in December, 2019. The symptoms of COVID-19 varied from modest, mild to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and the latter of which is generally associated with deregulated immune cytokine production; however, we currently know little as to the interplay between the extent of clinical symptoms and the compositions of lung immune microenvironment. Here, we comprehensively characterized the lung immune microenvironment with the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) from 3 severe and 3 mild COVID-19 patients and 8 previously reported healthy lung controls through single-cell RNA sequence (scRNA-seq) combined with TCR-seq. Our data shows that monocyte-derived FCN1+ macrophages, whereas notFABP4+ alveolar macrophages that represent a predominant macrophage subset in B...","There is an urgent need to project how transmission of the novel betacoronavirus SARS-CoV-2 will unfold in coming years. These dynamics will depend on seasonality, the duration of immunity, and the strength of cross-immunity to/from the other human coronaviruses. Using data from the United States, we measured how these factors affect transmission of human betacoronaviruses HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1. We then built a mathematical model to simulate transmission of SARS-CoV-2 through the year 2025. We project that recurrent wintertime outbreaks of SARS-CoV-2 will probably occur after an initial pandemic wave. We summarize the full range of plausible transmission scenarios and identify key data still needed to distinguish between them, most importantly longitudinal serological studies to determine the duration of immunity to SARS-CoV-2.","AbstractSevere acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronaviruses (CoVs) are zoonotic pathogens with high fatality rates and pandemic potential. Vaccine development has focussed on the principal target of the neutralizing humoral immune response, the spike (S) glycoprotein, which mediates receptor recognition and membrane fusion. Coronavirus S proteins are extensively glycosylated viral fusion proteins, encoding around 69-87 N-linked glycosylation sites per trimeric spike. Using a multifaceted structural approach, we reveal a specific area of high glycan density on MERS S that results in the formation of under-processed oligomannose-type glycan clusters, which was absent on SARS and HKU1 CoVs. We provide a comparison of the global glycan density of coronavirus spikes with other viral proteins including HIV-1 envelope, Lassa virus glycoprotein complex, and influenza hemagglutinin, where glycosylation plays a known role in shielding immunogenic ep...","Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome caused substantial morbidity and mortality during the 2002\u20132003 epidemic. Many of the features of the human disease are duplicated in BALB/c mice infected with a mouse-adapted version of the virus (MA15), which develop respiratory disease with high morbidity and mortality. Here, we show that severe disease is correlated with slow kinetics of virus clearance and delayed activation and transit of respiratory dendritic cells (rDC) to the draining lymph nodes (DLN) with a consequent deficient virus-specific T cell response. All of these defects are corrected when mice are treated with liposomes containing clodronate, which deplete alveolar macrophages (AM). Inhibitory AMs are believed to prevent the development of immune responses to environmental antigens and allergic responses by interacting with lung dendritic cells and T cells. The inhibitory effects of AM can also be nullified if mice or AMs are pretreated with poly I:C, which directly activate AMs an...","Abstract Over 12 years have elapsed since severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) triggered the first global alert for coronavirus infections. Virus transmission in humans was quickly halted by public health measures and human infections of SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) have not been observed since. However, other coronaviruses still pose a continuous threat to human health, as exemplified by the recent emergence of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) in humans. The work on SARS-CoV widens our knowledge on the epidemiology, pathophysiology and immunology of coronaviruses and may shed light on MERS coronavirus (MERS-CoV). It has been confirmed that T-cell immunity plays an important role in recovery from SARS-CoV infection. Herein, we summarize T-cell immunological studies of SARS-CoV and discuss the potential cross-reactivity of the SARS-CoV-specific immunity against MERS-CoV, which may provide useful recommendations for the development of broad-spectrum vaccines against coronavirus...","Efficient vaccination against infectious agents and tumors depends on specific antigen targeting to dendritic cells (DCs). We report here that biosafe coronavirus-based vaccine vectors facilitate delivery of multiple antigens and immunostimulatory cytokines to professional antigen-presenting cells in vitro and in vivo. Vaccine vectors based on heavily attenuated murine coronavirus genomes were generated to express epitopes from the lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus glycoprotein, or human Melan-A, in combination with the immunostimulatory cytokine granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF). These vectors selectively targeted DCs in vitro and in vivo resulting in vector-mediated antigen expression and efficient maturation of DCs. Single application of only low vector doses elicited strong and long-lasting cytotoxic T-cell responses, providing protective antiviral and antitumor immunity. Furthermore, human DCs transduced with Melan-A-recombinant human coronavirus 229E effi...","Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the cause of the ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), a public health emergency of international concern declared by the World Health Organization (WHO). An immuno-informatics approach along with comparative genomic was applied to design a multi-epitope-based peptide vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 combining the antigenic epitopes of the S, M and E proteins. The tertiary structure was predicted, refined and validated using advanced bioinformatics tools. The candidate vaccine showed an average of \u2265 90.0% world population coverage for different ethnic groups. Molecular docking of the chimeric vaccine peptide with the immune receptors (TLR3 and TLR4) predicted efficient binding. Immune simulation predicted significant primary immune response with increased IgM and secondary immune response with high levels of both IgG1 and IgG2. It also increased the proliferation of T-helper cells and cytotoxic T-cells along w...","Bats harbor many zoonotic viruses, including highly pathogenic viruses of humans and other mammals, but they are typically asymptomatic in bats. To further understand the antiviral immunity of bats, we screened and identified a series of bat major histocompatibility complex (MHC) I Ptal-N*01:01\u2013binding peptides derived from four different bat-borne viruses, i.e., Hendra virus (HeV), Ebola virus (EBOV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and H17N10 influenza-like virus. The structures of Ptal-N*01:01 display unusual peptide presentation features in that the bat-specific 3\u2013amino acid (aa) insertion enables the tight \u201csurface anchoring\u201d of the P1-Asp in pocket A of bat MHC I. As the classical primary anchoring positions, the B and F pockets of Ptal-N*01:01 also show unconventional conformations, which contribute to unusual peptide motifs and distinct peptide presentation. Notably, the features of bat MHC I may be shared by MHC I from various marsupials. Our study she...","The transmission potential of a novel infection depends on both the inherent transmissibility of a pathogen, and the level of susceptibility in the host population. However, distinguishing between these pathogen- and population-specific properties typically requires detailed serological studies, which are rarely available in the early stages of an outbreak. Using a simple transmission model that incorporates age-stratified social mixing patterns, we present a novel method for characterizing the transmission potential of subcritical infections, which have effective reproduction number R&lt;1, from readily available data on the size of outbreaks. We show that the model can identify the extent to which outbreaks are driven by inherent pathogen transmissibility and pre-existing population immunity, and can generate unbiased estimates of the effective reproduction number. Applying the method to real-life infections, we obtained accurate estimates for the degree of age-specific immunity against...","Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is an emerging infectious viral disease characterized by severe clinical manifestations of the lower respiratory tract. The pathogenesis of SARS is highly complex, with multiple factors leading to severe injury in the lungs and dissemination of the virus to several other organs. The SARS coronavirus targets the epithelial cells of the respiratory tract, resulting in diffuse alveolar damage. Several organs/cell types may be infected in the course of the illness, including mucosal cells of the intestines, tubular epithelial cells of the kidneys, neurons of the brain, and several types of immune cells, and certain organs may suffer from indirect injury. Extensive studies have provided a basic understanding of the pathogenesis of this disease. In this review we describe the most significant pathological features of SARS, explore the etiological factors causing these pathological changes, and discuss the major pathogenetic mechanisms. The latter incl...","The observations that Lymphopenia is common in severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) patients and that peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) could be infected by SARS-CoV indicate that PBMC could be useful in identifying the gene expression profile in convalescent patients and tracing the host response to SARS-CoV infection. In this study, the altered genes expressions in the PBMC of convalescent SARS patients were investigated with suppression subtractive hybridization (SSH). We found that genes encoded by mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) were obviously upregulated, while mitochondria were now found to be closely connected with antiviral immunity. The identification of a viral gene, M, in SSH cDNA library shows the long-term existence of SARS-CoV in vivo. In addition, some oxidative stress sensitive genes, heat shock proteins, transcription factors, and cytokines showed remarkable elevation. Thin-section electron microscope shows increased lysosome-like granule and mitochondria in PBMC...","If COVID-19 containment policies fail and social distancing measures cannot be sustained until vaccines becomes available, the next best approach is to use interventions that reduce mortality and prevent excess infections while allowing low-risk individuals to acquire immunity through natural infection until population level immunity is achieved. In such a situation, allowing some infections to occur in lower-risk groups might lead to an overall greater reduction in mortality than trying to protect everyone equally.","Background The outbreak of COVID-2019 is becoming a global public health emergency. Although its basic clinical features have been reported, the dynamic characteristics of immune system in COVID-2019 patients, especially those critical patients with refractory hypoxemia, are not yet well understood. We aim to describe the dynamic characteristics of immune system in 3 critical patients with refractory hypoxemia, and discuss the relationship between hypoxemia severity and immune cell levels, and the changes of gut microbes of COVID-2019 patient. Methods This is a retrospective study from 3 patients with 2019-nCoV infection admitted to Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, a COVID-2019 designated hospital in Wuhan, from January 31 to February 6, 2020. All patients were diagnosed and classified based on the Diagnosis and Treatment of New Coronavirus Pneumonia (6th edition) published by the National Health Commission of China4. We recorded the epidemiological history, demographic features, c...","ABSTRACTEffective countermeasures against the recent emergence and rapid expansion of the 2019-Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) require the development of data and tools to understand and monitor viral spread and immune responses. However, little information about the targets of immune responses to 2019-nCoV is available. We used the Immune Epitope Database and Analysis Resource (IEDB) resource to catalog available data related to other coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV, which has high sequence similarity to 2019-nCoV, and is the best-characterized coronavirus in terms of epitope responses. We identified multiple specific regions in 2019-nCoV that have high homology to SARS virus. Parallel bionformatic predictions identified a priori potential B and T cell epitopes for 2019-nCoV. The independent identification of the same regions using two approaches reflects the high probability that these regions are targets for immune recognition of 2019-nCoV.ONE SENTENCE SUMMARYWe identified potential...","BACKGROUND: The outcome of a viral infection is regulated by complex interactions of viral and host factors. SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) engages and regulates several innate immune response pathways during infection. We have previously shown that the SARS-CoV Papain-like Protease (PLpro) inhibits type I interferon (IFN) by inhibiting IRF3 phosphorylation thereby blocking downstream Interferon induction. This finding prompted us to identify other potential mechanisms of inhibition of PLpro on IFN induction. METHODS: We have used plasmids expressing PLpro and IRF3 including an IRF3 mutant that is constitutively active, called IRF3(5D). In these experiments we utilize transfections, chromatin immunoprecipitation, Electro-mobility Shift Assays (EMSA) and protein localization to identify where IRF3 and IRF3(5D) are inhibited by PLpro. RESULTS: Here we show that PLpro also inhibits IRF3 activation at a step after phosphorylation and that this inhibition is dependent on the de-ubiquitination ...","Abstract Background The severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus is a member of the Coronaviridae (CoV) family that first appeared in the Guangdong Province of China in 2002 and was recognized as an emerging infectious disease in March 2003. Over 8000 cases and 900 deaths occurred during the epidemic. We report the safety and immunogenicity of a SARS DNA vaccine in a Phase I human study. Methods A single-plasmid DNA vaccine encoding the Spike (S) glycoprotein was evaluated in 10 healthy adults. Nine subjects completed the 3 dose vaccination schedule and were evaluated for vaccine safety and immune responses. Immune response was assessed by intracellular cytokine staining (ICS), ELISpot, ELISA, and neutralization assays. Results The vaccine was well tolerated. SARS-CoV-specific antibody was detected by ELISA in 8 of 10 subjects and neutralizing antibody was detected in all subjects who received 3 doses of vaccine. SARS-CoV-specific CD4+ T-cell responses were detected in all vaccin...","The outbreak of SARS coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which occurred in Wuhan, China in December 2019, has caused a worldwide pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, there is a lack of epidemiological tools to guide effective public policy development. Here we present epidemiological evidence that SARS-CoV-2 S type exited Wuhan or other epicenters in China earlier than L type and conferred partial resistance to the virus on infected populations. Analysis of regional disparities in incidence has revealed that a sharp decline in influenza epidemics is a useful surrogate indicator for the undocumented spread of SARS-CoV-2. The biggest concern in the world is knowing when herd immunity has been achieved and scheduling a time to regain the living activities of each country. This study provides a useful tool to guide the development of local policies to contain the virus.","The 13th ERS Lung Science Conference (LSC) was organised to bring academics together from all over the world to present and discuss the latest developments regarding lung infection and immunity. The conference took place in breathtaking Estoril, Portugal; however, it wasn\u2019t the beautiful surroundings that were our main motivation to attend, but instead the scientific merit of the conference and the chance to create new scientific collaborations. The scientific programme [1] was packed with the most up-to-date content in the field of lung infection and immunity and included some of the top researchers within this exciting area. Moreover, the convenient size of the LSC offered the opportunity to renew and intensify friendships and collaborations. In particular, for researchers at the start of their career, this is a great feature and we therefore warmly recommend the LSC to ERS Juniors Members!","Animal coronaviruses, such as infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), and arteriviruses, such as porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), are able to manifest highly contagious infections in their specific native hosts, thereby arising in critical economic damage to animal industries. This review discusses recent progress in studies of virus-host interactions during animal and human coronavirus and arterivirus infections, with emphasis on IBV-host cell interactions. These interactions may be directly involved in viral replication or lead to the alteration of certain signaling pathways, such as cell stress response and innate immunity, to facilitate viral replication and pathogenesis.","On the basis of a semi-realistic SIR microsimulation for Germany and Poland, we show that the R0 parameter interval for which the COVID-19 epidemic stays overcritical but below the capacity limit of the health care system to reach herd immunity is so narrow that a successful implementation of this strategy is likely to fail. Our microsimulation is based on official census data and involves household composition and age distribution as the main population structure variables. Outside household contacts are characterised by an out-reproduction number R* which is the only free parameter of the model. For a subcritical domain we compute the time till extinction and prevalence as a function of the initial number of infected individuals and R*. For the Polish city of Wroclaw we also discuss the combined impact of testing coverage and contact reduction. For both countries we estimate R* for disease progression until 20th of March 2020.","We study a novel multi-strain SIR epidemic model with selective immunity by vaccination. A newer strain is made to emerge in the population when a preexisting strain has reached equilibrium. We assume that this newer strain does not exhibit cross-immunity with the original strain, hence those who are vaccinated and recovered from the original strain become susceptible to the newer strain. Recent events involving the COVID-19 virus demonstrates that it is possible for a viral strain to emerge from a population at a time when the influenza virus, a well-known virus with a vaccine readily available for some of its strains, is active in a population. We solved for four different equilibrium points and investigated the conditions for existence and local stability. The reproduction number was also determined for the epidemiological model and found to be consistent with the local stability condition for the disease-free equilibrium.","Abstract Objectives were to determine effects of lactation and pregnancy on endometrial gene expression on d 17 of the estrous cycle and pregnancy. Heifers (n=33) were assigned randomly after parturition to lactating (L, n=17) or nonlactating (NL, n=16) groups. Cows were subjected to an ovulation synchronization program for a timed artificial insemination (TAI); 10 cows in L and 12 in NL were inseminated. Slaughter occurred 17 d after the day equivalent to TAI, and intercaruncular endometrial tissues were collected. Gene expression was determined by DNA microarray analysis for pregnant (L, n=8; NL, n=6) and noninseminated cyclic (L, n=7; NL, n=4) cows. Differentially expressed genes were selected with a P-value &lt;0.01 and absolute expression &gt;40. In addition, a fold effect &gt;1.5 was used as a criterion for genes affected by pregnancy. In total, 210 genes were differentially regulated by lactation (136 downregulated and 74 upregulated), and 702 genes were differentially regulated by pregn...","Abstract A double-inactivated, candidate whole virus vaccine against severe acute respiratory syndrome associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) was developed and manufactured at large scale using fermenter cultures of serum protein free Vero cells. A two step inactivation procedure involving sequential formaldehyde and U.V. inactivation was utilised in order to ensure an extremely high safety margin with respect to residual infectivity. The immunogenicity of this double-inactivated vaccine was characterised in the mouse model. Mice that were immunised twice with the candidate SARS-CoV vaccine developed high antibody titres against the SARS-CoV spike protein and high levels of neutralising antibodies. The use of the adjuvant Al(OH)3 had only a minor effect on the immunogenicity of the vaccine. In addition, cell mediated immunity as measured by interferon-\u03b3 and interleukin-4 stimulation, was elicited by vaccination. Moreover, the vaccine confers protective immunity as demonstrated by prevention...","Abstract The causative agent of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) has been identified as a new type of coronavirus, SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV). CD8 T cells play an important role in controlling diseases caused by other coronaviruses and in mediating vaccine-induced protective immunity in corresponding animal models. The spike protein, a main surface antigen of SARS-CoV, is one of the most important antigen candidates for vaccine design. Overlapping peptides were used to identify major histocompatibility complex class I-restricted epitopes in mice immunized with vectors encoding codon-optimized SARS-CoV spike protein. CD8 T-cell responses were mapped to two H-2b-restricted epitopes (S436\u2013443 and S525\u2013532) and one H-2d-restricted epitope (S366\u2013374). The identification of these epitopes will facilitate the evaluation of vaccine strategies in murine models of SARS-CoV infection. Furthermore, codon and promoter optimizations can greatly enhance the overall immunogenicity ...","We probe how genetic variability across the three major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I genes (human leukocyte antigen [HLA] A, B, and C) may affect susceptibility to and severity of severe acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus responsible for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). We execute a comprehensive in silico analysis of viral peptide-MHC class I binding affinity across all known HLA -A, -B, and -C genotypes for all SARS-CoV-2 peptides. We further explore the potential for cross-protective immunity conferred by prior exposure to four common human coronaviruses. The SARS-CoV-2 proteome is successfully sampled and presented by a diversity of HLA alleles. However, we found that HLA-B*46:01 had the fewest predicted binding peptides for SARS-CoV-2, suggesting individuals with this allele may be particularly vulnerable to COVID-19, as they were previously shown to be for SARS (1). Conversely, we found that HLA-B*15:03 showed the greatest capacity to present hig...","Sepsis, acute lung injury, and ARDS contribute substantially to the expanding burden of critical illness within our ICUs. Each of these processes is characterized by a myriad of injurious events, including apoptosis, microvascular dysfunction, abnormal coagulation, and dysregulated host immunity. Only recently have platelets\u2014long considered merely effectors of thrombosis\u2014been implicated in inflammatory conditions and the pathobiology of these disease processes. A growing body of evidence suggests a prominent role for maladaptive platelet activation and aggregation during sepsis and ARDS and has begun to underscore the pluripotential influence of platelets on outcomes in critical illness. Not only do platelets enhance vascular injury through thrombotic mechanisms but also appear to help orchestrate pathologic immune responses and are pivotal players in facilitating leukocyte recruitment to vulnerable tissue. These events contribute to the organ damage and poor patient outcomes that stil..."],"title":["Priming with SARS CoV S DNA and boosting with SARS CoV S epitopes specific for CD4+ and CD8+ T cells

Type I IFNs are key mediators in innate immunity to viral infections and also provide a connection between the innate and adaptive arms of the immune response (Takaoka and Yanai, 2006) . Likewise, the sole type II IFN, IFN-\u2425, is a critical contributor to adaptive immunity, especially in T helper 1 (Th1)type responses (Malmgaard, 2004) and can potentiate type I IFN antiviral activity (Takaoka and Yanai, 2006) . We contend that IFNs and IFN-stimulated chemokines, such as CXCL10, are induced during acute SARS infection in severe and non-severe patients as part of a robust innate immune response (Fig. 2) . IFN responses may function as expected during inflammatory responses to SARS CoV infection in the majority of SARS patients who recover. Nevertheless, unregulated expression of IFNs and IFN-stimulated chemokines, e.g. CXCL10 and CCL2, in severe SARS patients as the illness progresses may lead to widespread immune dysregulation and serious pathogenic events (Fig. 2) . The self-sustaining expression of proinflammatory chemokines during late SARS in susceptible patients may be a compensatory mechanism to the incapacity to mount an effective adaptive immune response to clear the virus. Those patients who ultimately succumb to SARS behave as a differentiated group; not only clinically but also from an immunological point of view. The term severe acute respiratory syndrome may Fig. 2 . Model of immunopathological events associated with SARS clinical evolution. SARS patients mount robust IFN-mediated innate immune responses during early (acute) illness and peak symptomology. Following the median SO 2 nadir in surviving patients (late SARS), most SARS patients resolve inflammation and mount effective adaptive immunity against SARS CoV. Immune dysregulation in severe SARS patients is hallmarked by continued expression of inflammatory chemokines and ISGs and deficiencies in MHC and Ig gene expression. Immune-mediated pathology worsens in the minority of susceptible SARS patients and unresolved CXCL10 expression and viral burden is associated with poor outcome. therefore best describe a subgroup of particularly at-risk patients characterized by persistent induction of CXCL10 and CCL2 along with evidence of deficient adaptive immunity, more extensive thoracic involvement and a more severe compromise of respiratory indicators.","The panel of cytokines (Th1 cytokines interferon c (IFNc), tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-a, interleukin (IL)-2 and IL-12; Th2 cytokines IL-4, IL-6 and IL-10) reflects the overall balance within the immune system; chemokines function briefly in inflammatory processes, acting as regulatory bridge molecules between innate and acquired immunity. The complement system is an important component of innate immunity and major anti-viral effectors. Besides the soluble mediators mentioned above, lymphocytes, especially T and B lymphocytes, play a central role in specific anti-viral immunity for clearing the virus. We thus decided to define the immune response profile, focusing mainly on cytokine/ chemokine balance and lymphocyte subtypes to give an overview of the immune spectrum against SARS-CoV. Therefore, we characterized systemically the spectrum of immune and inflammatory responses in 95 SARS-infected healthcare workers. Our results indicate that SARS-CoV seem to elicit effective humoral immunity but inhibit cellular immunity. An imbalance of Th2 over Th1 immunity, i.e. prolonged overproduction of IL-10 and transforming growth factor b (TGF-b), may play an important role in the disease. These observations are hypothesized to create an imbalance in immune function that could be associated with SARS pathogenesis, through direct destruction of lymphocytes by SARS or indirectly through impairment of cellular immunity by SARS-induced humoral mediators.","As we breathe, we sample an estimated 10 L of air per minute (Kohlmeier and Woodland, 2009 ). The mucosa of our respiratory system is, therefore, in direct and continual contact with the environment and, as such, is highly exposed to microorganisms, some of which may be pathogenic. Respiratory infections are among the leading causes of acute illness and mortality worldwide, being responsible for nearly 4 million deaths annually, the majority of which occur in infants and children in developing countries (Girard et al., 2005) . The main viruses responsible for acute respiratory infection include respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza virus, human parainfluenza virus (HPIV), human metapneumovirus (HMPV), human rhinovirus (HRV), coronaviruses, and adenoviruses. However, despite the public health importance of these infections, licensed vaccines are currently available only for influenza viruses. Protective immunity against respiratory virus infection is a complex interplay between systemic and mucosal responses. However, immune responses generated during a natural infection may not provide complete protection from reinfection and may actually contribute to the pathogenesis of disease (reviewed in Sections Pathogenesis and Immune Responses to Respiratory Virus Infection). Vaccine-induced immune responses must, therefore, aim to be more protective and less pathogenic than those induced naturally. In addition, our understanding of the relative contribution of mucosal and systemic immunity to protection remains incomplete. For example, it is well known that inactivated vaccines against influenza given intramuscularly (i.m.) are protective owing to the induction of systemic humoral immunity in the absence of a robust mucosal immune response, and current guidelines for vaccine licensure require influenza vaccines to induce systemic immune responses. However, it is also evident that some intranasal vaccines are protective owing to the induction of mucosal immunity, despite less impressive systemic immune responses (reviewed in Section Respiratory Virus Vaccines). Unfortunately, standardized methods of measuring mucosal immune responses are lacking, and reliable correlates of protection for vaccines that protect through mucosal immunity have not been identified. In this chapter, we review the main viral pathogens of the respiratory tract, the immune responses they induce, current vaccines, and vaccines that are in development to control them.","In this chapter, we review how the immune response to viral infection is regulated, and how the effector arms of the response mature over the course of infection and beyond. The complexity of the antiviral immune response is great, and requires that we be selective in the topics that we discuss. Consequently, we focus almost entirely on the adaptive (antigen-specific) immune response, and refer only briefly to innate immunity; our discussion of adaptive immunity, although covering both antibodies and T cells, favors T cells. Our overall intent is to describe the adaptive immune response, focusing on both quantitative and qualitative changes that occur over the course of a viral infection.","Available immunologic mechanisms are by recent convention broadly categorized as either innate, or adaptive. Innate immune responses are nonspecific, relying on host recognition of \"pathogen-associated molecular patterns,\" such as peptidoglycans, endotoxin, or fungal mannans. Such foreign patterns are recognized, and ligated, either by soluble bioactive substances within the airway (defensins, collectins) or by pattern recognition receptors on macrophages. Subsequent generation of \"early response cytokines\" (tumor necrosis factor, interleukin [IL]-1) and chemotaxins (leukotrienes, chemokines, split components of complement) leads to recruitment of additional cellular elements of innate immunity, granulocytes and natural killer cells. By means of concurrent cytokine networking with other cells in the alveolar milieu (including epithelia and fibroblasts), alveolar macrophages activate antigen-presenting cells, and lymphocytes move into the alveolar compartment; recruitment of the specialized lymphocytes, T cells and B cells, heralds the onset of the adaptive immune response. These cells manifest specific receptors somatically generated in response to specific antigens, facilitating immunologic \"memory\" and long-term cell-mediated and humoral immunity. Adaptive immunity thus initiates a targeted response aimed at containment and clearance of a specific antigen, allowing titration of nonspecific, and potentially host injurious, alveolar inflammation. Because of the anatomic location of elements of pulmonary innate immunity, these responses typically precede those of adaptive immunity. However, complex","Specific steps in virus-host interaction, such as the route of entry and pathway of spread, also can strongly influence viral tropism. For example, encephalitis viruses such as VEE are transmitted to humans by insect bites. These viruses undergo local primary replication and immune system detects pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), which are fundamental structural components of microbial products including nucleic acids, carbohydrates, and lipids. 234 Viral PAMPs in the form of single-stranded (ss)RNA, dsRNA, and DNA evoke the innate immune response through two groups of PRRs: the transmembrane Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and the cytosolic nucleic acid sensors. The latter include retinoic acid inducible gene-I (RIG-I)like receptors, nucleotide-binding domain and leucine-rich-repeat containing proteins (NLRs) such as NLRP, and DNA sensors. 235 Nucleic acid binding by PRRs activates signaling pathways leading to the production and extracellular release of IFN-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b2, and proinflammatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2 and IL-18. IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b2 engage the cell surface IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 receptor and thereby mediate expression of hundreds of gene products that corporately suppress viral replication and establish an intracellular antiviral state in neighboring uninfected cells. Well-described IFN-inducible gene products include the latent enzymes dsRNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR) and 2\u2032,5\u2032-oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS), both of which are activated by dsRNA. 236 PKR inhibits the initiation of protein synthesis through phosphorylation of translation initiation factor eIF2\u03b1. The 2\u2032,5\u2032oligoandenylates generated by OAS bind and activate endoribonuclease RNAse L, which degrades viral mRNA. In addition to mediating an intracellular antiviral state, IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 also stimulates the antigenindependent destruction of virus-infected cells by a specialized population of lymphocytes known as natural killer (NK) cells. 237 Importantly, IFNs bridge innate and adaptive antiviral immune responses through multiple modes of action, which include enhancing viral antigen presentation by class I MHC proteins, 238 promoting the proliferation of MHC class I-restricted CD8 + CTLs, 239 and facilitating the functional maturation of dendritic cells. 240 Proinflammatory mediators IL-1\u03b2 and IL-18 pleiotropically stimulate and amplify the innate immune response through induction of other inflammatory mediators, immune cell activation, and migration of inflammatory cells into sites of infection. 241 These molecules perform essential functions in host antiviral defense. 242 The adaptive immune response confers systemic and enduring pathogen-selective immunity through expansion and functional differentiation of viral antigen-specific T and B lymphocytes. Having both regulatory and effector roles, T lymphocytes are centrally positioned in the scheme of adaptive immunity. The primary cell type involved in the resolution of acute viral infection is the CD8 + CTL, which induces lethal proapoptotic signaling in virus-infected cells upon recognition of endogenously produced viral protein fragments presented by cell surface MHC class I molecules. Less frequently, CD4 + T cells, which recognize MHC class II-associated viral oligopeptides processed from exogenously acquired proteins, also demonstrate cytotoxicity against viral antigen-presenting cells. 243 The usual function of CD4 + T lymphocytes is to orchestrate and balance cell-mediated (CTL) and humoral (B lymphocyte) responses to infection. Classes of CD4 + helper T-cell subsets-Th1, Th2, Th17, Treg (regulatory T), and Tfh (follicular helper T)-have been defined based on characteristic patterns of cytokine secretion and effector activities. 244, 245 Th1 and Th2 lymphocytes are usually associated with the development of cell-mediated and humoral responses, respectively, to viral infection. Th17 and Treg CD4 + subsets are important for control of immune responses and prevention of autoimmunity, but their precise roles in viral disease and antiviral immunity are not clear. For certain persistent viral infections, such as those caused by HIV and HSV, Treg cells might exacerbate disease through suppression of CTLs or, paradoxically, ameliorate illness by attenuating immune-mediated cell and tissue injury. 246 Tfh cells promote differentiation of antigen-specific memory B lymphocytes and plasma cells within germinal centers. 247 Therefore, Tfh cells likely occupy a central place in the humoral response to viral infection and vaccination. Although Tfh cell functions are not unique to antiviral responses, chronic viral infections including HBV and HIV appear to stimulate proliferation of these cells. 248, 249 The Tfh phenotype may interconvert with other T-helper lineage profiles and thus represent a differentiation intermediate rather than a unique CD4 + T lymphocyte subset. 245 The primacy of cell-mediated immune responses in combating viral infections is revealed by the extreme vulnerability of individuals to Often, the linkage of a virus to a particular neoplasm can be attributed to transforming properties of the virus itself. For example, EBV encodes several latency-associated proteins that are responsible for immortalization of B cells; these proteins likely play crucial roles in the pathogenesis of EBV-associated malignancies. 220 Similarly, HPV encodes the E6 and E7 proteins that block apoptosis [112] [113] [114] and induce cell cycle progression, 110, 111 respectively. It is hypothesized that unregulated expression of these proteins induced by the aberrant integration of the HPV genome into host DNA is responsible for malignant transformation. 221 The tumorigenicity of polyomaviruses, which are oncogenic in rodent species, is mediated by a family of viral proteins known as tumor (T) antigens. Reminiscent of the HPV E6 and E7 proteins, T antigens induce cell cycling and block the ensuing cellular apoptotic response to unscheduled cell division. 222 The normally episomal polyomavirus genome becomes integrated into cellular DNA during neoplastic transformation of nonpermissive cells unable to support the entire viral replication program, which would otherwise culminate in cell death. Discovery of a human polyomavirus clonally integrated into cells of an aggressive form of skin cancer, Merkel cell carcinoma, 2 substantiates the long-standing suspicion that polyomaviruses can also promote neoplasia in humans.","In this report, DNA vaccination has been used to induce cellular and humoral immunity to the SARS-CoV S glycoprotein. The humoral immune response includes the generation of neutralizing antibodies. This humoral immunity alone can inhibit pulmonary viral replication in a murine challenge model and suggests that DNA vaccination with the SARS-CoV S glycoprotein gene results in protective immunity. The SARS-CoV is a novel coronavirus, but vaccines for other human coronaviruses have not been successfully developed14. But considerable experience in developing vaccines against common veterinary coronaviruses has been obtained with animal coronaviruses11,12. The feline infectious peritonitis virus is a coronavirus that causes significant morbidity and mortality in domestic animals for which vaccines have been investigated, but the development of these vaccines has been complicated by possible immune potentiation of the disease and by viral evolution19. In the present study, T-cell depletion and immune IgG passive transfer were used to assess the importance of humoral responses in protection against SARS-CoV challenge. These results suggest that antibodies against SARS-CoV S glycoprotein protect against SARS-CoV challenge and do not enhance infection in this animal model. The cellular immune response appears to play a limited role in protection, although studies of animal coronaviruses have suggested that both cellular and humoral immunity contribute to protection during persistent infection13,14.","This novel virus decoy cellular vaccine is designed to initiate NK cell-driven immune activation with the ultimate goal of inducing protective adaptive host immunity. NK cell-induced I-cell death should result in cytokine release, recruitment of antigen presenting cells (APCs), and maturation of elicited dendritic cells (DCs) at the site of vaccination. Presentation of SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein-derived peptides by recruited APCs will drive adaptive host immune responses against SARS-CoV-2. Interleukin 12 secreted from mature DCs in combination with NK-secreted GM-CSF and interferon-\uf067 (IFN\uf067\uf029 can combine to recruit T lymphocytes and may induce Th1 cell polarization, thereby inducing development of a potent cytotoxic T cell response and clearance of SARS-CoV-2-infected cells. Confirmation of Th1 polarization vs. a mixed Th1/Th2 or predominantly Th2 response is currently underway in preclinical immunization models. Previous efforts to develop respiratory virus vaccines to protect against Respiratory Syncytial J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Virus (RSV) and SARS-related disease have demonstrated the potential clinical benefits of eliciting a Th1 adaptive immune response over the disease-exacerbating effects of a Th2 polarized response (3, 4) . Immunization studies in mice with four candidate SARS vaccines (VLP, whole virus, and an rDNAproduced Spike protein) led to pulmonary immunopathology upon challenge with SARS virus, an effect that was signified by Th2 polarization in mice immunized with each candidate vaccine (4). The decoy cell vaccine can drive the host cellular immune response toward Th1, generating both potent cytotoxic T cell immunity against the major determinant of SARS-CoV-2 cellular entry and pathogenesis (Figure 2 ). Utilizing pathogen-derived cellular immunogens (virus-encoded antigens) as initiators of NK-mediated immune responses might provide an exciting method to produce novel vaccine candidates. It is important to highlight the flexibility of the decoy cell vaccination strategy as additional cell vaccines can be generated in an expeditious manner once new antigens of interest have been identified. Thus, successful demonstration of the efficacy of this current anti-SARS-CoV-2 approach in clinical trials would pave the way for use of the decoy cell platform to address a large number of unmet medical needs in the clinic as we seek to protect populations from viral, parasitic, fungal and bacterial diseases.","Exogenous mRNA is immunostimulatory, as it is recognized by a variety of cell surface, endosomal and cytosolic innate immune receptors. Mammalian cells can sense foreign RNA via PRRs such as TLR3, TLR7 and TLR8 located in the endosomes and RIG-I, MDA-5 and PKR located in the cytoplasm as well as NLRP3 and NOD2 (164). Activation of the PRRs by mRNA vaccines results in a robust innate immune response including production of chemokines and cytokines such as IL-12 and TNF at the inoculation site (165), which are innate factors crucial for the induction of an effective adaptive immune response against the encoded antigen. ID immunization with mRNA vaccines upregulates the expression of chemokines including the CXCR3-ligands CXCL9, CXCL10, and CXCL11, that recruit innate immune cells such as DCs and macrophages, to the site of injection (165). Kowalczyk et al. showed that the in the skin, protamine-formulated non-replicating sequence optimized mRNA vaccines are taken up by both non-leukocytic and leukocytic cells, the latter being mostly represented by APCs (150). mRNA was then transported to the draining lymph nodes (dLNs) by migratory dendritic cells. Moreover, the encoded protein was expressed and efficiently presented by APCs within the dLNs as shown by T cell proliferation and immune cell activation, followed by the induction of the adaptive immunity. Importantly, the immunostimulation was limited to the injection site and lymphoid organs as no proinflammatory cytokines were detected in the serum of the immunized mice. Lazzaro et al. demonstrated that CD8+ T-cell priming is restricted to bone-marrow-derived APCs and may involve antigen transfer from myocytes suggesting cross-priming as the prevalent mechanism upon IM injection of self-amplifying mRNA vaccines in mice (166). In a recent publication, Lutz et al. provided first mechanistic insights into the mode of action of LNP-formulated non-replicating sequence optimized mRNA vaccines, demonstrating a strong activation of the innate immune response at the injection site and in the dLNs in mice. IM injection of LNP-formulated mRNA vaccine resulted in spontaneous uptake of the mRNA by cells surrounding the injection site and strong expression inside transiently transfected cells, including resident professional APCs, neutrophils and non-leukocytic cells (141). Interestingly, similar observations were published using LNP-formulated non-replicating mRNA vaccines containing modified nucleotides which induced rapid and local infiltration of neutrophils, monocytes, and DCs to the site of administration and the dLNs in injected NHPs (167). While these cells efficiently internalized LNPs, mainly monocytes and DCs translated the mRNA and up-regulated key co-stimulatory receptors (CD80 and CD86). This coincided with upregulation of type I IFN-inducible genes, including Mx1 and CXCL10. The innate immune activation was transient and resulted in priming of antigen-specific CD4+ T cells exclusively in the vaccine-draining LNs. The data demonstrate that mRNA-based vaccines induce type-I IFN-polarized innate immunity and, when combined with antigen production by APCs, lead to generation of potent vaccine-specific responses. Professional APCs, with DCs likely being the most relevant cell type for mRNA vaccines, play a critical role in antigen processing and presentation to elicit an immune response against specific antigens. The transfected DCs express the mRNA-encoded antigen in the native form. Expressed proteins are subsequently processed into antigenic peptides and are presented on MHC class I and MHC class II molecules along with co-stimulatory signals to CD8+ and CD4+ T cells, respectively. Antigen expressed in the correctly folded native form can be recognized by B cells that in response produce antibodies against the antigen. A study in NHPs investigating the immunological events leading to antibody responses elicited by a modified non-replicating mRNA encoding influenza A H10 HA encapsulated in LNPs showed that, while both ID and IM administration induced titers considered to be protective, ID delivery generated this response more rapidly (168). Circulating influenza H10-specific memory B cells expanded after each of the two immunizations, along with a transient appearance of plasmablasts. The memory B cell pool waned over time but remained detectable throughout the 25-week study. Following immunization, H10-specific plasma cells (PCs) were detected in the bone marrow and persisted throughout the 25 week observation period with a more profound decline detected in IM group compared to the ID group by the end of the study. Germinal centers were formed in vaccine-draining lymph nodes along with an increase in circulating H10-specific ICOS+ PD-1+ CXCR3+ T follicular helper cells, a population shown to correlate with high avidity antibody responses after seasonal influenza vaccination in humans. In addition, a non-replicating sequence optimized mRNA vaccine induced long-lived functional antibody responses against HA of influenza A H1N1pdm in NHPs which persisted for one year (141). These results indicate that non-replicating mRNA vaccines potently induce an immunological repertoire associated with the generation of high magnitude long-lived antibodies.","PLGA microspheres and nanoparticles have been explored as delivery systems for mucosal vaccine development of protein antigens. PLGA microparticles containing OVA elicit sustained OVA-specific humoral and mucosal immunity in cattle after intranasal administration (Kavanagh et al., 2003), and in mice after oral delivery especially when immunostimulant MPLA is co-encapsulated (Sarti et al., 2011). Multiple oral vaccinations of OVA encapsulated in PLGA particles can stimulate CTL immune response in mice, although not as efficient as the formulation of OVA with ISCOMs (Maloy et al., 1994). Mansoor et al. reported that PLGA particles encapsulating bovine parainfluenza virus type-3 (BPI3V) peptides or proteins induced an early, gradually increasing humoral immune responses via intranasal delivery, suggesting the advantage of slow and prolonged release of antigens in particulate systems compared to those in the soluble form (Mansoor et al., 2014). Two peptide antigens of bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV) co-encapsulated in PLGA microparticles induced both mucosal immune response in upper and lower respiratory tract and T-cell mediated immune response in mice after a single-dose intranasal administration, which is not observed with soluble antigens (Kavanagh et al., 2013). Peptide antigens of malaria carried with PLGA microparticles induced stronger systemic immune response compared to those absorbed to alum either orally or subcutaneously administered in mice, and meanwhile the Th1-mediated cellular immune response was only observed in the previous formulation (Carcaboso et al., 2003). In another study, recombinant envelope protein E2 of classical swine fever virus (CSFV-E2) as the antigen was encapsulated in PLGA microspheres, with rabbit serum albumin as the protein stabilizer, for the mucosal and systemic vaccine development (Brandhonneur et al., 2009). Immunization tests were realized in rabbits through three routes (intranasal, oral and intramuscular) followed by an intradermal boost. The response after intranasal administration was found to be more stable and intense than that with the oral route.","Humoral immunity is one of the immune responses for defense against viral infection. Hence, investigation of human immune responses to the pathogens will provide us important information about the mechanism of how the pathogens interact with their hosts. To understand the humoral immunity to the SARS-CoV, Li et al. [8] studied the profile of specific IgG and IgM antibodies in SARS patient sera by indirect ELISA. They found that specific IgG antibodies were present in all tested convalescent patient sera and persisted for a long time (until week 12), but specific IgM antibodies remained measurable for a much shorter period, suggesting that IgG antibodies to the SARS-CoV may represent the primary humoral immune response protecting patients against SARS. Although several articles have been published on the antibody response against the structural proteins of SARS-CoV and their contribution to protective immunity [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] , more extensive study on the profile of specific antibodies to individual proteins of the SARS-CoV remains to be uncovered, and it could help us not only to understand the humoral immunity but also to develop specific diagnostic tools and vaccine.","During a viral infection, most cell types in the body respond by secreting high levels of type 1 interferons (IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b2) [11]. IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 can directly induce antiviral activities in neighboring cells, preventing viral spread by increasing the resistance of uninfected cells toward the virus. Moreover, these IFNs can activate Natural Killer (NK) cells mediated cytotoxity toward virus-infected cells [11,12], and there is accumulating evidence that IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 contribute to driving the adaptive-immune response in the T helper cell type 1 (Th1) direction, via stimulation of IFN-\u03b3 expression [12]. NK cells can produce IFN-\u03b3 [13], which activates leukocytes, such as monocytes/macrophages, that, in turn, participate in the antiviral responses by producing free radicals and proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF-\u03b1 [13]. During the response to viral infections, a key role is played by the expansion and activation of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, which are central to the antiviral immunity, including their capability to inhibit replication and clear the infection. CD8+ cells have a direct effector role through cytotoxic T lymphocyte mediated lysis, and cytokine and chemokine production [14]. The role of CD4+ T cells in antiviral immunity is highly dependent on production of cytokines, notably IFN-\u03b3 [15], and the cytolytic activity exerted by a subset of CD4+ T cells [16]. Activation, coordination, and regulation of the above-described antiviral responses are mediated by complex mechanisms, where cytokines play important roles. However, to our surprise, we found that the patients' response of SARS appears to be mainly an innate inflammatory response, rather than a specific immune response against a viral infection. There is no significant level of up-regulation of MHC-I genes, neither for major cytokines including IFNs, nor for genes involved in complement mediated cytolysis, suggesting that the immune response against SARS-CoV may be different from other viral infections.","HRSV replicates in respiratory epithelia, reaching high titers in nasal secretions and causing virus shedding for up to 3 weeks after the end of symptoms. Cell-to-cell spread leads to involvement of the entire respiratory tree by HRSV, reaching bronchioles 1-3 days after the onset of symptoms, inducing necrosis of ciliated cells, syncytia formation, peribronchiolar inflammation with abundant lymphocytes and macrophages, and impairment of secretion clearance, resulting in small airway obstruction and lung hyperinflation typical of bronchiolitis. HRSV pneumonia with interstitial mononuclear infiltrate, eosinophilic cytoplasmic inclusions in epithelial cells, and multinucleated giant cells, frequently coexist with bronchiolitis. HRSV disease is particularly severe in young babies, whose immature airways are unable to compensate for the virus-induced damage. Naturally acquired immunity to RSV is incomplete and short-lived, but disease severity is reduced on reinfections. Secretory IgA correlates better with protection than serum antibody level and patient age, and preexisting HRSV-specific maternal antibodies influence the development of disease. Cell-mediated immune response is central to recovery from infection, and immunosuppressed patients are at risk of severe HRSV disease and fatal outcome. The type of immune response to HRSV is a major factor in the development of wheezing and asthma exacerbations. A deviation toward Th2 cytokine response is associated with more severe disease, whereas a Th1 response leads to effective viral clearance and milder illness. A preexisting Th1 deficiency may be associated with severe disease in some children, which may be a marker of predisposition to wheezing and asthma later in life. The HRSV G protein, which is produced both as membrane-anchored and as soluble forms, is a type II glycoprotein with two highly variable extracellular mucin-like domains separated by a cysteine-rich, much conserved central region that inhibits innate immunity and modulates cytokine production. HRSV infection of epithelial cells triggers the release of Th1 cytokines  (IFN-, IL-2, IL-12), Th2 cytokines (IL-4, IL-5, IL-6,  IL-10) , IFN-, IFN-, and chemokines that amplify the immune response and inflammatory reaction.","SARS virus uses multiple mechanisms to inhibit the host type 1 interferon response with open reading frame (ORF) 3b, ORF 6, and nucleocapsid proteins all playing a major role; nucleocapsid protein inhibits the synthesis of interferon while ORF 3b and ORF 6 proteins inhibit both interferon synthesis and signaling. 29 In addition, ORF 6 protein inhibits nuclear translocation of STAT1. The importance of STAT1 to protection is demonstrated by STAT1 knockout (STAT1 \u2212/\u2212 ) mice being unable to clear SARS virus infection, resulting in increased virus lethality. 30 Furthermore, STAT1 \u2212/\u2212 mice infected with SARS virus had evidence of T cell and macrophage dysregulation with increased alternatively activated macrophages and a Th2-biased immune response. As STAT6 is essential for development of alternatively activated macrophage, the importance of alternatively activated macrophages to SARS pathology was able to be demonstrated using STAT1/STAT6 double-knockout mice, which exhibited reduced lung disease in response to SARS virus challenge. 31 On the host side, CD8 T cells are responsible for virus clearance and adoptive transfer of immune splenocytes or SARS-specific T cells reduced lung virus titers and enhanced survival. 32 The importance of Th1-cellular immunity to viral control may help explain the many mechanisms that SARS virus has developed to subvert Th1-cellular responses. By suppressing Th1 responses, the SARS virus may thereby impart an unbalanced Th2 bias to the antiviral lung immune response, which could amplify and exaggerate any preexisting Th2 bias already imparted by immunization with a Th-2 biased SARS vaccine. This thereby provides a plausible explanation for the vaccine-exacerbated lung eosinophilic pathology observed in recipients of alum-adjuvanted or unadjuvanted inactivated whole virus and recombinant S protein vaccines. This is supported by data from a ferret SARS virus reinfection model where reinfected animals or ferrets previously immunized with an alum-adjuvanted inactivated vaccine candidate failed to mount an effective type 1 interferon response. 33 In mice, SARS-associated lung pathology was shown to be prevented by pretreatment of alveolar macrophages with poly(I:C), a TLR3 agonist, which may reflect its ability to prime for a strong type 1 interferon response. 34 Hence the aberrant host immune response causing SARS-associated lung immunopathology is complex, with roles played by alternatively activated macrophages, neutrophils, NFkB activation, lack of a type 1 interferon response, and excess IL-I\u03b2, IL-6, and TNF production due to inflammasome activation by the SARS envelope protein-encoded ion channel. 31, [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] ","Host immune response is essential for the clearance of coronavirus infection, and the balance between coronavirus and host immunity is key to viral pathogenesis and will ultimately determine infection outcome 1 . Coronaviruses encode numerous viral gene products to evade and suppress host immune response, such as SARS-associated coronavirus nonstructural protein 1, which is able to inhibit host interferon-dependent antiviral signaling 2 , as well as another SARS coronavirus protein named open reading frame-9b, which can suppress mitochondria of immune cells 3 . Coronavirus suppressing host immunity has been demonstrated, however, the alterations of immune system in patients with COVID-2019 are not yet well understood.","The exact reason for why children are less severely affected is still unclear. One possible explanation is related to children's immature immune system. Their adaptive immunity is less developed to mount an inflammatory response during immune dysregulation phase induced by viral infection. 23 Relatively stronger humoral responses in children may also contribute to this phenomenon. Innate immunity is able to react more rapidly in response to pathogen invasion than adaptive immunity. author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.","The immune response to different pathological invasions in the human body is mediated by two arms; innate and acquired immunity. Innate immunity is the first arm of immune response to viral infections. The antiviral response is triggered upon the sensing of the different viral antigens by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) of the infected cell [1] .","DNA vaccines have been used to elicit protective humoral and cellular immunity against SARS-CoV in a mouse model . A gene-based vaccine has also been tested, boosted by inactivated virus to broaden the immune response Talaat and Stemke-Hale, 2005) . A combination of nucleocapsid DNA vaccine against SARS-CoV with N protein has been shown to be required to generate antibody and a CD8+ response, and the presence of adjuvant determined whether humoral or cellular immunity is elicited (Azizi et al., 2005) . Immunization with plasmid DNA carrying various S fragments have been shown by scientists at Hong Kong University to elicit antibodies in some mice, with the S1 fragment promoting a Th1-mediated antibody isotype switching. Both anti-S1 and anti-S2 antibodies were required for virus neutralization (Zeng et al., 2004a) . One study of an experimental DNA vaccine against SARS-CoV showed that N alone was sufficient to induce antibody and CTL responses in mice . In another study, N sequences linked to those specifying calreticulin (enhances antigen presentation to CD8+ T-cells) was efficacious in inducing N-specific humoral and cellular immune responses and in reducing the viral titer in mice challenged with N-expressing vaccinia virus . In mice immunized with plasmids, S, N, and M DNA vaccines were all able to elicit immune responses, with S and M eliciting more potent humoral and cellular immune responses, respectively (Wang et al., 2005c) .","Adults with COVID-19 usually showed a significant or progressive decrease in the absolute number of peripheral blood lymphocytes at the early stage of the disease. T lymphocyte subsets showed a decrease in both CD4 \u00fe and CD8 \u00fe T cell subsets, and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio is an early and reliable indicator for the development of severe COVID-19, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 can consume lymphocytes, which may also be an important reason for the virus to proliferate and spread in the early stage of the disease. 13 Severe cases in adults usually progress 7e10 days after the onset of disease, likely due to rapid virus replication, inflammatory cell infiltration, and an increased proinflammatory cytokine and chemokine response, leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), a fatal acute lung injury. 13 In children, however, white blood cell count and absolute lymphocyte count were mostly normal, and no lymphocyte depletion occurred, suggesting less immune dysfunction after the SARS-CoV-2 infection. 7e11 On the other hand, the mild disease in children may be related to trained immunity. Trained immunity, as a new immune model, refers to the use of certain vaccines such as Bacille Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin (BCG) to train innate immunity to generate immune memory. 14 BCG has been proved to provide nonspecific protection of mice against influenza virus infection probably by the induction of trained immunity. 14 Most, if not all, of the infants received regular immunizations, including BCG, in China and other Asian countries, and it is well known that influenza can cause more ARDS in the adults, yet very less in children.","Adults with COVID-19 usually showed a significant or progressive decrease in the absolute number of peripheral blood lymphocytes at the early stage of the disease.

Clearance of natural infections has been associated with antibodies directed against the FCoV S protein. 36 Conversely, antibodies directed against the S protein can be detrimental. In cats with pre-existing antibodies, 'antibodydependent enhancement' has been observed experimentally, resulting in a shortened disease course and earlier death. This enhancement was observed irrespective of whether cats had acquired antibodies through passive or active immunisation. [37] [38] [39] However, pre-existing antibody is not a precondition; in field studies cats developed FIP on first exposure to FCoV. 2, 40 Clinical signs","The plasmids encoding these modified S glycoproteins were analysed for their ability to elicit antiviral immunity after intramuscular injection in BALB/c mice. Injection of S, S\u0394TM and S\u0394CD expression vectors induced a substantial immune response. A marked increase was observed in the number of SARS-CoV S-specific CD4 T-cell immune responses (Fig. 2a), as measured by intracellular cytokine staining for interferon-\u03b3 (IFN-\u03b3) and tumour necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1). In addition, substantial SARS-CoV S-specific CD8 cellular immunity was detected at levels at least sevenfold above the background response. Humoral immunity was initially assessed using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) with lectin-captured S\u0394TM protein expressed in 293T cells (see Methods). Substantial end-point dilution antibody titres were observed in all groups, ranging from \u223c1:400 to \u223c1:2,000 (Fig. 2b, left panel).","Cell-mediated immune response represents an important defense mechanism against virus infection, which involved cytotoxic T lymphocyte activity or T cell-derived antiviral cytokines and so on (Altfeld et al., 2001; Eckels et al., 2000) . There is evident malfunction of cell immunity in SARS patients, which may be one of the important causative factors for this disease (Li et al., 2003) . Therefore, to enhance specific cellular immune response by vaccine administration is likely to accelerate the clearance of the virus and represents a potential alternative therapeutic method against SARS. As an internal protein of SARS-CoV, N protein is more conserved than surface protein such as S or M proteins, which makes it an ideal candidate for inclusion in a broadly protective vaccine for induction of cellular immune response. It was reported that vaccination with adenovirus vector expressing N protein of MHV could protect a significant fraction of mice against a lethal infection, which indicates that the N protein can generate a protective immune response (Wasmoen et al., 1995; Wesseling et al., 1993) . Splenic lymphocytes derived from plasmid pCI-N inoculated mice stimulated with recombinant N protein in vitro demonstrated significant proliferative responses, whereas the mice failed to respond to a control antigen transferrin.","The immune system is the key defense line for the body to resist and eliminate the virus. In the antiviral immune response, cellular immunity (including T cells and NK cells) plays a central role, while humoral immunity plays a coordinating role. The underlined mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 inflicted harmful effects leading to severe condition or death in COVID-19 patients is the over response against the virus by immune system and large amount of cytokines production (cytokine storm) [13] .

In some settings, antibodies and T cells contribute to exacerbation of the pathology although the mechanism by which this occurs is not well understood, and the role of CD8 versus humoral responses is hotly debated. In coronavirus infections such as MHV and BoCV (Bovine Coronavirus, also Group 2), T cells are critical to protection against illness. Both CD4 and CD8 T cells (T helper and cytotoxic T cells or CTL, respectively) are involved [23, 24] . T cell immunity is also required for protection against porcine endemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) [25] , and both humoral and cell-mediated immunity are involved in the immune response to turkey coronavirus infection (TCoV) [26] . Infectious bronchitis virus is a devastating disease for chicken producers and has been the focus of many vaccine studies.

Thus, immune responses may be termed nonantigen-specific or antigen-specific. As the name indicates, nonantigen-specific responses do not rely on recognition of specific antigenic motifs; these responses are broad-based and include phagocytes, natural killer cells, type I interferons, and ''barrier'' defenses, such as skin, lysozyme, and gastric acid. Their actions are exerted very early in the course of combating an infection, and they do not require any form of antigenic ''instruction''; consequently, they are termed innate immune responses. In contrast, the antigen-specific immune system can learn from experience and thus is termed adaptive immunity Upon first encounter with any given antigen, the antigenspecific responses will be somewhat slow to develop, usually becoming detectable only after the innate responses have approached their peak; however-and in contrast to the innate responses-upon second exposure to the same agent, the antigen-specific responses are greatly improved, both in quantity and quality. These enhanced antigen-specific secondary immune responses-termed anamnestic (from the Greek word for recall)-originate from memory cells that are specific for the antigens previously encountered and that are the cornerstone of all antiviral vaccines. Both the innate and adaptive immune responses play key roles in controlling a viral infection, and it is becoming increasingly clear that these responses are not, as previously supposed, separate and are instead inextricably linked; however, our goal in this chapter is to cover the adaptive response, and we shall provide no further description of the innate immune system herein.","Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is caused by SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) [1, 2] . It is known that human coronaviruses usually infect the upper respiratory tract and cause the common cold [3] , whereas SARS-CoV infects the lower respiratory tract, leading to pulmonary destruction [4] . Although antibody induction and lymphopenic responses to SARS-CoV have been briefly described elsewhere [5] , the precise immune and inflammatory responses following SARS-CoV infection remain unclear. Moreover, the rapidly reported results by other authors deal merely with one or two aspects of anti-viral immunity, i.e. either antibody induction, changes in T lymphocytes or alteration of cytokines. The initial studies showed that not only lung but also immune cells were targets of SARS-CoV [4] . What then, is the overall immune spectrum of SARS: the profile of humoral and cellular immunity and their importance in SARS; whether cytokines and chemokines play a role in pathogenesis of SARS; the status of immune memory function of lymphocytes in SARS? It is particularly important to explore a full, informative description of the immune response and pathogenesis in SARS. This will greatly help us in understanding the pathogenic mechanisms, as well as improving patient management and developing a vaccine to completely control SARS epidemics.","Health care workers and HBV \u25a0 Health care workers should always follow routine cross-infection control procedures, barrier precautions and procedures to safely handle needles and other sharps \u25a0 All health care workers who perform exposure-prone procedures -including independent contractors such as GPs and dentists working outside the hospital setting, and all medical, dental, nursing and midwifery students -should be immunised against hepatitis B, unless immunity to hepatitis B as a result of natural infection or previous immunisation has been documented. Their response to the vaccine should subsequently be checked. \u25a0 Staff whose work involves exposure-prone procedures and who fail to respond to the vaccine should be permitted to continue in their work, provided that they are not HBeAg positive. Newer vaccines are also being developed with the aim of improving response rates. \u25a0 Health care workers who are HBeAg positive should not perform exposure-prone procedures in which injury to the worker could result in blood contaminating the patient's open tissues \u25a0 Health care workers who are HBsAg positive but who are not HBeAg positive need not be barred from any area of work unless they have been associated with transmission of hepatitis B to patients whilst HBeAg negative \u25a0 Health Authorities and Trusts should ensure that members of staff employed or taking up employment, or other health care workers contracted to provide a service which involves carrying out exposure-prone procedures, are immunised against the hepatitis B virus, that their antibody response is checked and that carriers of the virus who are HBeAg positive do not undertake such procedures \u25a0 The response to vaccine should be checked 2-4 months after completion of the primary course. An anti-HBs level of 100 mIU/mL is considered to reflect an adequate response to the vaccine and to confer protective immunity. In the absence of natural immunity, levels of anti-HBs between 10 and 100 mIU/mL indicate a response to the vaccine but one that may not necessarily confer long-lasting immunity and which may require boosting. The specificity of levels of anti-HBs below 10mIU/mL cannot be assured and such levels cannot be considered as evidence of a response to the vaccine. If there is a delay in checking the response, a booster dose should be given before anti-HBs titres are measured as levels of antibody gradually fall after immunisation.","In general, the host immune system includes all physiologic mechanisms with the capacity to recognize materials foreign to itself and to neutralize, eliminate, or metabolize them with or without injury to its own tissues. 102 The immune response may be classified into two categories: specific and nonspecific. Specific immune responses depend on exposure to a foreign configuration, such as an infectious agent, and the subsequent recognition of and reaction to that agent. An example of this type of response is the development of humoral and cellmediated immunity related to a specific agent. A nonspecific response occurs after initial and subsequent exposure to a foreign antigen; although it is selective in differentiating \"self \" from \"nonself, \" it is not dependent on selective recognition. A number of factors modify the host's immune mechanisms, including genetic, age, metabolic, environmental, anatomic, physiologic, and microbial factors.","Several knock-out mice have been used to better understand the impact of the adaptive immune response on influenza virus infection. B-cell function has been tested using MT, J H , and C K knockouts, while CD8 and MHC class II knockouts have been used to understand the role of CD4 and CD8\u2423 and \u24242M knockouts have been used to understand the role of CD8 T cell. From studies with these knockouts, deficit in any component of the adaptive immune system results in enhanced susceptibility to infection, delayed virus clearance, and increased pulmonary inflammation and injury following influenza infection. Recovery from infection can be mediated by the remaining adaptive immune response in conjunction with the ongoing innate immune response. Ex-periments with these mice suggest that resistance to repeat infection and hetero-subtypic immunity is mediated in part by B cells.","Serological and pathological data from the SARS-CoV epidemic suggests that the innate immune response plays a crucial role in the control of SARS-CoV infection but the molecular mechanisms of innate immune activation, protection from severe disease, and the contribution of the innate response to immune pathology remain unknown [5],[9],[10],[38]. MyD88 is a key signaling adaptor protein for most all TLRs, IL-1R1, IL-18R1, and IFN\u03b3-R1 [14]. Contrary to previous virological studies [16]\u2013[19],[21],[39], we have demonstrated MyD88 plays a crucial role in protection from SARS-CoV infection independent of Type I (\u03b1/\u03b2) and III (IL-28/29 or interferon lambda) interferon, and the adaptive immune response. Though MyD88 mediated proinflammatory signaling has been implicated in the protection from numerous bacteria and parasitic infections, few in vivo studies have implicated MyD88 in protection from viral diseases [16]\u2013[19], [21], [40]\u2013[44]. Intranasal infection of MyD88-deficient mice with RSV or VSV produces more severe disease that was correlated with a failure to recruit immune cells to the sites of infection [17],[18]. For RSV, MyD88-dependent induction of type I interferon correlated with the recruitment of eosinophils to the lung and efficient virus clearance [17]. In contrast, MyD88-dependent protection from lethal VSV infection occurred independent of type I interferon, correlated with the recruitment of monocytes to the site of infection and was dependent on IL-1R1 signaling [18]. In the C57BL/6 mouse model of SARS-CoV pathogenesis reported here, we demonstrate MyD88-mediated protection from SARS-CoV infection in the absence of detectable induction of type I interferon. Furthermore, infection of IFN\u03b1/\u03b2 receptor deficient mice with rMA15 results in moderate weight loss and complete recovery with kinetics that is indistinguishable from those of WT mice (personal communication, Frieman and Baric, manuscript in preparation). Unlike RSV and VSV, we found that WT C57BL/6 mice are protected from lethal SARS-CoV infection by a MyD88-dependent mechanism that does not involve adaptive immunity, the induction of type I/III interferon, or IL1-R/IL-18R signaling (data not shown) suggesting that SARS-CoV is interfacing with the innate immune system in a potentially novel manner.","The expression of the immune response necessarily involves a certain amount of inflammation, cell infiltration, lymph node swelling, even tissue destruction, as described in Ch. 6. Such changes caused by the immune response are classed as immunopathological. Sometimes they are very severe, leading to serious disease or death, but at other times they play a minimal part in the pathogenesis of disease. With the possible exception of certain vertically transmitted virus infections and the transmissible 'prion' dementias (see Ch. 10), there are signs of an immune response in all infections. Therefore it is to be expected that there will nearly always be some contribution of the immune response to pathological changes.* Often the immunological contribution is small, but sometimes it forms a major part of the disease. For instance, in tuberculosis the pathological picture is dominated by the operation of a strong and persistent cell-mediated immunity (CMI) response to the invading bacillus. In the classical tubercle a central zone of bacilli with large mononuclear and giant cells, often with some necrosis, is surrounded by fibroblasts and lymphocytes. Mononuclear infiltrations, giant cells and granulomatous lesions (see p. 322) are characteristic pathological features of tuberculosis. When macrophages are killed by intracellular mycobacteria the lysosomal enzymes and other materials released from the degenerating cell contribute to chronic inflammation as in the case of the streptococcal lesions referred to above. There are no recognised toxins formed by tubercle bacilli, and there seems to be no single antigen or other component that accounts for virulence. Bacterial glycolipids (e.g. 'cord factor'), resistance to H202 (see pp. 91-92) and ability to utilise host Fe (see p. 387) have been correlated with pathogenicity, and inhibition of phagosome-lysosome fusion in macrophages (see p. 106) by release of unidentified bacterial components would also contribute to pathogenicity. However, none of these factors is by itself absolutely necessary for virulence, which in such a complex, ancient parasite is likely to be multifactorial. Now that the genome of M. tuberculosis has been completely sequenced, there will be opportunities for clearer definition of virulence determinants. The mere enlargement of lymphoid organs during infectious diseases is a morphological change that can often be regarded as pathological. The lymph node swelling seen in glandular fever, for instance, is an immunopathological feature of the disease, and the same can be said of the striking enlargement of the spleen caused by chronic malaria and other infections in the condition known as tropical splenomegaly.","Moreover, IL-2 is known to promote a Th1-type response and may be most useful as a vaccine adjuvant in diseases where cell-mediated immunity plays an important role in protection against pathogens (Chow et al. 1998). Published data show that the N gene plays an important role in cellular immune response of SARS-CoV infection (Kim et al. 2004; Zhao et al. 2005; Zhu et al. 2004). In this study, the antigen-specific cellular immune response of T lymphocytes, and the ELISPOT assay have been employed to assess the frequency of cytokine producing cells and the kind of T cell produced in cultures of lymphocytes isolated from co-immunized mice. Our results show that immunization with pcDNA-N plus pcDNA-IL2 elicited significant levels of T-cell responses, and the response was higher than that in the pcDNA-N alone group. ELISPOT and the FACS data further confirmed this result. Using the ELISPOT assay, we measured the number of antigen-specific T-cells per million splenocytes and found that pcDNA-IL2 significantly increased the stimulated function of Th1 (as reflected by an increased release of IFN-\u03b3) and of Th2 cells (as reflected by a increased release of IL-4). There was higher level of IFN-\u03b3 production compared to IL-4 (Fig. 4), suggesting that vaccine combination induced a Th1-dominated immune response. This finding is consistent with the ability of combined vaccines to activate CD4+ and CD+ 8 T cells, with a strong CD8+ and a mild CD4+ cell increase. Thus, the present results indicate that synergistic action of IL-2 results in a strong activation of SARS-CoV N-specific Th1 lymphocytes, witnessed by a high IFN-\u03b3 production. This might be sufficient for viral clearance in animals and humans with SARS-CoV infection.","The immunological effect of epitope-based peptides was studied. The lymphocyte proliferation assay showed the four epitope-based peptides stimulated the immune system. Secretion of IL-4 (a B cell growth and differentiation factor) might reflect the state of activation and proliferation of B cells and transition to antibody-producing plasma cells. The increase was dramatically greater in the number of IL-4-producing cells than in the number of IFN-\u03b3-producing cells after immunization with these epitope-based peptides, confirming that humoral immunity was predominant. So, the epitopes we selected are real B cell epitopes. The specific antibody induced by the four epitopes persisted at least 6 weeks, which was confirmed by monitoring IgG titer. Although specific IgG could be detected after primary immunization, persistent high titer IgG required revaccination. It indicated the involvement of humoral immune memory. Within 1 week after revaccination, B cell numbers peaked, which indirectly proved that antigen-specific memory B cells could be induced by these epitope peptides. It suggested that Lymphocytes were from the mice immunized with the four different peptides on 14 days, 21 days, and 35 days after primary immunization (n = 5). Results are means \u00b1 SD. a P value &lt; 0.01 compared with the control group. b P value &lt; 0.05 compared with the control group. Fig. 6 . Three-color flow cytometric analysis of surface markers (CD44 and CD62L) expression on CD4 + T cells isolated from the spleens of immune mice before (on day 0) and after (on days 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5) the third immunization with MAP1-4. Gates were set on the CD4 + T cells. The experiment was repeated three times with the same overall results. The values within each box indicate the relative cell number. these epitopes were potential for development of SARS vaccine. MAP2 and MAP4 induced rapid increase in the number of IL-4-producing cells to enhance the humoral immune indicated their potential uses for emergent prophylaxis of SARS; MAP1 and MAP3 induced relatively slow but persistent increase in that to enhance humoral immune indicated their potential uses for long-term prophylaxis of SARS. Since activated Th (CD4 + T) cells are also needed for effective humoral immunity, Th cells will be activated rapidly with the help of immune memory. In the mice, CD62L (Bradley et al., 1992; Yin et al., 1991) and CD44 (Budd et al., 1987; Butterfield et al., 1989 ) are used to distinguish naive from memory cells, and naive from activated T cells (Gerberick et al., 1997) . In our study, in epitope-based peptide-immunized mice, the classical phenotype of immunologic memory (CD44 high , and L-selectin low ) was present on the surface of CD4 + T lymphocytes just before the third immunization (day 0), suggesting that these epitope-based peptides could enhance the CD4 + T memory cell response and thereby increase immune surveillance, defense, and capacity to carry out their auxiliary functions when specific antigen reappeared.","Risk factors that have been associated with disease (or infection) include weakened immune systems and chronic diseases, such as diabetes, cancer, and chronic lung disease, as well as co-infections (5, 20, 25). Although these comorbidities clearly affect the status of the immune response, acute immunosuppression using drugs, as we have done here, provides a more controlled deficit in immune responses, whereas immune dysregulation brought on by chronic disease, infection, and aging is a complex phenomenon that involves deficiencies in the immune response, chronic inflammatory responses, and other known and yet to be described complex changes. For instance, the majority of patients had diabetes as a comorbidity and several others were immunosuppressed with HIV/AIDS. Both of these conditions alter the immune response in a way that both inhibits normal T cell functions, as well as inducing an inflammatory response by altering Th17 responses and secretion of inflammatory cytokines (26\u201330). The immunosuppression in our study mimics some aspects of the human condition in these patients, such as inhibition of CD4+ T cell responses by HIV-infected patients. However, the chemical immunosuppression used herein is unlikely to mimic the chronic inflammatory state in many of these patients. This higher basal level of immune activation associated with these conditions may be important contributions to the manifestation of the clinically overt serious disease following MERS-CoV infection, and would imply that the immune system plays a role in the pathogenesis of MERS-CoV. This agrees with our observation that upon simple immunosuppression, MERS-CoV replicated to higher levels and showed greater dissemination and shedding, while the pathology was actually reduced in these animals. Pathology was likely lessened due to the absence of inflammatory cells and mediators, as observed histologically in the lung tissues. This suggests that the virus itself might cause little damage to the cells that it infects and this would lead toward a mechanism in which the absence of an efficient immune response allows the virus to replicate to high levels, whereas pathology can be attributed to the overactive inflammatory response, which patients with comorbidities are prone to possess. This is supported by data in the resus and marmoset animal models, which show that increased viral replication and the local immune response to this plays an important role in the pulmonary severity of disease (31). Although not performed in this study, a control group treated with immunosuppressive drugs, and not challenged, would be necessary for a comprehensive picture of the immune status of these animals at the time of necropsy.","In the present study, we used two adjuvants: aluminum hydroxide, commonly known as alum, and CpG ODN 1826. Alum is the most extensively used adjuvant in commercial vaccines and acts mainly by stimulating Th2-type immune responses [22] . The mechanisms by which alum produces its adjuvant effect include formation of an antigen depot and activation of antigen-presenting cells [23] . In contrast, CpG ODNs bind to the TLR9 receptor and preferentially induce Th1-biased immune responses [24, 25] . Several reports have shown that co-administration of alum with CpG ODN and antigen enhanced the effect of CpG ODN and stimulated both Th1-and Th2-type immune responses [26, 27] . The mechanism for this effect has not been investigated. Our data indicate that CpG ODN 1826 stimulates a Th1-type immune response as evidenced by the increased serum IgG2a titers (Fig. 2B) and INF-\u2425 secretion (Fig. 4) . As for the magnitude of the antibody response, we detected increased total serum SARS-CoV IgG titers after the first injection with CpG ODN, compared to alum adjuvant alone; however, after the second injection the titers were similar ( Fig. 2A and C) . These results suggest that CpG ODN 1826 may only enhance the primary antibody response against the S318-510 antigen or that the level of immunity had reached maximal levels such that further boosting was not possible.","The copyright holder for this preprint . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.30.20047597 doi: medRxiv preprint range 1.9 million. Hospitals are in most cases overloaded ( m &gt; 0.03 in 53% of runs). Representative examples for the simulated courses of the pandemic in this case are shown in Fig. 4 . In some cases, where the policy response is particularly inefficient, herd immunity is achieved (Fig. 4a) , although this rests on the model assumption that immunity is persistent and strong after recovery, something which is not currently known (see Prompetchara et al. 2020 for a review of current knowledge of immune responses to SARS-CoV-2). This herd immunity can lead to removal of all or most NPI after the outbreak. In other cases, case numbers remain high for a long time (Fig. 4d ). There can be long time periods without new policy interventions (Figs. 4b, d) but also scenarios with more frequent interventions. Figure 4 : Representative examples of course of pandemic with policy responses and declining compliance (policy revision rate p=1/6), simulations differ only by choice of random seed. With a relatively slow policy response, herd immunity is unintentionally achieved (a), but other types of scenarios can arise with this parameterization as well (b-d) . Final cumulative mortality is 6.8% in panel (a) (overshooting the graph), 0.8% in (b), 0.18% in (c), and 0.13% in (d) .","The immune response to viral infection involves complex interactions among leukocytes, nonhematopoietic cells, signaling proteins, soluble proinflammatory mediators, antigen-presenting molecules, and antibodies. These cells and molecules collaborate in a highly regulated fashion to limit viral replication and dissemination through recognition of broadly conserved molecular signatures, followed by virusspecific adaptive responses that further control infection and establish antigen-selective immunologic memory. The innate antiviral response is a local, transient, antigen-independent perimeter defense strategically focused at the site of virus incursion into an organ or tissue. Mediated by ancient families of membrane-associated and cytosolic molecules known as pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), the innate agents, enter their hosts by transgression of a mucosal barrier, frequently undergoing primary replication in mucosal epithelium or adjacent lymphoid tissues. Neutralizing IgA exuded onto mucosal epithelial surfaces may protect against primary infection at this portal of viral entry. A classic example is gut mucosal immunity induced by orally administered Sabin poliovirus vaccine containing live-attenuated virus. Secretory IgA against poliovirus blocks infection at the site of primary replication and consequently interrupts the chain of viral transmission, although fully virulent revertant viruses arise at regular frequency in vaccine recipients, who may develop disease and also transmit revertant strains to nonimmune individuals. 255 Clinical and experimental studies of immunity to HIV have led to the recognition that resident immune responses at exposed mucosal surfaces are likely critical components of host resistance to primary HIV infection, and achievement of potent mucosal immunity has emerged as an important consideration for the design of candidate HIV vaccines. 256 Despite the appearance of serum neutralizing antibodies to HIV several weeks after infection, viral eradication is thwarted by selection of neutralization-resistant variant strains from a mutant pool, which is perpetually replenished because of extreme plasticity within neutralization determinants on the viral envelope glycoproteins. 257 Identification of epitopes bound by broadly neutralizing antiviral antibodies has provided potential new targets for structure-based vaccine design. 258 Protection against viral infection by serum immunoglobulins is often correlated with antibody-mediated neutralization of viral infectivity in cultured cells. Antibodies interrupt the viral life cycle at early steps, which may include cross-linking virion particles into noninfectious aggregates, steric hindrance of receptor engagement, and interference with viral disassembly. 259 It is presumed that virus neutralization in cell culture by human serum is reflective of antibody activity in the intact host, but the mechanistic basis of infection blockade and disease prevention by antibodies in vivo is difficult to define precisely. For example, exclusively in vivo functions of the humoral antiviral response include Fc-mediated virion phagocytosis 260, 261 and antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC). ADCC responses require effectors from both the innate and adaptive systems, NK cells and antibodies, respectively. 262 The basis of ADCC is Fc\u03b3RIIIa receptor-dependent recognition by NK cells of virus-specific IgG bound to antigens expressed on the surface of infected cells, leading to release of perforin and granzymes from NK cells that eventuate in target cell apoptosis. Neutrophils, lymphocytes, and macrophages also possess Fc receptors and may participate in ADCC.","In addition to humoral immunity, influenza-specific CD8 + cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) are associated with accelerated clearance of virus and recovery from infection. However, the extent to which the cellular immune response is protective against infection is unknown because the recall response is likely to occur after the peak of viral replication (Subbarao et al., 2006) , and cell-mediated immunity induced after vaccination has been less well studied than the humoral response, and the results are variable. Studies have shown that immunization of healthy adults with whole-virus inactivated vaccine resulted in enhanced CTL responses in peripheral blood, whereas immunization with a subunit vaccine resulted in poor CTL responses, the duration of which varied from several months to years (Ennis et al., 1977; McMichael et al., 1981; Powers and Belshe, 1993) . In addition, an increase in IFN-\u03b3-producing T cells was seen in children ages 6 months to 9 years of age who were vaccinated with inactivated vaccine; however, similar responses were not induced in adults (He et al., 2008) . H5N1-specific CD4 + T cells were also detected after a single dose of AS03-adjuvanted inactivated vaccine and was amplified by a second dose of vaccine (Moris et al., 2011) . In addition, numerous studies have found a significant increase in IFN-\u03b3-producing CD4 + and CD8 + T cells after vaccination with LAIV in both adults and children (Basha et al., 2011; Forrest et al., 2008; He et al., 2006a; Hoft et al., 2011; Lanthier et al., 2011) ; however, the role of cellular immune responses in LAIV-mediated protection needs further investigation.","Lymphopenia, neutrophilia, and high NLR are commonly presented and associated with more severe viral infection. 3, 11, 12 Recent data indicated that the NLR was identified as a powerful predictive and prognostic factor for severe COVID-19. 5 Thus, we develop simple combined immune response phenotypes using NLR, an indicator of innate immunity, and IgG, an indicator of acquired immunity. These four immune response phenotypes could be useful to distinguish the severe from the nonsevere cases and predict clinical outcome. We observed more severe cases occurred in NLR hi IgG hi or NLR hi IgG lo phenotypes, with only three dead cases.","Clinically, lymphopenia occurs in many infectious diseases, such as influenza, HIV, hypotosis, and sepsis. Lymphopenia is also commonly observed in MERS patients. The complement inhibiting, decay-accelerating factor (CD55) has been shown to regulate CD8+ T cell immunity to virus infection42. Ward and colleagues43 and Ward44 demonstrated that C5aR plays a crucial role in the development of septic lymphopenia and that targeting C5a to prevent lymphopenia can be considered to restore normal immune responses in lieu of \u201cafter-the-fact\u201d strategies. Chu et al45. demonstrated that MERS-CoV infection induced apoptosis of human primary T lymphocytes involved in the caspase-dependent apoptosis pathway. Our study confirmed that MERS-CoV contributed to apoptosis of splenic cells in vivo, accompanied by severe spleen damage and dysregulated systemic immune response, indicating that T cells play a role in controlling the pathogenesis of MERS-CoV infection. It is possible that regulation of the host immune response by complement improved the status of spleen tissue by decreasing splenic apoptosis and increasing the regeneration of splenic cells, indicating that induction of C5a production by MERS-CoV infection may contribute to the dysregulated immune responses, while blockade of the C5a\u2013C5aR axis may improve outcomes by restoring normal immune responses.","In the acute-phase SARS patients, the serum levels of IL-2 and IFN-c did not change significantly, but levels of TNF-b decreased, and IL-10 and TGF-b levels increased significantly, as shown in Fig. 1 , suggesting that a complex, predominantly Th2-associated pattern was triggered by SARS-CoV infection during the acute-phase. This differs from the results of previous reports, which found a Th1 pattern response [10] [11] [12] . The reason for this difference is unknown. Interestingly, this Th2 pattern was not statistically correlated with administration of steroids, although steroids can inhibit cytokine production. Also, it could not be due to use of ribavirin, because ribavirin switch cytokine response from a Th2 pattern to a Th1 one [13] and there was no evidence of this observed in this study. Thus, the difference may be due to variations in the study population, genetic heterogeneity of the SARS-CoV strains and discrepancies in the applied analytic methods. Previous work has shown that cytoplasmic parasites can directly activate nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-jB) pathway [14] . And another recent report showed that the Fig. 2 . Percentages of CD3+ of total numbers of PBMCs, percentages of CD4+, CD8+ lymphocytes of total numbers of CD3+ T cells, and CD4/CD8 ratios in acute-phase SARS patients. Percentages of T lymphocytes did not change significantly in acute-phase (P all &gt; 0.30, one-way ANOVA), whereas percentages of CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes decreased significantly (*: vs. the control and convalescent groups, P all &lt; 0.001, oneway ANOVA). Alteration in CD4+ T cell percentage correlated statistically with steroid use (correlation coefficient =-0.372, P &lt; 0.001, Spearman's correlation analysis), whereas CD8+ T lymphocytes did not (correlation coefficient =-0.125, P = 0.401, Spearman's correlation analysis). (A, percentages of T lymphocytes in acute patients; B, percentages of CD4+ T lymphocytes in acute-phase patients; C, percentages of CD8+ T lymphocytes in acute-phase patients. *: P &lt; 0.05, one-way ANOVA). The data were collected under the conditions indicated in Section 2.5, Flow cytometry analisis. SARS E2-spike protein contains a superantigen domain (residues 690-1050) that mimics the T-cell receptor a-bV chain protein [15] . Moreover, the entry of SARS-CoV into lymphocytes has been well established [16] . Therefore, we postulate that cytoplasmic SARS-CoVs could possibly activate Th2 cytokine release. It is well-known that Th2 immune response inhibits cellular immunity but facilitates induction of humoral immunity to help clear persistent viral infections [17] . So, this Th2 immune response may benefit the elimination of persistent extracellular coronavirus particles.","Attempts at vaccine development against SARS-CoV are ongoing by a number of organizations using various techniques (see review, (Groneberg et al., 2005) ). DNA vaccines (Kim et al., 2004; Yang et al., 2004; Zhu et al., 2004; Zhao et al., 2005) and viral vectors such as vaccinia virus (Bisht et al., 2004; Weingartl et al., 2004) , parainfluenza virus , adenovirus (Zakhartchouk et al., 2005) and rhabdoviruses (Faber et al., 2005; Kapadia et al., 2005) are used as recombinant vaccines. Yang et al. (2004) showed that viral replication was reduced by more than six orders of magnitude in the lungs of mice vaccinated with these S plasmid DNA expression vectors, and protection was mediated by a humoral but not a T-cell-dependent immune mechanism. Bisht et al. (2004) showed that inoculation of BALB/c mice with a recombinant MVA expressing SARS-CoV S protein elicited serum antibodies to SARS-CoV S protein and protective immunity against SARS-CoV infection. Previous studies demonstrated passive transfer of serum from immunized mice conferred protection against SARS-CoV in the respiratory tract following inoculation with either SARS CoV or recombinant MVA expressing S protein (Bisht et al., 2004; Subbarao et al., 2004) . These results suggest that S protein is a crucial antigen in generating protective immunity. We observed that intranasal or subcutaneous inoculation of BALB/c mice with rDIs expressing S protein (rDIsSARS-S, rDIsSARS-E/M/S or rDIsSARS-E/M/ N/S) produced serum antibodies capable of recognizing the SARS-CoV virion by ELISA, also capable of neutralizing SARS-CoV in vitro. The subcutaneous route appears to elicit stronger immunity than intranasal immunization with respect to the level of anti-SARS-CoV IgG antibody produced. Important finding here is that although the mucosal IgA antibody response was induced only in mice intranasally immunized with rDIsSARS-E/M/N/S, the mice administered with rDIsSARS-E/M/N/S by either route elicited strong protective immunity. Therefore, the protection was achieved in the absence of a mucosal IgA response in mice subcutaneously immunized with rDIsSARS-E/M/N/S. Thus, our results clearly show that mucosal infection might be prevented in the presence of a high level of neutralizing serum IgG antibody. Control mice vaccinated with DIs not expressing envelope proteins were not protected, indicating that the effect was specific for the expressed envelope proteins of SARS-CoV and was not due to enhanced nonspecific immunity.","Previously acquired or newly formed antibody does not appear to be protective; it accelerates the pathogenesis of the disease. The type of immune response formed by the cat may determine resistance or susceptibility and the type of clinical disease manifested. Cell-mediated immunity may be important in resistance to FIPV infection. 20 The lesions of noneffusive FIP suggest that incomplete control of infection is occurring through a partial cell-mediated immune response. 21 Paradoxically, there is preliminary evidence that noneffusive FIP may occur more frequently in cats with heterotypic FECV immunity. 23 Much has yet to be learned about the early pathogenesis of FIP, and it is likely that the sequence of events proposed in this article will change considerably in the future.","More recent studies have demonstrated that these supposedly unique and sequestered antigens are neither unique nor completely sequestered. Antigens identical to some of the lenticular or uveal antigens, for example, are found in nonsequestered tissues elsewhere in the body. Antigens inoculated into anterior c h a m b e r induce a sys-temic humoral and T-cell response, clearly pointing to at least some leakiness in the b l o o d -e y e barrier. A variety of experiments have lead to the suggestion of a carefully regulated system of ocular immunity, termed anterior chamber-associated immune deviation. In this system, intraocular antigens are s o m e h o w processed within the eye before draining from the trabecular m e s h w o r k into systemic circulation. These antigens, on reaching the spleen, initiate a typical humoral immune response but an atypical cell-mediated immune response. Proliferation of cytotoxic and suppressor \u03a4 cells is e n h a n c e d , but those \u03a4 cells committed to the production of cytokines as part of delayed hypersensitivity are suppressed. T h e theoretical result is that when these activated lymphocytes return to the e y e , they are only of the types destined to produce the most localized and specific effects on the offending antigen, with the least nonspecific \" b y s t a n d e r \" injury. As a further safety measure to prevent unnecessarily damaging immune-mediated injury, both uveal tissue and aqueous h u m o r contain cytokines [transforming growth factor \u03b2 (TGF-\u00df) is one] that inhibit activation of \u03a4 lymphocytes.","Recombinant measles viruses are able to induce high levels of both humoral and cellular immune responses against the transgene (33). Importantly, MV is able to infect cells of the immune system, including macrophages and dendritic cells, thus supporting delivery of target antigens directly to antigen-presenting cells (36). T cell-mediated responses to MV are dominated by a CD4+ phenotype, unlike the more CD8+ dominated response to adenoviral vectors, which might be a consideration for vaccine development. Since live attenuated MV is routinely used as a vaccine in child immunization programs in many countries, pre-existing immunity to MV as a viral vector has been raised as a concern. However, studies in mice and macaques showed no impact of previous MV exposure on transgene immunity (29). In agreement with animal studies, a clinical study conducted in the context of a MV vaccine against CHIKV likewise demonstrated that anti-vector immunity did not compromise vaccine efficacy (37).","Mutations in the spike protein have also been reported to be responsible for the change in host cell tropism [12] . The S protein is considered most antigenic and thereby can evoke immune responses and generate neutralizing antibodies that can block the virus attachment to the host cells [13] . Other viral proteins which were explored for vaccine development include N protein, E protein and the NSP16 proteins [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] . Almost all the platforms for vaccine development for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have been investigated including the lifeattenuated ones, recombinant viruses, sub-unit protein vaccines, DNA vaccines, Viral vectorbased vaccines, nanoparticle-based vaccines, etc. which may form the base for the vaccine designing against the newly emerged SARS-CoV-2 [10, 19] . Here we have designed a multiepitope-based vaccine for the SARS-CoV-2 using next generation vaccinology approach where the recently available genome and proteome of the SARS-CoV-2 were maneuvered and a potential vaccine candidate was conceived. Similar strategy was employed previously for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] as well as certain findings are reported for the newly emerged SARS-CoV-2 [26] [27] [28] . While immunoinformatics techniques was utilized by groups to predict the B-cell and cytotoxic T-cell epitopes in the SARS-CoV-2 surface glycoprotein, N protein [27] [28] [29] , others have utilized the information to design epitope-based vaccine based on the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein [26] . Along with the structural proteins, utilizing the non-structural and accessory proteins for the vaccine development can aid in better development of an efficacious vaccine for long term by neutralizing the mutation rate of this RNA virus. In this study, we explored the whole proteome of SARS-CoV-2 to scrutinize the highly conserved antigenic epitopes for the construction of a multi-epitope vaccine candidate that can effectively elicit both humoral and cellular mediated immune response against COVID-19. The constructed vaccine product has high population coverage and along with adaptive immunity, can as well lead to initiation of innate immune response further enhancing the generation of memory immunity.","Vaccination remains the primary strategy for the prevention and control of influenza (Lambert and Fauci, 2010) . As described in Section Immune Responses to Respiratory Virus Infection, after an influenza infection, both cellmediated immunity and systemic and mucosal neutralizing antibodies are produced. Whereas cell-mediated immunity contributes significantly to the clearance of a primary influenza virus infection, and can ameliorate disease caused by reinfection, neutralizing antibodies play an important role in preventing reinfection. The goal of vaccination is to prime the immune response to limit viral replication upon subsequent infection, and inactivated, recombinant hemagglutinin and live attenuated influenza vaccines (LAIVs) are licensed for use, with novel vaccines in varying stages of development. This section focuses on licensed vaccines and the immune responses they elicit, as determined from clinical trial data.","CMV is a member of the herpes virus family and, like other members of this family, is known for causing latent infections [75]. Like other herpes viruses, CMV is an enveloped virus with multiple surface glycoproteins. These glycoproteins are important for viral entry into host cells and are targets for host cell humoral and cell-mediated immunity [75,81]. The cellular protein that serves as the specific receptor for CMV entry has not been identified, but CMV infects cells by a process of endocytosis [37]. Once entry has occurred, CMV alters host immunity through the activation of multiple genes. One important CMV protein prevents cellular HLA-1 molecules from reaching the cell surface, preventing recognition and destruction by CD8+ T lymphocytes [82]. Thus, the CMV genome can remain in infected cells and avoid immune destruction, which accounts for its latency in clinical disease. Eventually, a cellular immune response, driven by high levels of anti-CMV CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, leads to control of the disease [37,82,83]. Antibodies against CMV do not provide significant immunity [83]."],"title":["Human immunopathogenesis of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)","Th2 predominance and CD8+ memory T cell depletion in patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome","Chapter 59 Respiratory Virus Vaccines","The Regulation and Maturation of Antiviral Immune Responses","Chapter 163 Immunology of Human Milk and Host Immunity","134 Biology of Viruses and Viral Diseases","A DNA vaccine induces SARS coronavirus neutralization and protective immunity in mice","Novel decoy cellular vaccine strategy utilizing transgenic antigen-expressing cells as immune presenter and adjuvant in vaccine prototype against SARS-CoV-2 virus","New Vaccine Technologies to Combat Outbreak Situations","Intranasal and oral vaccination with protein-based antigens: advantages, challenges and formulation strategies","Antibody responses to individual proteins of SARS coronavirus and their neutralization activities","Expression profile of immune response genes in patients with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome","Respiratory Viruses","Chapter 3 SARS coronavirus infections of the lower respiratory tract and their prevention","Immunodepletion with Hypoxemia: A Potential High Risk Subtype of Coronavirus Disease 2019","Clinical Characteristics of 74 Children with Coronavirus Disease 2019","Viroporins and inflammasomes: A key to understand virus-induced inflammation","Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV)","SARS-CoV-2 infection in children: Transmission dynamics and clinical characteristics","SARS-CoV-2 infection in children: Transmission dynamics and clinical characteristics","Feline infectious peritonitis.
