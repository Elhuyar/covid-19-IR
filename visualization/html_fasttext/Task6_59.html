This includes advice on the handling of COVID-19 fatalities and a set of considerations for managers faced with the need to plan for adequately responding to a possible surge in fatalities caused by COVID-19.","","Abstract Medicine shortages have been spreading in European countries. In many cases, the unavailability of medicinal products has a substantial impact on the capability of National Healthcare Systems in ensuring the continuity of care. Shortages originate from multifactorial causes. In particular, they can be due to supply-related factors (e.g., manufacturing issues, regulatory issues, logistics, distribution) and demand-related ones (e.g., fluctuating drug demand, parallel market, tendering, price and reimbursement policies). However, some extraordinary geopolitical events (e.g., Brexit) may also affect medicines\u2019 availability. The capability of European Regulatory Authorities and other stakeholders, which are involved in the pharmaceutical distribution chain and the healthcare assistance services, to define suitable problem-solving strategies has been limited for years by the fragmentation of the European regulatory framework, starting from the lack of a univocal definition of a med...","Abstract The aim is to diagnose COVID-19 earlier and to improve its treatment by applying medical technology, the \u201cCOVID-19 Intelligent Diagnosis and Treatment Assistant Program (nCapp)\u201d based on the Internet of Things. Terminal eight functions can be implemented in real-time online communication with the \u201ccloud\u201d through the page selection key. According to existing data, questionnaires, and check results, the diagnosis is automatically generated as confirmed, suspected, or suspicious of 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection. It classifies patients into mild, moderate, severe or critical pneumonia. nCapp can also establish an online COVID-19 real-time update database, and it updates the model of diagnosis in real time based on the latest real-world case data to improve diagnostic accuracy. Additionally, nCapp can guide treatment. Front-line physicians, experts, and managers are linked to perform consultation and prevention. nCapp also contributes to the long-term follow-up of pa...","","Abstract The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) was first diagnosed in Wuhan, China in December 2019 and has now spread throughout the world, being verified by the World Health Organization as a Pandemic on March 11th. This had led to the calling of a national emergency on March 13th in the United States. Many hospitals, healthcare networks, and specifically Departments of Surgery are asking the same questions of how to cope and plan for surge capacity, personnel attrition, novel infrastructure utilization, and resource exhaustion. Herein, we present a tiered plan for surgical department planning based on incident command levels. This includes Acute Care Surgeon deployment (given their critical care training and vertically integrated position in the hospital), recommended infrastructure and transfer utilization, triage principles, and faculty, resident and advanced care practitioner deployment.","On December 31, 2019, Chinese health officials reported a cluster of cases of acute respiratory illness in persons associated with the Hunan seafood and animal market in the city of Wuhan, Hubei Province, in central China. On January 7, 2020, Chinese health officials confirmed that a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) was associated with this initial cluster (1). As of February 4, 2020, a total of 20,471 confirmed cases, including 2,788 (13.6%) with severe illness,* and 425 deaths (2.1%) had been reported by the National Health Commission of China (2). Cases have also been reported in 26 locations outside of mainland China, including documentation of some person-to-person transmission and one death (2). As of February 4, 11 cases had been reported in the United States. On January 30, the World Health Organization (WHO) Director-General declared that the 2019-nCoV outbreak constitutes a Public Health Emergency of International Concern.(\u2020) On January 31, the U.S. Department of Health and Huma...","Middle East respiratory syndrome \u2013 Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) -- is a novel coronavirus that has caused a number of community-acquired cases and health care associated outbreaks in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) as well as sporadic cases in other countries, especially in the Middle East. The evidence to date links MERS-CoV cases with exposure to camels, including camel products or to probable or confirmed human cases of MERS-CoV. It typically presents as an acute respiratory illness and is associated with a 35% mortality rate. Based on available information at this time, the current risk to Canadians for acquiring MERS-CoV infections is considered low. However, the International Health Regulations Committee concerning MERS-CoV has cautioned that the upsurge of cases seen this past spring (2014) may be predictive of an increase in cases related to the Hajj \u2013 an annual pilgrimage to Mecca in Saudi Arabia that took place in early October 2014. Although the overall risk is low...","Estimates suggest that COVID-19 will stress bed capacity, equipment, and health care personnel in U.S. hospitals in ways not previously experienced. How can health systems prepare to care for a large influx of patients with this disease?","Abstract The globe is currently in the midst of a COVID-19 pandemic resulting in significant morbidity and mortality. This pandemic has placed considerable stress on health care resources and providers. This document from the Canadian Association of Interventional Cardiology - Association Canadienne de Cardiologie d'intervention, specifically addresses the implications for the care of patients in the Cardiac Catheterization Laboratory (CCL) in Canada during the COVID-19 pandemic. The key principles of this document are to maintain essential interventional cardiovascular care while minimizing risks of COVID-19 to patients/staff and maintaining the overall healthcare resources. As the COVID-19 pandemic evolves, procedures will be increased or reduced based on the current level of restriction to health care services. While some consistency across the country is desirable, provincial and regional considerations will influence how these recommendations are implemented. We believe the framew...","We integrate the human movement and healthcare resource data to identify cities with high vulnerability towards the 2019-nCoV epidemic with respect to available health resources. The results inform public health responses in multiple ways.","From geographic mapping at different scales to location-based alerting services, geoinformatics plays an important role in the study and control of global outbreaks like severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). This paper reviews several geographic mapping efforts of SARS on the Internet that employ a variety of techniques like choropleth rendering, graduated circles, graduated pie charts, buffering, overlay analysis and animation. The aim of these mapping services is to educate the public (especially travellers to potentially at-risk areas) and assist public health authorities in analysing the spatial and temporal trends and patterns of SARS and in assessing/revising current control measures.","BACKGROUND Person to person spread of COIVD-19 in the UK has now been confirmed. There are limited case series reporting the impact on women affected by coronaviruses (CoV) during pregnancy. In women affected by SARS and MERS, the case fatality rate appeared higher in women affected in pregnancy compared with non-pregnant women. We conducted a rapid, review to guide management of women affected by COVID -19 during pregnancy and developed interim practice guidance with the RCOG and RCPCH to inform maternity and neonatal service planning METHODS Searches were conducted in PubMed and MedRxiv to identify primary case reports, case series, observational studies or randomised-controlled trial describing women affected by coronavirus in pregnancy and on neonates. Data was extracted from relevant papers and the review was drafted with representatives of the RCPCH and RCOG who also provided expert consensus on areas where data were lacking RESULTS From 9964 results on PubMed and 600 on MedRxiv,...","The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is straining healthcare resources worldwide, prompting social distancing measures to reduce transmission intensity. The amount of social distancing needed to curb the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in the context of seasonally varying transmission remains unclear. Using a mathematical model, we assessed that one-time interventions will be insufficient to maintain COVID-19 prevalence within the critical care capacity of the United States. Seasonal variation in transmission will facilitate epidemic control during the summer months but could lead to an intense resurgence in the autumn. Intermittent distancing measures can maintain control of the epidemic, but without other interventions, these measures may be necessary into 2022. Increasing critical care capacity could reduce the duration of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic while ensuring that critically ill patients receive appropriate care.","Public health preparedness requires effective surveillance of and rapid response to infectious disease outbreaks. Inclusion of research activities within the outbreak setting provides important opportunities to maximize limited resources, to enhance gains in scientific knowledge, and ultimately to increase levels of preparedness. With rapid advances in laboratory technologies, banking and analysis of human genomic specimens can be conducted as part of public health investigations, enabling valuable research well into the future.","Abstract As the global COVID-19 pandemic escalates there is a need within radiation oncology to work to support our patients in the best way possible. Measures are required to reduce infection spread between patients and within the workforce. Departments need contingency planning to create capacity and continue essential treatments despite a reduced workforce. The #radonc community held an urgent online journal club in March 2020 to discuss these issues and create some consensus on urgent next steps. There were 121 global contributors. This document summarises these discussions around themes of infection prevention, rationalisation of workload and working practice in the presence of infection","ABSTRACT This consensus document has been drawn up by the Techniques and Transplantation and Nursing areas of the Spanish Society of Pulmonology and Thoracic Surgery (SEPAR) and the Spanish Society of Respiratory Endoscopy (AEER) with the aim of providing information on the safe and effective use of bronchoscopy in patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 infection. Our priority is to ensure the safety of our patients, the health workers caring for them, and the community in general.At this stage in the pandemic, our information on the use of bronchoscopy in patients of this type is based on the experience of hospitals in other countries, and scientific publications are scarce. The objective of this document is to compile these experiences, based on recommendations from official agencies, in a document offering guidance in daily clinical practice.","Models that enable the continent to better allocate scarce resources to better prepare and respond to the COVID-19 epidemic are crucial. The modelling study by Marius Gilbert and colleagues in The Lancet identifies each African country's risk of importation of COVID-19 from China, using data on the volume of air travel from three airports in provinces in China to African countries. Gilbert and colleagues use two indicators to determine the capacity of countries to detect and respond to cases: preparedness, using the WHO International Health Regulations Monitoring and Evaluation Framework; and vulnerability, using the Infectious Disease Vulnerability Index. Based on their analysis, Egypt, Algeria, and South Africa had the highest importation risk, and a moderate to high capacity to respond to outbreaks. Nigeria, Ethiopia, Sudan, Angola, Tanzania, Ghana, and Kenya had moderate risk with variable capacity and high vulnerability. In the model, the risk mainly originates from Guangdong, Fuj...","Summary Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a respiratory tract infection caused by a newly emergent coronavirus, that was first recognized in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. Currently, the World Health Organization (WHO) has defined the infection as a global pandemic and there is a health and social emergency for the management of this new infection. While most people with COVID-19 develop only mild or uncomplicated illness, approximately 14% develop severe disease that requires hospitalization and oxygen support, and 5% require admission to an intensive care unit (1). In severe cases, COVID-19 can be complicated by the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), sepsis and septic shock, and multiorgan failure. This consensus document has been prepared on evidence-informed guidelines developed by a multidisciplinary panel of health care providers from four spanish scientific societies (Spanish Society of Intensive Care Medicine [SEMICYUC], Spanish Society of Pulmonologists [SEPAR],...","An estimated 1.9 million children travel overseas annually. Infectious disease risks associated with international travel are diverse and depend on the destination, planned activities, and baseline medical history. Children have special needs and vulnerabilities that should be addressed when preparing for travel abroad. Children should have a pretravel health assessment that includes recommendations for both routine and special travel-related vaccination; malaria chemoprophylaxis, if indicated; and prevention counseling regarding insect and animal exposures, food and water safety, and avoiding injuries. Special consideration should be given to children with chronic diseases. Families should be given anticipatory guidance for management of potential illnesses and information about the location of medical resources overseas.","During the current COVID-19 pandemic it is imperative to give early warnings to reduce mortality. However, non-specialist such as authorities and the general population face several problems to understand the real thread of this pandemic, and under/overestimation of its risk are a commonplace in the press and social media. Here we define an index, which we call the COVID-19 Burden Index, that relates the capacities of the healthcare system of a given country to treat severe and critical cases. Its value is 0 if there is no extra strain in the healthcare system, and it reaches 1.0 when the collapse is imminent. As of 23 March 2020, we show that Chile, the USA, UK, among other countries, must reduce the rate of infections right now, otherwise, in less than 7 days they could be in a catastrophic situation such as Italy, Spain and Iran.","Since Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) first emerged, the California Department of Public Health has coordinated efforts to identify possible cases in travelers to California, USA, from affected areas. During 2013\u20132014, the department investigated 54 travelers for MERS-CoV; none tested positive, but 32 (62%) of 52 travelers with suspected MERS-CoV had other respiratory viruses.","Abstract At present, the situation of global fight against COVID-19 is serious. WHO (World Health Organization)-China Joint Mission fully confirms the success of \u201cChina's model\u201d against COVID-19 in the report. In fact, one particular power in \u201cChina's model\u201d is acupuncture and moxibustion of traditional Chinese medicine. To better apply \u201cnon-pharmaceutic measures\u201d\u2014the external technique of traditional Chinese medicine, in the article, the main content of Guidance for acupuncture and moxibustion interventions on COVID-19 (Second edition) issued by China Association of Acupuncture\u2013Moxibution is introduced and the discussion is stressed on the selection of moxibustion device and the duration of its exertion.","The recent Ebola and Zika epidemics demonstrate the need for the continuous surveillance, rapid diagnosis and real-time tracking of emerging infectious diseases. Fast, affordable sequencing of pathogen genomes \u2014 now a staple of the public health microbiology laboratory in well-resourced settings \u2014 can affect each of these areas. Coupling genomic diagnostics and epidemiology to innovative digital disease detection platforms raises the possibility of an open, global, digital pathogen surveillance system. When informed by a One Health approach, in which human, animal and environmental health are considered together, such a genomics-based system has profound potential to improve public health in settings lacking robust laboratory capacity. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The online version of this article (doi:10.1038/nrg.2017.88) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.","Abstract The world is currently suffering through a pandemic outbreak of severe respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) known as Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). The United States (US) Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) currently advises medical facilities to \u201creschedule non-urgent outpatient visits as necessary\u201d (1). The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, the United Kingdom National Health Service and several other international agencies covering Asia, North America and most regions of the world have recommended similar \u201csocial distancing\u201d measures(2, 3). The Society of Cardiovascular Computed Tomography (SCCT) offers guidance for cardiac CT (CCT) practitioners to help implement these international recommendations in order to decrease the risk of COVID-19 transmission in their facilities while deciding on the timing of outpatient and inpatient CCT exams. This document also emphasizes SCCT\u2019s commitment to the health and well-being of CCT techn...","Viral infections, such as Ebola, severe acute respiratory syndrome/Middle East respiratory syndrome and West Nile virus have emerged as a serious health threat with no effective therapies. These infections have little commercial potential and are not a high priority for the pharmaceutical industry. However, the academic community has been active in this area for many years. The challenge is how to take this academic virology knowledge into a drug discovery and development domain. One approach is the use of consortia and public\u2013private partnerships \u2013 this article highlights ongoing efforts in the USA. Public funds, such as those from government sources, can support research efforts that do not to appear to have commercial value. The key to success is finding a way to combine the different cultural and operational values and reward systems into a productive collaboration to identify new antivirals.","Fifteen years ago, United Nations world leaders defined millenium development goal 4 (MDG 4): to reduce under-5-year mortality rates by two-thirds by the year 2015. Unfortunately, only 27 of 138 developing countries are expected to achieve MDG 4. The majority of childhood deaths in these settings result from reversible causes, and developing effective pediatric emergency and critical care services could substantially reduce this mortality. The Ebola outbreak highlighted the fragility of health care systems in resource-limited settings and emphasized the urgent need for a paradigm shift in the global approach to healthcare delivery related to critical illness. This review provides an overview of pediatric critical care in resource-limited settings and outlines strategies to address challenges specific to these areas. Implementation of these tools has the potential to move us toward delivery of an adequate standard of critical care for all children globally, and ultimately decrease globa...","","Abstract Covid-19 is a global pandemic that is wreaking havoc with the health and economy of much of human civilization. Electrophysiologists have been impacted personally and professionally by this global catastrophe. In this joint document from representatives of the HRS, ACC and AHA we identify the potential risks of exposure to patients, allied health care staff, industry representatives and hospital administrators. We describe the impact of COVID-19 on cardiac arrhythmias and methods of triage based on acuity and patient comorbidities. We provide guidance for managing invasive and non-invasive electrophysiology procedures, clinic visits and cardiac device interrogations. We discuss resource conservation and the role of tele-medicine in remote patient care along with management strategies for affected patients.","","The number of confirmed COVID-19 cases admitted in hospitals is continuously increasing in the Philippines. Frontline health care workers are faced with imminent risks of getting infected. In this study, we formulate a theoretical model to calculate the risk of being infected in health care facilities considering the following factors: the average number of encounters with a suspected COVID-19 patient per hour; interaction time for each encounter; work shift duration or exposure time; crowd density, which may depend on the amount of space available in a given location; and availability and effectiveness of protective gears and facilities provided for the frontline health care workers. Based on the simulation results, we recommend the following: (i) decrease the rate of patient encounter per frontline health care worker, e.g., maximum of three encounters per hour in a 12-hour work shift duration; (ii) decrease the interaction time between the frontline health care worker and the patient...","Abstract Since December 2019, coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has spread rapidly from Wuhan, Hubei province, to other regions of China. To reduce and prevent cross-over infections in the interventional diagnosis and treatment of tumor patients. The Interventional Oncology Branch of the China Anti-Cancer Association organized specialists to compile the corresponding expert consensus. The consensus summarizes the critical points for COVID-19 prevention, focusing on the management of outpatients, inpatients, and interventional operating room in this particular time.","","Background Transmission of Middle East respiratory syndrome-coronavirus (MERS-CoV) among health care workers (HCWs) and patients has been documented with mortality rate approximating 36%. We propose advanced infection control measures (A-IC) used in conjunction with basic infection control measures (B-IC) help reduce pathogen transmission. B-IC include standard and transmission-based precautions. A-IC are initiatives implemented within our center to enhance effectiveness of B-IC. Objective Study effectiveness of combining B-IC and A-IC to prevent transmission of MERS-CoV to HCWs. Methods A retrospective observational study was undertaken. A-IC measures include administrative support with daily rounds; infection control risk assessment; timely screening, isolation, and specimen analysis; collaboration; epidemic planning; stockpiling; implementation of contingency plans; full personal protective equipment use for advanced airway management; use of a real-time electronic isolation flaggin...","","Covid-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) is a rapidly spreading pandemic in many countries. The total confirmed cases of Covid-19 are exponentially increasing and many countries are fighting Covid-19 with all strategies. However, there is still lacking consensus for effective strategies. Here, I demonstrate the time dependence of the doubling time in the Covid-19 exponential growths. Tracking the time-dependent doubling time tells how well Covid-19 prevention works, giving an index for successful fighting.","Abstract The outbreak of the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has caused more than 100,000 people infected and thousands of deaths. Currently, the number of infections and deaths is still increasing rapidly. COVID-19 seriously threatens human health, production, life, social functioning and international relations. In the fight against COVID-19, Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and big data technologies have played an important role in many aspects, including the rapid aggregation of multi-source big data, rapid visualization of epidemic information, spatial tracking of confirmed cases, prediction of regional transmission, spatial segmentation of the epidemic risk and prevention level, balancing and management of the supply and demand of material resources, and social-emotional guidance and panic elimination, which provided solid spatial information support for decision-making, measures formulation, and effectiveness assessment of COVID-19 prevention and control.

This commentary specifically addresses best ways to protect our hospitals against COVID-19.","Abstract A remarkable collaborative effort coordinated by the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) team at WHO resulted in discovery of the etiologic agent of severe acute respiratory syndrome less than 2 months after the announcement of global alert. The development of a vaccine to prevent SARS should be pursued with the same urgency and cooperative spirit, as SARS is highly lethal and, if not controlled during the first few generations of transmission, is likely to become endemic in regions of the world where health-care infrastructure is underdeveloped and epidemiological control measures are weak. The scientific community already learned many important lessons from HIV vaccine development; these should be heeded. For example, consideration should be given to the development of a vaccine that will protect across regional strains of SARS, as the newly emergent coronavirus SARS-coronavirus (SARS-CoV) is proving to be variable and may be mutating in response to immune pressure. SAR...","","Governments around the world must rapidly mobilize and make difficult policy decisions to mitigate the COVID-19 pandemic. Because deaths have been concentrated at older ages, we highlight the important role of demography, particularly how the age structure of a population may help explain differences in fatality rates across countries and how transmission unfolds. We examine the role of age structure in deaths thus far in Italy and South Korea and illustrate how the pandemic could unfold in populations with similar population sizes but different age structures, showing a dramatically higher burden of mortality in countries with older versus younger populations. This powerful interaction of demography and current age-specific mortality for COVID-19 suggests that social distancing and other policies to slow transmission should consider both the age composition of local and national contexts as well as the social connectedness of older and younger generations. We also call for countries t...","Abstract The geographic spread and rapid increase in the cases of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) caused by a novel coronavirus (MERS-CoV) during the past two months have raised concern about its pandemic potential. Here we call for the rapid development of an effective and safe MERS vaccine to control the spread of MERS-CoV.","Summary Background The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic has spread from China to 25 countries. Local cycles of transmission have already occurred in 12 countries after case importation. In Africa, Egypt has so far confirmed one case. The management and control of COVID-19 importations heavily rely on a country's health capacity. Here we evaluate the preparedness and vulnerability of African countries against their risk of importation of COVID-19. Methods We used data on the volume of air travel departing from airports in the infected provinces in China and directed to Africa to estimate the risk of importation per country. We determined the country's capacity to detect and respond to cases with two indicators: preparedness, using the WHO International Health Regulations Monitoring and Evaluation Framework; and vulnerability, using the Infectious Disease Vulnerability Index. Countries were clustered according to the Chinese regions contributing most to their risk. Find...","Abstract During the first few months of 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic has reached Europe. Health systems all over the world are trying to control the outbreak in the shortest possible time. Exotic disease outbreaks are not uncommon in animal health and randomised surveillance is frequently used as support for decision-making. This editorial discusses the possibilities of practicing One Health, by using methods from animal health to enhance surveillance for COVID-19 to provide an evidence base fort decision-making in communities and countries.","News broke on Feb 27, 2020, that an Italian citizen was Nigeria's first case of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The individual had landed at Lagos airport 2 days earlier on a flight from northern Italy, and had subsequently travelled from Lagos to Ogun State, western Nigeria, where he became ill and was promptly isolated. He is currently being treated for mild symptoms of COVID-19 in a hospital in Lagos. Upon identifying the index case, National Emergency Operations Centres were immediately activated to trace his contacts. By March 9, 2020, 27 suspected cases had been identified across five states (Edo, Lagos, Ogun, Federal Capital Territory, and Kano), of which two were confirmed to be positive (ie, the index case and a contact), with no deaths.1 216 contacts were linked to the index case, 136 of whom are being followed up. Similar to COVID-19, the Ebola epidemic of 2014 was imported through Lagos airport. Within weeks, 19 people were diagnosed with Ebola across two states of Nig..."],"title":["Labor and Delivery Guidance for COVID-19","Evacuation of quarantine-qualified nationals from Wuhan for

As long as the capacity of the Canadian health care system allows, clinicians and policy makers must attempt to maintain essential coronary and structural interventional procedures while minimizing additional burdens on hospital and system resources during the COVID-19 pandemic. The operational challenges are evolving rapidly; therefore, this guidance must be interpreted with flexibility and pragmatism. While some consistency across the country is desirable, provincial and regional considerations will influence how these recommendations are implemented. In collaboration with all 11 Affiliates, CCS 3 and Canadian Association of Interventional Cardiology -Association Canadienne de Cardiologie d'intervention (CAIC-ACCI: https://caic-acci.org.) have already issued guidance for inpatient and ambulatory cardiovascular care in Canada. In this manuscript, we provide guidance on the management of coronary and structural procedures in the CCL as the COVID-19 pandemic escalates and eventually abates.","In less than four months, the outbreak has rapidly escalated from a World Health In the midst of this chaotic pandemic, the health care systems and its providers are endangered. In particular, front-line health care workers -emergency medicine physicians, intensivists, anesthesiologists, nurses, and many others -have continued to care for massive surges of COVID-19 patients in the setting of health systems illprepared for the level of disease severity with dangerous, worldwide shortages of personal protective equipment (PPE) and protocols that might attenuate health worker risk overwhelmed. Over 9,000 health care workers have developed infection internationally including 3,400 in China and over 6, 200 in Italy, as well as hundreds of infections in United States personnel. 4 During this time of a global health emergency, rapid communication, international collaboration, and transparency are critical to better inform and adapt the guidance of precautionary measures when new evidence becomes available. Countries around the world have responded in different ways in managing risk to ophthalmologists and patients in the absence of signs or symptoms of COVID-19. Preparedness through risk mitigation strategies for the public, patient and providers are warranted and should be informed by available evidence and our collective, global experience. The gaps in evidence that we face also need to be addressed during this pandemic to guide international consensus and inform preparedness measures for future outbreaks. Limiting ambulatory care services to time-sensitive or urgent conditions, particularly in high-volume specialties such as ophthalmology, have also been recommended to reduce the potential for transmission in the community and physician offices. However, measures within the clinic are also needed to mitigate risk for patients with urgent or emergent complaints, and routine evaluations as the outbreak abates.","We argue for a focus on basic pediatric critical care principals with locally appropriate adaptations in collaboration with ministries of health and community members. A concentration on international partnerships, educational initiatives, and research strategies will only help to enhance the specialty of pediatric critical care. Building capacity and evaluating efficacy of critical care interventions in resource-limited settings has the potential to greatly improve the overall outcome of critically ill children by supporting interventions at every level of patient care. The strategies outlined move us toward delivery of an adequate standard of critical care for all children globally and provide an opportunity to dramatically decrease the mortality of children in resource-limited settings.","\u2022 Ensure there is sufficient capacity in terms of infrastructure, human resources, materials and self-protective equipment to respond to the increase number of deaths. If this is not available, the coordination group should resort on alternatives for the required support. \u2022 Additional health and safety issues that could arise from the MotD especially during the transportation of bodies, such as manual handling of bodies (large weight, several times), staff working in cold temperatures for prolonged periods of time, psychological impact, hazardous substances. Ensure support and adequate response to staff working under these conditions.","In order to prevent the development of a global pandemic from a regional epidemic, a global collaboration to ease the medical resources crisis in the affected countries during an infectious disease outbreak should be established. With the shared information, the collaboration could promptly evaluate the severity of the outbreak and the availability of medical resources. Travel advice and guidance of self-protection should also account for the potential medical resouce crisis in the epidemic areas.","Hospitals and healthcare facilities in LMICs of Asia and West Africa had poor strategies for the prevention and control of HAIs. This situation led to delayed reactions, serious cross contamination, increased the mortality, and financial loss during the outbreaks of SARS, Ebola, and MERS. Technology shortfalls primarily included poor infrastructure and inadequate facility ventilation, which failed to support isolation and other efforts for HAIs prevention. Human factors were also responsible for the HAIs of SARS, Ebola, and MERS. Lack of knowledge can lead to the failure of identifying suspected cases and induce a lax attitude toward infection control methods, such as hand washing and the proper use of PPE. Lack of knowledge is also related to poor triaging in outpatient departments and emergency treatment areas.","\u2022 Risk assessment must be coordinated and integrated with the host country's national risk assessment \u2022 Comprehensive risk assessment (with input from public health authorities) reviewed and updated regularly assessment. If a decision is made to proceed with MG events, risk mitigation measures should be put in place, consistent with WHO guidance on social distancing for COVID-19, 16 and the rationale for the decision should be clearly explained and communicated to the public.","(3) organizational-economic management; (4) the performance of health-care units based on measurable quantitative and qualitative targets; (5) the utilization of ICT; (6) the restructuring of resources in the smaller scale within health-care units; and (7) the coordinated and interconnected operations of health services and general or specialized medical departments/clinics within each health district. Respond to increased demand due to an aging population (home health-care, distant care for the elderly and implementation of long-term health-care systems at the local and regional level).","Since the 2001 anthrax and 2003 SARS alerts, response strategies from French public health authorities were primarily based on epidemiological and biological networks. At the international level, a review of the literature in the PubMed database showed the diversity of these networks. Several transitory or virtual physician networks were then established during outbreaks, with the aim of collecting data on patients to improve the clinical response and/or to conduct real-time clinical research (SARS crisis-WHO [9] , REVA GRIPPE-SRLF [10] , (H1N1)pdm2009 -HPA [11] ). The experience of the 2003 SARS crisis and the 2009 pandemic flu suggested that patient care needed to be integrated into the response preparation. This concept was adopted at the international level for the recent MERS-CoV and EVD epidemics, with the creation of the Emerging Disease Clinical Assessment and Response Network (EDCARN) [12] in which the French SCE group participated. Here again, there was strong evidence to suggest that biological and epidemiological networking organizations should better address clinician expertise. Indeed, the main objectives and actions of healthcare system managers needed to focus on ensuring and improving timely and adjusted patient care and appropriate infection control measures [13] . Since then, several European initiatives have created multidisciplinary structures with the aim of sharing information on EBR-associated IDs to enhance preparedness and response (EUNID [14] [15] [16] ) or to establish a framework for integrating clinical research into epidemic response (collaborations named PREPARE [17] , ISARIC [18] , REACTING). Another initiative is the European Training in Infectious Disease Emergencies program (ETIDE), conducted since 2006 which aims to \"enhance European capacity to recognize and respond in a coordinated fashion to any infectious disease emergency, whether accidental or deliberate in origin\" and which was opened to multidisciplinary professionals including frontline HCWs in Europe [19] . Based on this experience, the French SCE group aimed to contribute to an international approach, keeping at its core patient's care and encouraging operational interaction between ID specialists, epidemiologists, biologists (etc.) with frontline physicians. This field-based validated expertise can be available to physicians, patients and health authority decision-making.","Within days of the initial outbreak, Chinese researchers had identified a novel coronavirus\u2014temporarily named \u20182019-nCoV\u2019\u2014in samples from patients, and they made the viral sequence publicly available on 10 January 2020, after global urging. The swift identification of the new coronavirus reflects China\u2019s investment in scientific capacity, as well as new strategies and infrastructure for public-health emergencies implemented in the country since the outbreak of the related severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus in Guangdong province in 2002 (also see the Comment by John Nkengasong). However, the public release of the 2019-nCoV viral sequence was needed to empower the global community to collectively mobilize research efforts to help in the containment of this virus.","At the national level there should be an IC programme, which would provide healthcare facilities with appropriate direction, guidance and support in preventing the spread of infection in healthcare facilities. This will ensure consistency of approach. 49 In those areas without existing legislation to make IC and prevention interventions mandatory, public health officials should promote meetings with policy makers to lobby for legislation to mandate that each hospital should have an IC committee (ICC) with a specified core membership and an appropriate IC infrastructure, including resources. Functions of the hospital ICC should include outbreak investigation, surveillance, reviewing local epidemiological data, educating staff, patients and visitors, developing and promoting local guidelines and estimating resource needs. The ICC should be multidisciplinary and include nursing, medical, laboratory, public health, pharmacy, occupational health, hospital management and engineering representatives.","In addition to epidemics, natural and man-made disasters have highlighted the need for an emergent increase in critical care capacity globally. In 2010, the Pediatric Emergency Mass Critical Care Task Force, composed of 36 experts in domains, including medicine, public health, and disaster response, recommended that equipment and supplies be available to triple the typical ICU capacity for at least 10 days during times of disaster or epidemic illness regardless of location (113). The 2014 CHEST consensus statement on critical care in resource-limited settings calls for development of feasibility plans to address a protracted event requiring long-term use of critical care resources and capacity to immediately expand hospital critical care resources by 20\u2013200% depending on the surge response required by the disaster/pandemic (114, 115).","A fifth consideration is the importance of early goals-of-care discussions and addressing code status, especially for older patients and those with chronic life-limiting illness. Decisions to forego cardiopulmonary resuscitation and mechanical ventilation that is unwanted or nonbeneficial take on additional importance in the context of constrained resources given the potential risk to healthcare workers and subsequent increased strain on our healthcare capacity. Our palliative care specialists are charged with providing guidance for primary teams conducting these goals-of-care and code status discussions in order to preserve resources by avoiding unwanted or non-beneficial use. We also strived to provide all teams with clinician discussion tools as well as consultation to assist with complex communication. These resources include an informed assent strategy for discussing do-not-resuscitate orders 8 and resources for COVID-ready communication skills. 9 Our strategy specifies that in a Crisis capacity setting, we would consider the creation of an end-of-life care unit specifically for patients dying with COVID-19 which would be staffed by palliative care physicians and advanced practice provider specialists trained in use of PPE. We also specify that in a crisis capacity setting, telephonic support at all hours may provide additional palliative care capacity to provide coaching and symptom guidance to primary teams.","The responsibilities of the organizations are shown in Table 2. In accordance with the working principle of \u201cprevention first, prevention and control combined, scientific guidance and timely treatment\u201d, the prevention and control work shall be carried out in a coordinated and standardized way [23].","Whilst standard medical wards may be repurposed easily, creating ICU capacity is constrained by the need for complex equipment and the delivery of highly specialised care. Nevertheless, there are mechanisms by which ICU capacity can be increased in an emergency, including decreasing patient flow through reducing elective work or changing referral networks, and providing additional emergency physical capacity for mechanical ventilation (e.g. operating theatre ventilators). All of these require significant changes to infrastructure, processes, or sta ng and are therefore expensive and possibly time-consuming. Furthermore, the consequences for resources and sta\u21b5 redeployment are significant. Forecasting was therefore essential in guiding such di cult policy decisions in Italy [2] . The explosion of cases seen in Italy means that an early warning of need for surge capacity is likely to be required in England.","(1) Coordination. Coordination in this context refers to the organization of the medical team and resources needed to combat the epidemic, with government as the lead actor. Following formal confirmation of the gravity of COVID-19 and its deleterious health impacts on January 20th, 2020, the Chinese government implemented a coordinated topdown organization system to allocate and manage critical resources (http://cpc.people.com.cn/n1/2020/0223/c64094-31600380.html). For example, to improve the recovery rate and reduce mortality in Hubei Province, the central government immediately coordinated a number of different agencies, and quickly operationalized several specialized treatment hospitals within a very short period, including the construction of completely new Huoshenshan and Leishenshan hospitals. Meanwhile, until February 23rd 2020, more than 330 medical teams, comprising 41,600 medical staff from 29 provinces, including military health personnel, were temporarily assigned to Hubei Province to contribute to the treatment of patients (http://news. cctv.com/2020/03/01/ARTIyFaDgjnVVFUmkVuatpaz200301. shtml). The central government also established a ''green channel\" transportation for medical supplies and other material resources after the shutdown of the regular transport system in Wuhan. (2) Classification. Classification is employed to divide the outbreak areas and their associated risk factors into different levels, which consider the number of confirmed cases and the factors closely related to disease transmission, including population characteristics and the living environment. After the confirmation of Human-to-human transmission [10] , in response to the proliferation of the epidemic, differential prevention and control measures were adopted informed by a risk level detailed at the county scale. The central government, from January 23rd 2020, implemented a ''closed management\" policy in Wuhan [11] and six other cities in Hubei Province through closure of train stations, airports and highways that strictly controlled population mobility. Localities in cities that would typically have been crowded were closed to prevent asymptomatic patients from transmitting the virus. On February 17th 2020, to ensure an orderly return to work after the Spring Festival holiday during the containing COVID-19 process, the Chinese government issued a document stating that all provinces (except Hubei and Beijing) should declare the epidemic risk level for their counties based on the number of confirmed cases, evaluated as ''low\", ''medium\" and ''high\" risk levels Through the coordination, classification, and collaboration (3C) systematic approach, China has been able to curb the spread of the COVID-19 nationally. It is notable that these three processes are not independent but interrelated. For example, classification requires collaboration between different government agencies at different administrative levels, which in turn helps to strengthen management coordination. In addition, effective implementation of policies is inseparable from collaboration between different departments. Moreover, spontaneous collaboration behaviors among the general public (bottom-up) requires appropriate guidance from the government (top-down). In order to deal with the huge challenges of human-environmental systems, the systematic approach needs to fully consider the interaction between different agencies and actors.","The Ebola outbreak highlighted the fragile state of health care systems in resource-limited settings. There is an urgent need for a paradigm shift in healthcare delivery and outcomes of critical illness in these settings. What Ebola patients need most stems from the foundation of critical care and public health: early recognition, supportive care, fluid resuscitation, and electrolyte management within an infrastructure organized to support hygiene, sanitation, isolation practices, safe handling, and transportation services (12). Unfortunately, patients in Western Africa died due to the inability of health care systems to provide this foundation (13). The current emphasis on disease specific as opposed to care delivery-based programs in resource-limited settings makes the provision of efficient and effective healthcare challenging, clearly shown by this Ebola outbreak. Improvement in the fundamentals of critical care medicine can and should be instrumental in helping make these urgently needed health care delivery shifts happen.","Overall, agnostic or unbiased metagenomic sequencing capabilities in-country provide the ability to detect and respond to a variety of pathogens, even those that are unanticipated or unknown. Bridging of existing local and global resources for sequencing and analysis allows for better realtime surveillance locally, while also enabling better health pursuits overall, not just during outbreaks. The example described here serves as a call for continued training and infrastructure to support mNGS capacity in developing countries as bioinformatic tools proliferate and the cost of sequencing decreases.","The agenda for critical care research in resource-limited settings should include more evidence on epidemiology and outcomes. A more accurate estimate of the potential lives saved through pediatric critical care interventions would justify its role in healthcare systems globally (19). Data on critical care capacity, and access to both critical care resources and health care professionals, are essential for health system planning, but generally lacking. Efforts should be made to adjust critical care guidelines from high-income countries to resource-limited settings. Cost-effectiveness analyses of current and proposed critical care practices need to be emphasized (73). Efficacy must be measured and validated for critical care interventions, with limited resources targeted to those practices that save lives, time, and resources. Currently, available critical care mortality prediction tools and triage scoring systems require revalidation in region-specific contexts (131, 132) and low-cost critical care technology is much needed to support critical care in resource-limited settings.","1.

A Preparatory Guideline for a Mass Fatality Response Plan\"","The deficiencies in this legislation were highlighted by the measles epidemic of 1989-1991, which involved more than 55,000 cases and led to 123 deaths. 35, 76 Substantial numbers of unimmunized preschool children, particularly in inner-city areas, contributed to this event. 76 To ensure that vulnerable children had more reliable access to vaccines, the government refocused their funding resources on helping individual states in building immunization infrastructure. VFC is a state-operated federal entitlement program that provides free Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices-recommended vaccines to children 18 years of age or younger who are uninsured, Alaska Native or Native American, eligible for Medicaid, or receive their vaccines in a federally qualified health center. 77 At the state level, funds are earmarked for vaccine purchase and immunization programs. 35 State funds also have been used to purchase vaccines for children and adolescents not eligible for VFC. A combination of VFC, state/local, and Section 317 program funds (i.e., VFC only, VFC and Underinsured, VFC and Underinsured Select, Universal, and Universal Select) has been used by a number of states to purchase all recommended vaccines for children in the state, including the privately insured. 78 Many states use universal programs that expand the eligibility for VFC vaccines by supplementing VFC purchases at federally discounted prices. The universal purchase states have been successful in raising vaccination rates among the underinsured 79 and increasing access to newer and more expensive vaccines for children without insurance. 75 However, criticisms of the universal purchase programs have been raised, including (1) vaccine manufacturers' claims that universal purchase programs unfairly provide for the purchase of all vaccines at lower government contract prices, thus eliminating the private market for vaccines and decreasing revenue; (2) although immunization charges are reduced under this program, patients still pay for the vaccine administration fee; and (3) some contend that taxpayer money should not be spent to provide free vaccines for children whose insurance would otherwise pay for it. 79 State Medicaid and State Children's Health Insurance Program funds also are provided for vaccine purchase, although the level of Medicaid funding varies from state to state.","Information on vertical transmission for COVID-19 is limited, although testing of 15 neonates born to mothers with COVID-19 has all been negative. Guidance on mode of delivery requires expert consensus until further information emerges.","Performance objective (PO): the maximum frequency and/or concentration of a hazard in a food at a specified step in the food chain before the time of consumption that provides or contributes to an FSO or ALOP, as applicable. Attrey (2008) has identified the definitions from QMS resources as under: \u2022 Quality: is the totality of features and characteristics of a product showing its ability to meet stated or implied needs or degree to which a set of inherent characteristics fulfils customer requirements. \u2022 Quality management: are the coordinated activities to direct and control an organization with regard to quality. \u2022 System: is a set of interrelated and interfacing elements. Quality System is the organizational structure, responsibilities, procedures, processes, and resources for implementing quality management. \u2022 Management system: management system refers to what the organization does to manage its process or activities. It is a system to establish a Quality Policy and achieve quality objectives in an organization. \u2022 Quality management system (QMS): it is a management system, which directs and controls an organization with regard to quality. QMS has a set of requirements that deal with each aspect of the activities of the organization that affect quality. \u2022 Quality requirements: ISO family of standards represents an international consensus on good management practices with the aim of ensuring that the organization can time and again","As a result, increasing emphasis has been placed on the effectiveness of arrival screening to 64 prevent importation of cases to areas without established spread. At the same time, there is 65 great concern about potential public health consequences if nCoV spreads to developing 66 countries that lack health infrastructure and resources to combat it effectively. Limited 67 resources also could mean that some countries cannot implement large-scale arrival screening. 68","Consensus guidance from China advises \"delayed cord clamping is not recommended\" in order to reduce the risk of vertical transmission and that infants should be separated from mothers affected by COVID 19 (22) . Infants may acquire COVID-19 from their mothers after delivery via normal routes of transmission.","Preliminarily recommended thresholds on the volume of displacement victims: (1) at national level, &gt;10,000 persons; (2) at provincial level, &gt;1000 people; (3) at municipal level, &gt;500 people; (4) at county level, &gt; 100 people. (b) Level of impact: Whether the emergency event negatively affected the normal operation of local essential infrastructure and local normal social order. (c) Special background of event: Whether there was prevalence of certain infectious disease during the natural disaster, technical incident/ disaster and social security incident, and whether there were multiple emergency events at the same time. (d) Likelihood of further exaggeration: Primarily consider whether the emergency event persists and whether the emergency response capacity of local area is adequate. 3. If the event coincides with mass gatherings, and meets any of the following conditions, it should be incorporated in daily report: (a) Scale of conference: (i) number of participants 1000 and (ii) participants come from multiple provinces of the country (10 provinces) or multiple countries (3 countries), or the duration of the conference 1 week. (b) Special background: (i) prevalence of certain infectious disease at the site of the conference or the source areas of the participants during the event; (ii) large-scale food poisoning at the site of the conference during the event. (c) Political concerns: Whether administrative authorities at higher levels expressed particular concerns.","In order to reduce the risk of negative psychological outcomes caused by the COVID-19 outbreak and promote social stability, the National Health Commission of China (NHC) has integrated psychological crisis intervention into the general deployment of disease prevention. On the 27th January, 2020, the central health authority issued the 'Principles for Emergency Psychological Crisis Intervention for COVID-19 Pneumonia Epidemic' 19. The Principle addressed that the guidelines should be implemented under the guidance of trained mental health professionals. Expert teams at province, autonomous region, and municipality level should take up the lead and responsibility on psychological crisis intervention and related activities. The mental health-related national associations and academic societies are required to adopt emergency psychological crisis interventions, psychological counseling and establish psychological assistance expert groups to provide professional guidance and coordinate with health authorities.","The emergence of SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and now SARS-CoV-2, suggests that coronavirus will pose a lasting threat to human beings. The epidemic will eventually be contained, and people's memory of the coronavirus may gradually blur. But we must not forget the lessons learned from this crisis, and already begin to take measures to prevent the next new outbreak of Coronavirus or some other virus from appearing in the future. If it does appear, how will we respond to it? What if it does not happen in China? Will other countries have the fortitude to implement even more drastic measures and mobilize resources to prevent the spread of the virus and to care for the sick?","The results, in terms of a reduction in the number of cases and the rate of growth in case numbers, provide guidance to public health authorities as to how to optimise containment and control measures. Key questions that health authorities require guidance on involve the magnitude of social distancing interventions required to arrest virus spread, and include the strength, compliance rate, and duration of control measures required to be effective.","The World Health Organization (WHO) coordinated the global response to SARS and together with a number of technical partners including the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN) provided support, including field teams, to health authorities to combat SARS. 19 WHO also established a number of virtual networks which linked clinicians, epidemiologists, microbiologists, virologists, public health experts, IC practitioners and others enabling the rapid exchange of data and information. 19 These discussion groups, particularly those of the clinical network, helped fashion the IC guidance provided by WHO on its website. Many countries and regions employed WHO or other IC guidelines directly, or modified them to suit local circumstances. 20 Early in the course of the epidemic hospital outbreaks of SARS occurred in Canada, China, Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan, and Vietnam. 2-7 A total of 1706 cases of SARS occurred among HCWs and their distribution varied by country. 1 Major IC measures implemented in hospitals to control the outbreak included the following.","The Joint Commission has been following the COVID-19 epidemic closely, and in recent days our level of concern has heightened. We are sure that most health care systems are already working to respond to this threat. As information and recommendations about COVID-19 continue to evolve, we want to emphasize our support of the CDC and other public health partners as the appropriate source of information and guidance for health care organizations and providers. (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/COVID-19/hcp/index.html).","CBER has issued a guidance document intended to facilitate consistency and efficiency of review of cell therapy products, including stem cells. 4 This document is based on current best review practices and can be consulted by IND sponsors to gain a thorough perspective on the types and organization of information that CBER reviewers are looking for during review of a cell therapy IND. The document is entitled \"Draft Guidance for Reviewers: Instructions and Template for Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Control (CMC) Reviewers of Human Somatic Cell Therapy Investigational New Drug Applications (INDs)\" and is available for public examination and comment.

For example, mental health professionals, social workers, nursing home administrators, and volunteers should deliver mental health care for people living with dementia collaboratively. Within such a team, dementia experts could take the lead and support team members from other disciplines. Self-help guidance for reducing stress, such as relaxation or meditation exercise, could be delivered through electronic media. Service teams could support behavioural management through telephone hotlines. Psychological counsellors could provide online consultation for carers at home and in nursing homes. 11 In addition, we encourage people who have a parent with dementia to have more frequent contact or spend more time with their parent, or to take on some of the caregiving duties so as to give the carer some respite time.","Published data on pediatric critical care research from resource-limited countries remains sparse, yet is much needed (18, 73). Reasons for this gap in evidence likely include lack of funding, local critical care providers and researchers, academic mentorship and infrastructure to perform research, and/or barriers to turn available data into publishable research. The limited existing evidence hinders effective and efficient care and advocacy for resource-limited settings.","Based on its forensic capacity and experience gained worldwide from the management of the dead in emergencies, including epidemics (e.g. Ebola [2] ), the ICRC expects during the present COVID-19 pandemic to be asked by the authorities and other relevant stakeholders in some of its operational contexts for advice on the management of the dead from COVID-19 infection, for which it has prepared the necessary guidance.","Additionally, limitations on the movement of people and the closing of national and international transportation have been implemented. The primary goal of public authorities is to manage the outbreak so as to avoid overwhelming the health care system, in addition to buy time in order to bring online more capacity and resources that can handle the current and potential future peaks in the demand for emergency services. As such, there is an acute need to better understand the temporal growth of the outbreak (both symptomatic and asymptomatic), the geographic distribution of the outbreak, and the evolution of hot spots in the outbreak.","In the report \u201cInitial Public Health Response and Interim Clinical Guidance for the 2019 Novel Coronavirus Outbreak \u2014 United States, December 31, 2019\u2013February 4, 2020,\u201d on page 142, the fourth sentence of the first paragraph under \u201cLaboratory and Diagnostic Support\u201d should have read \u201cOn February 4, 2020 the Food and Drug Administration issued an Emergency Use Authorization to enable emergency use of CDC\u2019s 2019-nCoV Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel.\u201d","The WHO guidance [2] states that infection prevention and control measures are critical to prevent the possible spread of MERS-CoV in health care facilities.","A.N, A.L and B.C completed the laboratory work. D.K designed the infectious clone system, funded the project, provided expertise and edited the manuscript. D.C and S.T provided guidance, funding and edited the manuscript.","Nonetheless, the health sector has much more to do and WHO has identified priorities for improving the collective health response. First, emergency management needs to be strengthened. WHO is assisting member states to undertake all-hazard risk profiling, develop emergency preparedness plans, establish emergency operations centres (EOC), and apply the incident management system. 23 Afghanistan has improved its emergency management, now coordinated from a Crisis Control Centre in Kabul.","Governments and (public) health authorities alone cannot succeed in combating the outbreak. People need to protect themselves and others from contracting COVID-19 by following public health advice, adopting the suggested preventive measures, and complying with the guidance issued by health authorities.","Appropriate supportive care was shown to help reduce many unnecessary deaths in the Ebola epidemic (13). Although often considered part of basic care delivery in resource-rich settings, the availability and sustainability of clean water, reliable electricity, oxygen and compressed air, medical equipment, and support services (radiology, laboratory medicine, microbiology, and transfusion services) are essential for the delivery of critical care. In some areas, lack of basic health care resources, including protective gloves and gowns, intravenous fluids, and simple protocols or guidelines of care, limited the impact of frontline healthcare providers who risked their lives to care for those affected by Ebola (83). As a first step, providing ongoing access to these basic resources may improve survival in many resource-limited settings.","As we look to the future of epidemic prevention and control, we believe that telemedicine systems have the potential to play a role in addressing emergencies and large-scale outbreaks in high uncertainty settings. As telemedicine has inevitably altered the traditional working relationships within the healthcare network, how to ensure high-quality communication among healthcare practitioners poses a significant challenge. As such, frequent, timely, accurate, and problem-solving focused communication among clinical staffs from hospitals at different levels in the healthcare system is essential to minimize the risk incurred in handling patients with possible COVID-19 infection 3 . However, we have found that high quality of communication is not always maintained during the telemedicine coordination. Therefore, a learning telemedicine system platform for coronavirus care was developed across connected hospitals, serving as the overarching authoritative source for diagnostic decision making and knowledge sharing for treatment. The platform could aggregate COVID-19 patient records across 126 connected hospitals and rapidly expand to enable open collaborations with key stakeholders such as government authorities, research institutions and laboratories. The lessons learned from this crisis can provide insights to guide public health institutions as they implement telemedicine to increase resilience to future epidemic outbreaks.","We assessed the quality of all included trials based on review of the details in the method section and supplements of included trials. We appraised trial quality using the Cochrane collaboration tool for assessing risk of bias (RoB) (16) including assessment of random sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding (of interventions and outcome measurement or assessment), incomplete outcome data, selective reporting bias and other potential sources of bias (e.g., industry funding). For each criterion, we appraised the RoB to be either of low, high, or unclear risk (e.g., insufficient details). Two authors (Z.H.X, J.Z.M) independently assessed study quality and disagreements were resolved by consensus.","There is no doubt that critical care and public health overlap. An Ebola virus outbreak among a mobile population who carries it to densely populated areas without adequate critical care resources and systems to contain further spread is a huge public health issue (135). The lack of critical care resources in the center of the epidemic and the inability to increase available resources acutely has contributed to the amplification of disease burden, increasing stress on an already deficient public health system.","While in the throes of managing the acute pandemic, we must also not lose sight of the need to prepare our profession, and the medical profession in general, to emerge capable of fully meeting the needs of patients with ophthalmologic conditions that threaten their vision, their independence and their quality of life. This will require not only a functioning general health infrastructure (people, organizations, facilities, and funding) but assistance from governmental authorities to recover those elements of the system devastated by the medical and economic consequences of the pandemic. The world's population, for example, will still need cataract surgery, glaucoma care, corneal transplants and management of vitreoretinal diseases.","Enforcement of current wildlife protection policy and continued community infrastructure development appears to significantly reduce high-risk contact between humans, wildlife and livestock. Closer collaboration between local animal and human health authorities within the current epidemic disease prevention programmes will provide educational and training opportunities to promote risk-mitigation knowledge, skills and best practice in local communities. For example, cave monitoring and management is a low-cost and efficient method to help restrict human activities (e.g. recreation and mining) that lead to contact with bats in caves. This is of particular importance given the emergence of 2019-nCoV, which appears likely to be a bat-origin coronavirus.10,11","Telemedicine has been acknowledged as a breakthrough technology in combating epidemics 2 . Combining the functions of online conversation and real-time clinical data exchange, telemedicine can provide technical support to the emerging need for workflow digitalization. When facing the rapid spread of an epidemic, the ability to deliver clinical care in a timely manner requires effective relational coordination mechanisms amongst government authorities, hospitals, and patients 3 . This raises the question: How can telemedicine systems operate in a coordinated manner to deliver effective care to patients with COVID-19 and to combat the crisis outbreak?","Integrating genomics research into the context of public health surveillance and response can help maximize the use of limited resources, enhance the exchange and growth of scientific knowledge, and increase preparedness for infectious threats. Such research should be based on sound protocols that protect human subjects. Specimens should be processed and banked, enabling future research on genetic variation of both pathogen and host, as well as gene expression profiles, proteomics, and other measures. Epidemiologic data about environment and behaviors should be collected and stored to support additional analysis of gene-environment interactions. Such efforts will require a shift in culture and broadening of traditional public health definitions of preparedness and response, research, and collaboration."],"title":["Precautions and Procedures
