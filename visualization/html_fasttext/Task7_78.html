We have summarized in detail the management strategies implemented by the Chinese governments during the outbreaks. By considering three scenarios for the outbreak development, we simulated the facemasks availability from late-December 2019 to late-April 2020 and estimated the duration of sufficient facemask supplies. Our findings showed that if the COVID-19 outbreak occurred only in Wuhan city or Hubei province, facemask shortage would not appear with the existing public health measures. However, if the outbreak occurred in the whole of China, a shortage of facemask could be substantial assuming no alternative public health measures. Supplies of facemasks in the whole of China would have been sufficient for both healthcare workers and the general population if the COVID-19 outbreak only occurred in Wuhan city or Hubei province....","The recent emergence of SARS-CoV-2 lead to a current pandemic of unprecedented levels. Though diagnostic tests are fundamental to the ability to detect and respond, many health systems are already experiencing shortages of reagents associated with this test. Here, testing a pooling approach for the standard RT-qPCR test, we find that a single positive sample can be detected even in pools of up to 32 samples, with an estimated false negative rate of 10%. Detection of positive samples diluted in even up to 64 samples may also be attainable, though may require additional amplification cycles. As it uses the standard protocols, reagents and equipment, this pooling method can be applied immediately in current clinical testing laboratories. We hope that such implementation of a pool test for COVID-19 would allow expanding current screening capacities thereby enabling the expansion of detection in the community, as well as in close integral groups, such as hospital departments, army units, or...","Background: The overall objective of this rapid review was to identify infection protection and control recommendations from published clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) for adults aged 60 years and older in long-term care settings Methods: Comprehensive searches in MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, and relevant CPG publishers/repositories were carried out in early March 2020. Title/abstract and full-text screening, data abstraction, and quality appraisal (AGREE-II) were carried out by single reviewers. Results: A total of 17 relevant CPGs were identified, published in the USA (n=8), Canada (n=6), Australia (n=2), and the United Kingdom (n=1). All of the CPGs dealt with infection control in long-term care facilities (LTCF) and addressed various types of viral respiratory infections (e.g., influenza, COVID-19, severe acute respiratory syndrome). Ten or more CPGs recommended the following infection control measures in LTCF: hand hygiene (n=13), wearing personal protective equipment...","The COVID-19 virus has spread worldwide in a matter of a few months. Healthcare systems struggle to monitor and report current cases. Limited capabilities in testing result in difficult to guide policies and mitigate lack of preparation. Since severe cases, which more likely lead to fatal outcomes, are detected at a higher percentage than mild cases, the reported death rates are likely inflated in most countries. Such under-estimation can be attributed to the under-sampling of infection cases and results in systematic death rate estimation biases. The method proposed here utilizes a benchmark country (South Korea) and its reported death rates in combination with population demographics to correct the reported COVID-19 case numbers. By applying a correction, we predict that the number of cases is highly under-reported in most countries. In the case of China, it is estimated that more than 700.000 cases of COVID-19 actually occurred instead of the confirmed 80,932 cases as of 3/13/2020.","A symptom-based mass screening and testing intervention (MSTI) can identify a large fraction of infected individuals during an infectious disease outbreak. China is currently using this strategy for the COVID-19 outbreak. However, MSTI might lead to increased transmission if not properly implemented. We investigate under which conditions MSTI is beneficial.","[Image: see text] The carbamate group is a key structural motif in many approved drugs and prodrugs. There is an increasing use of carbamates in medicinal chemistry and many derivatives are specifically designed to make drug\u2013target interactions through their carbamate moiety. In this Perspective, we present properties and stabilities of carbamates, reagents and chemical methodologies for the synthesis of carbamates, and recent applications of carbamates in drug design and medicinal chemistry.","BACKGROUND: Strategies are urgently needed to mitigate the risk of zoonotic disease emergence in southern China, where pathogens with zoonotic potential are known to circulate in wild animal populations. However, the risk factors leading to emergence are poorly understood, which presents a challenge in developing appropriate mitigation strategies for local communities. METHODS: Residents in rural communities of Yunnan, Guangxi and Guangdong provinces were recruited and enrolled in this study. Data were collected through ethnographic interviews and field observations, and thematically coded and analysed to identify both risk and protective factors for zoonotic disease emergence at the individual, community and policy levels. RESULTS: Eighty-eight ethnographic interviews and 55 field observations were conducted at nine selected sites. Frequent human\u2013animal interactions and low levels of environmental biosecurity in local communities were identified as risks for zoonotic disease emergence...","Governments around the world are responding to the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic with unprecedented policies designed to slow the growth rate of infections. Many actions, such as closing schools and restricting populations to their homes, impose large and visible costs on society. In contrast, the benefits of these policies, in the form of infections that did not occur, cannot be directly observed and are currently understood through process-based simulations. Here, we compile new data on 936 local, regional, and national anti-contagion policies recently deployed in the ongoing pandemic across localities in China, South Korea, Iran, Italy, France, and the United States (US). We then apply reduced-form econometric methods, commonly used to measure the effect of policies on economic growth, to empirically evaluate the effect that these anti-contagion policies have had on the growth rate of infections. In the absence of any policy actions, we estimate that early infections of COVI...","Abstract The World Health Organisation has declared a pandemic caused by the newly discovered SARS-CoV-2. Due to growing demand for reagents used for SARS-CoV-2 RNA extraction for subsequent molecular diagnostics, there is a worldwide risk of kit- and/or reagent-shortages for extraction. With a detection sensitivity of 97.4% (95% CI=86.2-99.9%), we describe a simple, fast, alternative workflow for molecular detection of SARS-CoV-2, where samples are simply heat-processed for 5 minutes at 98\u00b0C prior to the RT-qPCR reaction.","Recently, more than 300 Chinese patients with psychiatric disorders were diagnosed with the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19). Possible reasons quoted in the report were the lack of caution regarding the COVID-19 outbreak in January and insufficient supplies of protective gear. We outlined major challenges for patients with psychiatric disorders and mental health professionals during the COVID-19 outbreak, and also discussed how to manage these challenges through further mental health service reform in China.","The scientific community is focussed on developing antiviral therapies to mitigate the impacts of the ongoing novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak. This will be facilitated by improved understanding of viral dynamics within infected hosts. Here, using a mathematical model in combination with published viral load data collected from the same specimen (throat / nasal swabs or nasopharyngeal / sputum / tracheal aspirate), we compare within-host dynamics for patients infected in the current outbreak with analogous dynamics for MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV infections. Our quantitative analyses revealed that SARS-CoV-2 infection dynamics are more severe than those for mild cases of MERS-CoV, but are similar to severe cases, and that the viral dynamics of SARS-CoV infection are similar to those of MERS-CoV in mild cases but not in severe case. Consequently, SARS-CoV-2 generates infection dynamics that are more severe than SARS-CoV. Furthermore, we used our viral dynamics model to predict th...","The two largest Brazilian cities, Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo, have declared community transmission of COVID-19 on mid March, 2020. In this study we estimated the most vulnerable areas in Brazil for COVID-19, both in terms of risk of introduction and risk of mortality associated with social vulnerability. We explore the most likely routes of spread through the country, from the already exposed cities, according to human mobility statistics. The resulting maps should help authorities in their efforts to prioritize actions and if resource allocation to mitigate the effects of the pandemic.","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) can be screened and diagnosed through the detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) have been rapidly developed and quickly applied to clinical testing during the pandemic. However, studies evaluating the performance of these NAAT assays are limited. We evaluated the performance of four NAATs, which were marked by the Conformit\u00e9 Europ\u00e9enne and widely used in China during the pandemic. Results showed that the analytical sensitivity of the four assays was significantly lower than that claimed by the NAAT manufacturers. The limit of detection (LOD) of Daan, Sansure, and Hybribio NAATs was 3000 copies/mL, whereas the LOD of Bioperfectus NAATs was 4000 copies/mL. The results of the consistency test using 46 samples showed that Daan, Sansure, and Hybribio NAATs could detect the samples with a specificity of 100% ...","Background: In the beginning of January 2020, new unknown virus pneumonia cases started to emerge in local hospitals in Wuhan, China. This virus epidemic quickly became a public health emergency of international concern by the WHO. Enormous amount of medical supplies as well as healthcare personals from other provinces were mobilized to support Wuhan. This current work tent to help people understanding how infectious disease spread and the purpose and consequences of various efforts based on simulation model. Method: a simulation model was created using known parameters. R0 set to 3 and mean incubation time to be 7.5days. the epidemic was divided to 3 periods. Simulation would run 50 times to mimic different patient0 status. Personal activity index was used to mimic different level of control measures. 141427709 simulated patients were created.

The numbers of new infections and deaths in Wuhan are still increasing, which have posed major public health and governance concerns. A series of mandatory actions have been taken by the municipal and provincial governments supported by the central government, such as measures to restrict travels across cities, case detection and contact tracing, quarantine, guidance and information to the public, detection kit development, etc. Challenges such as lacking effective drugs, insufficient hospital services and medical supplies, logistics, etc. have much alleviated with the solidarity of the whole society. The pandemic will definitely be ended with the continuous efforts of both national and international multi-sectoral bodies.","Governments around the world must rapidly mobilize and make difficult policy decisions to mitigate the COVID-19 pandemic. Because deaths have been concentrated at older ages, we highlight the important role of demography, particularly how the age structure of a population may help explain differences in fatality rates across countries and how transmission unfolds. We examine the role of age structure in deaths thus far in Italy and South Korea and illustrate how the pandemic could unfold in populations with similar population sizes but different age structures, showing a dramatically higher burden of mortality in countries with older versus younger populations. This powerful interaction of demography and current age-specific mortality for COVID-19 suggests that social distancing and other policies to slow transmission should consider both the age composition of local and national contexts as well as the social connectedness of older and younger generations. We also call for countries t...","Social distancing is an effective way to contain the spread of a contagious disease, particularly when pharmacological interventions are not available. Conventional wisdom suggests that social distancing measures should be introduced as soon as possible after the beginning of an outbreak. Using a simple epidemiological model we show, however, that there is in fact an optimal time to initiate a temporal social distancing intervention if the goal is to reduce the final epidemic size or flatten the epidemic curve. The optimal timing depends strongly on the effective reproduction number (R0) of the disease, such that as the R0 increases, the optimal time decreases non-linearly. Additionally, if pharmacological interventions (e.g., a vaccine) become available at some point during the epidemic, the sooner these interventions become available the sooner social distancing should be initiated to maximize its effectiveness. Although based on a simple model, we hope that these insights inspire fu...","Widespread, non-stop, and often sensational coverage of the coronavirus (COVID-19) has caught many governments flat-footed in efforts to protect the health and safety of their citizens. In response to the current global health event, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic. Mass gatherings present a historic challenge in protecting the health and safety of attendees. The majority of the prominent mass gatherings are religious in nature. Global sporting events, such as the Olympics and the World Cup, pose unique health risks to attendees and host nations. Deferment or cancellation of such mass gatherings may exert an extraordinary economic loss to the host nation. Universal adoption of best practices for infection control is the surest way for governments to prepare for mass gatherings. In these uncertain times, it is up to intergovernmental organizations to be the voice of reason.","","Countries across the world observed dramatic rises in COVID-19 cases and deaths in March 2020. In the United States, delays in the availability of diagnostic testing have prompted questions about the extent of unobserved community transmission. Using a simulation model informed by reported cases and deaths, we estimated that tens of thousands of people (median: \u200b22,876, 95% posterior predictive interval: 7,451 - 53,044) were infected by the time a national emergency was declared. Our results also indicate that fewer than 10% of locally acquired, symptomatic infections in the US were detected throughout much of late February. These results point to the need for immediate, large-scale efforts to mitigate the impacts of SARS-CoV-2 on the US.","We tested samples collected from nine patients diagnosed with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The virus was found in urine, blood, anal swabs and oropharyngeal swabs. It is the first time for SARS-CoV-2 found in urine, though no urinary irritation was found.","AbstractRNA knockdown in vivo carries significant potential for disease modelings and therapies. Despite the emerging approaches of CRISPR/Cas9-mediated permanent knock out of targeted genes, strategies targeting RNA for disruption are advantageous in the treatment of acquired metabolic disorders when permanent modification of the genome DNA is not appropriate, and RNA virus infection diseases when pathogenic DNA is not available (such as SARS-Cov-2 and MERS infections). Recently, Cas13d, a family of RNA-targeting CRISPR effectors, has been shown to accomplish robust down-regulation of cellular RNAs in mammalian cells in vitro. Among the various Cas13d subtypes, CasRx (RfxCas13d) showed the most potent RNA knockdown efficiency in HEK293T cells. However, the RNA-targeting activity of Cas13d still needs to be verified in vivo. In this study, the CasRx system was demonstrated to efficiently and functionally knock down genes related to metabolism functions, including Pten, Pcsk9 and lncLst...","Abstract Propagation of new human respiratory virus pathogens in established cell lines is hampered by a lack of predictability regarding cell line permissivity and by availability of suitable antibody reagents to detect infection in cell lines that do not exhibit significant cytopathic effect. Recently, molecular methods have been used to amplify and identify novel nucleic acid sequences directly from clinical samples, but these methods may be hampered by the quantity of virus present in respiratory secretions at different time points following the onset of infection. Human airway epithelial (HAE) cultures, which effectively mimic the human bronchial environment, allow for cultivation of a wide variety of human respiratory viral pathogens. The goal of the experiments described here was to determine if propagation and identification of a human respiratory virus may be achieved through inoculation of HAE cultures followed by whole transcriptome amplification (WTA) and sequence analysis....","Abstract Newcastle disease (ND) and infectious bronchitis (IB) are two major viral diseases affecting the respiratory tracts of birds and whose impact on African poultry is still poorly known. In the present study we aimed at assessing NDV and IBV prevalences in Ivory-Coast by molecular screening of &gt;22,000 avian swabs by nested PCR and by serology testing of close to 2000 avian sera from 2010 through 2012. The NDV and IBV seroprevalences over the study period reached 22% and 72%, respectively. We found 14.7% pooled swabs positive by PCR for NDV and 14.6% for IBV. Both pathogens are therefore endemic in Ivory-Coast. Economic losses associated with NDV and IBV infections still need to be evaluated.","Abstract Recent international epidemics of coronavirus-associated illnesses underscore the urgent medical and public health need for vaccine development and regulatory body approved therapies. In particular, the current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has quickly intensified interest in developing treatment options to mitigate impact on human life. Remdesivir (GS-5734\u2122) is a broad-spectrum antiviral drug that is now being tested as a potential treatment for COVID-19 in international, multi-site clinical trials. Currently available evidence about the antiviral effects of remdesivir against coronaviruses is primarily based on in vitro and in vivo studies (including some on a chemically related compound, GS-441524\u2122), which have demonstrated largely favorable findings. As the pandemic progresses, information from human compassionate use cases will continue to accumulate before the clinical trials are concluded. It is imperative for public health practitioners and the One Healt...","Abstract A remarkable collaborative effort coordinated by the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) team at WHO resulted in discovery of the etiologic agent of severe acute respiratory syndrome less than 2 months after the announcement of global alert. The development of a vaccine to prevent SARS should be pursued with the same urgency and cooperative spirit, as SARS is highly lethal and, if not controlled during the first few generations of transmission, is likely to become endemic in regions of the world where health-care infrastructure is underdeveloped and epidemiological control measures are weak. The scientific community already learned many important lessons from HIV vaccine development; these should be heeded. For example, consideration should be given to the development of a vaccine that will protect across regional strains of SARS, as the newly emergent coronavirus SARS-coronavirus (SARS-CoV) is proving to be variable and may be mutating in response to immune pressure. SAR...","SARS-CoV-2 has infected over 140,000 people as of March 14, 2020. We use a mathematical model to investigate the effectiveness of social distancing interventions lasting six weeks in a middle-sized city in the US. We explore four social distancing strategies by reducing the contacts of adults over 60 years old, adults over 60 years old and children, all adults (25, 75 or 95% compliance), and everyone in the population. Our results suggest that social distancing interventions can avert cases by 20% and hospitalizations and deaths by 90% even with modest compliance within adults as long as the intervention is kept in place, but the epidemic is set to rebound once the intervention is lifted. Our models suggest that social distancing interventions will buy crucial time but need to occur in conjunction with testing and contact tracing of all suspected cases to mitigate transmission of SARS-CoV-2.","In response to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak, the Chinese Government has ordered a nationwide school closure as an emergency measure to prevent spreading of the infection. Public activities are discouraged. The Ministry of Education estimates that more than 220 million children and adolescents are confined to their homes; this includes 180 million primary and secondary students and 47 million preschool children).1 Thanks to the strong administrative system in China, the emergency home schooling plan has been rigorously implemented.2 Massive efforts are being made by schools and teachers at all levels to create online courses and deliver them through TV broadcasts and the internet in record time. The new virtual semester has just started in many parts of the country, and various courses are offered online in a well organised manner. These actions are helping to alleviate many parents' concerns about their children's educational attainment by ensuring that school learn...","Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is infecting people throughout the world. It is probable that coronavirus disease (COVID-19) will be transmitted to people experiencing homelessness, which will become a major problem in particular in North America where there are sizable populations of people experiencing homelessness in nearly every metropolitan city in the USA and Canada. In the USA, more than 500 000 people were reported to be experiencing homelessness on any given night over the past decade (2007\u201319).1 The State of Homelessness in Canada 2016 report2 estimated 35 000 people are experiencing homelessness on any given night in Canada. People experiencing homelessness live in environments that are conducive to a disease epidemic. Many people experiencing homelessness live in congregate living settings\u2014be it formal (ie, shelters or halfway houses) or informal (ie, encampments or abandoned buildings)\u2014and might not have regular access to basic hygiene supplies...","Novel Corona virus (COVID-19 or 2019-nCoV) is an emerging global health concern that requires a rapid diagnostic test. Quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) is currently the standard for COVID-19 detection; however, Reverse Transcription Loop-Mediated Isothermal Amplification (RT-LAMP) may allow for faster and cheaper field based testing at point-of-risk. The objective of this study was to develop a rapid screening diagnostic test that could be completed in under 30 minutes. Simulated patient samples were generated by spiking serum, urine, saliva, oropharyngeal swabs, and nasopharyngeal swabs with a portion of the COVID-19 nucleic sequence. The samples were tested using RT-LAMP as well as by conventional qRT-PCR. Specificity of the RT-LAMP was evaluated by also testing against other related coronaviruses. RT-LAMP specifically detected COVID-19 in simulated patient samples. This test was performed in under 30 minutes. This approach could be used for monitoring of exposed indi...","Abstract Mass gathering (MG) medicine emerged against the backdrop of the 2009 pandemic H1N1 Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) when the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) hosted the largest annual mass gathering of over 3 million pilgrims from 180 plus countries. However, the events surrounding the latest threat to global health, the PHEIC COVID-19, may be sufficient to highlight the role of mass gatherings, mass migration, and other forms of dense gatherings of people on the emergence, sustenance, and transmission of novel pathogens. The COVID-19 spread illustrates the role of MGs in exacerbation of the scope of pandemics. Cancellation or suspension of MGs would be critical to pandemic mitigation. It is unlikely that medical countermeasures are available during the early phase of pandemics. Therefore, mitigation of its impact, rather than containment and control becomes a priority during pandemics. As the most systematically studied MG-related respiratory disease dat...","Publisher Summary This chapter describes three assays to monitor receptor-induced association of the envelope glycoprotein (EnvA) of avian sarcoma/leukosis virus (ASLV) with target bilayers: (1) the original assay for monitoring binding of the EnvA ectodomain (EnvA-PI) to target membranes (liposomes), (2) a modified and miniaturized EnvA-PI-liposome binding assay, and (3) an assay to measure binding of intact sarcoma/leukosis virus subtype A (ASLV-A) virus particles to target membranes. These assays are also useful for studying other receptor-activated viral fusion proteins. When one viral glycoprotein and one \u201csimple\u201d host cell receptor are involved, it should be possible to develop assays directly analogous to those described above for studying Tva-induced binding of the EnvA ectodomain (EnvA-PI) to target membranes. A general prerequisite for a fusion protein/target membrane binding assay is a soluble and correctly oligomeric form of the viral fusion protein ectodomain. The simplest...","BACKGROUND: There is an ongoing debate regarding the type of respiratory protection that should be recommended for use for healthcare workers. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was conducted in three countries: China, Pakistan and Vietnam. RESULTS: In China and Pakistan, the infection control guidelines were developed to be in line with the recommendations from the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, while in the Vietnamese guidelines the recommendations correspond with the WHO suggestions only. The guidelines from all three countries document the need for training and fit testing; however there is no system to monitor the training and fit testing programs. Across the three countries, there was some inconsistency with regard to the types of products (i.e. masks vs. respirators) recommended for influenza, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and tuberculosis. CONCLUSIONS: Available evidence should be examined and a compre...","BACKGROUND: In response to global concerns about the largest Ebola virus disease (EVD), outbreak to-date in West Africa documented healthcare associated transmission and the risk of global spread, the International Society of Chemotherapy (ISC) Infection Control Working Group created an Ebola Infection Control Readiness Checklist to assess the preparedness of institutions around the globe. We report data from the electronic checklist that was disseminated to medical professionals from October to December 2014 and identify action needed towards better preparedness levels. FINDINGS: Data from 192 medical professionals (one third from Africa) representing 125 hospitals in 45 countries around the globe were obtained through a specifically developed electronic survey. The survey contained 76 specific questions in 7 major sections: Administrative/operational support; Communications; Education and audit; Human resources, Supplies, Infection Prevention and Control practices and Clinical manage...","Abstract The ongoing novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) pandemic is expected to develop into an unprecedented stress test for health care systems worldwide. This brief report, written from a radiation oncology perspective during the developing outbreak of 2019-nCoV in Switzerland, highlights the challenges identified and measures taken in our department to mitigate risks and ensure continued operations during the outbreak.","Abstract Microbiology laboratories have traditionally relied upon phenotypic methods involving culture and biochemical testing to identify and characterize clinically important pathogens. These techniques have several disadvantages including poor sensitivity and long turn-around time. Molecular and mass spectroscopy techniques are rapidly changing infection diagnosis and management. Compared with conventional culture-based techniques, these modern approaches provide substantially more rapid and specific information on organism identification and on the presence of resistance mechanisms. These methods are expected to contribute substantially to enhancing antibiotic stewardship and to improving \u2018time to appropriate antibiotics\u2019, one of the most important factors in improving the prognosis of patients with life-threatening infections. This article gives an overview of some of the practical applications of these newer technologies.","Real-time molecular techniques have become the reference methods for direct diagnosis of pathogens. The reduction of steps is a key factor in order to decrease the risk of human errors resulting in invalid series and delayed results. We describe here a process of preparation of oligonucleotide primers and hydrolysis probe in a single tube at predefined optimized concentrations that are stabilized via lyophilization (Lyoph-P&amp;P). Lyoph-P&amp;P was compared versus the classic protocol using extemporaneously prepared liquid reagents using (i) sensitivity study, (ii) long-term stability at 4 \u00b0C, and (iii) long-term stability at 37 \u00b0C mimicking transportation without cold chain. Two previously published molecular assays were selected for this study. They target two emerging viruses that are listed on the blueprint of the WHO as to be considered for preparedness and response actions: chikungunya virus (CHIKV) and Rift Valley fever phlebovirus (RVFV). Results of our study demonstrate that (i) Lyop...","Abstract Our recommendation, as experts who have monitored health hazards at the Hajj for over 15 years, especially if the situation with COVID-19 continues to escalate globally is that Hajj 2020 will be at risk of being suspended and a means for Muslims to fulfill their rights in the future either personally or even by proxy need to be announced. The same holds true for the Summer 2020 Olympics in Japan and for many other MGs and large gatherings. Decisions in the time of COVID-19 will be closely followed and will be a blueprint for other mass gatherings.","Background: In coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), current case definitions presume mainly lower respiratory tract infection. However, cases seen outside the epicenter of the epidemic may differ in their overall clinical appearance due to more sensitive case finding. Methods: We studied viral load courses by RT-PCR in oro- and nasopharyngeal swabs, sputum, stool, blood, and urine in nine hospitalized cases. Infectious virus was detected by cell culture. Active replication was demonstrated by analysis of viral subgenomic replicative intermediates. Serology including neutralization testing was done to characterize immune response. Results: Seven cases had upper respiratory tract disease. Lower respiratory tract symptoms seen in two cases were limited. Clinical sensitivity of RT-PCR on swabs taken on days 1-5 of symptoms was 100%, with no differences comparing swab and sputum samples taken simultaneously. Average viral load was 6.76x10E5 copies per swab during the first 5 days. Live viru...","","The recent coronavirus pandemic follows in its early stages an almost exponential expansion, with the number of cases N reasonably well fit by N e\u03b1t, in many countries. We analyze the rate \u03b1 in 25 different countries, choosing as a starting point in each country the first day with 30 cases and fitting for the following 12 days, capturing thus the early exponential growth in a rather homogeneous way. We look for a link between the rate \u03b1 and the average temperature T of each country, in the month of the epidemic growth. Fitting with a linear behavior \u03b1(T), we find evidence for a decreasing growth rate as a function of T. However, a decrease in the growth rate is visible also in the very low-T data. Going beyond a linear model, a peak at about (9.5\u00b12.6)\u00b0C seems to be present in the data. Our findings give hope that, for northern hemisphere countries, the growth rate should significantly decrease as a result of both warmer weather and lockdown policies. In general the propagation should b...","Abstract Feed for livestock animals have been under increased scrutiny as a vector for pathogenic bacteria leading to human illnesses. Control of these pathogenic bacteria in animal feeds can be controlled via physical and chemical means. Physical methods can include thermal processing, including irradiation, pelleting, and extrusion. Chemical mitigation can be accomplished through the inclusion of various additives, including formaldehyde, organic acids, essential oils, or medium chain fatty acids. While physical and chemical interventions can help mitigate risk of pathogens contaminating finished animal feeds, the implementation of a biosecurity plan at the feed mill can help prevent pathogens from entering or spreading throughout the facility.","Policies and public health efforts have not addressed the gendered impacts of disease outbreaks.1 The response to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) appears no different. We are not aware of any gender analysis of the outbreak by global health institutions or governments in affected countries or in preparedness phases. Recognising the extent to which disease outbreaks affect women and men differently is a fundamental step to understanding the primary and secondary effects of a health emergency on different individuals and communities, and for creating effective, equitable policies and interventions. Although sex-disaggregated data for COVID-19 show equal numbers of cases between men and women so far, there seem to be sex differences in mortality and vulnerability to the disease.2 Emerging evidence suggests that more men than women are dying, potentially due to sex-based immunological3 or gendered differences, such as patterns and prevalence of smoking.4 However, current sex-disaggrega...","COVID-19 has spread to most countries in the world. Puzzlingly, the impact of the disease is different in different countries. These differences are attributed to differences in cultural norms, mitigation efforts, and health infrastructure. Here we propose that national differences in COVID-19 impact could be partially explained by the different national policies respect to Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) childhood vaccination. BCG vaccination has been reported to offer broad protection to respiratory infections. We compared large number of countries BCG vaccination policies with the morbidity and mortality for COVID-19. We found that countries without universal policies of BCG vaccination (Italy, Nederland, USA) have been more severely affected compared to countries with universal and long-standing BCG policies. Countries that have a late start of universal BCG policy (Iran, 1984) had high mortality, consistent with the idea that BCG protects the vaccinated elderly population. We also ...","The need to protect public health during the current COVID-19 pandemic has necessitated conference cancellations on an unprecedented scale. As the scientific community adapts to new working conditions, it is important to recognize that some of our actions may disproportionately affect early-career researchers and scientists from countries with limited research funding. We encourage all conference organizers, funders and institutions who are able to do so to consider how they can mitigate the unintended consequences of conference and travel cancellations and we provide seven recommendations for how this could be achieved. The proposed solutions may also offer long-term benefits for those who normally cannot attend conferences, and thus lead to a more equitable future for generations of researchers.","COVID-19 is a complex disease phenotype where the underlying microbiome could influence morbidity and mortality. Amplicon and metagenomic MinION based sequencing was used to rapidly (within 8 hours) identify SARS-CoV-2 and assess the microbiome in nasopharyngeal swabs obtained from patients with COVID-19 by the ISARIC 4C consortium.","Mass spectrometry (MS) has found numerous applications in life sciences. It has high accuracy, sensitivity and wide dynamic range in addition to medium- to high-throughput capabilities. These features make MS a superior platform for analysis of various biomolecules including proteins, lipids, nucleic acids and carbohydrates. Until recently, MS was applied for protein detection and characterization. During the last decade, however, MS has successfully been used for molecular diagnostics of microbial and viral infections with the most notable applications being identification of pathogens, genomic sequencing, mutation detection, DNA methylation analysis, tracking of transmissions, and characterization of genetic heterogeneity. These new developments vastly expand the MS application from experimental research to public health and clinical fields. Matching of molecular techniques with specific requirements of the major MS platforms has produced powerful technologies for molecular diagnosti...","During the current COVID-19 pandemic, testing kit and RNA extraction kit availability has become a major limiting factor in the ability to determine patient disease status and accurately quantify prevalence. Current testing strategies rely on individual tests of cases matching restrictive diagnostic criteria to detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA, limiting testing of asymptomatic and mild cases. Testing these individuals is one effective way to understand and reduce the spread of COVID-19. Here, we develop a pooled testing strategy to identify these low-risk individuals. Drawing on the well-studied group testing literature, modeling suggests practical changes to testing protocols which can reduce test costs and stretch a limited test kit supply. When most tests are negative, pooling reduces the total number of tests up to four-fold at 2% prevalence and eight-fold at 0.5% prevalence. At current SARS-CoV-2 prevalence, randomized group testing optimized per country could double the number of tested ind...","Social distancing policies are critical but economically painful measures to flatten the curve against emergent infectious diseases. As the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19 spread throughout the United States in early 2020, the federal government issued social distancing recommendations but left to the states the most difficult and consequential decisions restricting behavior, such as canceling events, closing schools and businesses, and issuing stay-at-home orders. We present an original dataset of state-level social distancing policy responses to the epidemic and explore how political partisanship, COVID-19 caseload, and policy diffusion explain the timing of governors' decisions to mandate social distancing. An event history analysis of five social distancing policies across all fifty states reveals the most important predictors are political: all else equal, Republican governors and governors from states with more Trump supporters were slower to adopt social distancing polici...","Relevant pandemic-spread scenario simulations provide guiding principles for containment and mitigation policy developments. Here we devise a simple model to predict the effectiveness of different mitigation strategies. The model consists of a set of simple differential equations considering the population size, reported and unreported infections, reported and unreported recoveries and the number of Covid-19-inflicted deaths. For simplification, we assume that Covid-19 survivors are immune (e.g. mutations are not considered) and that the virus can only be passed on by persons with undetected infections. While the latter assumption is a simplification (it is neglected that e.g. hospital staff may be infected by detected patients with symptoms), it was introduced here to keep the model as simple as possible. Moreover, the current version of the model does not account for age-dependent differences in the death rates, but considers higher mortality rates due to temporary shortage of intens..."],"title":["Facemask shortage and the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak: Reflection on public health measures","Evaluation of COVID-19 RT-qPCR test in multi-sample pools","Guidelines for preventing respiratory illness in older adults aged 60 years and above living in long-term care: A rapid review of clinical practice guidelines","Correcting under-reported COVID-19 case numbers","Assessing the impact of a symptom-based mass screening and testing intervention during a novel infectious disease outbreak: The case of COVID-19","Organic Carbamates in Drug Design and Medicinal Chemistry","A qualitative study of zoonotic risk factors among rural communities in southern China","The Effect of Large-Scale Anti-Contagion Policies on the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Pandemic","An alternative workflow for molecular detection of SARS-CoV-2 - escape from the NA extraction kit-shortage","The COVID-19 outbreak and psychiatric hospitals in China: managing challenges through mental health service reform","Modelling SARS-CoV-2 Dynamics: Implications for Therapy","Assessing the potential impacts of COVID-19 in Brasil: Mobility, Morbidity and Impact to the Health System","Comparative performance of four nucleic acid amplification tests for SARS-CoV-2 virus","A model simulation study on effects of intervention measures in Wuhan COVID-19 epidemic","The novel coronavirus outbreak in Wuhan, China","Demographic science aids in understanding the spread and fatality rates of COVID-19","Optimal timing for social distancing during an epidemic","An Ounce of Prevention: Coronavirus (COVID-19) and Mass Gatherings","Crowdsourcing data to mitigate epidemics","Estimating unobserved SARS-CoV-2 infections in the United States","2019 Novel Coronavirus can be detected in urine, blood, anal swabs and oropharyngeal swabs samples","Modulation of metabolic functions through Cas13d-mediated gene knockdown in liver","Human airway epithelial cell culture to identify new respiratory viruses: Coronavirus NL63 as a model","Prevalence of Newcastle disease virus and infectious bronchitis virus in avian influenza negative birds from live bird markets and backyard and commercial farms in Ivory-Coast","Current knowledge about the antivirals remdesivir (GS-5734) and GS-441524 as therapeutic options for coronaviruses","How the SARS vaccine effort can learn from HIV\u2014speeding towards the future, learning from the past","Evaluating the effectiveness of social distancing interventions against COVID-19","Mitigate the effects of home confinement on children during the COVID-19 outbreak","COVID-19: a potential public health problem for homeless populations","Rapid Detection of Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) by Reverse Transcription-Loop-Mediated Isothermal Amplification","COVID-19 \u2013 the role of mass gatherings","Receptor-Activated Binding of Viral Fusion Proteins to Target Membranes","Examining the policies and guidelines around the use of masks and respirators by healthcare workers in China, Pakistan and Vietnam","Preparedness of institutions around the world for managing patients with Ebola virus disease: an infection control readiness checklist","Contingency plans in a radiation oncology department amid the 2019-nCoV outbreak in Switzerland","Molecular-based diagnostics, including future trends","Lyophilized Matrix Containing Ready-to-Use Primers and Probe Solution for Standardization of Real-Time PCR and RT-qPCR Diagnostics in Virology","The cancellation of mass gatherings (MGs)?

To overcome this shortening of supplies, computerised tomography (CT) scans of lungs have been used for diagnosis, with mixed results and at a risk of false-negatives especially during the early onsets of symptoms [6] . When a shortage in diagnostic kits in China happened, the Chinese health institutions diagnosed COVID-19 in a period in patients based on clinical symptoms alone, resulting in a major peak in the reported cases on February 12 th 2020 [7] . Because clinical symptoms for COVID-19 are sometimes non-specific (cough, mild fever, sore throat, fatigue), similar to other respiratory diseases or even absent despite infection [8, 9] , molecular testing for SARS-CoV-2 [9] is necessary for a more correct diagnosis. In our diagnostic laboratory, purification of oropharyngeal swabs from patients is usually performed using the MagNA Pure NA purification system and diagnosis of COVID-19 is subsequently performed using the .

Training that informs workers on what they can and cannot do can mitigate claims. risk analysis further lowers workplace vulnerability to lawsuits. 19 \u2022 Substance abuse (drugs/alcohol in the workplace). employee drug testing is widely used in industry. policies, procedures, consent forms, checklists, and training materials are needed for such programs. 20 \u2022 Business espionage/theft of trade secrets. For many organizations, the loss of crucial information is of greater importance than the fraudulent disappearance of products or supplies. These transgressions include espionage or theft of trade secrets, including developmental procedures and know-how. \u2022 Environmental/social robberies. robberies are categorized as the third most significant crime in the hierarchy of the FBI's Uniform Crime Reports. robbery is the taking or attempting to take anything of value from the care, custody, or control of someone. Force or threat of force of violence and putting the victim in fear is a characteristic of this crime. robbery mitigation is likely to succeed when risk mitigation is put into place. \u2022 Intellectual property/brand protection/product counterfeiting. The brand, product, and information of an organization are precious assets. Intellectual property can walk out the door or be accessed through a few keystrokes. Security practitioners are interested in preventing this loss and also investigating possible incursions early on to lessen the damage. 21 \u2022 Global supply chain security. The stealing of goods that are being transported or stored is an ongoing concern for product manufacturers and distributors. 22 Outright theft requires prompt investigation and response. Broad transportation issues include container tracking and transit point security. \u2022 Executive protection (including travel security). The protection of senior officials from risk has become a highly evolved skill that draws upon management planning and analysis. 23 protection choreography, advance security preparations, domestic and international travel assessment, and physical training are all involved in the process. \u2022 Insurance/workers' compensation fraud. Organizations that provide workers' compensation insurance sometimes encounter abuse, which requires investigation and response. A security program is generally tasked with investigating other incidents concerning insurance claims. \u2022 Crisis management and response: international terrorism. The bombings of the World Trade Center, the Boston Marathon, the Oklahoma City federal building, and public and private assets in various locales domestically and globally suggest the importance of measures to deter such attacks. 24 As a global activity, security planners look at risks from unstable parts of the world, and political risks from groups such as ISIS (or ISIL) that could destabilize the world and affect conventional operations. \u2022 Bombings/bomb threats. Bombings in the workplace are rare. Bomb threats are frequent. Security practitioners devise strategies to analyze and deal with threats as they are received.","However, our simulations suggest that even in the more optimistic scenario, where all the age groups reduce their contact rates over 85%, the epidemic is set to rebound once the social distancing interventions are lifted. Our results suggest that social distancing interventions can \"buy us\" several weeks that could prove to be essential to strengthen our health systems and restock medical supplies, but will fail to mitigate the current pandemic. This is in agreement with other modeling results which suggested that very long periods of social distancing would be needed to control transmission [20] . Yet, sustaining social distancing interventions over a period of several months might not be feasible, both economically and socially. A combination of social distancing interventions with testing, isolation and contact tracing of new cases is needed to suppress transmission of SARS-CoV-2 [30] . Further, these interventions need to happen in synchrony around the world, as a new imported case could spark a new outbreak in any given region.","In several countries with high-performing healthcare systems where SARS-CoV-2 transmission has been established earlier, both supplies of personal protective equipment in hospitals and the availability of services has been problematic for COVID-19 care, and in all locations, ICU bed capacity is limited. 18 Plans are urgently needed to mitigate the effect of COVID-19 outbreaks on the local healthcare system.","Preventing respiratory illness in long-term care facilities: Two or more clinical practice guidelines recommended the following: hand hygiene (n=13), wearing personal protective equipment (n=13), social distancing/isolation (n=13), disinfecting surfaces (n=12), droplet precautions (n=12), surveillance and evaluation (n=11), conducting diagnostic testing to confirm suspected respiratory illness (n=10), policies and procedures for visitors (n=9), respiratory hygiene/cough etiquette (n=9), policies and procedures for staff and/or residents (n=9), providing supplies (n=9), education of staff and/or residents (n=8), increasing communication (n=6), consulting or notifying health professionals (n=6), appropriate ventilation practices (n=2), and cohorting equipment (n=2) ( Table 2 , Appendix 6).

For the moment of the proofs correction of this article, Iran reached 14,991 cases, of them 3,774 in Tehran, 1,301 in Esfahan, and 1,023 in Qom (March 16, 2020). ","In December 2013, the largest ever epidemic of Ebola virus disease (EVD), started in Guinea and quickly spread to neighboring West African countries where it caused over 10,000 deaths until controlled March 2016. In March 2014, as part of global assistance efforts, the EU allocated funding and deployed medical and laboratory staff and supplies in West Africa. The European Mobile field Laboratory (EMLab), an initiative by the International Cooperation and Development Office of the European Commission, established field diagnostic facilities in the affected countries to support patient screening (24). Between March 2014 and October 2015, more than 19,000 samples were tested in these laboratories (24). Deployment of an EMLab unit close to an Ebola Treatment Unit decreased the average turnaround time from reception of a sample to diagnostic result to 4 h instead of several days. Several EU-funded laboratory networks worked to ensure capacity for testing suspected cases of EVD both in Africa and in travelers returning from the epidemic affected areas. These included the ENIVD network and the Joint Action \u201cQuality Assurance Exercises and Networking on the Detection of Highly Infectious Pathogens\u201d (QUANDHIP) which was co-funded by the European Commission and Member States. Both networks contributed expert staff to the EMLab activities in Africa. The ENIVD members participated in an ECDC EQA exercise for rapid molecular diagnosis of EVD (25). Until September 2015, QUANDHIP expert laboratories provided tests for 692 patients with suspected EVD in Europe (26). During the epidemic, five cases of EVD were confirmed in repatriated patients from West Africa and three new cases were diagnosed in the EU, including two travel-associated cases and one nosocomial case in a healthcare provider (27). These data confirmed that EVD patient isolation measures based on rapid diagnostics interrupt virus transmission and mitigate the risk of spread from patients evacuated to EU countries.","We argue that, though simplistic, our model demonstrates the urgent need to focus control efforts in the U.S. on preventing further domestic virus spread. In China, local outbreak dynamics were highly correlated with travel between Wuhan and the outbreak dynamics therein during the early months of the epidemic . Similarly, if interstate introductions are not curtailed in the U.S. with improved surveillance measures, more robust diagnostic capabilities, and proper clinical care, quelling local transmission within states will be a Sisyphean task. We therefore propose that a unified effort to detect and prevent new COVID-19 cases will be essential for mitigating the risk of future domestic outbreaks. This effort must ensure that states have sufficient personal protective equipment, sample collection materials, and testing reagents, as these supplies enable effective surveillance. Finally, stateand local-level policymakers must recognize that the health and well-being of their constituents are contingent on that of the nation. If spread between states is now common, as our results indicate, the U.S. will struggle to control COVID-19 in the absence of a unified surveillance strategy.","All consecutive patients with confirmed or suspected 2019 novel coronavirus infection disease (COVID-19) according to WHO interim guidance admitted in Wuhan No.1 Hospital from 25 th December 2019 to 15 th February 2020 were retrospectively screened. Wuhan No.1 Hospital is a reginal comprehensively central hospital which was responsible for the treatments for COVID-19 assigned by the government since 14 th February 2020. Before 14 th February 2020, patients with confirm or suspected COVID-19 were transferred to designated hospital after initial treatment. A portion of suspected patients with COVID-19 at the early stage of the outbreak did not receive severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RT-PCR testing due to the limited supplies of diagnostic detection reagents. Patients who underwent hs-cTnI test within 48 hours after admission were included. Oral consents of all patients were obtained. This study was approved by the Wuhan No.1 Hospital institutional ethics committee. A comparison between non-survivors and survivor had been done and characteristics between patients who were included or not were also compared.","Research on interventions to prevent or mitigate pandemics has assessed their effectiveness, using modelling45 46 or empirical evidence,47 48 on their indirect effects,49 50 their economic impacts51 52 and the legal and ethical issues surrounding their use.53 This paper presents what we believe to be one of the first studies to measure the preferences of members of the public for control policies that form part of established pandemic preparedness plans.","Physicians providing direct care to SARS patients reported greater psychological distress, greater stigmatization, and greater concern regarding contagion to family than physicians not providing such care. Because all physicians are at increased risk of contracting SARS, providing support and disseminating scientific findings in a timely fashion may potentially mitigate these negative effects. Future research is required to determine what policies or interventions could be instituted to support physicians working under such uncertain conditions, particularly those physicians providing direct care to suspected or probable SARS patients.","Since 31 December 2019, when the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission reported 27 cases of viral pneumonia, including 7 critically ill cases, the pneumonia outbreak has received considerable global attention. A novel coronavirus was identified as the causative agent by the Chinese authorities on 7 January 2020, and on 10 January 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) designated the novel coronavirus as 2019-nCoV. On the same day, the WHO released a wide range of interim guidance for all countries on how they can get prepared for coping with this emergency, including how to monitor for potentially infected people, collect and test samples, manage patients, control and mitigate the burden generated by the infection in health centers, maintain the right drug supplies and effectively communicate with the lay public regarding the new virus [12].","WHO is monitoring the fast-evolving situation of the COVID-19 epidemic and needs to advise the countries in the malaria-endemic regions on how to establish and effectively execute public health policies. Preventive measures for COVID-19, including case and contact tracing, quarantine and screening, as well as education to encourage good hand hygiene practices, should be in place. Additional and pre-emptive measures must be taken for malaria control in these countries, anticipating the potential challenge that would be faced by the public health system during an outbreak of COVID-19. In the case of Ebola, it was estimated that malaria cases in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone could have increased by up to 1 million in 2014 as a result of a cessation of distribution of insecticide-treated bednets (ITNs). 10 Governments and health leaders in malaria-endemic regions must ensure that such stresses to medical infrastructure are minimised in the event of an outbreak of COVID-19. Resource allocation should be optimised whenever possible to ensure minimal disruption to malaria control should COVID-19 management become necessary. Management of medical supplies and stockpiling of surgical masks and other protective equipment should be done in advance and medical staff should be adequately trained in their use. In cases of emergency, mass drug administration and the distribution of ITNs might be considered for short-term malaria relief in hyperendemic areas. Such measures would also aid efforts in COVID-19 management by reducing the strain on medical resources and minimising confounding factors in diagnosis. Previous successful implementation of such measures occurred during Ebola outbreaks in Sierra Leone in 2014-15 and in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in 2018, in accordance with WHO guidelines. 11, 12 In malaria-endemic regions, malaria diagnostics should be systematically added to fever management, including for suspected cases of COVID-19, and health-care facilities should be well stocked with artemisinin combination therapy drugs. Infection management protocols, such as social distancing, mask-wearing, and prompt seeking of diagnostic testing and necessary treatment, should be communicated in advance. These measures will require collective political will and unity in a coordinated effort by African countries.","Evaluate and Manage HCP with Symptoms of Respiratory Illness Implement sick leave policies that are non-punitive, flexible, and consistent with public health policies that allow ill HCP to stay home. As part of routine practice, ask HCP (including consultant personnel) to regularly monitor themselves for fever and symptoms of respiratory infection. Remind HCP to stay home when they are ill. If HCP develop fever or symptoms of respiratory infection while at work, they should immediately put on a facemask, inform their supervisor, and leave the workplace. Consult occupational health on decisions about further evaluation and return to work. When transmission in the community is identified, nursing homes and assisted living facilities may face staffing shortages. Facilities should develop (or review existing) plans to mitigate staffing shortages.","We avoid to fit model to data in conventional way. Instead, we use a simple model framework to discuss what elements might be needed. For instance, in order to achieve a good fitting performance, one obviously needs to include a time-varying report rate (as we reconstructed in Figure 4b ), which was caused by the availability of medical supplies, hospital capacities and changing testing/reporting policies. Thus it would be challenging given a relatively short time series, and several other unknown parameters to be estimated. We employ some parameter estimates from the 1918 influenza pandemic, given the similar characteristics of COVID-19 and influenza (most cases are mild) and the similar level of mitigation. Transmission from asymptotically infected cases is reported but the contribution of asymptomatic transmission is unclear (presumably small), which shall be further investigated in future studies.","To mitigate the spread of the virus, Chinese Government has implemented extremely serious quarantine prevention measures since Jan 23, 2020. All 31 provincial-level regions in China announced the highest public health alert. The extremely serious prevention measures are taken to mitigate the epidemic spreading, such as: Group tours, travel packages are suspended across China; Mass gatherings are all cancelled; Spring Festival holiday is extended; the start of Spring semester is postponed; Mask wearing is required at public place; temperature screening measures to detect individuals with fever have adopted at airports, train stations and Highway entrance, as well as entrance of community.","is the (which was not peer-reviewed) The copyright holder for this preprint . https: //doi.org/10.1101 //doi.org/10. /2020 How far will this epidemic go and what policies should be put in place to control and mitigate the risks very much depends on understanding the true magnitude of the epidemic.","The estimates above describe the superposition of all policies deployed in each country, i.e. they represent, for each country, the average effect of policies on infection growth rates that we would expect to observe, if all policies enacted anywhere in the country were implemented simultaneously in a region of the country. We also estimate the effects of individual types of policies or clusters of policies that are grouped based on their similarity in goal (e.g., closing libraries and closing 5 . museums are grouped) or timing (e.g., policies that are generally deployed simultaneously in a certain country). In many cases, our estimates for these effects are statistically noisier than the estimates for all policies combined (presented above) because we are estimating multiple effects simultaneously. Thus, we are less confident in individual estimates and in their relative rankings. Estimated effects differ between countries, and policies are neither identical nor perfectly comparable in their implementation across countries or, in many cases, across different localities within the same country. Nonetheless, overall we estimate that almost all policies likely contribute to slowing the growth rate of infections (Figure 2c ), except two policies (social distancing in France and Italy) where point estimates are slightly positive, small in magnitude, and not statistically different from zero.","Heating of the oropharyngeal swabs for 5 min. at 98\u02daC followed by cooling for 2 min. at 4\u02daC prior to a SARS-CoV-2 RT-qPCR reaction is not as sensitive or accurate as RT-qPCR reactions performed on purified samples. However, during a time where the spread of SARS-CoV-2 is so immense and molecular testing is critically challenged by the limited supplied of reagents for NA purification we may use alternative diagnostic methods. Simply heating of the samples could serve as an easy, fast and inexpensive alternative to chemical extraction kits, which would detect 97.4% of the COVID-19 positive patients with no false positives.","Understanding how to mitigate the epidemic will require accessing and linking data about causes and consequences of this 'insult' across sectors including education, economy, transport. This is required in order to rapidly learn how to effectively respond to the COVID-19 epidemic. Social distancing policies may themselves influence the background mortality risks, as people may be less likely to access health and social care, and because social isolation has in many previous studies been shown to be associated with the onset and progression of cardiovascular and other diseases (34) . Thus it is possible that we may have under-estimated the true 1-year mortality risks. It is not known whether sudden and systematic social distancing (35, 36) , particularly if prolonged over months, has different or additional health consequences, compared to those reported from earlier studies of 'social isolation.","to initiate social distancing, which arises as an interesting and potentially useful feature of a simple epidemiological model. Our hope is that these insights inspire other researchers to investigate the existence of optimal (or just more effective) times to implement social distancing measures within the context of more complex and data-driven epidemiological models, as to better serve decision makers developing strategic policies to mitigate the extent of current and future epidemics.","Before delving into the details of the proposed procedure, a word of caution is needed since, unfortunately, a visual inspection of the database suggests the presence of a number of anomalous data both at a regional and country level. The detected anomalies might be associated to the biological samples collecting process and the testing procedures. In fact, the typical lab-workflow is governed by a set of rigid protocols which might be critically affected by factors such as the availability of manpower, swabs, reagents and other laboratory materials. In emergency situations, such a workflow can be disrupted and temporal inconsistency might appear as a result. For example, a set of samples might be delivered to a laboratory with longer than usual delays with respect to the time of collection or a given lab can only complete a screening process for a certain number of samples. In both the cases, one day (or more) shift in the release of the lab results can be reasonably expected. A further source of anomalies is represented by the data entry and data editing processes, carried out in working environment necessarily affected by the risk of contagious and under rigid deadlines."," With adherence to the existing WHO mass gathering guidelines, governments have a narrow window to mitigate the spread of the novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV), optimize their healthcare system, and maintain the people's trust in their government. ","As the number of cases grew, the Iranian government started to increase the stringency of its response. The first case was reported on February 19, 2020 (two individuals who both were reported to have died that day). The next day, school closures were announced in the province of Qom and travel in the region was discouraged. By February 22, 2020 the government closed schools in 14 provinces and closed down major gathering sites such as football matches and theaters. By March 5, 2020 schools were closed nationwide and government employees were required to work from home. Home isolation was implemented by the military on March 13, 2020, which the media described as \"the near-curfew follows growing exasperation among MPs that calls for Iranian citizens to stay at home had been widely ignored, as people continued to travel before the Nowruz New Year holidays.\" 104 United States For the United States' policy response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we relied on a number of sources, including the U.S. Center for Disease Control (CDC), individual state health departments, as well as various press releases from county and city-level government or media outlets. The CDC has posted and continually updated a Community Mitigation Framework that encompasses both mandatory and recommended policies at a national level. This framework was interpreted by individual states as 105 106 they each declared their own States of Emergency at various dates, and subsequently released their own community mitigation plans. Some of the first states to release such plans include Massachusetts, California, Florida, Washington, and New York. Each respective Community 107 Mitigation Framework included both mandatory and optional policies to prevent the COVID-19 spread. In addition to both national and federal level policies and recommendations, cities and counties have also taken on the role of providing guidance and implementing policies to mitigate the spread of COVID-19.","Many sociological factors may also contribute to the emergence/reemergence and spread of viral diseases. Some of these factors include inadequate public health infrastructures, a lack of access to vaccinations or reduced immunization policies (see In-Depth Look), and political conflict or wars that displace millions of people, creating overcrowded refugee populations without access to basic health care or clean water supplies.","Samples were collected between February 7 -February 27, 2020, while the outbreak was ongoing. Three sets of surface samples were collected using dacron swabs across major hospital function zones, hospital equipment/objects and medical supplies, and HCW's used PPE. Swab samples were also collected from control areas (i.e., spaces that did not house COVID-19 patients, consisting of administrative areas and the parking lot). Dacron swabs were premoistened with cell preservation solution. Samples were shipped with ice packs and refrigerated upon arrival at the laboratory. Blank controls were also used in swab sampling. Medical equipment assessed consisted of finger clips of pulse oximetry, electrocardiogram monitors, oxygen cylinders, oxygen regulators, oxygen masks, CT scanning machine, centrifuge, .

Specifically, we have estimated time-delay adjusted CFR in three different 154 geographic areas in Korea and found that the most severely affected areas were Gyeongsangbuk-do while 155 the rest of Korea exhibits milder severity impact. Specifically, the delay-adjusted CFR in Gyeongsangbuk-156 do, largely driven by hospital-based transmission, was relatively high, being estimated at 2.4% (95% CrI: 157 1.6-3.4%), which is about 2-fold higher than our estimate for Daegu and for all regions in Korea. These 158 findings suggest that the situation in Gyeongsangbuk-do is more severe compared with the other affected 159 areas in Korea. 160","While loss clearly helped increase the formation of security programs in banking and aviation, many other industries were developing security programs without the force of directive legislation. For example, no legislation requires the retail industry to engage in security measures; however, substantial measurable losses in retailing have produced a cadre of managers who evaluate losses and forcefully seek to mitigate them. The same holds true for other aspects of commerce and industry -public, private, and not-forprofit sectors alike. Nonaviation transporters, distributors, mining and processing facilities, and a myriad of service organizations have all enhanced their security policies and systems.","As researchers all over toil hard for an effective anti-viral and vaccine against COVID-19, the psychological impact of the illness is largely neglected. Pandemics like this, are not just a medical phenomenon; they tend to affect quality of life in an individual and as a whole, causing social dysfunction. Stigma, xenophobia, mass hysteria and panic are the common offshoots. As the global prevalence increases, people start hoarding medical supplies, isolate themselves physically, restrict social interaction and enter into a constant state of health-anxiety even over mild conditions that can mimic the illness, like common cold (Duan and Zhu, 2020) . People with mental illness are especially vulnerable to these effects, as are the health-care workers in hospitals and laboratories, the volunteers and social service personnel and those quarantined for prolonged duration. Recent literature states that even though online and at-site psychological services have been initiated in China, the lack of sensitization and training in mental health often adversely affect the performance and health outcome of the medical staff there (Chen et al., 2020) .","Development of a real-time NASBA for human metapneumovirus E. Bufflier, H. Savelli, F. Jacobs, C. Moore, P. Van de Wiel (Grenoble, FR; Boxtel, NL; Cardiff, UK) Objective: The aim was to develop and evaluate human Metapneumovirus (hMPV) reagents based on NASBA amplification and real-time detection with molecular beacons. Methods: hMPV RNA is isolated using a semi automated magnetic extraction method (NucliSens\u00d2 miniMag). An internal control is added to the sample prior to nucleic acid extraction. Primers are directed against the M-gene region of the hMPV genome (subtypes A1, A2, B1 and B2), and against the internal control molecule. A FAM-labelled molecular beacon probe is used to detect hMPV amplicons, while a ROX-labelled molecular beacon is designed to detect the internal control amplicons, amplified in the same reaction. Amplification and real-time detection reactions are performed in a NucliSens\u00d2 EasyQ Analyser. The extraction and amplification-detection reactions to detect hMPV in nasal swab samples can be performed within approximately 3.0 hours. Results: The analytical sensitivity of the NASBA reaction was determined to be close to 10 copies per input (90% hit rate) using serial dilutions of in vitro hMPV RNA in direct amplification, while in combination with extraction, the sensitivity was found to be 263 copies per input (90% hit rate). No cross reactivity was observed with PIV 1, PIV 2, PIV 3, PIV 4, RSV A, RSV B, Sars CoV, Influenza A and Influenza B. The NASBA real time reagents to detect both hMPV and RSV were further investigated in a clinical study performed in Cardiff in 2004-2005. Amongst 1158 clinical respiratory samples tested (Nasopharyngeal Swabs, Nasal Swabs, Throat Swabs and Nasopharyngeal Aspirates) the NASBA allowed to detect 22 hMPV positive samples (ca. 2%). Finally, the efficiency of the method to detect the four A1, A2, B1 and B2 subtypes of hMPV was demonstrated on viral stocks.","Differences in the positive detection rates of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the surface swabs between hospital areas, hospital objects and medical supplies, and HCW's used PPE were assessed using Chi-Square tests and/or the Fisher's exact test where appropriate based on cell size. Two-tailed tests were used, and Pvalues smaller than 0.05 were considered statistically significant.","This study provided evidence of human\u2013animal interactions in rural communities of southern China that increase the potential for zoonotic disease emergence and suggested opportunities for risk mitigation. Population migration from rural communities to urban areas for employment, as well as the wild animal protection policy changes in China in recent years, have led to a perceived overall reduction in activities such as household animal raising and wildlife trade.30,31 Protective attitudes, knowledge and a supportive social environment for disease prevention were reportedly being developed within the community.31 Existing local preliminary programmes and policies around human and animal health, community development and conservation are considered effective resources to begin or continue developing cost-effective strategies to mitigate zoonotic risks.","Individual behaviour will be crucial to control the spread of COVID-19. Personal, rather than government action, in western democracies might be the most important issue. Early self-isolation, seeking medical advice remotely unless symptoms are severe, and social distancing are key. Government actions to ban mass gatherings are important, as are good diagnostic facilities and remotely accessed health advice, together with specialised treatment for people with severe disease. Isolating towns or even cities is not yet part of the UK Government action plan. 15 This plan is light on detail, given the early stages of the COVID-19 epidemic and the many uncertainties, but it outlines four phases of action entitled contain, delay, research, and mitigate. 15 The UK has just moved from contain to delay, which aims to flatten the epidemic and lower peak morbidity and mortality. If measures are relaxed after a few months to avoid severe economic impact, a further peak is likely to occur in the autumn (figure). Italy, South Korea, Japan, and Iran are at the mitigate phase and trying to provide the best care possible for a rapidly growing number of people with COVID-19.","Despite the evidence of the importance of mass gatherings for disease transmission from intuition and individual outbreaks, the population-level impact of different mass gathering policies has not been established. While systematic reviews have identified outbreak reports involving mass gatherings [5, 6] , the overall impact of mass gatherings could not be quantitatively assessed. A detailed modelling study of disease transmission in the state of Georgia, USA, found that in extreme scenarios when 25% of the population participated in a 2day long gathering shortly before the epidemic peak, peak prevalence could increase by up to 10% [8] . More realistic scenarios resulted in minimal population-level changes [8] .","As chloroquine has significant adverse events, effective short-course dosing are very important. Moreover, both of these drugs are prescribed for weeks to months for various indications. Other antiviral drugs in pipeline may not be very useful as their productions and supplies to the developing countries may require lengthy timeframe whereas mass production of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine is already in place in malaria endemic developing countries.","Several rapid and sensitive detection tests have been developed for the prevention and control of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak. At present, seven products including the SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid detection kit (fluorescent PCR method) and the SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid sequencing system have been approved on an emergency basis by the National Medical Products Administration. Biological product companies have Y. Yang, et al. Journal of Autoimmunity xxx (xxxx) xxxx expanded production of detection kits for the new coronavirus. The use of detection kits can accelerate accurate diagnosis of patients, help to determine quarantine and isolation requirements, assist in determining the treatment of patients and save limited medical resources. However, the rapidity of spread of the disease has led to an insufficient supply of detection kits. It is worth noting that there have been confirmed patients whose viral nucleic acid tests are negative multiple times in the early stages, and there have also been confirmed cases whose throat swabs were negative for the viral nucleic acid test but positive in alveolar lavage fluid. Correlation of Chest CT and RT-PCR testing of 1014 cases showed that CT had a 88% had a positive CT scan but only 59% had positive RT-PCR. [86] . The poor sensitivity of the current tests makes diagnosis and epidemic control more challenging. Sampling techniques, extraction and detection of viral nucleic acids, and diagnostic reagents may affect the test results. More attention should be paid to the sensitivity and specificity of diagnostic reagents, and diagnostic decisions should rely on comprehensive judgment based on the clinical manifestations, laboratory results and imaging examinations of patients. According to the latest guideline of the NHC [82] , if the suspected cases in Hubei Province have imaging characteristic of pneumonia, the CT image results can be used as a basis for \"clinical diagnosis cases\".","Reagents and solvents were purchased from Wako Pure Chemical Ind., Ltd. (Osaka, Japan), and Aldrich Chemical Co. Inc. (Milwaukee, WI) and were used without further purification. Analytical thin-layer chromatography (TLC) was performed on Merck Silica Gel 60F254 pre-coated plates. Preparative HPLC was performed using a C18 reverse-phase column (19 \u00c2 150 mm; Sun-Fire Prep C18 All other chemicals were of analytical grade or better. 1 H and 13 C NMR spectra were obtained using a JEOL 400 MHz spectrometer, a Varian Mercury 300 spectrometer (300 MHz), or a BRUKER AV600 spectrometer (600 MHz) with tetramethylsilane as an internal standard. High-resolution mass spectra (ESI or EI) were recorded on a micromass Q-Tof Ultima API or a JEOL JMS-GCmate BU-20 spectrometer. Mass spectra (ESI) were recorded on an LCMS-2010EV (SHIMADZU).","The UK parliament formalized Brexit -divorce from the EUat the end of January 2020. The type of manpower mobility arrangements for health workers due to be negotiated by the end of 2020 between the UK and EU will have a specific and important bearing on the already hard-pressed medical services in the UK [6] . There remains additional uncertainty following Brexit about arrangements for continuity of supplies of medicines, regulation of medicinal products and transnational access to new medicines across the region [7] . Trade and tariff barriers arising from evolving isolationist policies of the USA are also likely to restrict progress on implementation and the health impact of achieving the UN's Sustainable Development Goals, not least through increased international costs of diagnostics, devices and medicines.","If the reagent is not FDA approved, additional testing may be needed to ensure its safety and quality. Appropriate testing will depend on how and when during the manufacturing scheme the specific reagent is used. Additional testing may include safety testing (sterility, endotoxin, mycoplasma, and adventitious agents) and functional analysis, purity, and other assays to demonstrate absence of potentially harmful substances. In addition, there should be a description of test procedures for detection of residual levels of reagents in the final product.","The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.02.20030189 doi: medRxiv preprint 6 remains largely unknown. To mitigate this knowledge gap, and to provide scientific analysis on the benefit of antibody testing when used in combination with the current RNA testing, this study investigates the dynamics of total antibody (Ab), IgM and IgG antibody against SARS-CoV-2 in serial blood samples collected from 173 confirmed COVID-19 patients and provides discussion on the clinical value of antibody testing. Written informed consent was obtained from each enrolled patient.","There is little modern health care experience with respiratory mass casualties of this scale. However, it is apparent that the mortality, morbidity, and public confidence in the time of an airborne pandemic are likely to be highly dependent on the critical care response. It is therefore imperative for critical care providers to take the lead in planning and preparing for largescale airborne epidemics and pandemics. Issues to be considered include developing triage protocols, augmenting ICU surge staffing, implementing rational infection control measures, stockpiling medical equipment and supplies, and information sharing among many units.","Although the World Health Organization recommends that only positively-confirmed patients should wear medical masks to mitigate COVID-19 transmission, Vietnam is the first country to legalize the behaviors of using medical masks in public. It is not an optional choice anymore. Since this regulation becomes effective, the Vietnamese citizens have to self-protect by wearing medical masks in the public area. However, the use of medical masks as one of the prevention methods is still debatable. For example, Leung et al. (2020) suggested that there should have guidance for mass masking. However, WHO recommends that there exists a lack of evidence (WHO, 2020). Up to date, health authorities suggest social distancing, hand-washing, and so forth.","As the number of infections increasing, the lack of clear and definite information of virus from the media, the shortage of medical workers and resources, and the lack of masks and protecting supplies in the marketplace resulted in the Chinese people, especially Wuhan residents, suffering intense anxiety due to the uncertainty and insecurity they experienced in the first several weeks. Since the metropolitan-wide quarantine of Wuhan and surrounding cities, which began Jan 23-24, 2020, people bombarded with various discomforting network information, the mental health of public in Wuhan and surrounding cities should not be overlooked either. Although the psychosocial impact will cause a huge impediment to COVID-19 control in these regions, there are barely reports focusing on it so far, except that the local government of Wuhan has implemented policies to address these mental health problems for medical works (Kang et al., 2020) .","Extraction of RNA was performed with Roche MagNa Pure LC (RNA Viral isolation Kit). Sputum samples were pretreated with 2 9 lysis buffer for 30 min in a shaking incubator. Swabs were placed in lysis buffer. Two hundred microlitres of each sample was added to the MagNA Pure LC plate, which contains 96 wells. Reaction reagents were then loaded and checked, before the samples were run according to the manufacturer's instructions for nucleic acid extraction in the specimen area.","Considering that numerous factors cause shortages, a univocal problem-solving strategy cannot be established at the European level. The needs of big-pharmaceutical markets, such as Germany (Said et al., 2018) or Italy (Di Giorgio et al., 2019) , are far from those of small ones like as Finland (Heiskanen et al., 2017) . Moreover, excessive fragmentation of the National regulatory frameworks may be itself a cause of drug shortage. The relationship between the price policies and availability of medicinal products is known (Dave et al., 2018; De Weerdt et al., 2015b) . Considering the different reimbursement policies of Member States (WHO, 2018) , the price of the same medicinal product may vary significantly around Europe. In this context, the exportation of drug products to more profitable markets (e.g., parallel trade) is frequently cited as one of the demand-related causes of drug shortages (De Weerdt et al., 2015b) . Noteworthy, such a cause-effect relationship is still debated (Aguiar and Ernest, 2020) . The importation of medicinal products from other EU or extra-EU countries is also the most common strategy to mitigate the adverse effects of severe shortages (Said et al., 2018) . Notably, small European countries might not be profitable enough for MAHs to justify building new manufacturing sites and marketing medicinal products. In this context, for justified public health reasons, the National Regulatory Authorities can adopt regulatory pathways to speed up the release of the marketing authorization (e.g., Art. 126a of Directive 2001/83/EC) and, therefore, to make medicines available on the National market. Otherwise, parallel trade can be a possible solution to ensure the patients' access to treatments. For example, besides the granting of National marketing authorizations, a small English-speaking country like Malta ensures its medicines' supply mainly by Art. 126a authorizations, while parallel import licences contribute only to the residual needs (less than 10%) (Farrugia, 2018) . Indeed, the application of Art. 126a permits the MAHs of products already authorized in other English-speaking EU countries (e.g., UK, Ireland) to have easy access to the Maltese market. However, Brexit (EMA, 2019a) and some concurrent updates of the European regulatory framework might worsen such a delicate balance. For example, the new medicine traceability system introduced in the EU by the Regulation (EU) 2016/161 increased the costs of both the production and the distribution of medicinal products, affecting the economic sustainability of the all actors involved in the pharmaceutical supply chain (e.g., MAHs, parallel distributors). The potential repercussions on patients' access to treatments in the more fragile EU countries are foreseeable, especially in the case of low-price medicinal products (e.g., generics).","Notice that the reproduction number would be different, if we consider the whole susceptible population without isolating the detected ones. By inspecting Eq. (16), we observe that we can move towards a disease free state corresponding to R 0 \u2264 1 by either reducing k i or increasing k d . The former can be enforced by mitigation policies such as social distancing, while the latter can be attained by mass testing of asymptomatic individuals.","Finally, we have analyzed how many tests are needed to mitigate the Covid-19 pandemic. How can we achieve the 1.7666-fold increased detection rate modeled in Fig. 6c ? To answer this central question, we have studied the relationship between the detection rate k d , i.e., the rate of the identification of infected persons by testing (or by onset of severe symptoms), and the testing interval of the susceptible population.","While more and more affected populations are moving from containment towards risk mitigation plans for Covid-19, it is important to understand the engaged mechanisms underlying this pandemic-spread. Outcomes of social distancing : social distancing phase with 70% lower infection rate (50 to 100 days) followed by one year of high frequency testing with a 1.7666 times higher detection rate. Dashed lines represent the immune (n s,init \u2212 n s (t)), dash-dotted lines the infected (n i|u + n i|d ) and solid lines the deceased (n k ) population; on the top with linear and in the middle with logarithmic scaling. In the bottom logarithmic plots the detected infected population (dotted lines) is shown together with the intensive care unit capacity (horizontal long dashed lines). The values are in % of the initial susceptible population size and are plotted over number of days.

It is found that the latter can significantly reduce the percentage of people getting infected and the death toll. It is important to emphasize here that more testing has to be applied to individuals without symptoms, since those with symptoms contain themselves automatically in most cases. As improved testing capacities are built up, our approach may help to decide when alternative mitigation methods may not only complement, but eventually replace the current social distancing regime. This may help to minimize the socio-economical impacts resulting from severe social isolation policies. While social distancing is currently essential, it is of utmost importance that the testing capabilities are upgraded such that they cover large portions of affected populations in the near future."],"title":["The cancellation of mass gatherings (MGs)?
