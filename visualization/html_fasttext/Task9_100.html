The public tends to view community pharmacists as businesspeople. Several factors influence individuals' willingness to patronize and to continue visiting such pharmacies. On the supply side, community pharmacists' responsibilities and duties center on the health and well-being of society. In this chapter, an assessment of community pharmacy practices in developing countries is particularly interesting in terms of medication dispensing and extended pharmacy services that promote public wellness. Community pharmacists in developing countries, who are supposedly strategically positioned in the community to provide public health, are not taking advantage on this opportunity. Although several studies have noted the services provided by community pharmacists, in general, the practice is far from meeting expectations due to several barriers. Pharmacists need to realize their opportunities and ...","Objective To provide an overview of supply and demand issues in the vaccine industry and the policy options that have been implemented to resolve these issues. Data sources Medline, Policy File, and International Pharmaceutical Abstracts were searched to locate academic journal articles. Other sources reviewed included texts on the topics of vaccine history and policy, government agency reports, and reports from independent think tanks. Keywords included vaccines, immunizations, supply, demand, and policy. Study selection Search criteria were limited to English language and human studies. Articles pertaining to vaccine demand, supply, and public policy were selected and reviewed for inclusion. Data extraction By the authors. Data synthesis Vaccines are biologic medications, therefore making their development and production more difficult and costly compared with \u201csmall-molecule\u201d drugs. Research and development costs for vaccines can exceed $800 million, and development may require 10 y...","Any plan for stopping the ongoing 2019-nCov epidemic must be based on a quantitative understanding of the proportion of the at-risk population that needs to be protected by effective control measures in order for transmission to decline sufficiently and quickly enough for the epidemic to end. Using an SEIR-type transmission model, we contrasted two alternate strategies by modeling the proportion of the population that needs to be protected from infection by one-time vaccination (assuming 100% effectiveness) or by testing with isolation and treatment of individuals within six, 24, or 48 hours of symptom onset. If R is currently 2.2, vaccination at the herd immunity coverage of 55% would drive R just below 1, but transmission could persist for years. Over 80% of coverage is required to end the epidemic in 6 months with population-wide vaccination. The epidemic could be ended in just under a year if testing with isolation and treatment reached 80% of symptomatically infected patients with...","Timely detection of novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection cases is crucial to interrupt the spread of this virus. We assessed the required expertise and capacity for molecular detection of 2019-nCoV in specialised laboratories in 30 European Union/European Economic Area (EU/EEA) countries. Thirty-eight laboratories in 24 EU/EEA countries had diagnostic tests available by 29 January 2020. A coverage of all EU/EEA countries was expected by mid-February. Availability of primers/probes, positive controls and personnel were main implementation barriers.","Accreditation is an internationally recognised process through which healthcare organisations are able to improve the safety and quality of services delivered to patients. The focus of accreditation is to help organisations understand what they are doing well and what opportunities are available for improvement. The Canadian approach to accreditation is a rigorous peer review process comprised of a self-assessment against a set of standards, an on-site survey and follow-up action on recommendations that arise from the survey. The accreditation standards can be used effectively to guide the surgical teams in the transformation of the specialty. The 17 standards that are used to evaluate surgical teams relate to the activities that represent the continuum of clinical care as well as aspects related to learning. Within the subsections and standards are opportunities for surgeons and surgical teams to use the standards to effectively deliver services and to continuously improve patient car...","BACKGROUND: Strategies are urgently needed to mitigate the risk of zoonotic disease emergence in southern China, where pathogens with zoonotic potential are known to circulate in wild animal populations. However, the risk factors leading to emergence are poorly understood, which presents a challenge in developing appropriate mitigation strategies for local communities. METHODS: Residents in rural communities of Yunnan, Guangxi and Guangdong provinces were recruited and enrolled in this study. Data were collected through ethnographic interviews and field observations, and thematically coded and analysed to identify both risk and protective factors for zoonotic disease emergence at the individual, community and policy levels. RESULTS: Eighty-eight ethnographic interviews and 55 field observations were conducted at nine selected sites. Frequent human\u2013animal interactions and low levels of environmental biosecurity in local communities were identified as risks for zoonotic disease emergence...","","While coronaviruses were first identified nearly 60 years ago, they received notoriety in 2003 when one of their members was identified as the etiological agent of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV) 1. Previously these viruses were known to be important agents of respiratory and enteric infections of domestic and companion animals and to cause approximately 15% of all cases of the common cold. This Review focuses on recent advances in our understanding of the mechanisms of coronavirus replication, interactions with the host immune response and disease pathogenesis and highlights the recent identification of numerous novel coronaviruses and the propensity of this virus family to cross species barriers.","The past century witnessed a rapid development of respiratory medicine in China. The major burden of respiratory disease has shifted from infectious diseases to chronic noninfectious diseases. Great achievements have been made in improving the national standard of clinical management of various respiratory diseases and in smoking control. The specialty of respiratory medicine is expanding into pulmonary and critical care medicine. Nevertheless, respiratory diseases remain a major public health problem, with new challenges such as air pollution and nosocomial infections. This review describes the history, accomplishments, new challenges, and opportunities in respiratory medicine in China.","Exotic and emerging viral pathogens associated with high morbidity and mortality in humans are being identified annually with recent examples including Lujo virus in southern Africa, Severe Fever with Thrombocytopenia Syndrome virus in China and a SARS-like coronavirus in the Middle East. The sporadic nature of these infections hampers our understanding of these diseases and limits the opportunities to design appropriate medical countermeasures against them. Because of this, animal models are utilized to gain insight into the pathogenesis of disease with the overall goal of identifying potential targets for intervention and evaluating specific therapeutics and vaccines. For these reasons it is imperative that animal models of disease recapitulate the human condition as closely as possible in order to provide the best predictive data with respect to the potential efficacy in humans. In this article we review the current status of disease models for highly pathogenic and emerging viral p...","Background We aimed to investigate the frequency of standard precautions (SPs) compliance and the factors affecting the compliance among nursing students (NSs). Methods A cross-sectional survey study guided by the health belief model was conducted in 2009. The study questionnaire is valid (content validity index, 0.81) and reliable (Cronbach \u03b1 range, 0.65-0.94). Results There were 678 questionnaires analyzed, with a response rate of 68.9%. The mean frequency score of SPs compliance was 4.38 \u00b1 0.40 out of 5. Tukey honest significant difference post hoc test indicated that year 2 and year 4 students had better SPs compliance than year 3 students. Further analysis using a univariate general linear model identified an interaction effect of perceived influence of nursing staff and year of study (F1,593 = 3.72; P &lt; .05). The 5 following predictors for SPs compliance were identified: knowledge of SPs, perceived barriers, adequacy of training, management support, and influence of nursing staff...","The large outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) that started in Wuhan, China has now spread to many countries worldwide. Current epidemiologic knowledge suggests that relatively few cases are seen among children, which limits opportunities to address pediatric specific issues on infection control and the children's contribution to viral spread in the community. Here, we report the first pediatric case of COVID-19 in Korea. The 10-year-old girl was a close contact of her uncle and her mother who were confirmed to have COVID-19. In this report, we present mild clinical course of her pneumonia that did not require antiviral treatment and serial viral test results from multiple specimens. Lastly, we raise concerns on the optimal strategy of self-quarantine and patient care in a negative isolation room for children.","","","Background Traditional infection control policies have focused on engineering controls, specific protocols, and personal protective equipment (PPE). In light of the variable success in protecting health care workers (HCWs) from Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2003, organizational and individual factors related to self-protective behavior in health care settings may also play an important role. Methods A critical review of the literature was conducted, directed at understanding what organizational and individual factors are important in protecting HCWs from infectious diseases at work. Results Organizational factors, such as a positive safety climate, have been associated with increased HCW adherence to universal precautions. There is some evidence that appropriate training of HCWs could be effective in changing HCW behavior if appropriate follow-up is applied. Very little research into these factors has been conducted with regard to preventing exposures to respiratory tract...","Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) was the first natural disaster that challenged the Chinese people at the beginning of the twenty-first century. It was caused by a novel animal coronavirus, never recognized or characterized before. This SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) exploited opportunities provided by \u2018wet markets\u2019 in southern China to adapt to the palm civet and human. Under the positive selection pressure of human host, certain mutated lineages of the virus became readily transmissible between humans and thus caused the epidemic of 2002\u20132003. This review will provide first-hand information, particularly from Guangdong, China, about the initial epidemiology, the identification of the aetiological agent of the disease, the molecular evolution study of the virus, the finding of SARS-like CoV in horseshoe bats and the mechanistic analysis for the cross-host tropism transition. The substantial scientific contributions made by the Chinese scientists towards understanding the virus an...","Public health preparedness requires effective surveillance of and rapid response to infectious disease outbreaks. Inclusion of research activities within the outbreak setting provides important opportunities to maximize limited resources, to enhance gains in scientific knowledge, and ultimately to increase levels of preparedness. With rapid advances in laboratory technologies, banking and analysis of human genomic specimens can be conducted as part of public health investigations, enabling valuable research well into the future.","On the basis of a semi-realistic SIR microsimulation for Germany and Poland, we show that the R0 parameter interval for which the COVID-19 epidemic stays overcritical but below the capacity limit of the health care system to reach herd immunity is so narrow that a successful implementation of this strategy is likely to fail. Our microsimulation is based on official census data and involves household composition and age distribution as the main population structure variables. Outside household contacts are characterised by an out-reproduction number R* which is the only free parameter of the model. For a subcritical domain we compute the time till extinction and prevalence as a function of the initial number of infected individuals and R*. For the Polish city of Wroclaw we also discuss the combined impact of testing coverage and contact reduction. For both countries we estimate R* for disease progression until 20th of March 2020.","Background: The rapid global spread of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is unprecedented. The outbreak has quickly spread to more than 100 countries reporting over 100,000 confirmed cases. Australia reported its first case of COVID-19 on 25th January 2020 and has since implemented travel restrictions to stop further introduction of the virus. Methods: We analysed daily global COVID-19 data published by the World Health Organisation to investigate the spread of the virus thus far. To assess the current risk of COVID-19 importation and local spread in Australia we predict international passenger flows into Australia during 2020. Findings: Our analysis of global data shows that Australia can expect a similar growth rate of reported cases as observed in France and the United States. We identify travel patterns of Australian citizens/residents and foreign travellers that can inform the implementation of new and the alteration of existing travel restrictions related to COVID-19. Interpretation...","RIG-I and MDA5 receptors are key sensors of pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP)-containing viral RNA and transduce downstream signals to activate an antiviral and immunomodulatory response. Fifteen years of research have put them at the center of an ongoing hunt for novel pharmacological pan-antivirals, vaccine adjuvants, and antitumor strategies. Current knowledge testifies to the redundant, but also distinct, functions mediated by RIG-I and MDA5, opening opportunities for the use of specific and potent nucleic acid agonists. We critically discuss the evidence and remaining knowledge gaps that have an impact on the choice and design of optimal RNA ligands to achieve an appropriate immunostimulatory response, with limited adverse effects, for prophylactic and therapeutic interventions against viruses and cancer in humans.","BACKGROUND: Infectious diseases emerge frequently in China, partly because of its large and highly mobile population. Therefore, a rapid and cost-effective pathogen screening method with broad coverage is required for prevention and control of infectious diseases. The availability of a large number of microbial genome sequences generated by conventional Sanger sequencing and next generation sequencing has enabled the development of a high-throughput high-density microarray platform for rapid large-scale screening of vertebrate pathogens. METHODS: An easy operating pathogen microarray (EOPM) was designed to detect almost all known pathogens and related species based on their genomic sequences. For effective identification of pathogens from EOPM data, a statistical enrichment algorithm has been proposed, and further implemented in a user-friendly web-based interface. RESULTS: Using multiple probes designed to specifically detect a microbial genus or species, EOPM can correctly identify k...","Abstract There is currently a lack of pathologic data on the novel coronavirus (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) pneumonia, or coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), from autopsy or biopsy. Two patients who recently underwent lung lobectomies for adenocarcinoma were retrospectively found to have had COVID-19 at the time of the operation. These two cases thus provide important first opportunities to study the pathology of COVID-19. Pathologic examinations revealed that apart from the tumors, the lungs of both patients exhibited edema, proteinaceous exudate, focal reactive hyperplasia of pneumocytes with patchy inflammatory cellular infiltration, and multinucleated giant cells. Hyaline membranes were not prominent. Because both patients did not exhibit symptoms of pneumonia at the time of operation, these changes likely represent an early phase of the lung pathology of COVID-19 pneumonia.","BACKGROUND: Viral epidemics or pandemics of acute respiratory infections like influenza or severe acute respiratory syndrome pose a global threat. Antiviral drugs and vaccinations may be insufficient to prevent their spread. OBJECTIVES: To review the effectiveness of physical interventions to interrupt or reduce the spread of respiratory viruses. SEARCH METHODS: We searched The Cochrane Library, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2010, Issue 3), which includes the Acute Respiratory Infections Group's Specialised Register, MEDLINE (1966 to October 2010), OLDMEDLINE (1950 to 1965), EMBASE (1990 to October 2010), CINAHL (1982 to October 2010), LILACS (2008 to October 2010), Indian MEDLARS (2008 to October 2010) and IMSEAR (2008 to October 2010). SELECTION CRITERIA: In this update, two review authors independently applied the inclusion criteria to all identified and retrieved articles and extracted data. We scanned 3775 titles, excluded 3560 and retrieved full pape...","Abstract 26 There is currently a lack of pathologic data on the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) 27 pneumonia, or COVID-19, from autopsy or biopsy.

We are not aware of any gender analysis of the outbreak by global health institutions or governments in affected countries or in preparedness phases. Recognising the extent to which disease outbreaks affect women and men differently is a fundamental step to understanding the primary and secondary effects of a health emergency on different individuals and communities, and for creating effective, equitable policies and interventions. Although sex-disaggregated data for COVID-19 show equal numbers of cases between men and women so far, there seem to be sex differences in mortality and vulnerability to the disease.2 Emerging evidence suggests that more men than women are dying, potentially due to sex-based immunological3 or gendered differences, such as patterns and prevalence of smoking.4 However, current sex-disaggrega...","The 2019-Novel-Coronavirus (COVID-19) has affected 115 countries and out of more than 118,000 confirmed cases. Understanding the transmission dynamics of the infection in each country which affected on a daily basis and evaluating the effectiveness of control policies is critical for our further actions. To date, the statistics of COVID-10 reported cases show more than 80 percent of infected had a mild case of disease, while around 14 percent of infected experienced a severe one and about 5 percent are categorized as critical disease victims. Today's report (2020-03-12; daily updates in the prepared website) shows the confirmed cases of COVID-19 in China, South Korea, Italy, and Iran are 80932, 7869, 12462 and 10075; respectively. Calculating the total Case Fatality Rate (CFR) of Italy (2020-03-04), about 7.9% of confirmed cases passed away. Compared to South Korea's rate of 0.76% (10% lower than Italy) and China's 3.8% (50% lower than Italy), the CFR of Italy is too high. There are so...","Abstract Coronaviruses (CoVs) are enveloped, positive-strand RNA viruses with characteristic spike glycoproteins that project outward like the rays of the sun (corona \u2013 Latin for \u2018crown\u2019), when visualized by electron microscopy. CoV are classified, together with the toroviruses, in the family Coronaviridae and the order Nidovirales. All nidoviruses have a common genome organization and generate a nested set (nido \u2013 Latin for \u2018nest\u2019) of 3\u2032 co-terminal mRNAs. CoVs have been isolated from a variety of species, including birds, livestock, domestic animals, and humans. CoV infections can cause respiratory, gastrointestinal, and neurologic disease, depending on the strain of the virus and the site of infection. Importantly, CoVs have been shown to cross species barriers and have emerged from animal reservoirs to infect humans and cause severe disease. The CoV responsible for an outbreak of severe acute respiratory disease (SARS-CoV) in 2002\u201303 likely originated as a bat coronavirus which, du...","Governments around the world are responding to the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic with unprecedented policies designed to slow the growth rate of infections. Many actions, such as closing schools and restricting populations to their homes, impose large and visible costs on society. In contrast, the benefits of these policies, in the form of infections that did not occur, cannot be directly observed and are currently understood through process-based simulations. Here, we compile new data on 936 local, regional, and national anti-contagion policies recently deployed in the ongoing pandemic across localities in China, South Korea, Iran, Italy, France, and the United States (US). We then apply reduced-form econometric methods, commonly used to measure the effect of policies on economic growth, to empirically evaluate the effect that these anti-contagion policies have had on the growth rate of infections. In the absence of any policy actions, we estimate that early infections of COVI...","Although the use of vaccines has controlled enteric diseases in dogs in many developed countries, vaccine coverage is still under optimal situation in Brazil. There is a large population of nonimmunized dogs and few studies about the identification of the viruses associated with diarrhea. To address this situation, stool samples from 325 dogs were analyzed by polymerase chain reaction for the detection of common enteric viruses such as Canine adenovirus (CAdV), Canine coronavirus (CCoV), Canine distemper virus (CDV), Canine rotavirus (CRV) and Carnivorous protoparvovirus 1 (canine parvovirus 2; CPV-2). At least one of these species was detected in 56.6% (184/325) of the samples. The viruses detected most frequently in either diarrheic or nondiarrheic dog feces were CPV-2 (54.3% of the positive samples), CDV (45.1%) and CCoV (30.4%), followed by CRV (8.2%) and CAdV (4.9%). Only one agent was detected in the majority of the positive samples (63%), but co-infections were present in 37% of...","BACKGROUND: There is an ongoing debate regarding the type of respiratory protection that should be recommended for use for healthcare workers. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was conducted in three countries: China, Pakistan and Vietnam. RESULTS: In China and Pakistan, the infection control guidelines were developed to be in line with the recommendations from the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, while in the Vietnamese guidelines the recommendations correspond with the WHO suggestions only. The guidelines from all three countries document the need for training and fit testing; however there is no system to monitor the training and fit testing programs. Across the three countries, there was some inconsistency with regard to the types of products (i.e. masks vs. respirators) recommended for influenza, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and tuberculosis. CONCLUSIONS: Available evidence should be examined and a compre...","A group of biologists, ARTIC Network, has proposed a multiplexed PCR primer set for whole-genome analysis of the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, soon after the start of COVID-19 epidemics was realized. The primer set was adapted by many researchers worldwide and has already contributed to the high-quality and prompt genome epidemiology of this rapidly spreading viral disease. We have also seen the great performance of their primer set and protocol; the primer set amplifies all desired 98 PCR amplicons with fairly small amplification bias from clinical samples with relatively high viral load. However, we also observed an acute drop of reads derived from some amplicons especially amplicon 18 and 76 in \"pool 2\" as a sample's viral load decreases. We suspected this low coverage issue was due to dimer formation between primers targeting those two amplicons. Indeed, replacement of just one of those primers, nCoV-2019_76_RIGHT, to a newly designed primer resulted in a drastic improvement of co...","As of March 22, 2020, the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in the U.S. has reached nearly 30,000. While rapid and accessible diagnosis is paramount to monitoring and reducing the spread of disease, COVID-19 testing capabilities across the U.S. remain constrained. For many individuals, urgent care centers (UCCs) may offer the most accessible avenue to be tested. Through a phone survey, we describe the COVID-19 testing capabilities at UCCs and provide a snapshot highlighting the limited COVID-19 testing capabilities at UCCs in states with the greatest disease burden.","Abstract Introduction Influenza is a common respiratory infectious disease affecting population worldwide yearly.

The predictions obtained, for a time horizon of 10 days starting from March 29th, will be provided at a national as well as at a more disaggregate levels, following a criterion based on the magnitude of the phenomenon. While the Regions which have been hit the most by the pandemic have been kept separated, the less affected ones have been aggregated into homogeneous macroareas. Results show that , within the forecast period considered (March 29th April 7th ) , all of the Italian regions will show a decreasing number of CoViD-19 positive people. Same for the number of people who will need to be hospitalized in a Intensive Care Unit (ICU). These estimates are valid under constancy of the Government s current containment policies. In this scenario, Northern Regions will remain the most affected ones and...","Background: The 2019 Coronavirus (COVID-19) has turned into a global pandemic with unprecedented challenges for the global community. Understanding the state of the disease and planning for future trajectories relies heavily on data on the spread and mortality. Yet official data coming from various countries are highly unreliable: symptoms similar to common cold in majority of cases and limited screening resources and delayed testing procedures may contribute to under-estimation of the burden of disease. Anecdotal and more limited data are available, but few have systematically combined those with official statistics into a coherent view of the epidemic. This study is a modeling-in-real-time of the emerging outbreak for understanding the state of the disease. Our focus is on the case of the spread of disease in Iran, as one of the epicenters of the disease in the first months of 2020. Method: We develop a simple dynamic model of the epidemic to provide a more reliable picture of the st...","As of March 23, 2020 there have been over 354,000 confirmed cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in over 180 countries, the World Health Organization characterized COVID-19 as a pandemic, and the United States (US) announced a national state of emergency.1, 2, 3 In parts of China and Italy the demand for intensive care (IC) beds was higher than the number of available beds.4, 5 We sought to build an accessible interactive model that could facilitate hospital capacity planning in the presence of significant uncertainty about the proportion of the population that is COVID-19+ and the rate at which COVID-19 is spreading in the population. Our approach was to design a tool with parameters that hospital leaders could adjust to reflect their local data and easily modify to conduct sensitivity analyses. We developed a model to facilitate hospital planning with estimates of the number of Intensive Care (IC) beds, Acute Care (AC) beds, and ventilators necessary to accommodate patients w...","The recent coronavirus pandemic follows in its early stages an almost exponential expansion, with the number of cases N reasonably well fit by N e\u03b1t, in many countries. We analyze the rate \u03b1 in 25 different countries, choosing as a starting point in each country the first day with 30 cases and fitting for the following 12 days, capturing thus the early exponential growth in a rather homogeneous way. We look for a link between the rate \u03b1 and the average temperature T of each country, in the month of the epidemic growth. Fitting with a linear behavior \u03b1(T), we find evidence for a decreasing growth rate as a function of T. However, a decrease in the growth rate is visible also in the very low-T data. Going beyond a linear model, a peak at about (9.5\u00b12.6)\u00b0C seems to be present in the data. Our findings give hope that, for northern hemisphere countries, the growth rate should significantly decrease as a result of both warmer weather and lockdown policies. In general the propagation should b...","The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) is the etiological agent for the infectious disease, SARS, which first emerged 10 years ago. SARS-CoV is a zoonotic virus that has crossed the species barriers to infect humans. Bats, which harbour a diverse pool of SARS-like CoVs (SL-CoVs), are believed to be the natural reservoir. The SARS-CoV surface Spike (S) protein is a major antigenic determinant in eliciting neutralizing antibody production during SARS-CoV infection. In our previous work, we showed that a panel of murine monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that target the S2 subunit of the S protein are capable of neutralizing SARS-CoV infection in vitro (Lip KM et al, J Virol. 2006 Jan; 80(2): 941\u201350). In this study, we report our findings on the characterization of one of these mAbs, known as 1A9, which binds to the S protein at a novel epitope within the S2 subunit at amino acids 1111\u20131130. MAb 1A9 is a broadly neutralizing mAb that prevents viral entry mediated by the S ...","We present here several variants of a mathematical model to explore three main issues related to SARS-CoV-2 spread in scenarios similar to those present in Mexico and elsewhere in Latin America. We explore the consequences for travel inside a given region, in this case Mexico, particularly focusing on airplane transportation but attempting to give a gross approximation to terrestrial movement since this is the main form of population movement across geographical areas in the country; then we proceed to study the effect of behavioral changes required to lower transmission by lowering the contact rate and infection probability and lastly, we explore the consequences of disease spread in a population subject to social isolation.These models are not suitable for predictive purposes although some rough predictions can be extracted from them. They are presented as a tool that can serve to explore plausible scenarios of spread and impact, effectiveness and consequences of contention and mitig...","COVID-19 has spread to most countries in the world. Puzzlingly, the impact of the disease is different in different countries. These differences are attributed to differences in cultural norms, mitigation efforts, and health infrastructure. Here we propose that national differences in COVID-19 impact could be partially explained by the different national policies respect to Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) childhood vaccination. BCG vaccination has been reported to offer broad protection to respiratory infections. We compared large number of countries BCG vaccination policies with the morbidity and mortality for COVID-19. We found that countries without universal policies of BCG vaccination (Italy, Nederland, USA) have been more severely affected compared to countries with universal and long-standing BCG policies. Countries that have a late start of universal BCG policy (Iran, 1984) had high mortality, consistent with the idea that BCG protects the vaccinated elderly population. We also ...","Background: The overall objective of this rapid review was to identify infection protection and control recommendations from published clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) for adults aged 60 years and older in long-term care settings Methods: Comprehensive searches in MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, and relevant CPG publishers/repositories were carried out in early March 2020. Title/abstract and full-text screening, data abstraction, and quality appraisal (AGREE-II) were carried out by single reviewers. Results: A total of 17 relevant CPGs were identified, published in the USA (n=8), Canada (n=6), Australia (n=2), and the United Kingdom (n=1). All of the CPGs dealt with infection control in long-term care facilities (LTCF) and addressed various types of viral respiratory infections (e.g., influenza, COVID-19, severe acute respiratory syndrome). Ten or more CPGs recommended the following infection control measures in LTCF: hand hygiene (n=13), wearing personal protective equipment...","Respiratory viruses have emerged and re-emerged in humans for hundreds of years. In the recent past avian and animal influenza viruses have caused human disease ranging from conjunctivitis to respiratory illnesses, including the 2009\u201310 A(H1N1)pdm09 pandemic. Coronaviruses, human metapneumovirus (hMPV) and enteroviruses have also impacted humans globally. Since the likely public health impacts are common, plans and policies for intervention strategies can be developed, encompassing early detection through surveillance and diagnostics, as well as treatment and prevention through clinical and non-clinical interventions. The global comprehensiveness of these varies according to differing resources, competing health priorities and the causative agent, yet, irrespective of this, activities must be proportional to the threat. Pandemics and severe epidemics enable policies to be tested and gaps identified.","During the current COVID-19 pandemic, testing kit and RNA extraction kit availability has become a major limiting factor in the ability to determine patient disease status and accurately quantify prevalence. Current testing strategies rely on individual tests of cases matching restrictive diagnostic criteria to detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA, limiting testing of asymptomatic and mild cases. Testing these individuals is one effective way to understand and reduce the spread of COVID-19. Here, we develop a pooled testing strategy to identify these low-risk individuals. Drawing on the well-studied group testing literature, modeling suggests practical changes to testing protocols which can reduce test costs and stretch a limited test kit supply. When most tests are negative, pooling reduces the total number of tests up to four-fold at 2% prevalence and eight-fold at 0.5% prevalence. At current SARS-CoV-2 prevalence, randomized group testing optimized per country could double the number of tested ind...","Coronaviruses are of major importance for both animal and human health. With the emergence of novel coronaviruses such as SARS and MERS, the need for fast genome characterisation is ever so important. Further, in order to understand the influence of quasispecies of these viruses in relation to biology, techniques for deep-sequence and full-length viral genome analysis are needed. In the present study, we compared the efficiency of two sequence-independent approaches [sequence-independent single primer amplification (SISPA) and single primer isothermal amplification (SPIA, represented by the Ovation kit)] coupled with high-throughput sequencing to generate the full-length genome of bovine coronavirus (BCoV) from a nasal swab. Both methods achieved high genome coverage (100% for SPIA and 99% for SISPA), however, there was a clear difference in the percentage of reads that mapped to BCoV. While approximately 45% of the Ovation reads mapped to BCoV (sequence depth of 169\u2013284 944), only 0.0...","Known human coronaviruses are believed to have originated in animals and made use of intermediate hosts for transmission to humans. The intermediate hosts of most of the human coronaviruses are known, but not for HCoV-NL63. This study aims to assess the possible role of some major domestic livestock species as intermediate hosts of HCoV-NL63. We developed a testing algorithm for high throughput screening of livestock sera with ELISA and confirmation with recombinant immunofluorescence assay testing for antibodies against HCoV-NL63 in livestock. Optimization of the ELISA showed a capability of the assay to significantly distinguish HCoV-NL63 from HCoV-229E (U = 27.50, p &lt; 0.001) and HCoV-OC43 (U = 55.50, p &lt; 0.001) in coronavirus-characterized sera. Evaluation of the assay with collected human samples showed no significant difference in mean optical density values of immunofluorescence-classified HCoV-NL63-positive and HCoV-NL63-negative samples (F (1, 215) = 0.437, p = 0.509). All the ...","BACKGROUND: Array comparative genomic hybridization is a fast and cost-effective method for detecting, genotyping, and comparing the genomic sequence of unknown bacterial isolates. This method, as with all microarray applications, requires adequate coverage of probes targeting the regions of interest. An unbiased tiling of probes across the entire length of the genome is the most flexible design approach. However, such a whole-genome tiling requires that the genome sequence is known in advance. For the accurate analysis of uncharacterized bacteria, an array must query a fully representative set of sequences from the species' pan-genome. Prior microarrays have included only a single strain per array or the conserved sequences of gene families. These arrays omit potentially important genes and sequence variants from the pan-genome. RESULTS: This paper presents a new probe selection algorithm (PanArray) that can tile multiple whole genomes using a minimal number of probes. Unlike arrays b...","Social distancing policies are critical but economically painful measures to flatten the curve against emergent infectious diseases. As the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19 spread throughout the United States in early 2020, the federal government issued social distancing recommendations but left to the states the most difficult and consequential decisions restricting behavior, such as canceling events, closing schools and businesses, and issuing stay-at-home orders. We present an original dataset of state-level social distancing policy responses to the epidemic and explore how political partisanship, COVID-19 caseload, and policy diffusion explain the timing of governors' decisions to mandate social distancing. An event history analysis of five social distancing policies across all fifty states reveals the most important predictors are political: all else equal, Republican governors and governors from states with more Trump supporters were slower to adopt social distancing polici...","AbstractThe beginning of 2020 has seen the emergence of COVID-19 outbreak caused by a novel coronavirus, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). There is an imminent need to better understand this new virus and to develop ways to control its spread. In this study, we sought to gain insights for vaccine design against SARS-CoV-2 by considering the high genetic similarity between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, which caused the outbreak in 2003, and leveraging existing immunological studies of SARS-CoV. By screening the experimentally-determined SARS-CoV-derived B cell and T cell epitopes in the immunogenic structural proteins of SARS-CoV, we identified a set of B cell and T cell epitopes derived from the spike (S) and nucleocapsid (N) proteins that map identically to SARS-CoV-2 proteins. As no mutation has been observed in these identified epitopes among the available SARS-CoV-2 sequences (as of 9 February 2020), immune targeting of these epitopes may potentially offer pr...","The beginning of 2020 has seen the emergence of COVID-19 outbreak caused by a novel coronavirus, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).

When the attack rate is high, transmission might occur regardless of isolation and the policy might merely create a burden on the isolated individuals and their families, without a tangible public health benefit. If the policy is proven effective, it is not known whether the CDC-recommended one day of symptom-based isolation is sufficient, and if not, how many days would be most beneficial. At the outset of our project, we hypothesized that these policies would have a small beneficial effect on reducing attack rate, delay the peak of the outbreak and reduce the height of its peak. We did not expect these policies to reduce the overall incidence because there would be many other opportunities to become infected. Furthermore, practical barriers may reduce the strictness with which the policies are enforced, which would reduce the policies' effectiveness.","Telemedicine (TM) has the potential to help by permitting mildly ill patients to get the supportive care they need while minimizing their exposure to other acutely ill patients. After all, the only infection that one can catch while using TM is a computer virus. To encourage the TM approach, nearly all health plans and large employers offer some form of coverage for TM services. Although the use of TM has increased over the last 2 to 3 years, rates of TM adoption among allergists are still low. 3 In response to the current COVID-19 situation, the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services and commercial health plans largely have waived co-pays for TM visits as a means to encourage utilization in this time of need, and allergists need to pay attention to this. 4, 5 A recent survey demonstrated that patients are willing to use telehealth, but barriers still exist, namely: (1) At a time of need, many people revert to what they are used to doing and the way in which they previously interacted with the health care system. (2) Patients would prefer that they see their own provider through TM versus someone with whom they do not have a previously established relationship. (3) Patients may be unaware that they have TM as an option and do not know how to access it. 6 Health plans, employers, hospital systems, and media outlets should work to overcome these barriers by (1) educating people that TM is an effective alternative and safer under the current circumstances, (2) expanding network reimbursement coverage for physicians to see their patients through TM, (3) making people aware that a TM benefit exists, with step-by-step instructions on how it can be accessed, (4) helping people understand how TM works, and (5) continuing to reduce cost barriers to accessing TM.","This study identified that hospital surfaces in these Bangladeshi hospitals, were frequently contaminated with respiratory pathogens and pose a potential threat for fomite-borne transmission of respiratory infections to patients, healthcare workers and family caregivers. To prevent the spread of Klebsiella and other infections between patients, healthcare personnel must follow specific infection control precautions including strict adherence to hand hygiene and the use of gloves. In addition, our data clearly indicate that efforts to regularly disinfect environmental surfaces and ensure clean towels for patient caregiving could reduce risk of exposure to patients, healthcare staff and visitors. The government of Bangladesh has taken a number of initiatives to improve infection control in hospitals [36]. Despite this, a 2013 nationally representative survey of healthcare facilities showed that healthcare workers performed recommended hand hygiene in only 9% of 919 opportunities, suggesting low adherence to international standards [30]. Barriers include awareness, training, accountability and appropriate infrastructure (among 875 health facilities, 10% handwashing locations had no water, 20% had no soap and 50\u201380% had no alcohol based sanitizer) to support these behaviours [30, 37, 38] This study highlighted the gaps in practice, as well as the substantial barriers to improvement that will require widespread investments to address. In 2018, the Directorate of Hospital Infection Control, Directorate General of Health Services (DGHS) at the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare in Bangladesh has communicated the intention to form infection control committees in each district and tertiary care hospital across the country to improve the safe care [39]. Further investigation to identify the true contribution of fomites in the transmission of respiratory pathogens within hospital settings could be useful to help these committees prioritize efforts to improve hand and surface cleaning.","Assaf et al. emphasized that the devastated healthcare system has restricted immunization programs in Jordan, which consequently left thousands of individuals susceptible to the infectious diseases [34]. For instance, influenza vaccination is recognized as an effective way to prevent influenza and its problems [35]. However, there are many barriers identified between the modality of prevention and the general population. One of the main barriers among the Jordan population has been the fear of side effects, although the fear of the virus outbreak could have been the major reason to receive the vaccine. Nonetheless, as compared to other countries, the coverage rates have been lower in Jordan [34]. In Jordan, the majority of the households perceived the high cost of medical care as an obstacle to seek and receive standard care. Specialized care facilities and improved access to medications have been perceived to be among the primary requirements of the local population. It has been suggested that extra support to the poor households can prove to be beneficial in this regard [28].","The results of this study found that knowledge, training, management support of SPs, barriers to SPs, and nursing staff influence were the predictors for NSs' SPs compliance. The purpose of the HBM is to identify the factors which can improve the likelihood of compliance to SPs among NSs. However, the underlying reasons why NSs might be affected by those factors might not be well explained by the HBM. Theory-in-use 38 might shine some light on the explanation of such findings in the present study. To apply the theory in the context of SPs compliance, theory-in-use is the performance of the behaviors related to the SPs compliance, whereas espoused theory is to explain or justify the behaviors related to the SPs compliance. Argyris and Schon 38 explained that theory-in-use (ie, actual practice and self-reported practice) of an individual worker is shaped by espoused theory, that is, his/her formal (eg, policies, guidelines) and informal (eg, observation, organizational culture) learning in the workplace. In terms of SPs compliance among NSs, increasing SPs knowledge, providing more SPs training, promoting a safety climate (management support), reducing identified SPs barriers, and improving nursing staff compliance to SPs would enhance NSs' SPs compliance.","With the advent of new and broader spectrum antibiotics, improved environmental hygiene, and advances in microbiological techniques it was widely expected that the need for diagnosis of infectious agents in tissue would diminish in importance. This assumption underestimated the infinite capacity of infectious agents for genomic variation, enabling them to develop antimicrobial resistance and exploit new opportunities to spread infections which are created when host defenses become compromised. The following are currently the most important factors influencing the presentation of infectious diseases: \u2022 The increased mobility of the world's population through tourism, immigration and inter national commerce has distorted natural geographic boundaries to infection, exposing weaknesses in host defenses, and in knowledge. \u2022 Immunodeficiency states occurring either as part of an infection, e.g. Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) which causes acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), or as an iatrogenic disease. As treatment becomes more aggressive, depression of the host's immunity occurs, enabling organisms of low virulence to become life-threatening, and may allow latent infections, accrued throughout life, to reactivate and spread. \u2022 Emerging, re-emerging and antibiotic-resistant organisms such as the tubercle bacillus and staphylococcus are a constant and growing threat. \u2022 Adaptive mutation occurring in microorganisms allows them to jump species barriers and exploit new physical environments. Such adaptation allows infections to evade host defenses and resist agents of treatment. \u2022 Bioterrorism has become an increasing concern.","The 2019 novel coronavirus 1 pandemic is forcing societies around the world to make consequential policy decisions with limited information. After containment of the initial outbreak failed, attention turned to implementing large-scale social policies designed to slow contagion of the virus, 6 with the ultimate goal of slowing the rate at which life-threatening cases emerge so as to not exceed the capacity of existing medical systems. In general, these policies aim to decrease opportunities for virus transmission by reducing contact among individuals within or between populations, such as by closing schools, limiting gatherings, and restricting mobility. Such actions are not expected to halt contagion completely, but instead are meant to slow the spread of COVID-19 to a manageable rate. These large-scale policies are developed using epidemiological simulations 2, 4, 7-17 and a small number of natural experiments in past epidemics. 18 However, the actual impacts of these policies on infection rates in the ongoing pandemic are unknown. Because the modern world has never experienced a pandemic from this pathogen, nor deployed anti-contagion policies of such scale and scope, it is crucial that direct measurements of policy impacts be used alongside numerical simulations in current decision-making.","Many of the studies in this special issue identified strategies to improve the health of marginalized groups. Wallimann and colleagues [19] explored the primary care network of Eritrean immigrants in Switzerland. They found language difficulties and intercultural understanding are barriers to properly accessing care and identified six key lessons for practices to facilitate health care access for Eritrean immigrants. Pudpong et al. [20] assessed a voluntary health insurance scheme for migrants in Thailand. They found that it improved access for previously uninsured migrants and reduced the financial burden for public hospitals in the project area. They suggested further efforts to raise community understanding of the benefits of being insured in order to improve the sustainability and effectiveness of the program. Gaboardi et al. [21] assessed the goals and principles of providers working with people experiencing homelessness in eight European countries, indicating a contrast between providers who were more focused on their client\u2019s autonomy and those whose primary focus was on the client\u2019s basic needs such as food, health and temporary accommodation. Braun-Lewensohn et al. [22] explored the coping strategies for stressors among women in Bedouin society and described the stability of sense of coherence (SOC) in this minority society as it underwent rapid social and cultural changes. Significant differences were found between age groups, and the oldest women were identified as an at-risk population due to limitations in their coping strategies and SOC. In related research in a very different community, Millan et al. [23] examined the health beliefs and practices of Gypsies and Travelers in the UK, where these communities experience significant marginalization and discrimination. They described this community\u2019s health problems and their experiences in health care systems, including discrimination and negative stereotypes. The authors indicate the need for a more concentrated and intensive approach to improve health among travelers in the UK.","Data (IPD) from multiple countries and healthcare systems may facilitate better understanding of the generalizability and implementation prediction models across different settings and populations, and may greatly improve their applicability and robustness in routine care. [29] [30] [31] [32] The evidence base for the development and validation of prediction models related to COVID-19 will quickly increase over the coming months. Together with the increasing evidence from predictor finding studies 33 and open peer review initiatives for COVID-19 related publications, 34 data registries [35] [36] [37] [38] are being set up.

Importantly, understanding this basic information will not only aid our public health preparedness against SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, but also help prepare for novel coronaviruses that may emerge.","A second type of primary prevention is antimicrobial prophylaxis, often referred to as chemoprophylaxis. Use of effective chemoprophylaxis requires that the infectious agent be susceptible to the antimicrobial drug used. As a primary prevention strategy, it may be used before or after exposure to prevent infection. Examples of chemoprophylaxis in the postexposure setting include erythromycin after exposure to pertussis; rifampin after N. meningitidis; amantadine, rimantadine, zanamir, or oseltamivir after influenza A virus; and zidovudine after HIV exposure. Use of antiretroviral drugs by HIV-infected pregnant women has been shown to substantially reduce the risk of perinatal HIV infection. 128 Prophylaxis against surgical wound infections with broad-spectrum coverage before surgery and prophylaxis of neonates against ophthalmia neonatorum are examples of chemoprophylaxis used in the hospital setting. In such situations, chemoprophylaxis is origin, socioeconomic status, and geographic location. For example, persons born outside the United States are at increased risk for infectious diseases such as tuberculosis and for being chronic carriers of infections such as hepatitis B. Screening programs targeted to these populations, with subsequent interventions such as isoniazid prophylaxis for persons with M. tuberculosis infection or immunization of susceptible household contacts of HBV carriers, can serve as important community-based strategies to prevent infectious disease occurrence. [115] [116] [117] Another example of defining risk at the community level is assessing behavior that increases the risk for specific diseases, such as injection drug use as a risk behavior for acquiring HIV or HCV infection. Education and drug treatment programs targeted to this population can serve as an important disease prevention and control strategy. Finally, assessing the population of species-specific mosquitoes and viability of local breeding sites can provide a risk assessment of the likelihood of vector-borne disease transmission (e.g., West Nile virus infection). 118, 119 In developing control programs, the feasibility of a strategy also needs to be assessed. Feasibility is dependent on the sociodemographic factors of the population involved. For example, high immunization rates can clearly prevent the occurrence of infectious diseases. In the United States, immunizations should be readily available; however, in the late 1980s, numerous large outbreaks of measles occurred in U.S. inner-city populations because of low immunization rates. 120 A variety of sociodemographic factors contributed to these low rates, such as inadequate access to medical care and other barriers to immunization. Until such barriers are removed and control strategies are developed to specifically target at-risk populations, adequate control of vaccinepreventable diseases in the United States cannot be accomplished. 121 Cost and availability of resources also need to be considered when developing control strategies. Adequate water treatment facilities and distribution systems in developing countries would do much to eliminate the spread of cholera. However, in many countries, resources to build and develop such facilities are not available. Consequently, control strategies need to be focused on simpler, less expensive methods, such as boiling water or improving water storage in the home.","European cooperation will continue to provide great opportunities for improving the quality of healthcare not only for Europe's \u223c746 million citizens but also as translatable health benefits for citizens around the world [5] .

We discuss vaccine-preventable diseases and the substantial successes and persistent challenges in their control; health-care-associated infections (HAIs), a leading preventable cause of death; emerging zoonotic and vector-borne diseases and their spread across a globalised world; foodborne infections, increasingly linked to new sources of contamination; and the intersecting epidemics of HIV, sexually transmitted infections (STIs), chronic viral hepatitis, and tuberculosis. Antimicrobial-resistant pathogens, several of which have become or are becoming resistant to all available drugs, are intensifying these threats. In addition to their eff ect \u2022 Despite major advances towards their control, infectious diseases continue to present substantial challenges to health and health-care resources in the USA \u2022 Priority actions to meet these challenges include addressing high-burden diseases such as HIV and chronic hepatitis, foodborne diseases, and health-care-associ ated infections; targeting outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases; and controlling endemic and emerging vector-borne and zoonotic infections \u2022 Antimicrobial resistance has become a global health crisis that demands new multidisciplinary approaches and collaborations across local, state, regional, national, and international levels \u2022 Rapidly evolving molecular technologies and increases in microbial understanding off er new opportunities for treatment, prevention, and control of infectious diseases \u2022 Ongoing enhancements in communication capacities, including social media, are bringing new techniques to monitor infectious diseases and rapidly share prevention information on human health, these diseases cause substantial health-care, workplace, and other societal costs. We discuss priority actions needed to meet these challenges including modernisation of existing surveillance systems to better inform public health action; enhancement of public health laboratories to incorporate the latest molecular technologies for improved disease detection and outbreak response; and strengthening of the clinical and public health interface to facilitate information exchange and leverage changes in health care to improve prevention and control of infectious diseases.","Methods: The team used Maternal Health booklet for reference to formulate Port-A-Cath Care booklet which contained the information of self-assessment, postoperative wound care, infusion notes, principle of care after discharge to home and infusion record after discussions and allowed patients to understand the use and management of port-a-cath. Results: Patients' condition at home and present condition at admission would be understood through self-assessment of brochure after their admission to hospital; therefore, nurses could provide patients with timely access to relevant information and nursing intervention. Since the implementation of the study at a regional hospital in February, 2017, we found that completion rate of port-a-cath care guidance reached 100%; in addition, patient satisfaction scores increased from 3.31 to 4.1, with a significant improvement in suitability of nursing procedure and timeliness of nursing care. Conclusion: Although we worry that giving more information regarding port-a-cath to the patients and family members will increase probability of disputes occurrence between patients and hospital staff if the staff members don't follow the standard of care, it is necessary to incorporate patients and family numbers into the gatekeeper mode to have a better understanding of clinical quality and thereby enhance education training of practice staff to improve patient safety. Background: Effective control of tuberculosis (TB) requires a close partnership between private and public healthcare providers. An integrated web-based information system is vital and crucial for engaging all relevant healthcare providers in prevention, diagnosis and treatment of TB. Methods: A \"MONITOR\" information system was established in 2016 by Taiwan Centers for Disease Control (TCDC) with single entryway and enhanced capacity and flexibility. Main purpose of the system is to promote more rapid response and provide decision support. Information such as TB epidemiology, case management, treatment, DOTS rate, contact tracing coverage, TB clusters, TB statistics and laboratory data are included in the system. Information without personal data can be viewed online with access permission. Daily laboratory data including AFB-smear, culture, identification, drug susceptibility testing and the interferon-gamma release assay (IGRA) are automatically entered from different interface of diverse information systems in clinical settings and public health sectors. The system provides timely warnings of drug-resistant cases, IGRA-positive cases and high-risk populations to management staff according to their responsibilities. In addition, daily scheduled analyses of laboratory quality indicators, turnaround time and visualized profiles are updated automatically.","We then modeled the number of days it would take to get to zero with different rates of coverage with vaccination or testing with isolation and treatment of symptomatically infected patients ( Figure 1 ). If R is currently 2.2, for example, vaccination at the herd immunity coverage of 55% would drive R just below 1, but transmission could persist for years. Over 80% of coverage is required to end the epidemic in 6 months with population-wide vaccination. The epidemic could be ended in just under a year if testing with isolation and treatment reached 80% of .

Modelling such a strategy for the UK, for example, which is just beginning distancing measures, would be extremely useful to guide when such measures could be lifted-ie, at what proportion of the population tested (and, given asymptomatic and presymptomatic transmission, how regularly) could we be confident that we are controlling the epidemic sufficiently to considerably delay or even prevent resurgence if lockdown were to be lifted. Emerging data from South Korea, which adopted a widespread testing strategy early (in conjunction with an innovative digital crowd-sourced contact tracing strategy) and has so far avoided the need for widespread lockdown, 4 would prove very useful in this regard. As would data from Italy, which is now attempting to use such a strategy as a way out of lockdown. 5, 6 The contributions of testing, contact tracing, and localised quarantine on reductions in contacts and COVID-19 transmission could be determined via a model that simulates localised clusters throughout the country and estimates their likely coverage by testing, given the number of tests kits made available nationally per day. Promising pooled testing methods, whereby multiple samples (eg, from a household, or local cluster of up to 64 people-the limit of pool sample accuracy) are pooled 7 and all individuals are quarantined if the sample comes back positive, could be useful to multiply the effect of restricted testing capacity. The testing capacity of a country is likely to be a key bottleneck that determines whether such an alternative non-pharmaceutical intervention strategy could be successful in sufficiently suppressing COVID-19 spread. Adding the effects of emerging drug treatments 7 to fatality rates and, importantly, intensive care capacity (as such treatments could reduce the need for intensive care) would be a key next step. Intensive care capacity should be modelled as intensive care beds, including needed ventilator equipment and staff available per day based on national scale-up plans, and empirical data on the speed of achieved scale-ups in the coming weeks. The health-care systems capacity side of the model should also be modelled to include outcomes for all other diseases and conditions requiring hospital treatment, especially intensive care, so that useful estimates of overall effects on population mortality under different scenarios are obtained.","The most comprehensive attempt to describe the underlying components of the safety climate in health care institutions found 6 different components 23 : (1) senior management support for safety programs, (2) absence for workplace barriers to safe work practices, (3) cleanliness and orderliness of the worksite, (4) minimal conflict and good communications among staff, (5) frequent safety-related feedback and training by supervisors, and (6) availability of PPE and engineering controls. 23 In addition, 2 of these factors, senior management support for safety programs and frequent safety-related feedback and training, were significantly associated with lower rates of exposures to blood and body fluids. Although it seems that we have a good understanding of what specific elements contribute to the safety climate, no studies have attempted to implement measures to try to improve a safety climate where a poor climate exists. The study cited above recommended that safety climate surveys sponsored jointly by the infection control and occupational health and safety committees should be administered in hospitals using the safety climate scale. 23 The authors made several suggestions as to how they could be used. None of the recommendations, however, have been evaluated in terms of their ability to improve worker safety, once applied. Another challenge to improving safety climates in hospitals comes with the recent emphasis on downsizing organizations and outsourcing of the workforce. Studies in the United States have shown that hospital-based HCWs are having to work faster and harder than ever in an environment of higher patient acuity and increased patient turnover and with less time for training and education. [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] This is likely happening in Canada, and other countries, as well. How these larger organizational changes affect safety climate remains to be studied.","\u2610A statement that the guideline will be updated NR Describe the procedure for updating the guideline. \u2610Explicit time interval or explicit criteria to guide decisions about when an update will occur \u2610Methodology for the updating procedure \u2610Methods by which information regarding the facilitators and barriers to implementing recommendations were sought (e.g., feedback from key stakeholders, pilot testing of guidelines before widespread implementation) \u2610Information/description of the types of facilitators and barriers that emerged from the inquiry (e.g., practitioners have the skills to deliver the recommended care, sufficient equipment is not available to ensure all eligible members of the population receive mammography)","\u2610Purpose and intent of the external review (e.g., to improve quality, gather feedback on draft recommendations, assess applicability and feasibility, disseminate evidence) \u2610Methods taken to undertake the external review (e.g., rating scale, open-ended questions) \u2610Description of the external reviewers (e.g., number, type of reviewers, affiliations) \u2610Outcomes/information gathered from the external review (e.g., summary of key findings) \u2610How the information gathered was used to inform the guideline development process and/or formation of the recommendations (e.g., guideline panel considered results of \u2610Types of facilitators and barriers that were considered \u2610Methods by which information regarding the facilitators and barriers to implementing recommendations were sought (e.g., feedback from key stakeholders, pilot testing of guidelines before widespread implementation) \u2610Information/description of the types of facilitators and barriers that emerged from the inquiry (e.g., practitioners have the skills to deliver the recommended care, sufficient equipment is not available to ensure all eligible members of the population receive mammography) \u2610How the information influenced the guideline development process and/or formation of the recommendations NR 19.

However, in countries with relatively few cases, transmission was much rarer. This finding suggests that infection control measures are adequate to interrupt transmission to HCWs, but consistency is critical because the greater number of opportunities for lapses in the hardest hit centers likely led to more HCW infections. 7 The incubation period of SARS-CoV is between 2 and 10 days. 8 Diagnosis is based on polymerase chain reaction testing. Treatments attempted included corticosteroids and ribavirin, which were not found to be beneficial. Supportive care remains the cornerstone of care for SARS-CoV, although in vitro studies suggest that antivirals developed in the wake of the Ebola virus epidemic may inhibit SARS-CoV replication as well. 9 MERS-COV MERS-CoV was first reported in September 2012. 10 The virus was isolated from sputum of a man in Saudi Arabia hospitalized with a respiratory tract infection. 10 Since then, more than 2400 cases of MERS-CoV have been reported to the World Health Organization (WHO) in and around the Arabian Peninsula. 11 Periodic infections and localized outbreaks have continued. Similar to SARS-CoV, presentation is typically fever with symptoms of lower respiratory tract infection and radiographic evidence of pneumonia or ARDS. Other manifestations might include renal failure, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, and disseminated intravascular coagulation. Again, HCWs were disproportionately infected, although a large number of those cases were mild or asymptomatic. 7 The incubation period of MERS-CoV ranges from 1 to 14 days. Diagnosis is made by identifying the virus in respiratory samples by polymerase chain reaction testing. Treatment is largely supportive, 11 focusing on management of complications of sepsis and ARDS in intensive care units. Antivirals such as ribavirin and interferonbased treatments have had questionable benefit, but the role for these treatments remains experimental. 12 ","Two doses of measles-containing vaccines provide 95% vaccine efficacy, but at least 94% of the population must be vaccinated to ensure herd immunity, or population protection. Infants too young to be immunized and people who are immune compromised depend on herd immunity for protection. Accumulation of susceptible people in a community can result in periodic outbreaks when measles virus is circulating. 30 Endemic transmission of measles has been interrupted in the United States since 2000, 37 but travelers to areas where the virus still circulates account for 50 to 100 importations to the United States most years. Aggressive public health investigation of each suspected measles case is conducted to limit spread of the virus. Recently, several measles outbreaks in the United States have been associated with transmission among people who have not been vaccinated, intentionally, due to personal beliefs. In 2011, 222 measles cases occurred in the United States, the largest number of annual cases reported since 1996. 38 The most important source of imported virus in 2011 was Europe, where large outbreaks affected multiple countries. A very large outbreak in France (where an estimated 20,000 cases occurred) 39 was linked with importations to multiple countries in the Americas. 38, 40 Public health response to each outbreak is expensive. 24 Because measles is rarely seen in the United States, missed diagnosis can lead to sustained exposures particularly in health care settings (Fig. 14-3 ). 41 year-primarily in developing countries. 42 Enormous progress in measles immunization through supplemental immunization activities and increasing routine coverage, particularly in Africa, has led to a 74% reduction in worldwide measles deaths. 43 Despite this progress, the weak underlying immunization systems, famine, limited access associated with political disruption, and delayed emergency campaigns explain resurgences of measles in the Horn of Africa and southern Africa. 44 Low first-dose measles coverage and long intervals between campaigns offering second-dose opportunities allow rapid accumulation of children susceptible to measles and can lead to large outbreaks. Poor vaccine acceptance in selected communities, ranging from the Roma communities 45 to anthroposophists in Switzerland has led to sizable outbreaks in Europe as well. 46 34, 51 These outbreaks were difficult to control, and although the highest risk occurred among unvaccinated persons, many case-patients had received one or two doses of mumpscontaining vaccine, consistent with only 80% to 85% vaccine efficacy for one-and two-dose regimens. 48, 50 Although factors associated with disease include intense crowding, there is no evidence to support immune escape. 54 Recent outbreaks have been notable for very little transmission to the broader community. Although some proponents exist, the value of administering a third dose of mumps-containing vaccine in outbreaks that occur despite high two-dose coverage has been unclear because disease tends to be decreasing by the time additional doses are provided. 55 Because most mumps outbreaks have occurred in unusual settings where there is extreme crowding or extensive personal contacts and most mumps is self-limited and relatively mild, it is unlikely major investments will be made to attempt to improve the efficacy of mumps vaccines.","This study provided evidence of human\u2013animal interactions in rural communities of southern China that increase the potential for zoonotic disease emergence and suggested opportunities for risk mitigation. Population migration from rural communities to urban areas for employment, as well as the wild animal protection policy changes in China in recent years, have led to a perceived overall reduction in activities such as household animal raising and wildlife trade.30,31 Protective attitudes, knowledge and a supportive social environment for disease prevention were reportedly being developed within the community.31 Existing local preliminary programmes and policies around human and animal health, community development and conservation are considered effective resources to begin or continue developing cost-effective strategies to mitigate zoonotic risks.","The UK parliament formalized Brexit -divorce from the EUat the end of January 2020. The type of manpower mobility arrangements for health workers due to be negotiated by the end of 2020 between the UK and EU will have a specific and important bearing on the already hard-pressed medical services in the UK [6] . There remains additional uncertainty following Brexit about arrangements for continuity of supplies of medicines, regulation of medicinal products and transnational access to new medicines across the region [7] . Trade and tariff barriers arising from evolving isolationist policies of the USA are also likely to restrict progress on implementation and the health impact of achieving the UN's Sustainable Development Goals, not least through increased international costs of diagnostics, devices and medicines.","A national strategy for the management of COPD, drafted by the Chinese Medical Association, was fi rst published in 2002 and then updated annually. 81 Doctors are also encouraged to adopt the GOLD (Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease) guideline for the care of patients with COPD. 1 Despite widely disseminated evidence-based clinical practice guidelines, current knowledge of primary care physicians and management of patients with COPD remain suboptimal.

However, the education market demands much more. Teaching, executive training, book and blog publishing may be low priorities in academia compared to peer-reviewed papers, but are effective ways for researchers to gain practitioner and societal relevance. Our contemporary knowledge consumers see rigor as an order-qualifier while relevance is their orderwinner. Deeper understanding of rigor and relevance is key here Varadarajan, 2003) , as is research-related academic-practitioner engaged scholarship ( Van de Ven, 2018) . A key proposition of this paper is that research alone overlooks an array of interactive educational opportunities in our armoury, and that innovative teaching practice, processes and programs can be used to help bridge the research-practice gap.","Initial outbreak sizes were among the key determinants for the success of isolation. 2 months ago, the world knew almost nothing about COVID-19, and Wuhanthe epicentre of the outbreak-did not have the luxury of early detection and response. Challenged by the reality that earlier opportunities had been missed, China launched a costly public health response in Wuhan, which involved many tactics besides isolation of cases and contacts, including lockdown of the city and mass quarantine, social distancing mandates, school closures, and intense case finding and contact tracing by the medical and public health professionals who were mobilised across the country to come to Wuhan. [2] [3] [4] The approach in Wuhan and the nearby cities in Hubei Province took exceptional measures in response to the outbreak, because there was evidence of high-level community transmission and widespread nosocomial infections. 5 As of Feb 11, 2020, 3019 COVID-19 cases among health workers had been reported, with at least five deaths. 5,6 In many regions outside of China, decision makers and the medical community still have the opportunity of early detection and response. 2 The Article by Hellewell and colleagues gives us a clearer sense of how quickly the window for early response is closing: when the number of initial cases increases to 40, the probability of failure to control is high, at 80% even with 80% of contacts traced and isolated. Based on the early experience in Wuhan, the number of COVID-19 cases could increase from 20 to 40 cases within 3 days (from Jan 6-8, 2020), and outbreak sizes doubled in every 7\u00b74 days on average, highlighting the urgency of early detection and rapid response. 7 In Hellewell and colleagues' model, transmission before symptoms, even when the percentage is moderate, at 15-30%, had a marked effect on probability to control. 1 Unlike the severe acute respiratory syndrome virus, where almost all onward transmissions occur after symptom onset, 8 we now know that transmission of COVID-19 virus can occur before symptom onset. In the fifth version of Chinese guidelines governing contact tracing, it defined close contacts as \"those who have been in close contact since 2 days before the onset of symptoms in suspected and confirmed cases, or 2 days prior to an asymptomatic confirmed case,\" which reflects our current understanding that secondary transmission of COVID-19 virus is possible at least 2 days before symptom onset. 9 However, the efficiency of transmission remains uncertain, and seroprevalence studies among different contacts will be important. Transmission by people with no or mild symptoms can dampen the power of the isolation strategy because of reduced likelihood of isolating all cases and tracing all contacts. The identification and testing of potential cases need to be as extensive as is permitted by health care and diagnostic testing capacity-including the identification, testing, and isolation of suspected cases with no or mild disease (eg, influenza-like illness).","Although COVID-19 is a pandemic as opposed to a natural disaster, it too is creating challenges for patients in terms of its impact on normal day-to-day routines (e.g. through social distancing and self-isolation requirements), employment and access to healthcare services which will ultimately create new barriers to medication adherence. Community pharmacists have an important role to play in promoting medication adherence through the provision of evidence-based interventions. 40, 41 However, income losses in particular may affect patients' abilities to continue to pay for their medications. Current medication reimbursement policies should be re-examined in light of the acute income losses faced by many individuals whose jobs have either been lost or are now under threat. For example, access to medication on public health schemes may need to be increased and prescription copayments for patients who obtain their medications on such schemes may need to be reconsidered as these can also negatively impact on medication adherence. 42","The third, and perhaps largest objective of the Working Group, is to strengthen influenza-related public health practices, infrastructure, and research. A successful component of this objective is the promotion of adult immunization programs with improved vaccine coverage of individuals at increased risk of complications from influenza. Several groups are developing communications networks and protocols to disseminate up-to-date information to healthcare providers and the public. Research on influenza biology and epidemiology, animal surveillance, and vaccine and antiviral development has been and will continue to be supported by NIH through grants to academic researchers and through grants that support public-private partnerships. Development of cell culture-based vaccines and the testing in humans of candidate pandemic vaccines made using reverse genetics or classical reassortment techniques should be encouraged. There is also a need to test adjuvanted vaccines and to develop new antiviral agents. It is noteworthy that there are currently only two influenza vaccine manufacturers licensed to distribute vaccine in the US for the 2003-2004 influenza season. It is also noteworthy that 80-90% of produced vaccine is purchased privately, and it takes nearly a full year from the time of selection of strains to the production of usable vaccine. As a result, it will be essential to encourage new vaccine manufacturers and new approaches, including reverse genetics to prepare seed strains, in addition to developing and implementing a vaccine policy that ensures adequate and fair procurement and distribution of the vaccine during an influenza pandemic. Such policies will need to take into account liability protection and equitable global access. Finally, identifying appropriate antiviral drugs to stockpile and developing plans to prioritize use of these antivirals are necessary for pandemic preparedness.","The clinical trial is cited as the gold standard of epidemiologic research. However, many epidemiologic studies cannot take place under such rigorously controlled conditions. Taking advantage of opportunities to study diseases in clinical and community settings is one of the strengths of epidemiology. In the setting of a clinical practice, epidemiology may involve studying a series of patients, participating in multicenter trials, or being a reporting source for cases of disease to public health officials. This last aspect of epidemiologic study may be a legal obligation, but it should also be viewed as an opportunity for all practicing clinicians to participate in the practice of community-based epidemiology. Academic-based research centers are often settings for clinical trials, studies requiring newly developed laboratory methods, or studies derived from referrals to clinical specialty groups. Public health departments typically do not have direct access to or contact with patients for clinical trials, but they are responsible for surveillance of reportable diseases and the investigation of outbreaks. There has been a debate about how to distinguish public health surveillance from research and the ethical considerations of that distinction. 36 Each of the described settings provides opportunities for epidemiologic studies that can make major contributions to the understanding, prevention, and control of infectious diseases.","All three domains (research, practice and social) need to reinvigorate their commitment to the pursuit of understanding, recognising that the complexity of the commons has taken us well beyond the capacity of any one domain to achieve its goals without interaction with others. Fig. 3 identifies that education provides one bridge to effective interaction. However, multiple perspectives have moved the commons beyond taming such dilemmas with simplistic linear solutions. Incentives and rewards in all three domains are complicated and there will be many trial-and-error interactions without necessarily guaranteeing immediate and measurable benefits. Young career academics are under increasing scrutiny to perform well on student evaluations even though teaching is often treated as a given, and not celebrated like high level publication. These younger academics increasingly game the teaching system and avoid risk in pursuit of a simple \"tick\" on their education-related tenure evaluations. This only exacerbates distrust of students and stakeholders. We cannot predict which experiments will lead to which outcomes (Rice, O'Connor, &amp; Pierantozzi, 2008) but our more interactive educational cases show that there are plenty of opportunities and plenty do work.","China's Economic Statecraft and Social Penetration against Taiwan Finally, they employ new digital technologies to spread false and divisive discourse. Authoritarian regimes usually exercise their sharp power through four types of social exchanges: cultural exchange programs, academic/think tank cooperation, media, and publishing. For example, China established a global network of Confucius Institutes all over the world to host cultural, educational, and academic exchange programs. Each year, China also hosts several all-expenses-paid media and think tank conferences and exchanges with journalists and scholars worldwide. Those programs and conferences, no matter how diversified they are, share one thing in common: censorship. Program staff usually seek to block discussions on sensitive topics, such as Taiwan, Tibet, Uyghurs, or other human rights issues in China. Criticisms are discouraged, especially those that challenge the legitimacy of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). Participants are expected to promote a positive image of China, as well as to praise China's social, economic, and cultural model and its achievements. 12 Of course, liberal hegemons or other democratic great powers also regularly promote their culture and political values worldwide. Joseph Nye uses \"soft power\" to describe liberal powers' pursuit of and competition for international attractiveness, legitimacy, and credibility. 13 However, there are two qualitatively different characteristics between soft power and sharp power. First, as Nye indicates, soft power rests in the ability of persuasion and voluntarism: you persuade your target to voluntarily follow your request with legitimate values or reasons. Sharp power, in contrast, fundamentally rejects voluntarism. Sharp power relies on the deceptive use of information and covert operations to mislead the target. In other words, sharp power is actually a type of coercive power because it eliminates the target's voluntary choices by manipulating ideas, political perceptions, electoral processes, and so on. 14 Second, openness is the prerequisite for developing soft power, while sharp power is based on opacity, censorship, and barriers to free flows of information. Ultimately, soft power hinges on legitimacy, and no one can sustain legitimacy without transparency. A country is likely to lose its international legitimacy, as well as soft power, if it continues to rely on covert operations or secret diplomacy, or if its actions are opaque or have a hidden agenda. In contrast, opacity facilitates manipulation through disinformation and is thus conducive to sharp power. Liberal democracies historically countered sharp power by promoting open information and transparency of state behaviors. However, information and communication technologies have CHANG AND YANG created the opportunities for authoritarian regimes to exploit the openness and interdependence of global networks.","recommendations \u2610Criteria for assessing impact of implementing the recommendations \u2610Advice on the frequency and interval of measurement \u2610Operational definitions of how the criteria should be measured \u2610A statement that the guideline will be updated \u2610Explicit time interval or explicit criteria to guide decisions about when an update will occur \u2610Methodology for the updating procedure \u2610Types of facilitators and barriers that were considered \u2610Methods by which information regarding the facilitators and barriers to implementing recommendations were sought (e.g., feedback from key stakeholders, pilot testing of guidelines before widespread implementation)","Applying system-oriented event analysis model to the safety of center catheter care systems Lin Shi-Hua 1 , Chuang Sheu-Wen 2 , Hsueh Kuei-hsia 1 , Chen Han-Hsing 1 . 1 Taipei Hospital, Ministry of Health and Welfare, 2 Taipei Medical University Background: At 1990 Institute of Medicine (IOM) proposed \"To Err is Human: Building a Safer Health System,\" the construction of safe sanitation systems have become a modern medical industry objectives pursued. Central line (CL) bundles to prevent central line-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSIs) are widely promoted. However, in 2010 the studies also a policy for the CL bundle is often present but frequently not well implemented by National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN). Therefore, understanding the center catheter care systems during the depth of the interaction cross relationship becomes a very important issue. In addition, in recent years, to develop resilience engineering bringing new opportunities to enhance patient safety. Therefore, the study Applying System-Oriented Event Analysis Model (SOEA) and resilience engineering to the safety of center catheter care systems. Methods: Used SOEA and qualitative research interviews in an Intensive Care Unit of regional hospital. Results: The study found the goals of central catheter care systems to save patients live and control the CLABSI, in system-wide, there are three important sub-systems of working system functions to achieve system goals. Use SOEA, we found that there are 9 kinds of hazards in the central catheter care system. However, sampling a total of 15 cases of exposure to hazard among those in January 1, 2015 to March 31, 2015, only 3 cases to get the CLABSI. In view of this situation, interview doctors and nurses, found that in the same system hazers caused by the various states, have the same or different reaction practices to maintain their system and can implement functions continue to work, and may reduce the risk of patient injury. In the other hand, the SOEA can clarify the relationship between the various elements of central catheter care systems, combined with resilience engineering to understand HealthCare worker that how to respond the system in daily hazards, and under the anticipated and unanticipated occurrence of various adaptively adjust its central catheter combined practices, rather than blindly follow, and to maintain patient safety practices.

Rather, the capacity to identify and recognize different perspectives on the same issue is a necessary skill for developing a conceptual synthesis that respects the complementary input from a plurality of stakeholders. The following examples and discussion examine the practical implications, opportunities, and limitations of applying transdisciplinary approaches to specific emerging infections.","When a patient seeks medical attention because of illness, the physician searches for evidence to establish a diagnosis that leads to treatment that will cure or ameliorate the illness. Prior to the medical encounter, the diagnostic possibilities are enormous ranging from medical and surgical diseases to the field of psychiatry. Infectious diseases in theory offer the greatest opportunities for specific nonsurgical treatment of illness. The key to a favorable outcome is an astute clinician who seeks appropriate clinical, occupational, social, and travel history; considers wisely the potential epidemiological exposures; and gathers incisive data from the physical examination, radiological studies, and laboratory testing. The intermediate result is a prioritized list of differential diagnoses with focus on identifying diseases with the highest clinical consequences and those that are amenable to treatment.","Thirdly, One Health should be formally included in the curricula of medical, veterinary, public health and epidemiology courses. Improved understanding of the core principles of One Health by stakeholders is instrumental and currently appears lacking. Education opportunities, such as workshops, conferences and professional development courses needs to be developed. It is also imperative to recognize the need to extend education on the One Health approach beyond professionals in the health sciences field. Further efforts are required to educate all stakeholders, from primary producers through to legislators.","The accreditation standards can be used effectively to guide the surgical teams in the transformation of the specialty. The 17 standards are divided into nine subsections that relate to the activities of the teams. The subsections represent the continuum of clinical care as well as aspects related to learning. Within the subsections and standards are opportunities for surgeons and surgical teams to use the standards to effectively deliver services and to continuously improve patient care.","The remarkable ability of infectious agents to adapt to new environments and exploit the susceptibilities of their hosts will continue to complicate and obstruct eff orts for their control. In the USA, the largest gains will be achieved through focused eff orts to reduce high burden and high consequence diseases and to strengthen eff orts to promote early detection of and rapid response to emerging infections. Priorities for these eff orts include prevention measures with broad-reaching eff ects such as vaccines, multifaceted approaches to decrease antimicrobial resistance, and testing and education to reduce the further spread of preventable infections. In addition, new opportunities for control of infectious disease are envisioned through US health reforms, which are expanding access to care and improving health-care coordination for many underserved populations."],"title":["Symptom-Based Isolation Policies: Evidence from a Mathematical Model of Outbreaks of Influenza and COVID-19","Telemedicine in the Era of COVID-19","Contamination
