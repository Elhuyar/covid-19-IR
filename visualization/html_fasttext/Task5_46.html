Several terms have been used to describe the variety of techniques that have been designed to oxygenate blood and remove carbon dioxide extracorporeally. These include ECMO, extracorporeal carbon dioxide removal (ECCO2-R) and extracorporeal life support (ECLS). In the typical ECMO setting, a femoral-jugular venovenous bypass is established with oxygenation of the circulating blood by the membrane oxygenator. ECMO was introduced into the treatment of ARDS in the 1970s. In adults with ARDS, two randomized controlled trials failed to show an advantage of ECMO over conventional ventilation. 128, 129 However, both these trials were performed before the development of modern heparinized tubings and membrane oxygenators, which may reduce the complications of this modality.","The WHO-declared pandemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is causing clusters of fatal pneumonia from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID- 19) , with reports of some patients receiving extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) support. [1] [2] [3] [4] WHO interim guidelines 5 for the management of suspected COVID-19 recommend administering venovenous ECMO to eligible patients with COVID-19related acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in expert centres with sufficient case volumes to ensure clinical expertise. However, its effectiveness will be influenced by the initial experience and preparedness of the health-care system. 6 Although there are observational data on the use of rescue ECMO during previous outbreaks of emerging infectious diseases, mainly in the context of influenza A(H1N1) ARDS, the real need for ECMO during such outbreaks is unclear. For reference, the incidence of ECMO use in patients with 2009 influenza A(H1N1) ARDS in Australia and New Zealand was estimated to be 2\u00b76 cases per million, whereas 5\u00b78% of the critically ill patients in Saudi Arabia were supported with ECMO for Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus-related ARDS. 7, 8 Therefore, the overall impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on potential ECMO use is currently unclear, but there could be an increased need for ECMO worldwide.","The planning of ECMO services during an outbreak of an emerging infectious disease such as COVID-19 can be broadly categorised into ensuring appropriate organisation of personnel, equipment, facilities, and systems (figure 2). 16 As with any scarce resource in times of high demand, a mismatch in these factors can develop. During the 2009 influenza A(H1N1) pandemic, inadequate surge capacity highlighted the need for intensive-care reserves and improved health-care resource planning at all levels. 17, 18 In an effort to improve ECMO preparedness 19 for an outbreak of an emerging infectious disease, we highlight the ten key components of an ECMO action plan (panel) based on these four categories, with practical recommendations for health centres to ensure appropriate training, capacity, and planning, depending on local priorities and resources. The focus is on building sustainable systems that ensure quality care for patients and their families and staff safety and wellbeing. Details on the organisation of ECMO programmes have been reported elsewhere. 20, 21 WHO interim guidelines recommend offering extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) to eligible patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) related to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The number of patients with COVID-19 infection who might develop severe ARDS that is refractory to maximal medical management and require this level of support is currently unknown. Available evidence from similar patient populations suggests that carefully selected patients with severe ARDS who do not benefit from conventional treatment might be successfully supported with venovenous ECMO. The need for ECMO is relatively low and its use is mostly restricted to specialised centres globally. Providing complex therapies such as ECMO during outbreaks of emerging infectious diseases has unique challenges. Careful planning, judicious resource allocation, and training of personnel to provide complex therapeutic interventions while adhering to strict infection control measures are all crucial components of an ECMO action plan. ECMO can be initiated in specialist centres, or patients can receive ECMO during transportation from a centre that is not specialised for this procedure to an expert ECMO centre. Ensuring that systems enable safe and coordinated movement of critically ill patients, staff, and equipment is important to improve ECMO access. ECMO preparedness for the COVID-19 pandemic is important in view of the high transmission rate of the virus and respiratory-related mortality.","In additional antiviral therapy, special attention should be paid to ventilator management and other supportive care. Similar to ARDS of any other cause, patients who require invasive mechanical ventilation should be treated with a low-tidalvolume strategy targeting 6 mL/kg of ideal body weight. [39] [40] [41] In cases of severe ARDS, consideration should be given to salvage therapies, including prone positioning and paralytic therapy for the first 48 hours following intubation. [42] [43] [44] Although noninvasive positive pressure ventilation has been tried in patients with ARDS, 45,46 reports from the 2009 H1N1 pandemic suggest that this strategy is not effective in patients with ARDS caused by influenza. 47 Patients with severe viral infection are at risk for secondary bacterial pneumonia, because of both the effects of the virus alone and the risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia from prolonged mechanical ventilation. 48, 49 Invasive tests, such as bronchoscopy, may be helpful to differentiate bacterial coinfection from viral pneumonia alone. 5, 50 In general, the empiric use of antibiotic therapy in patients with viral pneumonia should be avoided and may increase the risk of antibiotic resistance and subsequent nosocomial infection. 51,52 The use of intravenous corticosteroids in the treatment of ARDS has generally not improved outcomes. 53,54 In patients with ARDS related to influenza and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), adjunctive corticosteroids have not improved outcomes and may increase the risk subsequent nosocomial infection. 55, 56 Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) gained attention during the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic after several studies reported low mortality in patients with viral ARDS treated with this modality. 57, 58 The only randomized clinical trial that compared ARDS treatment with ECMO with conventional care, the CESAR trial, enrolled a significant proportion of patients with influenza. 59 However, this trial had several significant methodological limitations; in particular, more patients in the ECMO arm were treated with a low-tidalvolume ventilation strategy compared with patients in the conventional arm. In a retrospective matched cohort study of patients with influenza A (H1N1) and ARDS, the mortality in patients treated with ECMO was similar to propensity score-matched controls not treated with ECMO. 60 ","Current interventions such as lung protective ventilation, prone ventilation, and neuromuscular blocking agents have been shown in randomized trials to improve mortality in patients with ARDS [5\u20137]. However, in some patients, these conventional measures fail to maintain adequate oxygenation; therefore, other rescue therapies are considered, such as different modes of ventilation, inhaled pulmonary vasodilators, and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). Anticipated difficulties in patient recruitment, study design, and ethical concerns affect the feasibility of conducting randomized clinical trials that examine the efficacy of ECMO in this population. Therefore, observational studies are a reasonable alternative. In this study, we aim to describe the effect of ECMO rescue therapy on patient-important outcomes in patients with severe MERS-CoV.","The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) can induce acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which can progress to refractory pulmonary failure. In such cases, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) may be considered as a rescue therapy. In a study of ECMO for ARDS in patients with Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV), a similar coronavirus disease emerged in 2012, a significant decrease of inhospital mortality rate and length of intensive care unit (ICU) stay was found in patients treated with ECMO compared to those managed with conventional therapy [1] . However, with COVID-19, concerns have been raised about high mortality rate observed in an early report which included data on ECMO in infected patients [2] . It has been suggested that the compounded immunologic insult by both infection and extracorporeal circuit may counterbalance or even offset survival benefits [2] . In this article, we aimed to evaluate ECMO mortality as reported in early COVID-19 epidemiological studies.","Because mechanical ventilation is reliant on a functional alveolus for gaseous diff usion, it is unable to provide lifesaving respiratory support when a critical volume of alveolar units has failed. In addition to replacing endogenous alveolar gaseous exchange, extracorporeal gas exchange-either extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) or extracorporeal carbon dioxide removal-allows reduction in ventilatory settings, reducing the risk of ventilator-induced lung injury. At present, the evidence base for these interventions is sparse, consisting of case series, observational cohort studies, and one randomised controlled trial. In the CESAR study, 114 rather than directly assessing ECMO in refractory hypoxaemia, investigators compared management at a referring centre with management at a tertiary centre capable of providing ECMO in 180 patients. The cohort managed at the ECMO centre had a higher rate of survival without disability at 6 months than did those managed at referring centres (63% vs 47%; RR 0\u00b769, 95% CI 0\u00b705-0\u00b797; p=0\u00b703), although only 75% of the group received ECMO. Two observational studies, one from Australia and New Zealand 115 and one from the UK, 116 also showed high rates of survival with ECMO in patients with infl uenza A (H1N1) with refractory hypoxaemia on maximum ventilatory support. However, ECMO is a scarce and expensive resource that is often available only at specialist centres (fi gure 4) and associated with well recognised complications, including bleeding, vascular damage, and risks from interhospital transfer. Despite widespread and growing use worldwide, at present there is an absence of level one evidence for its effi cacy. In the UK, ECMO is a nationally commissioned service provided at few regional centres.","Treatment principle: treat the patients to improve the symptoms and underlying diseases, actively prevent potential complications and secondary infection; provide timely measures to support organ function. Hypoxic respiratory failure and severe ARDS. Give oxygen therapy immediately to patients with ARDS, and closely monitor them for signs of clinical deterioration, such as rapidly progressive respiratory failure. Consider severe hypoxemic respiratory failure when standard oxygen therapy fails. When patients have increased frequency of breathing (&gt; 30 times/min) and hypoxemia (SpO2 &lt; 90% or PaO2 &lt; 60 mmHg) even with oxygen delivered via a face mask and reservoir bag (gas flow of 10~15 L/min, FiO2 0.60\u20130.95), it may be considered as hypoxic respiratory failure.ARDS is a status of severe acute hypoxic respiratory failure caused by increased pulmonary capillary permeability and alveolar epithelial cell damage. It can be divided into mild, moderate and severe conditions according to the Berlin definition [38] (Table 6). HFNO. Under the support of standard oxygen therapy, to maintain SpO2 above 93% stills hard, and the breathing rate increases rapidly, then HFNO should be considered. HFNO can deliver 60 L/min of gas flow and FiO2 up to 1.0. Generally, gas flow is initially set as 30\u201340 L/min and oxygen concentration 50%\u201360%, which is well tolerated and coordinated. Then settings can be adjusted according to the oxygenation status of patients. Compared with standard oxygen therapy, HFNO is able to reduce the chance of tracheal intubation. Patients with hypercapnia (like exacerbation of obstructive lung disease, cardiogenic pulmonary edema), hemodynamic instability, multi-organ failure, or abnormal mental status should not be given HFNO. HFNO may be safe in patients with mild-moderate and non-worsening hypercapnia. However, if the respiratory distress still exists or even worsens dramatically under HFNO (FiO2 &gt; 70%, gas flow &gt; 50 L/min for 1 hour), the respiratory supporting strategy should be changed.NIV. NIV provides a certain positive pressure ventilation effect through the positive pressure formed by the closed mask. HFNO combined with intermittent short-term NIV (1\u20132 h) support may be useful to reduce respiratory power consumption and improve oxygenation. But NIV guidelines recommend the use of respiratory support therapy in hypoxemic respiratory failure or pandemic viral illness. Limited data showed a high failure rate of NIV in MERS patients. Invasive mechanical ventilation should be considered in case the ARDS still exists and even acutely deteriorates in NIV process (about 1 h). Patients with hemodynamic instability, multiple organ failure, or abnormal mental status should not receive NIV.Invasive mechanical ventilation. Under the support of HFNO (the demand for FiO2 &gt; 70% and gas flow &gt; 50 L/min) or NIV, ARDS still exists and even acutely deteriorates, invasive mechanical ventilation should be implemented as soon as possible.Endotracheal intubation should be carried out by trained and experienced provider using airborne precautions, since endotracheal intubation is an operation that may produce a large number of contagious aerosols.The strategy of protective lung ventilation should be implemented in invasive mechanical ventilation: lower tidal volume (4\u20136 ml/kg), lower plateau pressure (&lt; 30 cmH2O), and appropriate PEEP. For patients with moderate-severe ARDS (PaO2/FiO2 &lt; 150), it is recommended to use higher PEEP, apply prone ventilation for more than 12 h per day and adopt deep sedation and analgesia muscle relaxation strategy within the first 48 h of mechanical ventilation. For patients with severe acute hypoxic respiratory failure, we should pay attention to and prevent ventilator-associated lung injury after mechanical ventilation.Extracorporeal Life Support (ECLS). In the process of invasive mechanical ventilation when the patient is still in the state of hypoxia, combined with increased partial pressure of carbon dioxide (excluding ventilation dysfunction, PaCO2 &gt; 60 mmHg), especially after muscle relaxation and prone ventilation, it is necessary to consider to implement ECLS. However, it is suggested that ECLS treatment should only be carried out under the condition that the professional center is with access to expertise. Currently the ECLS in ICU includes VV-ECMO (blood is pumped from femoral vein, and returns to right atrium through internal jugular vein after oxygenation through membrane oxygenator) and VA-ECMO (blood is pumped from femoral vein and directly enters aortic system through femoral artery after oxygenation through membrane oxygenator). For patients with severe refractory hypoxemia, neuromuscular blockade can improve oxygen supply, especially if there is still evidence of ventilator-patient dyssynchrony after the use of sedatives. However, neuromuscular blockade through continuous infusion should not be routinely used in patients with moderate-severe ARDS; Where available, ECMO in conjunction with low tidal-volume mechanical ventilation can be considered in the treatment of patients with severe refractory hypoxemia in whom standard therapy are failing; Routine use of high-frequency oscillatory ventilation (HFOV) in patients with moderate-severe ARDS is not beneficial, but may be harmful. However, HFOV may still be regarded as a rescue therapy for patients with severe ARDS and refractory hypoxemia. ECMO can be used in some severe ARDS patients (lung injury score &gt; 3 or pH &lt; 7.2 due to uncompensated hypercapnia), but it is not recommended for all ARDS patients. It can be considered to use extracorporeal carbon dioxide removal for ARDS patients, if there is more supportive research evidence in the future.","Twenty-two experts, with an emphasis on clinicians in the front line of clinical treatment, were invited to join the second round of Delphi survey. With 20 of these experts responding to the questionnaire within 24 h, the attrition rate was 8%. Certain additional outcomes-chest CT test, respiratory rate, blood gas analysis, acute physiology and chronic health evaluation (APACHE) II score, lactic acid, and psychological test-were suggested to supplement the agreed-upon outcomes. Based on the results of the second round, a teleconference was held by the steering group to discuss and confirm the candidate outcomes for the final consensus meeting. After discussion, the steering group agreed that the APACHE II score would be added to the severe stage; the CURB-65 score and duration of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) would be removed from the critical type; and the incidence of sequelae and the rate of interstitial pneumonia would be combined into the incidence of sequelae. Finally, the outcomes voted as essential for consensus included four for mild, eight for ordinary, 16 for severe, 12 for critical, and four for rehabilitation period (Table 4 ).","Key words: COVID-19, Arrhythmias, Electrocardiogram, Acute cardiac injury Case 1 A 66-year-old woman with no remarkable past medical history was admitted to the hospital with diagnosed COVID-19. The symptom of dyspnea and pulmonary imaging (Supplementary Figure S1A ) developed and progressively worsened in the following 30 days of hospitalization. Finally, trachea intubation and vein-to-vein extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VV-ECMO) were employed in order to maintain optimal PaO2. The ECMO was withdrawn five days later when the patient became stabilized. The patient's ECG revealed dynamic changes when her clinical state was unstable. The baseline ECG shows sinus rhythm with a first-degree atrioventricular block (AVB) (Fig. 1A) . On the day of the trachea intubation, the ECG recording showed sinus tachycardia with SITIIIQIII morphology (Fig. 1B) . A simultaneous echocardiogram revealed an enlarged right atrium and right ventricle accompanied by severe tricuspid regurgitation, which could result from the elevated pulmonary artery pressure. Mobitz type I second-degree AVB and atrioventricular junctional escape beat were recorded (Fig. 1C ) the same day. On the following day, temporary nearly complete AVB (or high-grade AVB) developed (Fig. 1D ). Soon after, the ECG showed a recovery to first-degree AVB, and the SITIIIQIII disappeared ( Fig 1F) . Case 2 A 70-year-old man was admitted to the hospital with a diagnosis of COVID-19. He had a previous history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes. Despite of therapy, lesions in both lungs increased (see Supplementary Figure S1B ) and hypoxemia got worsen. On the fourteenth day of hospitalization, trachea intubation was required to maintain optimal oxygenation. The patient's first ECG recording showed basic rhythm of sinus tachycardia with an incomplete right bundle branch block (RBBB) ( Fig. 2A) . On the 34 th day of hospitalization, the patient developed severe hypoxia and VV-ECMO was employed. However, the patient's oxygenation had not significantly improved and severe hypotension ensued. Artery blood gas showed a critically low PaO2 level of 57.3 mmHg and lactic acidosis (Lac 10.8mmol/L). The day after VV-ECMO incubation, the patient's ECG demonstrated ST segment elevations in inferior and precordial leads (Fig 2B) and the amplitude of ST elevation was gradually increasing to form a triangular QRS-ST-T waveform (Fig. 2E) . During the evolution of ST elevation, two episodes of multifocal ventricular tachycardia developed (Figs. 2C and 2D) . Lidocaine was administered and sinus rhythm was restored. Simultaneous blood chemical tests showed positive cardiac troponin I (cTnI), elevated creatine kinase (CK) of 900.9U/L (normal range 10-190 U/L), creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB) of 72.6U/L (normal range 0-24 U/L), and significantly increase of N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) up to 24245pg/ml (normal range&lt;900). The echocardiogram revealed diffuse hypokinesis, especially in the anterior and inferior walls. The patient died within 24 hours of the occurrence of ventricular tachycardia and ST elevation. Discussion It is reported that acute cardiac injury is not uncommon in patients with COVID-19 1, 2 . The percentage of COVID-19 patients with myocardial injury has been reported variously at 12% 1 and 7.2% 2 , which is much higher in critically ill patients in these two study. As seen in our report, the abnormal ECG changes were recorded during the critical condition of these two cases. There were several possible mechanisms. Firstly, Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) has been identified as a functional receptor for coronaviruses 3 , which is highly expressed in the heart and lungs. Therefore, ACE2-related signaling pathways might have played a role in cardiac injury. Secondly, hypoxemia caused by COVID-19 may cause damage to myocardial cells. Thirdly, the systemic inflammatory response and immune system disorders may be important factors 4 . The ECG changes may reflect different cardiac injuries with diverse manifestations.","Supportive therapy includes bedrest, adequate nutrition, monitoring vital signs and oxygen saturation, prevention of dehydration and maintaining water, electrolyte, and acid-base balance. For severe cases, it may be necessary to proactively prevent complications and secondary Y. Yang, et al. Journal of Autoimmunity xxx (xxxx) xxxx infections, treat underlying diseases and provide organ function support according to the patients' condition such as that reported by Chen et all that involved the administration of intravenous immunoglobulin therapy to 27 of such patients [37] . Supplemental oxygen should be administered to patients with decreased oxygen saturation. In Huang's study [26] , four (10%) patients needed invasive mechanical ventilation, and two received extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). In Chen's study [37] , 75 of 99 patients received oxygen therapy, 13 patients required non-invasive mechanical ventilation, four patients needed an invasive ventilator to assist ventilation, and three patients were treated with ECMO. In Wang's study [83] , of the 36 patients in the ICU, four patients received high-flow oxygen therapy, 15 patients received non-invasive ventilation, and 17 patients received invasive ventilation (four patients switched to ECMO). In Guan's study, 418 of 1099 patients received oxygen therapy, 67 patients received mechanical ventilation, and ECMO was adopted in 5 severe cases [85] .","In The Lancet Respiratory Medicine, Kollengode Ramanathan and colleagues 1 provide excellent recommendations for the use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) for patients with respiratory failure from acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) secondary to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The authors describe pragmatic approaches to the challenges of delivering ECMO to patients with COVID-19, including training health-care personnel, resolving equipment and facilities issues, implementing systems for infection control and personal protection, providing overall support for health-care staff, and mitigating ethical issues. They also address some of the anticipated challenges with local and regional surges in COVID-19 ARDS cases; although there has been an increase in hospitals with the capacity to provide ECMO, the potential demand might exceed the available resources. Furthermore, some health-care systems offer advanced therapies such as ECMO but lack a coordinated local, regional, or national referral protocol.","Several studies examining risk factors for the development of ARDS related to 2009 H1N1 noted that time to treatment with antivirals was important: patients who received appropriate antiviral therapy with oseltamivir or zanamavir shortly after presentation for medical care had better outcomes. 41, 46, 48 Rapid initiation of antivirals when H1N1 infection is suspected is particularly important in those with risk factors for disease progression and those requiring hospitalization. Ideally, therapy should be started within 48 hours of symptom onset, but is also effective and recommended if given later than this. 70 The recommended dose is 75 mg twice a day, although higher doses were given at some centers for critically ill and obese patients according to WHO recommendations. 71 Recent data suggest that 75 mg of oseltamivir administered twice per day via the orogastric route in critically ill patients consistently yields sufficient blood levels for near maximal (in vitro) suppression of viral replication. 72 Most patients also received broad-spectrum antimicrobial therapy, at least initially, while investigations were pending to determine the cause of respiratory failure. Current recommendations from the CDC state that antiviral treatment is recommended as early as possible in any patient with confirmed or suspected influenza who requires hospitalization, has severe, complicated, and progressive illness, or is at high risk for influenza complications (ie, &lt;2 years and &gt;65 years, immunocompromised, chronic disease, pregnant or postpartum, morbidly obese, Aboriginal, and residents of nursing homes or long-term care facilities). The current recommended therapy is either oseltamivir or inhaled zanamivir. However, in individuals with underlying respiratory disease, oseltamivir is recommended over zanamivir. 73 In critically ill patients with pneumonia, the viral RNA may be detected in lower airway secretions for several weeks after the initiation of oseltamivir. In patients with influenza pneumonia or evidence of clinical progression, an increased dose of the oseltamivir (150 mg twice daily in adults) and, more importantly, an increased duration of therapy for 10 days instead of 5 days, may be warranted. 29, 74 Oseltamivir-resistant viruses have been isolated, but are not common. The resistance is via a His275Tyr mutation in viral neuraminidase, which confers high-level resistance to oseltamivir but not zanamivir. Most resistant isolates have been found in patients with prior oseltamivir exposure, and have been associated with mild self-limited disease. If oseltamivir resistance is suspected or confirmed, treatment should be with zanamivir. 29, 75 Most patients admitted to an ICU with 2009 H1N1 viral pneumonitis fulfilled the criteria for ALI or ARDS and required mechanical ventilation. Many patients initiated on noninvasive positive-pressure ventilation (NIPPV) failed this mode, and subsequently required intubation and invasive ventilation. 21, 38 There are some reports of successful use of NIPPV, likely related to selection of less hypoxemic patients for this mode of treatment. 25 Concerns arose regarding transmission of H1N1 with NIPPV, as this mode of ventilation generates respiratory droplets and aerosols, which can reach a 0.5-m radius surrounding a patient receiving NIPPV. 76 Most centers internationally ventilated 2009 H1N1 viral pneumonitis patients with low tidal ventilation (6 mL/kg of predicted body weight and plateau pressures &lt;30 cm H 2 O) whenever possible, as this is what has been recommended for ARDS based on results of the ARDSNet trial. 46, 69, 70, [77] [78] [79] High levels of positive endexpiratory pressure (PEEP) were noted to be required to manage severe hypoxemia, with mean PEEP levels between 16 and 22 cm H 2 O reported in some studies. 25, 38, 39, 49 Other modes of ventilation were also used, including airway pressure release ventilation and high-frequency oscillation; however, there are insufficient data to conclusively state whether these modes had any impact on outcomes. 21, 49 Similarly, recruitment maneuvers, prone positioning, and inhaled nitric oxide were used as salvage therapies for refractory hypoxemia, again with insufficient evidence to determine their effectiveness. 21, 25, 49, 80 Several studies have reported on the use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic. The largest of these series is from Australia, where 68 patients with severe ARDS (median PaO 2 /FiO 2 of 58 and PEEP of 18 cm H 2 O) were initiated on ECMO. Seventy-one percent survived their ICU admission and 21% died. By comparison, only 4 patients had been treated with ECMO for ARDS in the previous year in the same Australian centers. 58 Reports from other countries on the use of ECMO for ARDS related to H1N1 2009 pneumonia are much smaller, with mortality rates of between 56% and 67%. 81, 82 Avoidance of volume overload (and judicious diuresis) may also be associated with reduced duration of ventilation and length of stay in the ICU for most patients with ARDS. 83 This strategy was used and recommended in patients with ARDS related to 2009 H1N1. 84 Steroids were used in a variable number of patients across studies and for varying indications (sepsis, COPD or asthma exacerbation, stress-dose replacement therapy, or ARDS). 21, 41, 52 One study in Argentina examined the effect of treatment with corticosteroids, and found steroids to be safe and associated with improvement in lung injury score. However, there were only 13 patients and there was no real comparator group, as all patients received some degree of steroid therapy. 85 A study from the European Society of Intensive Care medicine H1N1 registry found that early use of corticosteroids in patients admitted to the ICU with H1N1 was associated with increased risk of superinfections, predominantly hospitalacquired pneumonia, with no mortality benefit. 86 Similarly, other studies found no mortality benefit or even harm with early steroid use. 87, 88 At present there is insufficient evidence for routine use of steroids in 2009 H1N1 or other influenza-related ARDS. Some historical data and experience with recent influenza epidemics suggests the potential utility of convalescent serum in the management of severe influenza. 89, 90 Although research on the issue is clearly required, the use of convalescent serum or immunoglobulin may become a useful treatment modality should future pandemic influenza A viruses be resistant to current antiviral agents.","Use predetermined consensus criteria for rationing of ECMO if indicated; reassess all aspects of a patient's treatment plan regularly, including the need to continue or terminate ECMO; invoke distributive justice only in circumstances where rationing precludes the ability to care for each individual optimally; seek opinions from hospital ethics and medicolegal committees in ethically challenging scenarios Quality assurance and collaborative research Maintain quality assurance and clinical governance frameworks with frequent ECMO quality reviews; ensure collection and sharing of data to inform preparedness and patient care; aim to have ethics approval in place or develop mechanisms for expedient ethics review and approval processes ECMO=extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. PPE=personal protective equipment.","Supportive therapy is the mainstay of management of severe MERS pneumonia, which includes mechanical ventilation, vasopressor support, and renal replacement therapy if needed. Oxygen rescue therapy like extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has been used in patients with refractory hypoxemia. In one case-control study of patients with MERS, the rescue use of ECMO compared to a matched control with no-ECMO was associated with reduced in-hospital-mortality (65% compared 100%) (Alshahrani et al., 2018) . Another retrospective study, found that critically ill healthcare workers who died because of MERS were more likely to have received ECMO than not, probably because the severity of pneumonia that led to use of rescue therapy, rather than use of ECMO itself (Shalhoub et al., 2018) . Corticosteroids have been used frequently in MERS patients. A study that accounted for time-varying confounding demonstrated that corticosteroid use was not associated with difference on mortality although it was associated with prolongation of viral RNA shedding (Arabi et al., 2018b) .","There are several limitations in this study. First, the development of the outcome pool was only based on clinical trial protocols listed in two registry platforms. Doctors and patients were not consulted to collect indicators. Therefore, there is a potential risk of missing important outcomes. Second, due to the prevalence of new infectious diseases, patients were not invited to join in the survey and consensus process. As a result, patients' opinions may not have been fully reflected. Third, the number of representatives for different stakeholders may not be fully adequate. The fact that the majority of the experts were from China weakens the regional representation. Fourth, the process of consensus was conducted via conference calls instead of through face-to-face meetings, which may have led to insufficient discussion and affected the consensus results. Finally, the current understanding of COVID-19 is still incomplete and in the process of being established, so the relevant evaluation outcomes and COS must be updated with the process of practice.

Four patients used an invasive ventilator to assist ventilation for 3-20 days (median 17 [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] ). The ventilator adopted PSIMV mode, the inhaled oxygen concentration was 35-100%, and the positive end expiratory pressure was 6-12 cm H 2 O. All four patients were still using ventilators at data cutoff. Moreover, nine (9%) patients received continuous blood purifi cation due to renal failure and three (3%) patients were treated with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO; table 2).","Patients received a variety of novel treatments including immunosuppressants and antivirals. Forty-two (82.4 %) patients received broad-spectrum antibiotics and five (9.8 %) received hydrocortisone. Thirty one patients received antiviral treatment. Twenty-three patients (45.1 %) were treated with interferon beta, eight (15.7 %) were treated with interferon alpha. A variety of anti-viral combinations were used. Eight patients (15.7 %) received mycophenolate mofetil, seven of these patients received it in combination with interferon beta. Nineteen (37.3 %) patients required intensive care unit (ICU) care, and 10 patients received extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). All patients treated in the ICU and all patients receiving ECMO died.","ARDS, lung failure, and fulminant pneumonia are major lung diseases in H7N9 patients, and H7N9 virus causes extrapulmonary diseases including rhabdomyolysis and encephalopathy through cytokine storms in vivo [4, 18, 19] . There is currently no vaccine available for preventing H7N9 infections. Moreover, other extensive therapeutic interventions (such as extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) and continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT)) have been applied to patients with severe H7N9 infectious patients [20\u221222] . However, dealing with the antiviral resistance of H7N9 and secondary infection induced multiple organ dysfunction in patients is still a serious concern, and there is an exigent demand to explore an effective strategy against H7N9 infection in humans. The corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) garnered on global attention for causing infectious pneumonia in Wuhan, China [23\u221225] . The number of infected patients rose rapidly due to a lack of enough awareness, proximity of people, ease of mobility, and the humanto-human transmission ability of the virus [26\u221229] . Currently, there is no effective way to cure COVID-19. Because H7N9 and COVID-19 share similar complications (such as ARDS and lung failure) and corresponding multi-organ dysfunction with lung inflammatory lesions and structural damage [24, 30] . Hence, finding a breakthrough of treatment strategy for H7N9 infection in humans will be critical for treating COVID-19 especially ARDS-induced severe pneumonia, which is currently causing panic around the world.","There were 13 (28.9%) patients treated with high-flow nasal cannula, 6 (13.3%) with non-invasive mechanical ventilation, 20 (44.4%) with invasive mechanical ventilation. For patients with intubation, tidal volumes of 7.0 mL/kg predicted body weight was applied in accordance with lung protective ventilation strategy (17) . Recruitment maneuvers were administered in 6 patients (13.3%). A total of 5 patients (11.1%) received prone position ventilation. In addition, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) and continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) was applied in 9 (20.0%) and 4 (8.9%) patients, respectively. There were 15 (33.3%) patients administrated with vasoconstrictive agents, 19 (42.2%) with sedation and analgesia and 8 (17.8%) with neuromuscular blocking agents (table 4).","A single-center adult study reported seven patients developing ARDS from adenovirus, four of whom died (33). Hung and Lin described a case of a 9-month-old male with adenoviral ARDS requiring extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) (34). Hasvold et al. studied adult patients hospitalized with hMPV and discovered progression to ARDS in 19 (14.8%) patients (35). In 2014, an outbreak of enterovirus D68 in the United States led to symptoms of respiratory failure similar to influenza A (H1N1) virus, although less severe (36). While seasonal viruses typically cause severe infection in immunocompromised patients (37), cases of severe disease in immunocompetent patients are becoming increasingly reported (38).","Health-care Development least 10 cm H 2 O; respiratory rate of 10-30 breaths per min) and conventional ventilatory support versus ECMO for severe adult respiratory failure (CESAR; 37 peak inspiratory pressure 20-25 cm H 2 O; positive end-expiratory pressure 10 cm H 2 O; respiratory rate of 10 breaths per min) could serve as useful guides pending further evidence on ventilation strategies for ECMO in patients with ARDS. Prone positioning could be considered during ECMO, although there are few data to support this practice. 38 The benefits of ECMO for ARDS largely stem from its ability to confer lung protection, which is associated with decreased adverse outcomes. It should be noted that although extracorporeal CO 2 removal for lung-protective ventilation is feasible, it is neither evidence-based nor is it universally available. 39 Occasionally, patients develop concomitant or discrete cardiac failure-mainly from myocarditis, myocardial infarction, or sepsis-related cardiomyopathy-and might need venoarterial ECMO. Provision of ECMO in the setting of both pulmonary and cardiac dysfunction is particularly complex and, where possible, requires close liaison with an expert extracorporeal life support centre before ECMO initiation. ECMO-assisted cardiopulmonary resuscitation (ECPR) can be considered in carefully selected patients who develop cardiac arrest. However, given the likelihood of poor outcomes and the considerable risk of infection to staff responding to these patients, ECPR should be undertaken with great caution.","We conducted a patient with IPA following influenza infection with refractory hypoxemia by Veno-venous mode extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (V-V ECMO) therapy. Case report: A 60-year-old man with hypertension history presented to ED. According to his family, he visited a friend about 7 days ago, and his friend had the symptoms of a common cold. Few days later, fever, frequent cough during spiking fever, scanty sputum and sore throat developed. Shortness of breath was also noticed. In emergency department, acute respiratory failure developed, so endotracheal intubation was performed and the patient was admitted to intensive care unit. Oseltamivir, intravenous (iv) with broad-spectrum antibiotic, vasopressor and iv albumin supplement were initiated. However, refractory hypoxemia was noticed so lung recruitment therapy was performed. After the discussion with cardiovascular surgeon and family members, the VV-ECMO was applied. The serum Aspergillosis antigen was positive; therefore voriconazole was added. Owing to the development of adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), unstable hemodynamic status and oxygenation did not improve.","In the case series of 99 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 infection from Wuhan, oxygen was given to 76%, non-invasive ventilation in 13%, mechanical ventilation in 4%, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) in 3%, continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) in 9%, antibiotics in 71%, antifungals in 15%, glucocorticoids in 19% and intravenous immunoglobulin therapy in 27% [15]. Antiviral therapy consisting of oseltamivir, ganciclovir and lopinavir-ritonavir was given to 75% of the patients. The duration of non-invasive ventilation was 4\u201322 d [median 9 d] and mechanical ventilation for 3\u201320 d [median 17 d]. In the case series of children discussed earlier, all children recovered with basic treatment and did not need intensive care [17].","In terms of respiratory support, 67.1% of COVID-19 patients received conventional oxygen therapy (COT) as initial support, whereas 89.7% patients of H1N1 patients received mechanical ventilation (p&lt;0.001). However, the failure rates of COT, high-flow nasal canula oxygen therapy (HFNC), and non-invasive mechanical ventilation (NIV) were higher than those in COVID-19 patients. During the entire process of treatment, the proportions of H1N1 patients who received HFNC, NIV, invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV), and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) were significantly higher than those of COVID-19 patients (p&lt;0.05) ( Table 4 ).","In line with the heightened alert, healthcare staff movement between the various healthcare institutions in Singapore was restricted. Measures were also taken to prevent OR cross contamination between HCW. This included dividing staff members into teams such that if one team was accidentally exposed to an undiagnosed COVID-19 patient, team members would be taken out of the elective roster until they were cleared. In addition, the Department of Perfusion also allocated dedicated personnel to manage both the intensive care unit (ICU) and OR separately. Besides providing services in NHCS, perfusionists also support the Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO) services in both SGH and the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID). An ECMO support team, made up of 2 perfusionists, 1 cardiothoracic surgeon and an intensivist, is rostered to the NCID, while a second team will provide similar support for COVID-19 patients admitted to SGH.","The 2019 novel coronavirus disease has spread rapidly across Hubei province and dispersed to all regions in China owing to its person-to-person transmission and strong invasiveness targeting the lower respiratory tract. [1] By the end of February 15, 2020, more than 68,000 cases of COVID-19 pneumonia had been confirmed in China, including over 1,600 fatalities. [2] Most infected patients who developed COVID-19 pneumonia suffered from only mild symptoms and then completely recovered. However, in some patients, the phenotype may rapidly progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and multi-organ failure. The initial clinical data, collected in Jinyintan Hospital, Wuhan, showed that ARDS was reported in 12 (29%) among 41 confirmed patients. [3] Among the 41 patients, 13 patients received medical care in the intensive care unit (ICU), 4 patients were provided invasive mechanical ventilations, whereas for 2 others, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) treatment was applied.","The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.19.20038984 doi: medRxiv preprint underling diseases including diabetes and hypertension in the LPV/r group, characterized by severe diarrhea on day 3.

This virus continues to provoke human disease, with 500 cumulative cases reported to the World Health Organization since 2003, and a case-fatality rate of nearly 60%. 1 Symptoms of H5N1 infection in humans are common and nonspecific, including fever, dyspnea, cough, vomiting, diarrhea, headache, etc. [20] . However, in most cases, pneumonia progresses rapidly to acute respiratory failure and ARDS [20] . Clinical factors that might be associated with severity include older age (&gt; 65 years), late consultation, lower respiratory tract lesions and/or leukopenia, but most H5N1-infected patients were previously healthy [19, 20] . Direct avian-to-human H5N1-virus transmission is the predominant means of human infection, and human-to-human transmission is probably limited [19, 20] . Autopsies of patients who succumbed to H5N1 infection found diffuse alveolar damage with hyaline membrane formation, patchy interstitial lymphoplasmacytic infiltrates, bronchiolitis with squamous metaplasia and/or pulmonary congestion with various degrees of hemorrhage [19, 20] . The nonspecific clinical and radiological characteristics of H5N1-induced disease often result in the misdiagnosis of subsequently confirmed cases. Conventional or real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) detection of viral RNA is the best diagnostic method. Because the disease is still endemic in poultry in parts of Asia, Africa and the Middle East, clinicians must be aware of this rare but fulminant ARDS etiology, particularly in travellers with pulmonary symptoms of unknown origin [19, 20] . Management of patients with H5N1-induced ARDS remains nonspecific. Although human-to-human transmission is not frequent, isolation is recommended [20] . Treatment with high-dose oseltamivir (e.g., 150 mg twice daily) for 10 days is recommended [20] . For oseltamivir-resistant H5N1 variants, compassionate use of intravenous zanamivir to treat seriously ill patients showed promising results [21] . Although the new, intravenously administered, neuraminidase-inhibitor peramivir has demonstrated antiviral activity against H5N1 and yielded encouraging results in lethally infected mice, data are lacking in humans [22] . Corticosteroids should not be used routinely, not only because their efficacy has not been demonstrated, but also because their use might increase the infectious complication rate. Other therapeutic modalities are nonspecific and include MV, rescue strategies for severe ARDS (nitric oxide, recruitment manoeuvres, high-frequency oscillation and/or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation [ECMO]) and organ support. In 2009, a new influenza A H1N1 virus was detected in California. After initially spreading among individuals in Mexico, the United States, and Canada [23] [24] [25] , the virus spread globally, causing the first influenza pandemic since 1968, with circulation outside the usual influenza season in the Northern Hemisphere [26] . H1N1-2009 infection triggers a broad spectrum of clinical syndromes, ranging from afebrile upper respiratory illness to fulminant viral pneumonia [26] . Most illnesses caused by this virus have been acute and self-limited, with children and young adults being the most susceptible, while sparing adults over 60 years old [26] . However, severe cases with ARDS have been described (figure 1) [23, 24, 27, 28] . During the 2009 pandemic, risk factors for severe H1N1 disease or its complications were pregnancy [29, 30] , chronic cardiovascular condition (congestive heart failure, atherosclerotic disease), chronic lung disorder (e.g., asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cystic fibrosis), morbid obesity, hemoglobinopathy, chronic renal disease, cirrhosis, and age &lt; 1 year [26] . However, approximately onequarter to one-half of the H1N1-2009-infected patients who were hospitalized or died had no known coexisting medical conditions [24, 26, 28] . The main syndrome leading to ICU hospitalization consisted of diffuse viral pneumonitis associated with severe hypoxemia, ARDS and, sometimes, shock and renal failure [24, 26, 28] , and accounted for approximately 49-72% of ICU admissions for H1N1-2009 infections [24, 26, 28, 31] . Rapid progression was common, typically starting on day 4-5 after influenza onset, and intubation was often required within 24 hours after admission [26, 28, 30] . During autopsy of patients who died of H1N1-2009 infections, the virus was localized all along the respiratory tract, from the upper respiratory tract to the alveoli [32, 33] . The most prominent histopathological feature was diffuse alveolar damage in the lungs of all patients examined, but alveolar hemorrhage, intraalveolar edema, perivasculitis, microthrombi and/or pulmonary embolism were also observed [32, 33] . Alveolar lining cells, including type I and type II pneumocytes, were the primary cells infected. Notably, bacterial co-infections were identified in &gt; 25% of those patients [32, 33] . As for H5N1, management of patients with ARDS due to H1N1-2009-virus infection included early administration of high-dose oseltamivir for 10 days [26] . Bioavailability in critically ill e563 [ ( F i g u r e _ 1 ) T D $ F I G ] Virus-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome: Epidemiology, management and outcome patients receiving oseltamivir by nasogastric tube appears to be similar to that in patients with uncomplicated H1N1 flu [26] . For patients with oseltamivir-resistant H1N1 variants, successful compassionate use of intravenous zanamivir has been reported [34] . Peramivir was recently authorized for emergency use in the United States [26] . Again, as for H5N1, corticosteroids are not recommended. Although roughly half of the patients received corticosteroids in most published series, their use was associated with a higher rate of nosocomial infection [35] or mortality [36] [37] [38] .","For patients who cannot absorb or tolerate oral oseltamivir, the use of IV peramivir or investigational IV zanamivir should be considered. It is possible that novel influenza A viruses may become resistant to oseltamivir and peramivir during treatment but remain susceptible to zanamivir. In resistant infection, zanamivir is the preferred agent and can be delivered by inhalation or by the intravenous route. Corticosteroid treatment is controversial with some reports showing benefit and others harm. In all cases of severe influenza whatever the type bacterial coinfection is possible and as such, appropriate antimicrobial treatment directed toward those organisms causing bacterial acute community acquired pneumonia, and mechanical ventilation as required can reduce the mortality rate. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has been utilised in some patients with ARDS and one study showed a possible mortality benefit in patients who were referred to a specialised ECMO centre [17] .","The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.27.20029009 doi: medRxiv preprint which was consistent with our study. Antibiotic treatment was used to prevent secondary infections since these patients were critically ill. Antiviral regimes were also used in most patients which we hoped may have roles but still need more data. However, there were no specific remedies for SARS-CoV-2 yet 11, 12 . Therefore, most patients were treated with supportive treatment and intensive care. Unfortunately, due to restrictions of hospital's conditions and the heavy burden of COVID-19 in Wuhan City, neither were we able to provide patients in need with advanced life support systems like Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO), nor were able to transport all serious patients to superior hospital for better medical treatments in time. The median survival time of the patients in our study was only 2 weeks approximately, which was shorter compared to previous reports 13 will decrease as the clinical capacity improves.","A range of potential treatments are under consideration, development, or evaluation (panel 3). A phase 1, first-inhuman, single site, randomised, double-blind, placebocontrolled study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and immunogenicity of single ascending doses of a co-administered monoclonal antibodies REGN3048 and REGN3051 administered intravenously in healthy adult volunteers (NCT03301090) is ongoing and study duration will be approximately 16 months. Another study is comparing patients who received extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) support with those who did not receive ECMO support (NCT02627378). Several monoclonal and polyclonal neutralising antibody products, including novel chimeric camel or human heavychain antibodies, are protective in animal models, [110] [111] [112] and their potential use for pre-exposure or post-exposure prophylaxis in outbreak management requires evaluations in controlled trials.","Based on our findings, we suggested that the early interventions of host immune system and gut microbiota are necessary for COVID-2019 patients with refractory hypoxia. For these critical patients, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) therapy also should be supported early to ameliorate the symptom of refractory hypoxia.","Compared with H1N1, patients with COVID-19 induced ARDS had lower severity of illness scores at presentation and lower SOFA-score adjusted mortality. ECMO, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation; PaO 2 , partial pressure of oxygen; PaCO 2 , partial pressure of carbon dioxide; FiO 2 , fractional inspired oxygen. ","Infectious cases may be intentionally brought out of isolation rooms for various reasons. Intra-hospital transfer may be required from emergency departments to the wards, from the general floor to the intensive care unit and from the wards to radiology suites. Inter-hospital transfer may be required for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) if patients with COVID-19 develop severe acute respiratory distress syndrome within hospitals with only basic ventilation facilities. During episodes of patient transport outside of isolation, potential breaches of infection control can occur. At the same time, when COVID-19 patients turn ill during transport, their management is exceptionally challenging as accompanying staff would be wearing cumbersome personal protective equipment (PPE) [3].","We considered clinical trials between those planning to include only patients with severe diseases, those planning to include patients with moderate diseases and those planning to include both. We defined severe patients as patients requiring either non-invasive ventilation, high flow oxygen devices or invasive mechanical ventilation or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). Patients with moderate pneumonia were patients who did not require these. Studies were further analysed according to the primary endpoint, that could be clinical, virological (viral excretion in clinical samples), radiological (imaging results such as CT-scan or X-rays), or immunological (CD8+/CD4+ T cells count, IFN-gamma measurement results).","Risk-adapted treatment approaches were adopted for these patients. Treatment-failure patients should be prepared early for intubation and invasive mechanical ventilation, and even considered with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) [6] .","Some patients with COVID-19 may experience cardiac injury and arrhythmias (32) , and employment of echocardiography and cardiac enzymes would seem paramount in this setting (53). Myocardial injury may occur due to a variety of mechanisms, from direct viral invasion of cardiomyocytes, hypoxia due to severe pneumonia leading to ischemic cardiac tissue, or an overwhelming inflammatory response leading to cytokine storm and myocardial dysfunction (Figure 1) (41) . This leads to troponin leak and elevations in brain natriuretic peptide (BNP). While laboratory assessment for cardiac injury is not recommended on a routine basis, patients who show signs and symptoms of myocardial injury (STsegment changes on an electrocardiogram for example), acute coronary syndrome (chest pain), unstable arrhythmias, or heart failure should be evaluated thoroughly. Differentiation between normal cardiac function with increased metabolic demand, acute coronary syndrome, and fulminant myocarditis will be important as each of these clinical scenarios will require a different treatment algorithm. For patients who are deteriorating, judicious use of fluid resuscitation, vasopressors, mechanical ventilation and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) have been successful at supporting patients through critical illness (29, 55) . While the use of steroids has not been recommended in the general treatment of COVID-19 (55) , there have been reports of patients recovering from fulminant myocarditis with intravenous immunoglobulin and steroids (36) . More studies will be needed to help parse out which patients will benefit from such therapies.","For example, the images in Figure 3 are from a patient who was treated with 40 mg intravenously (iv) every day (qd) methylprednisolone after admission. On day 6 of treatment, review of the lung computed tomography (CT) scan showed significant lesion progression and the patient ultimately died, indicating that lung changes caused by the None of the patients is currently on invasive respiratory support and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). This is likely because the patients included in this study were predominantly admitted to the respiratory department and therefore relevant data from the intensive care unit and other departments are insufficient, which could lead to a biased conclusion. Sixteen of the 137 (11.7%) patients eventually died from complications of this infection. This is a higher mortality rate than previously reported (24/549), [4] which might be attributed to the fact that these were all inpatients with more critical conditions than most other patients infected in this outbreak.","The duration of invasive mechanical ventilation was 1-31 days (median 5 days [IQR2.00-8.00]). Seven patients were treated with Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation(ECMO) and eight with Continuous Renal Replacement Therapy(CRRT).","The copyright holder for this preprint . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03. 18.20038190 doi: medRxiv preprint (26) .

The antibiotics used generally covered mild pathogens and some atypical pathogens; when secondary bacterial infection occurred, medication was administered according to the results of bacterial culture and drug sensitivity. The antibiotics used were moxifloxacin, ceftriaxone, azithromycin, and tigecycline or linezolid against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, as well as antifungal drugs. Six patients significantly increased in IL6 were also treated with methylprednisolone. Three patients used non-invasive ventilator mechanical ventilation. Two patients used an invasive ventilator to assist ventilation. The ventilator adopted P-SIMV mode, the inhaled oxygen concentration was 35-100%, and the positive end-expiratory pressure was 6-12 cm H 2 O. No patients were treated with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). Moreover, 7.3% patients were diagnosed ARDS, 7.3% patients were diagnosed acute cardiac injury (troponin I&gt;28 pg/mL) and 4.4% patients were diagnosed fungal infections or shock (Table 1) .","Currently, there have been more than 330 laboratory-confirmed adult cases of COVID-19 in Shanghai [7]. Most patients (&gt;90%) are in mild or moderate states, and more than 90% of them have been cured and discharged by now. Because no specific drugs have been shown with clear effectiveness in helping the human body to clear the SARS-CoV-2 viruses, the disease severity rate in Shanghai (26 cases, around 9\u201310%) actually objectively reflected the natural history of the disease, and was comparable with the severity rate at other places outside Hubei Province. All critically ill patients received invasive mechanical ventilation, and six patients received extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). We found that in addition to the involvement of the respiratory system, critically ill patients often had systemic involvement of multiple organs, including the heart, kidney, and coagulation system in the early disease course. Sometimes multiple system involvement was observed even at the time of initial hospital admission. Therefore, in addition to the respiratory supportive treatment, timely multiorgan evaluation and treatment is very crucial.","Positive PCR results for MERS-CoV in blood at diagnosis are associated with an increased risk of requiring mechanical ventilation, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) or to lead to death [58, 59] .","The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the *ALT: alanine aminotransferase, AST: aspartate aminotransferase, CRP: C-reactive protein, ARDS: acute respiratory distress syndrome, ECMO: extracorporeal membrane oxygenation.","The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.02.20030452 doi: medRxiv preprint oseltamivir, arbidol hydrochloride, \u03b1-interferon atomization inhalation, and lopinavir/ritonavir), (4) Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) support was used for the patients with refractory hypoxemia that is difficult to be corrected by prone and protective lung ventilation strategy.","Patient should wear surgical mask at all times and should be transported to the OR through a dedicated pathway.

This procedure might avoid the need for intubation and mechanical ventilation because it provides high concentrations of humidified oxygen, low levels of positive endexpiratory pressure, and can facilitate the elimination of carbon dioxide. 4 WHO guidelines support the use of high-flow nasal oxygen in some patients, but they urge close monitoring for clinical deterioration that could result in the need for emergent intubations because such procedures might increase the risk of infection to health-care workers. 5 For patients with COVID-19 who require endotracheal intubation, use of low tidal volume (6 mL/kg per predicted bodyweight) with a plateau airway pressure of less than 30 cm H 2 O, and increasing the respiratory rate to 35 breaths per min as needed, is the mainstay of lungprotective ventilation. If the hypoxaemia progresses to a PaO 2 :FiO 2 ratio of less than 100-150 mm Hg, there are several therapeutic options. The level of positive endexpiratory pressure can be increased by 2-3 cm H 2 O every 15-30 min to improve oxygen saturation to 88-90%, with the goal of maintaining a plateau airway pressure of less than 30 cm H 2 O. Lower driving pressures (plateau airway pressure minus positive end-expiratory pressure) with a target of 13-15 cm H 2 O can also be used. If the patient is not responding to adjustment of the level of positive end-expiratory pressure, additional strategies might stabilise them. Recruitment manoeuvres probably have little value, 6 prone positioning should be instituted, unless there is a specific contraindication, and can be initiated along with the interventions already described. For persistent refractory hypoxaemia even with prone positioning, neuromuscular blockade, and efforts to optimise positive end-expiratory pressure therapy, there are additional options. Inhaled 5-20 ppm NO might improve oxygenation. Insertion of an oesophageal balloon to measure transpulmonary pressures to set an optimal positive end-expiratory pressure can be considered in patients with moderate-to-severe obesity, although a 2019 trial in patients with ARDS did not show the benefit of this procedure in most patients. 7 Fluid management is important to consider as a measure to reduce pulmonary oedema. 8 In the absence of shock, fluid conservative therapy is recommended to achieve a negative fluid balance of 0\u00b75 to 1\u00b70 L per day. In the presence of shock, fluid balance might be achieved with renal replacement therapy, especially if there is associated acute kidney injury and oliguria. Antibiotics should be considered since secondary bacterial infections have been reported in patients with COVID-19. 9 Glucocorticoids should be avoided in view of the evidence that they can be harmful in cases of viral pneumonia and ARDS from influenza. 10 Rescue therapy with high-dose vitamin C can also be considered. 11 Finally, ECMO should be considered using the inclusion and exclusion criteria of the EOLIA trial. 3 Since treatment of severe ARDS from COVID-19 is an ongoing challenge, it is important to learn from the patients who have been treated to gain an understanding of the disease's epidemiology, biological mechanisms, and the effects of new pharmacological interventions. Currently, there are some research groups working to coordinate and disseminate key information, including information on patients who have been treated with ECMO for COVID-19, although an accurate estimate of the number of such patients is not currently available. The Extracorporeal Life Support Organization is an international non-profit consortium that plans to maintain a registry of patients to facilitate an improved understanding of how ECMO is being used for patients with COVID-19.","Supportive care with fluids and oxygen remain the mainstay of treatment for most respiratory viral infections. For some individuals, respiratory support on high-dependency units or intensive care is needed.

The objective of this study is to compare the outcomes of MERS-CoV patients before and after the availability of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) as a rescue therapy in severely hypoxemic patients who failed conventional strategies. METHODS: We collected data retrospectively on MERS-CoV patients with refractory respiratory failure from April 2014 to December 2015 in 5 intensive care units (ICUs) in Saudi Arabia. Patients were classified into two groups: ECMO versus conventional therapy. Our primary outcome was in-hospital mortality; secondary outcomes included ICU and hospital length of stay. RESULTS: Thirty-five patients were included; 17 received ECMO and 18 received conventional therapy. Both groups had similar baseline characteristics. The ECMO group had lower in-hospital mortality (65 vs. 100%, P = 0.02), longer ICU stay (median...","Summary WHO interim guidelines recommend offering extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) to eligible patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) related to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The number of patients with COVID-19 infection who might develop severe ARDS that is refractory to maximal medical management and require this level of support is currently unknown. Available evidence from similar patient populations suggests that carefully selected patients with severe ARDS who do not benefit from conventional treatment might be successfully supported with venovenous ECMO. The need for ECMO is relatively low and its use is mostly restricted to specialised centres globally. Providing complex therapies such as ECMO during outbreaks of emerging infectious diseases has unique challenges. Careful planning, judicious resource allocation, and training of personnel to provide complex therapeutic interventions while adhering to strict infection control measures are all c...","","","","Abstract Background In December 2019, human infection with a novel coronavirus, known as SARS-CoV-2, was identified in Wuhan, China. The mortality of critical illness was high in Wuhan. Information about critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection outside of Wuhan is scarce. We aimed to provide the clinical features, treatment, and prognosis of the critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection in Guangdong Province. Methods In this multi-centered, retrospective, observational study, we enrolled critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia who were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) in Guangdong Province. Demographic data, symptoms, laboratory findings, comorbidities, treatments, and prognosis were collected. Data were compared between patients with and without intubation. Results Forty-five critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia were identified in 7 ICUs in Guangdong Province. The mean age was 56.7 years, and 29 patients (64.4%) were men. The most commo...","Summary Acute respiratory distress syndrome presents as hypoxia and bilateral pulmonary infiltrates on chest imaging in the absence of heart failure sufficient to account for this clinical state. Management is largely supportive, and is focused on protective mechanical ventilation and the avoidance of fluid overload. Patients with severe hypoxaemia can be managed with early short-term use of neuromuscular blockade, prone position ventilation, or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. The use of inhaled nitric oxide is rarely indicated and both \u03b22 agonists and late corticosteroids should be avoided. Mortality remains at approximately 30%.","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a newly emerged infection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) and has been pandemic all over the world. This study described acute kidney injury (AKI) at early stage of COVID-19 and its clinical significance. Three-hundred and fifty-five COVID-19 patients with were recruited and clinical data were collected from electronic medical records. Patient's prognosis was tracked and risk factors of AKI was analyzed. Of 355 COVID-19 patients, common, severe and critical ill cases accounted for 63.1%, 16.9% and 20.0%, respectively. On admission, 56 (15.8%) patients were with AKI. Although AKI was more common in critical ill patients with COVID-19, there was no significant association between oxygenation index and renal functional indices among COVID-19 patients with AKI. By multivariate logistic regression, male, older age and comorbidity with diabetes were three important independent risk factors predicting AKI among COVID-19 pa...","Objective:To analyse the clinical features of COVID\u221219 parturients, and to compare anaesthetic regimen and clinical outcomes in parturients with or without COVID\u221219 undergoing cesarean delivery.Methods: Data were extracted from the electronic medical record of 3 medical institutions in Hubei Province, China, from June 1, 2019 to March 20, 2020 according to inclusion and exclusion criteria.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) due to novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) related infection (COVID-19) is characterized by severe ventilation perfusion mismatch leading to refractory hypoxemia. To date, there is no specific treatment available for 2019-nCoV. Nitric oxide is a selective pulmonary vasodilator gas used as a rescue therapy in refractory hypoxemia due to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). In has also shown in-vitro and clinical evidence that inhaled nitric oxide gas (iNO) has antiviral activity against other strains of coronavirus. The primary aim of this study is to determine whether inhaled NO improves oxygenation in patients with hypoxic SARS-CoV2. This is a multicenter randomized controlled trial with 1:1 individual allocation. Patients will be blinded to the treatment. Methods and analysis. Intubated patients admitted to the intensive care unit with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe hypoxemia will be randomized to receive inhala...","Abstract Purpose To investigate the epidemiological, clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients with abnormal imaging findings.

We have confirmed this as fact through the study of a 1-year period of HCoV outbreaks occurring during a prospective survey of NRVI in a paediatric and neonatal intensive care unit (PNICU) using new molecular techniques for HCoV detection. Nasal samples obtained at admission and weekly thereafter for all hospitalised children, as well as monthly nasal samples from staff, were analysed using immunofluorescence for respiratory syncitial virus (RSV), influenza viruses A and B, paramyxoviruses 1, 2, 3 and adenoviruses. RT-PCR was used for HCoV detection. During the year 1998, 43 HCoV-related NRVI were detected in 152 neonates (incidence 28.3%), and 7 HCoV-related NRVI were found in 92 children (incidence 7.6%). Three HCoV-related outbreaks were observed (February, August and December), associated with a high prevalence of HCoV infection in ...","Introduction The COVID 19 outbreak is posing an unprecedented challenge to healthcare workers. This study analyzes the geo temporal effects on disease severity for the 1,688 Chinese healthcare workers infected with COVID 19. Method Using the descriptive results recently reported by the Chinese CDC, we compare the percentage of infected healthcare workers in severe conditions over time and across three areas in China, and the fatality rate of infected healthcare workers with all the infected individuals in China aged 22 to 59 years. Results Among the infected Chinese healthcare workers whose symptoms onset appeared during the same ten day period, the percentage of those in severe conditions decreased statistical significantly from 19.7% (Jan 11 to 20) to 14.4% (Jan 21 to 31) to 8.7% (Feb 1 to 11). Across the country, there was also a significant difference in the disease severity among patients symptoms onset during the same period, with Wuhan being the most severe (17%), followed by Hu...","Coronaviruses (CoV), like other positive-stranded RNA viruses, redirect and rearrange host cell membranes for use as part of the viral genome replication and transcription machinery. Specifically, coronaviruses induce the formation of double-membrane vesicles in infected cells. Although these double-membrane vesicles have been well characterized, the mechanism behind their formation remains unclear, including which viral proteins are responsible. Here, we use transfection of plasmid constructs encoding full-length versions of the three transmembrane-containing nonstructural proteins (nsps) of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus to examine the ability of each to induce double-membrane vesicles in tissue culture. nsp3 has membrane disordering and proliferation ability, both in its full-length form and in a C-terminal-truncated form. nsp3 and nsp4 working together have the ability to pair membranes. nsp6 has membrane proliferation ability as well, inducing perinuclear...","Abstract A diverse group of cytolytic animal viruses encodes small, hydrophobic proteins to modify host cell membrane permeability to ions and small molecules during their infection cycles. In this study, we show that expression of the SARS-CoV E protein in mammalian cells alters the membrane permeability of these cells. Immunofluorescent staining and cell fractionation studies demonstrate that this protein is an integral membrane protein. It is mainly localized to the ER and the Golgi apparatus. The protein can be translocated to the cell surface and is partially associated with lipid rafts. Further biochemical characterization of the protein reveals that it is posttranslationally modified by palmitoylation on all three cysteine residues. Systematic mutagenesis studies confirm that the membrane permeabilizing activity of the SARS-CoV E protein is associated with its transmembrane domain.","Summary Background In December, 2019, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in Wuhan, China. The number of affected pregnant women is increasing, but scarce information is available about the clinical features of COVID-19 in pregnancy. This study aimed to clarify the clinical features and obstetric and neonatal outcomes of pregnant patients with COVID-19. Methods In this retrospective, single-centre study, we included all pregnant women with COVID-19 who were admitted to Tongji Hospital in Wuhan, China. Clinical features, treatments, and maternal and fetal outcomes were assessed. Findings Seven patients, admitted to Tongji Hospital from Jan 1, to Feb 8, 2020, were included in our study. The mean age of the patients was 32 years (range 29\u201334 years) and the mean gestational age was 39 weeks plus 1 day (range 37 weeks to 41 weeks plus 2 days). Clinical manifestations were fever (six [86%] patients), cough (one [1...","Abstract To promote viral entry, replication, release, and spread to neighboring cells, many cytolytic animal viruses encode proteins responsible for modification of host cell membrane permeability and for formation of ion channels in host cell membranes during their life cycles. In this study, we show that the envelope (E) protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus can induce membrane permeability changes when expressed in Escherichia coli. E protein expressed in bacterial and mammalian cells under reducing conditions existed as monomers, but formed homodimer and homotrimer under non-reducing conditions. Site-directed mutagenesis studies revealed that two cysteine residues of the E protein were essential for oligomerization, leading to induction of membrane permeability. This is the first report demonstrating that a coronavirus-encoded protein could modify membrane permeability in E. coli cells.","Background: Since the outbreak of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in China, respiratory manifestations of the disease have been observed. However, as a fatal comorbidity, acute myocardial injury (AMI) in COVID-19 patients has not been previously investigated in detail.

PDCoV was subsequently identified in the USA in 2014 in pigs with a history of severe diarrhea. The virus has now been detected in pigs in several countries around the world. Following the development of tissue culture adapted strains of PDCoV, it is now possible to address questions regarding virus\u2013host cell interactions for this genera of coronavirus. Here, we presented a detailed study of PDCoV-induced replication organelles. All positive-strand RNA viruses induce the rearrangement of cellular membranes during virus replication to support viral RNA synthesis, forming the replication organelle. Replication organelles for the Alpha-, Beta-, and Gammacoronavirus genera have been characterized. All coronavirus genera induced the formation of double-membrane vesicles (DMVs). In addition, Alpha- and Betacoronaviruses induce the formation of convoluted membranes, while Gammacoro...","OBJECTIVE: To study the neurological manifestations of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). DESIGN: Retrospective case series SETTING: Three designated COVID-19 care hospitals of the Union Hospital of Huazhong University of Science and Technology in Wuhan, China. PARTICIPANTS: Two hundred fourteen hospitalized patients with laboratory confirmed diagnosis of severe acute respiratory syndrome from coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Data were collected from 16 January 2020 to 19 February 2020. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Clinical data were extracted from electronic medical records and reviewed by a trained team of physicians. Neurological symptoms fall into three categories: central nervous system (CNS) symptoms or diseases (headache, dizziness, impaired consciousness, ataxia, acute cerebrovascular disease, and epilepsy), peripheral nervous system (PNS) symptoms (hypogeusia, hyposmia, hypopsia, and neuralgia), and skeletal muscular symptoms. Data of all neurological symptoms w...","BACKGROUND There is little information about the coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) during pregnancy. This study aimed to determine the clinical features and the maternal and neonatal outcomes of pregnant women with Covid-19. METHODS In this retrospective analysis from five hospitals, we included pregnant women with Covid-19 from January 1 to February 20, 2020. The primary composite endpoints were admission to an intensive care unit (ICU), the use of mechanical ventilation, or death. Secondary endpoints included the clinical severity of Covid-19, neonatal mortality, admission to neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), and the incidence of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) of pregnant women and newborns. RESULTS Thirty-three pregnant women with Covid-19 and 28 newborns were identified. One (3%) pregnant woman needed the use of mechanical ventilation. No pregnant women admitted to the ICU. There were no moralities among pregnant women or newborns. The percentages of pregnant women...","Background: Since December 2019, when coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID 19) emerged in Wuhan and rapidly spread throughout the world, critically ill patients have a high mortality rate. We aimed to assess the effect of continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) on all cause mortality in patients with COVID 19 undergoing invasive mechanical ventilation. Methods: In this retrospective cohort study, we included all patients with COVID 19 undergoing invasive mechanical ventilation at Optical Valley Branch of Tongji Hospital Affiliated with Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan from February 12th to March 2nd, 2020. Demographic, clinical, laboratory, and treatment data were collected and analyzed. All patients were followed until death or end of follow up (March 9th), and all survivors were followed for at least one week. Findings: Of 36 hospitalized COVID-19 patients with invasive mechanical ventilation, the mean age was 69.4 (SD 1.8) years and 30 (83....","[Image: see text] Infectious diseases are a leading cause of mortality worldwide, with viruses and bacteria in particular having enormous impacts on global healthcare. One major challenge in combatting such diseases is a lack of effective drugs or specific treatments. In addition, drug resistance to currently available therapeutics and adverse effects caused by long-term overuse are both serious public health issues. A promising treatment strategy is to employ cell-membrane mimics as decoys to trap and to detain the pathogens. In this Perspective, we briefly review the infection mechanisms adopted by different pathogens at the cellular membrane interface and highlight the applications of cell-membrane-mimicking nanodecoys for systemic protection against infectious diseases. We also discuss the implication of nanodecoy\u2013pathogen complexes in the development of vaccines. We anticipate this Perspective will provide new insights on design and development of advanced materials against emergi...","Abstract Infection with coronavirus rearranges the host cell membrane to assemble a replication/transcription complex in which replication of the viral genome and transcription of viral mRNA occur. Although coexistence of nsp3 and nsp4 is known to cause membrane rearrangement, the mechanisms underlying the interaction of these two proteins remain unclear. We demonstrated that binding of nsp4 with nsp3 is essential for membrane rearrangement and identified amino acid residues in nsp4 responsible for the interaction with nsp3. In addition, we revealed that the nsp3-nsp4 interaction is not sufficient to induce membrane rearrangement, suggesting the participation of other factors such as host proteins. Finally, we showed that loss of the nsp3-nsp4 interaction eliminated viral replication by using an infectious cDNA clone and replicon system of SARS-CoV. These findings provide clues to the mechanism of the replication/transcription complex assembly of SARS-CoV and could reveal an antiviral ...","Abstract Introduction An epidemic of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) began in December 2019 in China leading to a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). Clinical, laboratory, and imaging features have been partially characterized in some observational studies. No systematic reviews on COVID-19 have been published to date. Methods We performed a systematic literature review with meta-analysis, using three databases to assess clinical, laboratory, imaging features, and outcomes of COVID-19 confirmed cases. Observational studies and also case reports, were included, and analyzed separately. We performed a random-effects model meta-analysis to calculate pooled prevalences and 95% confidence intervals (95%CI). Results 660 articles were retrieved for the time frame (1/1/2020-2/23/2020). After screening, 27 articles were selected for full-text assessment, 19 being finally included for qualitative and quantitative analyses. Additionally, 39 case report articles were incl...","Summary Background An ongoing outbreak of pneumonia associated with the severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) started in December, 2019, in Wuhan, China. Information about critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection is scarce. We aimed to describe the clinical course and outcomes of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia. Methods In this single-centered, retrospective, observational study, we enrolled 52 critically ill adult patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia who were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) of Wuhan Jin Yin-tan hospital (Wuhan, China) between late December, 2019, and Jan 26, 2020. Demographic data, symptoms, laboratory values, comorbidities, treatments, and clinical outcomes were all collected. Data were compared between survivors and non-survivors. The primary outcome was 28-day mortality, as of Feb 9, 2020. Secondary outcomes included incidence of SARS-CoV-2-related acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and the proportion of pati...","Abstract Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) is caused by a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV). Coronaviruses including SARS-CoV encode an envelope (E) protein, a small, hydrophobic membrane protein. We report that, in planar lipid bilayers, synthetic peptides corresponding to the SARS-CoV E protein forms ion channels that are more permeable to monovalent cations than to monovalent anions. Affinity-purified polyclonal antibodies recognizing the N-terminal 19 residues of SARS-CoV E protein were used to establish the specificity of channel formation by inhibiting the ion currents generated in the presence of the E protein peptides.","Abstract Many current and potential drug targets are membrane-bound or secreted proteins that are expressed and transported via the Sec61 secretory pathway. They are targeted to translocon channels across the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) by signal peptides (SPs), which are temporary structures on the N-termini of their nascent chains. During translation, such proteins enter the lumen and membrane of the ER by a process known as co-translational translocation. Small molecules have been found that interfere with this process, decreasing protein expression by recognizing the unique structures of the SPs of particular proteins. The SP may thus become a validated target for designing drugs for numerous disorders, including certain hereditary diseases.","Background The ongoing epidemics of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have caused serious concerns about its potential adverse effects on pregnancy. There are limited data on maternal and neonatal outcomes of pregnant women with COVID-19 pneumonia. Methods We conducted a case-control study to compare clinical characteristics, maternal and neonatal outcomes of pregnant women with and without COVID-19 pneumonia. Results During January 24 to February 29, 2020, there were sixteen pregnant women with confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia and eighteen suspected cases who were admitted to labor in the third trimester. Two had vaginal delivery and the rest took cesarean section. Few patients presented respiratory symptoms (fever and cough) on admission, but most had typical chest CT images of COVID-19 pneumonia. Compared to the controls, COVID-19 pneumonia patients had lower counts of white blood cells (WBC), neutrophils, C-reactive protein (CRP), and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) on admission. Incr...","Background: At present, there is a global pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia.

However, the significant heterogeneity and less critical outcomes of such trials may be leading to a waste of research resources. This study aimed to develop a core outcome set (COS) for clinical trials on COVID-19 in order to tackle the outcome issues. The study was conducted according to the Core Outcome Measures in Effectiveness Trials (COMET) handbook (version 1.0), a guideline for COS development. A research group was set up that included experts in respiratory and critical medicine, traditional Chinese medicine, evidence-based medicine, clinical pharmacology, and statistics, in addition to medical journal editors. Clinical trial registry websites (chictr.org.cn and clinicaltrials.gov) were searched to retrieve clinical trial protocols and outcomes in order to form an outcome pool. A total of 78 clinical trial protocols on COVID-19 w...","ABSTRACT Objective The aim of this systematic review was to report pregnancy and perinatal outcomes of Coronavirus (CoV) spectrum infections, and particularly COVID-19 disease due to SARS-COV-2 infection during pregnancy.

The membrane topology of SARS-CoV M and the functional significance of its N-glycosylation are not completely understood as is its interaction with the surface glycoprotein S. Using biochemical and immunofluorescence analyses we found that M consists of a short glycosylated N-terminal ectodomain, three transmembrane segments and a long, immunogenic C-terminal endodomain. Although the N-glycosylation site of M seems to be highly conserved between group 1 and 3 coronaviruses, studies using a recombinant SARS-CoV expressing a glycosylation-deficient M revealed that N-glycosylation of M neither influence the shape of the virions nor their infectivity in cell culture. Further functional analysis of truncated M proteins showed that the N-terminal 134 amino acids comprising the three ...","Publisher Summary This chapter focuses on the structural chemistry of membrane alanyl aminopeptidase (mAAP). The early history of mAAP relates to its role as Cys-Gly dipeptidase or cysteinyl-glycinase. It was proposed that this peptidase activity present in apparently purified RNA preparations contributed to polypeptide biosynthesis by acting in reverse in a sequential fashion. mAAP has a broad substrate specificity removing N-terminal amino acids (Xaa-Xbb-) from almost all unsubstituted oligopeptides and from an amide or arylamide. mAAP is a type II integral membrane protein located on the plasma membrane as an ectoenzyme. The pI is approximately 5. mAAP is widely distributed among species and tissues although it is of greatest abundance in brush border membranes of the kidney, in the mucosal cells of the small intestine and in the liver. It is also present in the lung where it is identical to the pI46 type II alveolar epithelial cell antigen and is located on endothelial cells in blo...","Abstract Objective To investigate the characteristics and prognostic factors in the elderly patients with COVID-19.
