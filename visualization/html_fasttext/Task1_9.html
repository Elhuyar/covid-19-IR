The sporadic nature of these infections hampers our understanding of these diseases and limits the opportunities to design appropriate medical countermeasures against them. Because of this, animal models are utilized to gain insight into the pathogenesis of disease with the overall goal of identifying potential targets for intervention and evaluating specific therapeutics and vaccines. For these reasons it is imperative that animal models of disease recapitulate the human condition as closely as possible in order to provide the best predictive data with respect to the potential efficacy in humans. In this article we review the current status of disease models for highly pathogenic and emerging viral p...","Resumen Introducci\u00f3n El uso de modelos experimentales en animales permite aumentar el conocimiento sobre la patolog\u00eda del sistema nervioso central.

Examples are severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and novel variants of influenza A virus, such as H5N1 and pandemic H1N1. Different animal models are used to develop therapeutic and preventive measures against such viruses, but it is not clear which are most suitable. Therefore, this review compares animal models of SARS and influenza, with an emphasis on non-human primates, ferrets and cats. Firstly, the pathology and pathogenesis of SARS and influenza are compared. Both diseases are similar in that they affect mainly the respiratory tract and cause inflammation and necrosis centred on the pulmonary alveoli and bronchioles. Important differences are the presence of multinucleated giant cells and intra-alveolar fibrosis in SARS and more fulminant necrotizing and haemorrhagic pneumonia in H5N1 influenza. Secondly, the path...","Objective: To review and critically appraise published and preprint reports of models that aim to predict either (i) presence of existing COVID-19 infection, or (ii) future complications in individuals already diagnosed with COVID-19. Any models to identify subjects at risk for COVID-19 in the general population were also included. Design: Rapid systematic review and critical appraisal of prediction models for diagnosis or prognosis of COVID-19 infection. Data sources: PubMed, EMBASE via Ovid, Arxiv, medRxiv and bioRxiv until 13th March 2020. Study selection: Studies that developed or validated a multivariable COVID-19 related prediction model. Two authors independently screened titles and abstracts. Data extraction: Data from included studies were extracted independently by at least two authors based on the CHARMS checklist, and risk of bias was assessed using PROBAST. Data were extracted on various domains including the participants, predictors, outcomes, data analysis, and predictio...","The outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003 was controlled by public health measures at a time when specific interventions such as antiviral drugs, vaccines and immunotherapy were not available. Since then, several animal models have been developed for the study of SARS and, although no model replicates the human disease in all aspects, the use of animal models for SARS has led to the establishment of several important principles for vaccine and immunotherapy. Consistency and reproducibility of findings in a given model must be demonstrated to establish the superiority of one model over others. Here, we suggest aspects of an ideal animal model for studies of SARS pathogenesis and vaccine development and present our assessment of the strengths and limitations of the current animal models for SARS.","Abstract Two novel coronaviruses have emerged to cause severe disease in humans. While bats may be the primary reservoir for both viruses, SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) likely crossed into humans from civets in China, and MERS coronavirus (MERS-CoV) has been transmitted from camels in the Middle East. Unlike SARS-CoV that resolved within a year, continued introductions of MERS-CoV present an on-going public health threat. Animal models are needed to evaluate countermeasures against emerging viruses. With SARS-CoV, several animal species were permissive to infection. In contrast, most laboratory animals are refractory or only semi-permissive to infection with MERS-CoV. This host-range restriction is largely determined by sequence heterogeneity in the MERS-CoV receptor. We describe animal models developed to study coronaviruses, with a focus on host-range restriction at the level of the viral receptor and discuss approaches to consider in developing a model to evaluate countermeasures agai...","Abstract The aim of this chapter is to describe the animal models generated by transgenic technology for the functional analysis of the protective axis of the renin\u2013angiotensin system, consisting of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), angiotensin (Ang)-(1-7), and Mas. Transgenic overexpression of the components of this axis in general led to an ameliorated cardiac and vascular damage in disease states and to an improved metabolic profile. Knockout models for ACE2 and Mas, however, show aggravated cardiovascular pathologies and a metabolic syndrome-like state. In particular, the local production of Ang-(1-7) in the vascular wall, in the heart, and in the brain was found to be of high physiological relevance by the use of transgenic animals overexpressing ACE2 or Ang-(1-7) in these tissues.","The emergence of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), two strains of animal coronaviruses that crossed the species barrier to infect and cause severe respiratory infections in humans within the last 12 years, have taught us that coronaviruses represent a global threat that does not recognize international borders. We can expect to see other novel coronaviruses emerge in the future. An ideal animal model should reflect the clinical signs, viral replication and pathology seen in humans. In this review, we present factors to consider in establishing an animal model for the study of novel coronaviruses and compare the different animal models that have been employed to study SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.","Coronaviruses (CoVs) have formerly been regarded as relatively harmless respiratory pathogens to humans. However, two outbreaks of severe respiratory tract infection, caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), as a result of zoonotic CoVs crossing the species barrier, caused high pathogenicity and mortality rates in human populations. This brought CoVs global attention and highlighted the importance of controlling infectious pathogens at international borders. In this review, we focus on our current understanding of the epidemiology, pathogenesis, prevention, and treatment of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, as well as provides details on the pivotal structure and function of the spike proteins (S proteins) on the surface of each of these viruses. For building up more suitable animal models, we compare the current animal models recapitulating pathogenesis and summarize the potential role of host receptor...","Abstract We summarize findings of SARS-CoV infections in several animal models each of which support viral replication in lungs accompanied by histopathological changes and/or clinical signs of illness to varying degrees. New findings are reported on SARS-CoV replication and associated pathology in two additional strains (C57BL/6 and 129S6) of aged mice. We also provide new comparative data on viral replication and associated pathology following infection of golden Syrian hamsters with various SARS-CoV strains and report the levels of neutralizing antibody titers following these infections and the cross-protective efficacy of infection with these strains in protecting against heterologous challenge. Finally, we summarize findings of a variety of vaccine approaches and discuss the available in vitro and in vivo data addressing the potential for disease enhancement following re-infection in animals previously vaccinated against or infected with SARS-CoV.","Protein structures are crucial for understanding their biological activities. Since the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), there is an urgent need to understand the biological behavior of the virus and provide a basis for developing effective therapies. Since the proteome of the virus was determined, some of the protein structures could be determined experimentally, and others were predicted via template-based modeling approaches. However, tertiary structures for several proteins are still not available from experiment nor they could be accurately predicted by template-based modeling because of lack of close homolog structures. Previous efforts to predict structures for these proteins include efforts by DeepMind and the Zhang group via machine learning-based structure prediction methods, i.e. AlphaFold and C-I-TASSER. However, the predicted models vary greatly and have not yet been subjected to refinement. Here, we are reporting new predictions fr...","A variety of neurological diseases in humans, including multiple sclerosis (MS), have been postulated to have a viral etiology. The use of animal models provides insights into potential mechanism(s) involved in the disease process. The murine coronavirus-induced demyelinating disease in rodents is one such model for demyelinating disease in humans.","Human coronaviruses (HCoVs) are large RNA viruses that infect the human respiratory tract. The emergence of both Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome and Middle East Respiratory syndrome CoVs as well as the yearly circulation of four common CoVs highlights the importance of elucidating the different mechanisms employed by these viruses to evade the host immune response, determine their tropism and identify antiviral compounds. Various animal models have been established to investigate HCoV infection, including mice and non-human primates. To establish a link between the research conducted in animal models and humans, an organotypic human airway culture system, that recapitulates the human airway epithelium, has been developed. Currently, different cell culture systems are available to recapitulate the human airways, including the Air-Liquid Interface (ALI) human airway epithelium (HAE) model. Tracheobronchial HAE cultures recapitulate the primary entry point of human respiratory viruses w...","Abstract Objectives To develop and test machine learning-based CT radiomics models for predicting hospital stay in patients with pneumonia associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Design Cross-sectional Setting Multicenter Participants A total of 52 patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and their initial CT images were enrolled from 5 designated hospitals in Ankang, Lishui, Zhenjiang, Lanzhou, and Linxia between January 23, 2020 and February 8, 2020. As of February 20, patients remained in hospital or with non-findings in CT were excluded. Therefore, 31 patients with 72 lesion segments were included in the final analysis. Intervention CT radiomics models based on logistic regression (LR) and random forest (RF) were developed on features extracted from pneumonia lesions in training and inter-validation datasets. The predictive performance was further evaluated in test dataset on lung lobe- and patients-level. Main outcomes Short-term hospital stay (\u226410 days) and long-term...","Respiratory virus infection is one of the major sources of exacerbation of chronic airway inflammatory diseases. These exacerbations are associated with high morbidity and even mortality worldwide. The current understanding on viral-induced exacerbations is that viral infection increases airway inflammation which aggravates disease symptoms. Recent advances in in vitro air-liquid interface 3D cultures, organoid cultures and the use of novel human and animal challenge models have evoked new understandings as to the mechanisms of viral exacerbations. In this review, we will focus on recent novel findings that elucidate how respiratory viral infections alter the epithelial barrier in the airways, the upper airway microbial environment, epigenetic modifications including miRNA modulation, and other changes in immune responses throughout the upper and lower airways. First, we reviewed the prevalence of different respiratory viral infections in causing exacerbations in chronic airway inflamm...","Protection of healthcare workforce is of paramount relevance for the care of infected and non-infected patients in the setting of a pandemic such as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Healthcare workers are at increased risk to become infected because of contact to infected patients, infected co-workers and their community outside the hospital. The ideal organisational strategy to protect the healthcare workforce in a situation in which social distancing cannot be maintained at the workplace remains to be determined. In this study, we have mathematically modelled strategies for the employment of hospital workforce with the goal to simulate health and productivity of the workers. Therefore, deterministic models were extended to account for stochastic influences potentially occurring in rather small populations. The models were also designed to determine if desynchronization of medical teams by dichotomizing the workers may protect the workforce. Our studies model workforce productivit...","During the study of epidemics, one of the most significant and also challenging problems is to forecast the future trends, on which all follow-up actions of individuals and governments heavily rely. However, to pick out a reliable predictable model/method is far from simple, a rational evaluation of various possible choices is eagerly needed, especially under the severe threat of COVID-19 epidemics which is spreading worldwide right now. In this paper, based on the public COVID-19 data of seven provinces/cities in China reported during the spring of 2020, we make a systematical investigation on the forecast ability of eight widely used empirical functions, four statistical inference methods and five dynamical models widely used in the literature. We highlight the significance of a well balance between model complexity and accuracy, over-fitting and under-fitting, as well as model robustness and sensitivity. We further introduce the Akaike information criterion, root mean square errors ...","Anthropization of natural habitats including climate change along with overpopulation and global travel have been contributing to emerging infectious diseases outbreaks. The recent COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan, highlights such threats to human health, social stability and global trade and economy. We used species distribution modelling and environmental data from satellite imagery to model Blueprint Priority Diseases occurrences. We constructed classical regression and Support Vector Machine models based on environmental predictor variables such as landscape, tree cover loss, climatic covariates. Models were evaluated and a weighed mean was used to map the predictive risk of disease emergence. We mapped the predictive risk for filovirus, Nipah, Rift Valley Fever and coronavirus diseases. Elevation, tree cover loss and climatic covariates were found to significant factors influencing disease emergence. We also showed the relevance of disease biogeography and in the identification potentia...","As a first step toward the development of diagnostic and therapeutic tools to fight the Coronavirus disease (COVID-19), it is important to characterize CD8+ T cell epitopes in the SARS-CoV-2 peptidome that can trigger adaptive immune responses. Here, we use RosettaMHC, a comparative modeling approach which leverages existing high-resolution X-ray structures from peptide/MHC complexes available in the Protein Data Bank, to derive physically realistic 3D models for high-affinity SARS-CoV-2 epitopes. We outline an application of our method to model 439 9mer and 279 10mer predicted epitopes displayed by the common allele HLA-A*02:01, and we make our models publicly available through an online database (https://rosettamhc.chemistry.ucsc.edu). As more detailed studies on antigen-specific T cell recognition become available, RosettaMHC models of antigens from different strains and HLA alleles can be used as a basis to understand the link between peptide/HLA complex structure and surface chemi...","The initial cluster of severe pneumonia cases that triggered the COVID-19 epidemic was identified in Wuhan, China in December 2019. While early cases of the disease were linked to a wet market, human-to-human transmission has driven the rapid spread of the virus throughout China. The Chinese government has implemented containment strategies of city-wide lockdowns, screening at airports and train stations, and isolation of suspected patients; however, the cumulative case count keeps growing every day. The ongoing outbreak presents a challenge for modelers, as limited data are available on the early growth trajectory, and the epidemiological characteristics of the novel coronavirus are yet to be fully elucidated. We use phenomenological models that have been validated during previous outbreaks to generate and assess short-term forecasts of the cumulative number of confirmed reported cases in Hubei province, the epicenter of the epidemic, and for the overall trajectory in China, excluding...","Summary Emerging infectious diseases arising from livestock and wildlife pose serious threats to global human health, as shown by a series of continuous outbreaks involving highly pathogenic influenza, SARS, Ebola and MERS. The risk of pandemics and bioterrorism threats is ever present and growing, but our ability to combat them is limited by the lack of available vaccines, therapeutics and rapid diagnostics. The use of high bio-containment facilities, such as the CSIRO Australian Animal Health Laboratory, plays a key role studying these dangerous pathogens and facilitates the development of countermeasures. To combat diseases like MERS, we must take a holistic approach that involves the development of early biomarkers of infection, a suite of treatment options (vaccines, anti-viral drugs and antibody therapeutics) and appropriate animal models to test the safety and efficacy of candidate treatments.","Filoviruses are emerging pathogens and causative agents of viral haemorrhagic fever. Case fatality rates of filovirus disease outbreaks are among the highest reported for any human pathogen, exceeding 90% (ref. 1). Licensed therapeutic or vaccine products are not available to treat filovirus diseases. Candidate therapeutics previously shown to be efficacious in non-human primate disease models are based on virus-specific designs and have limited broad-spectrum antiviral potential. Here we show that BCX4430, a novel synthetic adenosine analogue, inhibits infection of distinct filoviruses in human cells. Biochemical, reporter-based and primer-extension assays indicate that BCX4430 inhibits viral RNA polymerase function, acting as a non-obligate RNA chain terminator. Post-exposure intramuscular administration of BCX4430 protects against Ebola virus and Marburg virus disease in rodent models. Most importantly, BCX4430 completely protects cynomolgus macaques from Marburg virus infection whe...","Abstract The causative agent of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) has been identified as a new type of coronavirus, SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV). CD8 T cells play an important role in controlling diseases caused by other coronaviruses and in mediating vaccine-induced protective immunity in corresponding animal models. The spike protein, a main surface antigen of SARS-CoV, is one of the most important antigen candidates for vaccine design. Overlapping peptides were used to identify major histocompatibility complex class I-restricted epitopes in mice immunized with vectors encoding codon-optimized SARS-CoV spike protein. CD8 T-cell responses were mapped to two H-2b-restricted epitopes (S436\u2013443 and S525\u2013532) and one H-2d-restricted epitope (S366\u2013374). The identification of these epitopes will facilitate the evaluation of vaccine strategies in murine models of SARS-CoV infection. Furthermore, codon and promoter optimizations can greatly enhance the overall immunogenicity ...","The ongoing COVID-19 epidemic continues to spread within and outside of China, despite several social distancing measures implemented by the Chinese government. Limited epidemiological data are available, and recent changes in case definition and reporting further complicate our understanding of the impact of the epidemic, particularly in the epidemic\u2019s epicenter. Here we use previously validated phenomenological models to generate short-term forecasts of cumulative reported cases in Guangdong and Zhejiang, China. Using daily reported cumulative case data up until 13 February 2020 from the National Health Commission of China, we report 5- and 10-day ahead forecasts of cumulative case reports. Specifically, we generate forecasts using a generalized logistic growth model, the Richards growth model, and a sub-epidemic wave model, which have each been previously used to forecast outbreaks due to different infectious diseases. Forecasts from each of the models suggest the outbreaks may be n...","Zoonotic viruses that emerge from wildlife and domesticated animals pose a serious threat to human and animal health. In many instances, mouse models have improved our understanding of the human immune response to infection; however, when dealing with emerging zoonotic diseases, they may be of limited use. This is particularly the case when the model fails to reproduce the disease status that is seen in the natural reservoir, transmission species or human host. In this Review, we discuss how researchers are placing more emphasis on the study of the immune response to zoonotic infections in the natural reservoir hosts and spillover species. Such studies will not only lead to a greater understanding of how these infections induce variable disease and immune responses in distinct species but also offer important insights into the evolution of mammalian immune systems. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The online version of this article (doi:10.1038/nri3551) contains supplementary material, which...","In December 2019, a novel coronavirus (CoV) epidemic, caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus \u2013 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged from China. This virus causes the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Since then, there have been anecdotal reports of ocular infection. The ocular implications of human CoV infections have not been widely studied. However, CoVs have been known to cause various ocular infections in animals. Clinical entities such as conjunctivitis, anterior uveitis, retinitis, and optic neuritis have been documented in feline and murine models. In this article, the current evidence suggesting possible human CoV infection of ocular tissue is reviewed. The review article will also highlight animal CoVs and their associated ocular infections. We hope that this article will serve as a start for further research into the ocular implications of human CoV infections.","Early analysis of outbreaks of novel pathogens to evaluate their likely public health impact depends on fitting predictive models to data gathered and updated in real-time. Both transmission rates and the critical threshold (i.e. the pathogen's 'reproductive number') are inferred by finding the values that provide the best model fit to reported case incidence. These models and inferred results are then the basic tools used for public health planning: how many people expected to be infected, at what scales of time and space, and whether potential intervention strategies impact disease transmission and spread. An underlying assumption, however, is that the ability to observe new cases is either constant, or at least constant relative to diagnostic test availability. We present a demonstration, discussion, and mathematical analysis of how this assumption of predictable observability in disease incidence can drastically impact model accuracy. We also demonstrate how to tailor estimations o...","Abstract Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a highly lethal emerging disease caused by coronavirus SARS-CoV. New lethal animal models for SARS were needed to facilitate antiviral research. We adapted and characterized a new strain of SARS-CoV (strain v2163) that was highly lethal in 5- to 6-week-old BALB/c mice. It had nine mutations affecting 10 amino acid residues. Strain v2163 increased IL-1\u03b1, IL-6, MIP-1\u03b1, MCP-1, and RANTES in mice, and high IL-6 expression correlated with mortality. The infection largely mimicked human disease, but lung pathology lacked hyaline membrane formation. In vitro efficacy against v2163 was shown with known inhibitors of SARS-CoV replication. In v2163-infected mice, Ampligen\u2122 was fully protective, stinging nettle lectin (UDA) was partially protective, ribavirin was disputable and possibly exacerbated disease, and EP128533 was inactive. Ribavirin, UDA, and Ampligen\u2122 decreased IL-6 expression. Strain v2163 provided a valuable model for anti-SARS re...","The Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus was first identified in 2012 and has since then remained uncontrolled. Cases have been mostly reported in the Middle East, however travel-associated cases and outbreaks have also occurred. Nosocomial and zoonotic transmission of the virus appear to be the most important routes. The infection is severe and highly fatal thus necessitating rapid and efficacious interventions. Here, we performed a comprehensive review of published literature and summarized the epidemiology of the virus. In addition, we summarized the virological aspects of the infection and reviewed the animal models used as well as vaccination and antiviral tested against it.","The epidemic of a novel coronavirus illness (COVID-19) becomes as a global threat. The aim of this study is first to find the best prediction models for daily confirmed cases in countries with high number of confirmed cases in the world and second to predict confirmed cases with these models in order to have more readiness in healthcare systems. This study was conducted based on daily confirmed cases of COVID-19 that were collected from the official website of Johns Hopkins University from January 22th, 2020 to March 1th, 2020. Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model was used to predict the trend of confirmed cases. Stata version 12 was used. Mainland China and Thailand had almost a stable trend. The trend of South Korea was decreasing and will become stable in near future. Iran and Italy had unstable trends. Mainland China and Thailand were successful in haltering COVID-19 epidemic. Investigating their protocol in this control like quarantine should be in the first lin...","COVID-19 is an acute respiratory disease that has been classified as a pandemic by the World Health Organization. Information regarding this particular disease is limited, however, it is known to have high mortality rates, particularly among individuals with preexisting medical conditions. Creating models to identify individuals who are at the greatest risk for severe complications due to COVID-19 will be useful to help for outreach campaigns in mitigating the diseases worst effects. While information specific to COVID-19 is limited, a model using complications due to other upper respiratory infections can be used as a proxy to help identify those individuals who are at the greatest risk. We present the results for three models predicting such complications, with each model having varying levels of predictive effectiveness at the expense of ease of implementation.","As an emerging infectious disease, the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has developed into a global pandemic. During the initial spreading of the virus in China, we demonstrated the ensemble Kalman filter performed well as a short-term predictor of the daily cases reported in Wuhan City. Second, we used an individual-level network-based model to reconstruct the epidemic dynamics in Hubei Province at its early stage and examine the effectiveness of non-pharmaceutical interventions on the epidemic spreading with various scenarios. Our simulation results show that without continued control measures, the epidemic in Hubei Province could have become persistent. Only by continuing to decrease the infection rate through 1) protective measures and 2) social distancing can the actual epidemic trajectory that happened in Hubei Province be reconstructed in simulation. Finally, we simulate the COVID-19 transmission with non-Markovian processes and show how these models produce different epidemi...","Abstract Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) has emerged as a coronavirus infection of humans in the past 5 years. Though confined to certain geographical regions of the world, infection has been associated with a case fatality rate of 35%, and this mortality may be higher in ventilated patients. As there are few readily available animal models that accurately mimic human disease, it has been a challenge to ethically determine what optimum treatment strategies can be used for this disease. We used in-vitro and human ex-vivo explant cultures to investigate the effect of two immunomodulatory agents, interferon alpha and cyclosporine, singly and in combination, on MERS-CoV replication. In both culture systems the combined treatment was more effective than either agent used alone in reducing MERS-CoV replication. PCR SuperArray analysis showed that the reduction of virus replication was associated with a greater induction of interferon stimulated genes. As these therape...","Abstract Molecular analysis of respiratory viruses and the host response to both infection and vaccination have transformed our understanding of these ubiquitous pathogens. Polymerase chain reaction for the rapid and accurate diagnosis of viral infections has led to a better understanding of the epidemiology and impact of many common respiratory viruses and resulted in better patient care. Over the past decade a number of new respiratory viruses including human metapneumovirus and new coronaviruses have been discovered using molecular techniques such as random primer amplification, pan-viral array and next generation sequencing. Analysis of the host transcriptional response during respiratory viral infection using in-vitro, animal models and natural and experimental human challenge have furthered the understanding of the mechanisms and predictors of severe disease and may identify potential therapeutic targets to prevent and ameliorate illness.","A novel human coronavirus, SARS-CoV, emerged suddenly in 2003, causing approximately 8000 human cases and more than 700 deaths worldwide. Since most animal models fail to faithfully recapitulate the clinical course of SARS-CoV in humans, the virus and host factors that mediate disease pathogenesis remain unclear. Recently, our laboratory and others developed a recombinant mouse-adapted SARS-CoV (rMA15) that was lethal in BALB/c mice. In contrast, intranasal infection of young 10-week-old C57BL/6 mice with rMA15 results in a nonlethal infection characterized by high titer replication within the lungs, lung inflammation, destruction of lung tissue, and loss of body weight, thus providing a useful model to identify host mediators of protection. Here, we report that mice deficient in MyD88 (MyD88(\u2212/\u2212)), an adapter protein that mediates Toll-like receptor (TLR), IL-1R, and IL-18R signaling, are far more susceptible to rMA15 infection. The genetic absence of MyD88 resulted in enhanced pulmon...","Abstract Coronaviruses infect many species of animals including humans, causing acute and chronic diseases. This review focuses primarily on the pathogenesis of murine coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) and severe acute respiratory coronavirus (SARS-CoV). MHV is a collection of strains, which provide models systems for the study of viral tropism and pathogenesis in several organs systems, including the central nervous system, the liver, and the lung, and has been cited as providing one of the few animal models for the study of chronic demyelinating diseases such as multiple sclerosis. SARS-CoV emerged in the human population in China in 2002, causing a worldwide epidemic with severe morbidity and high mortality rates, particularly in older individuals. We review the pathogenesis of both viruses and the several reverse genetics systems that made much of these studies possible. We also review the functions of coronavirus proteins, structural, enzymatic, and accessory, with an emphas...","Abstract An increase in on-farm mortality (euthanasia and death) in dairy herds has been reported in several countries in the last decade. This does not only imply possible problems with animal welfare, but it also causes economic losses to the farmer. The objective of this study was to evaluate time trends in on-farm dairy cow mortality in Sweden and identify potential herd-level risk factors. Data were retrieved on all Swedish dairy herds enrolled in the milk recording scheme between 2002 and 2010. Herds with a herd size of &lt;20 cows or a mortality rate (MR) of &gt;40 dead or euthanized cows per 100 cow-years were excluded. Two different models were used: 1 multiple-year analysis, which included 6,898 herds during the period 2002 to 2010 and 1 single-year analysis including 4,252 herds for the year 2010, where other variables that were not present during the entire multiple year study were analyzed. The outcome variable was the number of euthanized and dead cows per year and season. A ne...","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-2019) has been recognized as a global threat, and several studies are being conducted using various mathematical models to predict the probable evolution of this epidemic. These mathematical models based on various factors and analyses are subject to potential bias. Here, we propose a simple econometric model that could be useful to predict the spread of COVID-2019. We performed Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model prediction on the Johns Hopkins epidemiological data to predict the epidemiological trend of the prevalence and incidence of COVID-2019. For further comparison or for future perspective, case definition and data collection have to be maintained in real time.","The Eyrings rate process theory and free volume concept, two very popular theories in chemistry and physics fields, are employed to treat infectious disease transmissions. The susceptible individ- uals are assumed to move stochastically from one place to another. The virus particle transmission rate is assumed to obey the Eyring rate process theory and also controlled by how much free volume available in a system. The transmission process is considered to be a sequential chemical reaction, and the concentrations or fractions of four epidemiological compartments, the susceptible, the exposed, the infected, and the removed, can be derived and calculated. The obtained equations show that the basic reproduction number, R0, is not a constant, dependent on the volume frac- tion of virus particles, virus particle size, and virus particle packing structure, the energy barrier associated with susceptible individuals, and environment temperature. The developed models are applied to treat coronav...","Background: As the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), a sudden case increase in late February 2020 in global attracted deep concern. Italy, South Korea, Iran, France, Germany, Spain, the U.S. and Japan are probable the most severe countries. Collecting epidemiological data and predicting epidemic trends are important to develop and measure public intervention strategies. Epidemic predictions results yield by different mathematical models are out of line, therefore, we sought to compare different models and their prediction results, so as to generate objective conclusions. Methods: We used the number of cases reported from January 23 to March 20, 2020 to estimate possible spread size and peak time of COVID-19, especially in 8 high risk countries. Logistic growth model, basic SEIR model and adjusted SEIR model were adopted for predicting. Considering different model inputs may infer different model outputs, we implemented three model predictions with three scenarios of epid...","Abstract2019-nCov has caused more than 80 deaths as of 27 January 2020 in China, and infection cases have been reported in more than 10 countries. However, there is no approved drug to treat the disease. 2019-nCov Mpro is a potential drug target to combat the virus. We built homology models based on SARS Mpro structures, and docked 1903 small molecule drugs to the models. Based on the docking score and the 3D similarity of the binding mode to the known Mpro ligands, 4 drugs were selected for binding free energy calculations. Both MM/GBSA and SIE methods voted for nelfinavir, with the binding free energy of \u221224.69\u00b10.52 kcal/mol and \u22129.42\u00b10.04 kcal/mol, respectively. Therefore, we suggested that nelfinavir might be a potential inhibitor against 2019-nCov Mpro.","Cellular entry of enveloped viruses is often dependent on attachment proteins expressed on the host cell surface. Viral envelope proteins bind these receptors, and, in an incompletely understood process, facilitate fusion of the cellular and viral membranes so as to introduce the viral core into the cytoplasm. Only a small fraction of viral receptors have been identified so far. Recently, a novel coronavirus was identified as the etiological agent of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). The fusion protein gene of SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) was cloned and characterized, and shortly thereafter, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) was shown to be its functional receptor. Identification of ACE2 as a receptor for SARS-CoV will likely contribute to the development of antivirals and vaccines. It may also contribute to the development of additional animal models for studying SARS pathogenesis, and could help identify the animal reservoir of SARS-CoV.","Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is one of the major threats to the healthcare systems in some countries, especially in the Arabian Peninsula. MERS-CoV is considered an ideal example of the One Health concept. This is due to the animals, especially dromedary camels, play important roles in the transmission and sustainability of the virus, and the virus can be transmitted through aerosols of infected patients into the environment. However, there is some debate regarding the origin of MERS-CoV either from bats or other unknown reservoirs. The dromedary camel is the only identified animal reservoir to date. These animals play important roles in sustaining the virus in certain communities and may act as an amplifier of the virus by secreting it in their body fluids, especially in nasal and rectal discharges. MERS-CoV has been detected in the nasal and rectal secretions of infected camels, and MERS-CoV of this origin has full capacity to infect human airway epithelium...","Background &amp; Aims Besides secreting pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines and effector molecules, effector CD8+ T cells that arise upon acute infection with certain viruses have been shown to produce the regulatory cytokine interleukin (IL)-10 and, therefore, contain immunopathology. Whether the same occurs during acute hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection and role that IL-10 might play in liver disease is currently unknown. Methods Mouse models of acute HBV pathogenesis, as well as chimpanzees and patients acutely infected with HBV, were used to analyse the role of CD8+ T cell-derived IL-10 in liver immunopathology. Results Mouse HBV-specific effector CD8+ T cells produce significant amounts of IL-10 upon in vivo antigen encounter. This is corroborated by longitudinal data in a chimpanzee acutely infected with HBV, where serum IL-10 was readily detectable and correlated with intrahepatic CD8+ T cell infiltration and liver disease severity. Unexpectedly, mouse and human CD8+ T cell-deriv...","Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) is a newly emerging infectious disease caused by a novel coronavirus, MERS-coronavirus (MERS-CoV), a new member in the lineage C of \u03b2-coronavirus (\u03b2-CoV). The increased human cases and high mortality rate of MERS-CoV infection make it essential to develop safe and effective vaccines. In this review, the current advancements and potential strategies in the development of MERS vaccines, particularly subunit vaccines based on MERS-CoV spike (S) protein and its receptor-binding domain (RBD), are discussed. How to improve the efficacy of subunit vaccines through novel adjuvant formulations and routes of administration as well as currently available animal models for evaluating the in vivo efficacy of MERS-CoV vaccines are also addressed. Overall, these strategies may have important implications for the development of effective and safe vaccines for MERS-CoV in the future.","Introduction: The highly pathogenic coronaviruses severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) are lethal zoonotic viruses that have emerged into human populations these past 15 years. These coronaviruses are associated with novel respiratory syndromes that spread from person-to-person via close contact, resulting in high morbidity and mortality caused by the progression to Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). Areas covered: The risks of re-emergence of SARS-CoV from bat reservoir hosts, the persistence of MERS-CoV circulation, and the potential for future emergence of novel coronaviruses indicate antiviral drug discovery will require activity against multiple coronaviruses. In this review, approaches that antagonize viral nonstructural proteins, neutralize structural proteins, or modulate essential host elements of viral infection with varying levels of efficacy in models of highly pathogenic coronavirus di...","Summary Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a new infectious disease that first emerged in Guangdong province, China, in November, 2002. A novel coronavirus was later identified in patients with SARS. The detection of the virus in these patients, its absence in healthy controls or other patients with atypical pneumonia, and the reproduction of a similar disease in a relevant animal model fulfilled Koch's postulates for implicating this coronavirus as the causal agent of SARS. The full genome sequence was determined within weeks of the virus's identification. The rapid progress in the aetiology, the development of laboratory diagnostic tests, and the defining of routes of viral transmission were facilitated through a unique WHO-coordinated virtual network of laboratories, which shared information on a real-time basis through daily teleconferences. Subsequent studies have indicated that the SARS coronavirus is of animal origin, that its precursor is still present in animal popula...","Abstract Coronaviruses may cause respiratory, enteric and central nervous system diseases in many species, including humans. Until recently, the relatively low burden of disease in humans caused by few of these viruses hampered development of coronavirus specific therapeutics. However, the emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) has prompted the discovery of such drugs. Subsequent studies in animal models demonstrated the efficacy of SARS-CoV specific monoclonal antibodies, pegylated-interferon-\u03b1 and siRNAs against SARS-CoV. Furthermore, several antivirals shown to be effective against other viruses were tested in vitro. Because of availability and shown efficacy, the use of interferons may be considered should SARS-CoV or a related coronavirus (re)-emerge. The more recent design of wide-spectrum inhibitors targeting the coronavirus main proteases may lead to the discovery of new antivirals against multiple coronavirus induced diseases.","Abstract Canine coronavirus (CCoV) is responsible for mild or moderate enteritis in puppies. The virus is highly contagious and avoiding contact with infected dogs and their excretions is the only way to ensure disease prevention. Since no studies have yet focused on the sensitivity of CCoV to chemical biocides the present investigation examined the efficiency of physical and chemical methods of viral inactivation. CCoV infectivity was stable at +56\u00b0C for up to 30min, but tended to decrease rapidly at +65\u00b0C and +75\u00b0C. Germicidal ultra-violet (UV\u2013C) light exposure demonstrated no significant effects on virus inactivation for up to 3 days. CCoV was observed to be more stable at pH 6.0\u20136.5 while extreme acidic conditions inactivated the virus. Two tested aldehydes inactivated the virus but their action was temperature- and time-dependent. The methods for CCoV inactivation could be applied as animal models to study human coronavirus infection, reducing the risk of accidental exposure of re...","SARS-CoV-2 emerged by the end of 2019 to rapidly spread in 2020. At present, it is of utmost importance to understand the virus biology and to rapidly assess the potential of existing drugs and develop new active compounds. While some animal models for such studies are under development, most of the research is carried out in the Vero E6 cells. Here, we propose fully differentiated human airway epithelium cultures as a model for studies on the SARS-CoV-2. Further, we also provide basic characteristics of the system."],"title":["Animal models for highly pathogenic emerging viruses","Modelos experimentales de desmielinizaci\u00f3n-remielinizaci\u00f3n","The Pathology and Pathogenesis of Experimental Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome and Influenza in Animal Models","Systematic review and critical appraisal of prediction models for diagnosis and prognosis of COVID-19 infection","Is there an ideal animal model for SARS?","Development of animal models against emerging coronaviruses: From SARS to MERS coronavirus","Chapter 22 Animal Models with a Genetic Alteration of the ACE2/Ang-(1-7)/Mas Axis","Animal models for SARS and MERS coronaviruses","From SARS to MERS, Thrusting Coronaviruses into the Spotlight","Animal models and vaccines for SARS-CoV infection","Modeling of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Proteins by Machine Learning and Physics-Based Refinement","Murine coronavirus infection: a paradigm for virus-induced demyelinating disease","Coronaviruses and the human airway: a universal system for virus-host interaction studies","Machine learning-based CT radiomics model for predicting hospital stay in patients with pneumonia associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection: A multicenter study","Respiratory Viral Infections in Exacerbation of Chronic Airway Inflammatory Diseases: Novel Mechanisms and Insights From the Upper Airway Epithelium","Modelling strategies to organize healthcare workforce during pandemics: application to COVID-19","Rational evaluation of various epidemic models based on the COVID-19 data of China","In search for the hotspots of Disease X: A biogeographic approach to mapping the predictive risk of WHO s Blueprint Priority Diseases","Structure-based modeling of SARS-CoV-2 peptide/HLA-A02 antigens","Real-time forecasts of the COVID-19 epidemic in China from February 5th to February 24th, 2020","Overview of the CSIRO Australian Animal Health Laboratory","Protection against filovirus diseases by a novel broad-spectrum nucleoside analogue BCX4430","Identification of murine CD8 T cell epitopes in codon-optimized SARS-associated coronavirus spike protein","Short-term Forecasts of the COVID-19 Epidemic in Guangdong and Zhejiang, China: February 13\u201323, 2020","Studying immunity to zoonotic diseases in the natural host \u2014 keeping it real","Can the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Affect the Eyes?

Having an animal model that can recapitulate human disease is essential for vaccine and therapeutic development as well as testing. For a potential animal model to be susceptible to infection, the virus must be able to 1.) gain entry into host cells; 2.) overcome the host's antiviral responses; and 3.) disseminate virus following infection to allow infection of other neighbouring cells and tissues. It is also of importance for the model to be able to recapitulate human disease and viral transmission modes. When evaluating the ability of an animal to be infected by a virus and serve as a model, viral shedding, clinical disease, and seroconversion should be determined. The past animal models for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV were not universal due to the expression of the virus-specific cellular receptors for entry [63] . As SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV do not share a cellular receptor, they do not share the same host range and susceptibility, which includes research animal models [64] . Cynomolgus macaques, ferrets, and cats were some of the first animals to be determined susceptible to SARS-CoV [65, 66] . The advantage of ferrets is that they are a smaller animal compared to non-human primates and also are able to recapitulate some of the clinical symptoms and transmission kinetics of human respiratory viruses including coughing, sneezing, fever, and weight loss [67] . Although mice can be infected with SARS-CoV, as shown by recovery of vRNA and the elicitation of neutralizing antibodies, infection does not cause severe disease [68] . However, SARS-CoV could be passaged in mice (15 times) for the establishment of a model with clinical features [69] . After the identification of MERS-CoV, it was quickly determined that typical research animal models were not susceptible to the virus including mice, Syrian hamsters, and ferrets. Larger non-human primate models, such as Rhesus macaques and common marmoset were determined susceptible. To make use of small animal models, transgenic mice have been engineered for MERS-CoV susceptibility through expression of the human DPP4 receptor [70] . Other attempts at other mouse model developments were not successful, including an immunocompromised 129/SATA1-/-1 mouse [63] . Having an understanding of the animal models and model development previously utilized for the other coronaviruses of interest will aid in the development of a model for 2019-nCoV. As is necessary, elucidation of the receptor will help guide in development, and creating a clinical picture of the acute symptoms in humans will be essential for vaccine and antiviral evaluation.","The use of different animal models can be tailored to the goals of each study. Consistency, reproducibility and the relevance of the outcome measures to the scientific question (such as immunogenicity and efficacy of vaccines or pathogenesis of disease) must be considered before one can conclude that a given model is superior to other available models and is the preferred or appropriate model. Clearly, the pathogenesis of disease can only be studied in animal models that replicate key aspects of the disease. But animal models do not need to replicate all aspects of disease to provide useful information in evaluation of vaccines and immunoprophylaxis. For example, an animal model can be useful in vaccine efficacy studies if the following two criteria are met: (i) virus titer correlates with disease severity; and (ii) the virus replicates in the animal model to a sufficiently high titer so that differences in the level of replication between immunized and mock-immunized control groups can be meaningfully distinguished. Under these conditions, demonstration that a vaccine or antibody can prevent or significantly reduce the level of replication of challenge virus would be convincing evidence of efficacy. There is ample precedence for this approach in the development of vaccines against other respiratory viruses.","Traditionally, respiratory viruses are studied in animal models, usually mice and ferrets [48, 61]. However, it is not always possible to correctly recapitulate human infection and disease in animal models. The establishment of transgenic animal models for human disease is attainable when either the virus receptor has been identified, which is not the case for all HCoVs, or when viruses can be adapted to a different host. An adapted human virus may not share the same properties as the original human virus. SARS-CoV was found to replicate naturally in various strains of inbred mice but to enhance clinical signs of disease the hACE2 was introduced into these mice. This resulted in murine models with varying degree of human disease similarity. Since SARS-CoV already replicated in mouse cells, adapting it to the murine host was quite successful. This resulted in three mouse adapted strains that caused disease in mice similar to severe SARS-CoV cases in humans [62].","Phylogenetic species restriction of susceptibility to MERS-CoV infection has severely limited development of animal models of disease. Primates, including rhesus macaques and marmosets, transgenic mice expressing human DPP4, camelids, and rabbits have been assessed as potential animal models,35 however, each model system has limitations. Rhesus macaques develop transient pulmonary infection and illness.36,37 Whereas marmosets develop more severe illness following MERS-CoV infection,38 some have questioned whether the observed pathology is related to experimental manipulation of this small mammal versus the effects of viral infection.39 Transgenic mice that constitutively express human DPP4 develop lethal systemic infection, including central nervous system disease40-42 whereas transgenic mice expressing human DPP4 driven from surfactant promoters43 or transduced with adenoviral-associated vectors that express human DPP444 develop mild, transient disease. While camels and alpacas are natural hosts for MERS-CoV infection and have been used as disease models,45 they develop a self-limited upper respiratory infection different from human infection.32 Moreover, there is considerable expense and difficulty of experimental models using large animals.","In conclusion, the development of animal models for SARS has progressed rapidly; the described models range from those in which only virus replication is observed (such as young BALB/c or B6 mice) to models in which virus replication is accompanied by histopathologic evidence of disease (such as hamsters, ferrets, African green monkeys, cynomolgus and rhesus macaques) and those in which consistent findings of clinical illness and histopathological evidence of disease are observed (old BALB/c mice). Although much has been learned since the initial description of the various animal models and from subsequent studies in which vaccines or therapeutic or prophylaxis strategies were studied in different animal models, the limitations of the various models (Box 1) must also be recognized. Available data do not yet support a conclusion that there is a single preferred model for SARS in which all intervention or preventive strategies must be evaluated.","Over the last few decades, mathematical models of disease transmission have been useful to gain insights into the transmission dynamics of infectious diseases and the potential role of intervention strategies 15 . Epidemic transmission models focused on the spread of an infectious disease through a population. But this spread can be modeled in two fundamental ways: by looking at the entire population as a single group or set of linked subgroups (population-based) or by considering everyone that makes up the population and how interactions between unique individuals facilitate disease spread (individual-based). Common models of infectious disease included meta-population models, individual-based network models, and simple SIR-type models that incorporate the effects of reactive behavior changes or inhomogeneous mixing 16 .","Small animal models of SARS-CoV infection have benefits into the elucidation of innate immune pathogenesis beyond cell culture systems due to their ability to model the interaction of lung epithelium and immune cell types within an infected organism. While hamsters and ferrets have been considered for use as small animal models of SARS-CoV infection, a robust mouse model has been more vigorously pursued because of the relative ease of genetic manipulation of the host, as well as greater availability of immunological reagents [24] [25] [26] . SARS-CoV epidemic isolates replicate in young mice but do not cause clinical disease, limiting the use of these models for pathogenesis studies [27, 28] . SARS-CoV infected aged mice (12 months) exhibit minor clinical illness, but do not address pathogenic mechanisms associated with SARS disease in senescent or non-senescent populations [29] [30] [31] . Infections using the mouse coronavirus MHV-1 have also been proposed as models for SARS-CoV infection [32] . Recently, mouse adapted SARS coronaviruses (MA-SARS-CoV) have been developed by serial passage through the lungs of mice yielding several different MA-SARS-CoV strains [33, 34] . Infection of 6-10 week old mice with SARS-CoV adapted by 15 serial passages (MA15-SARS-CoV) causes morbidity and mortality, viral replication in the lungs, and lung pathology associated with mild SARS disease [33, 34] . In addition, MA-SARS-CoV infections of aged mice exhibit exacerbated SARS disease that mimics the age-dependent and ARDS phenotypes seen in humans [35, 36 ] . Currently, studies are underway to determine the response of recombinant inbred lines of mice (known as the Collaborative Cross) to MA15-SARS-CoV infection, utilizing Genome Wide Associate Studies to map quantitative trait loci that contribute to in vivo phenotypes (e.g. weight loss or lung pathology) [37 ] . These studies offer an unbiased approach to determining the contributions of many different genes to the complex trait of SARS-CoV disease, and could identify novel host factors involved in SARS-CoV pathogenesis.","Since human clinical SARS data is complicated by host genetic variation, disease exacerbating comorbidities, age variation, and variable drug treatment regimens, animal models provide a more homogenous and controlled environment within which to ask questions related to the mechanisms of disease pathogenesis. Prior to the generation of a mouse adapted SARS-CoV (MA15) which causes 100% mortality in BALB/c mice, previous SARS-CoV BALB/c or C57BL/6 animal models using the epidemic strain, SARS Urbani, were purely models of in vivo virus replication without overt signs of disease [12],[13],[36],[37]. In contrast to previous models, our novel C57BL/6 model of SARS-CoV pathogenesis recapitulates disease similar to non-severe human SARS-CoV cases with high virus titer replication in the lung, significant weight loss, elevated inflammatory cytokine/chemokines, the recruitment of inflammatory cells to the lung, viral clearance and subsequent convalescence [4]\u2013[6],[9]. Furthermore, the recovery from rMA15 disease is dependent on MyD88 but does not seem to be dependent on the presence of functional T or B cells (Fig. 1A). In contrast to a previous report where RAG-1\u2212/\u2212 mice were demonstrated to clear SARS Urbani (dose: 1\u00d7104 TCID50) with similar kinetics as compared to WT mice, we demonstrate that RAG-1\u2212/\u2212 mice recover from disease signs with similar kinetics as WT mice but are unable to clear (dose: 105 pfu) the more robust rMA15 [12]. The discrepancy regarding clearance of virus in RAG-1\u2212/\u2212 mice may be due to the differing doses used and/or the enhanced pathogenesis of the mouse adapted virus. The disease observed in our rMA15 C57BL/6 disease model has also been observed with a second independently derived mouse adapted SARS-CoV suggesting that the disease phenotype is not simply an artifact of the rMA15 mutational spectra but that both sets of mouse adapting mutations enhance the intrinsic pathogenic potential of the epidemic strain (data not shown). Taken together, the morbidity and mortality data for rMA15 infected WT, RAG-1\u2212/\u2212, and MyD88\u2212/\u2212 mice suggest that early MyD88 dependent innate signals are required for protection from rMA15 induced mortality.","While the mechanisms underlying the development and acute exacerbation of chronic airway inflammatory disease is extensively studied for ways to manage and control the disease, a viral infection does more than just causing an acute exacerbation in these patients. A viral-induced acute exacerbation not only induced and worsens the symptoms of the disease, but also may alter the management of the disease or confer resistance toward treatments that worked before. Hence, appreciation of the mechanisms of viral-induced acute exacerbations is of clinical significance to devise strategies to correct viral induce changes that may worsen chronic airway inflammatory disease symptoms. Further studies in natural exacerbations and in viral-challenge models using RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) or single cell RNA-seq on a range of time-points may provide important information regarding viral pathogenesis and changes induced within the airway of chronic airway inflammatory disease patients to identify novel targets and pathway for improved management of the disease. Subsequent analysis of functions may use epithelial cell models such as the air-liquid interface, in vitro airway epithelial model that has been adapted to studying viral infection and the changes it induced in the airway (Yan et al., 2016; Boda et al., 2018; Tan et al., 2018a). Animal-based diseased models have also been developed to identify systemic mechanisms of acute exacerbation (Shin, 2016; Gubernatorova et al., 2019; Tanner and Single, 2019). Furthermore, the humanized mouse model that possess human immune cells may also serves to unravel the immune profile of a viral infection in healthy and diseased condition (Ito et al., 2019; Li and Di Santo, 2019). For milder viruses, controlled in vivo human infections can be performed for the best mode of verification of the associations of the virus with the proposed mechanism of viral induced acute exacerbations (Ravi et al., 2019). With the advent of suitable diseased models, the verification of the mechanisms will then provide the necessary continuation of improving the management of viral induced acute exacerbations.","In order to characterize the viral pathogenesis and evaluate therapeutic options for MERS-CoV, researchers rely on an animal model mimicking the clinical course and pathology observed in humans. In contrast to the SARS animal model, where aged mice displayed pathological changes post-infection [52], mice infected with MERS-CoV did not show any clinical signs of infections, such as weight loss [53]. In addition, Syrian hamsters and ferrets, which are known to be susceptible to SARS-CoV, failed to be infected by MERS-CoV [22, 54]. Non-human primates (NHP) and common marmoset models have been tested for their suitability as MERS-CoV models. Upon a combination of various inoculation routes (intratracheal, ocular, oral, and intranasal) using an infectious dose of MERS-CoV, rhesus macaques developed a transient lower respiratory tract infection and mild clinical disease without mortality [55]. On the other hand, MERS-CoV infected common marmosets developed progressive, severe pneumonia [56]. Although NHPs are sufficiently good models to study MERS at different severity, working with NHPs is costly. Hence, establishing transgenic rodent animal models is crucial to move forward in the development of vaccines and therapeutic methods against MERS-CoV. By comparing small animal cell lines transfected with human and hamster dpp4 genes, it was observed that only humanized cell lines enabled MERS-CoV replication [57]. Therefore, researchers have now developed a hDPP4 transgenic mouse model [58\u2022, 59]. Agrawal et al. cloned hCD26/DPP4 in an expression vector with the ubiquitous cytomegalovirus immediate early enhancer and chicken beta-actin promoter and microinjected the DNA into mice zygotes. After lineage screening, hDPP4 transgenic mice that expressed hCD26/DPP4 were fully permissive to MERS-CoV infection, resulting in weight loss and an acute inflammatory response within the lungs and brains of the animal [58\u2022]. When these hCD26/DPP4 transgenic mice were immunized with MF59-adjuvanted RBD fragment (S377-588), fused to the Fc fragment, they were protected after challenge with a high dose (100\u00d7 LD50) of the virus [60]. Another hDPP4 transgenic mouse was recently created using an expression vector with either cytokeratin 18 (K18) or surfactant protein C (SPC) promoters, with the SPC-DPP4 transgenic mice exhibiting a milder disease phenotype [59].","The international cooperation and coordination that led to the rapid identification of SARS-CoV and the control of the SARS outbreak were exemplary. Efforts to develop animal models were undertaken in several laboratories around the world and experimental infection in these different animal models has proven to be invaluable in establishing the basis for prevention and control strategies for SARS. However, published reports from laboratories that have used different animal models have led to some controversial opinions and misunderstandings about animal models for SARS. It is essential that the findings in a given model are consistent and reproducible and that these features are well documented.","Animal models play a vital role to uncover the mechanisms of viral pathogenicity from the entrance to the transmission and designing therapeutic strategies. Previously, to examine the replication of SARS-CoV, various animal models were used which showed the symptoms of severe infection [43] . In contrast to SARS-CoV, no MERS-CoV pathogenesis was observed in small animals. Mice are not vulnerable to infection by MERS-coronavirus due to the non-compatibility of the DPP4 receptor [44] . As the entire genome of the 2019-novel coronavirus is more than 80% similar to the previous human SARS-like bat CoV, previously used animal models for SARS-CoV can be utilized to study the infectious pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2. The human ACE2 cell receptor is recognized by both SARS and Novel coronaviruses. Conclusively, TALEN or CRISPR-mediated genetically modified hamsters or other small animals can be utilized for the study of the pathogenicity of novel coronaviruses. SARS-CoV has been reported to replicate and cause severe disease in Rats (F344), where the sequence analysis revealed a mutation at spike glycoprotein [45] . Thus, it could be another suitable option to develop spike glycoprotein targeting therapeutics against novel coronaviruses. Recently, mice models and clinical isolates were used to develop any therapeutic strategy against SARS-CoV-2 induced COVID-19 [46, 47] . In a similar study, artificial intelligence prediction was used to investigate the inhibitory role of the drug against SARS-CoV-2 [48] . SARS-CoV-2 infected patients were also used to conduct randomized clinical trials [46, 49, 50] . It is now important that the scientists worldwide collaborate the design a suitable model and investigate the in vivo mechanisms associated with pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2.","A wide array of models exists for the predicting the spread of infectious disease across various cohorts. These models may be stochastic in nature, creating probability distributions by moving about random variables, or deterministic in nature, compartmentalizing the population across various groups. The Susceptible Exposed Infectious Recovered (SEIR) model is a widely utilized mathematical model in the COVID-19 outbreak 14 . Liu et al reviewed the models of 12 studies which calculated the basic reproductive number (R0) of the SARS-COV-2 virus 15 . The studies examined employed various techniques of subdividing the population and utilizing historical data of related diseases (i.e. SARS, MERS) to estimate the potential impact of COVID-19. While these models help simulate the possible course of a disease given population and disease characteristics, each model becomes outdated as various governments implement restrictions on its population. Infectious disease dynamics are classically considered as exponential in nature. However, Maier and Brockmann demonstrate that COVID-19 is affected by \"fundamental mechanisms that are not captured by standard epidemiological models\" 16 . This is notably true in early phases of disease expansion. Consequentially, COVID-19's behavior warrants the examination of models outside of inductive logic.","The reasons for host restriction, none or limited clinical symptoms observed in varies animal models are complexity. The interaction between the host receptor and functional proteins of SARS and MERS, respectively, plays an important and predominant role. In the context of animal models of SARS-CoV infection, researchers have compared the ACE2 amino acids that interact with the S protein RBD from several species. In agreement with the permissive nature of these species, the ACE2 residues of marmoset and hamster are similar to those of hACE2 [53]. By comparison, many residues of mouse ACE2 are different from those of hACE2, and this meets with decreased replication of SARS-CoV in mouse cells [207] and the lungs of young mice [149]. The changes at positions 353 (histidine) and 82 (asparagine) of rat ACE2 relative to hACE2 partially disrupt the S protein-DPP4 interaction and contribute to abrogation of binding. Interestingly, ferrets are permissive to SARS-CoV infection, but most of their ACE2 interaction residues are different from those of hACE2 [53], while many of the ACE2 residues between civet and ferret are the same, which may result in similar affinity [208]. For MERS-CoV, 14 residues of the S protein RBD have direct contact with 15 residues of hDPP4 [57]. Comparisons of human DPP4 binding affinity to that of other species indicated that human DPP4 had the highest affinity to the S protein of MERS-CoV, where the decreasing order of affinity is as follows: human &gt; horses &gt; camels &gt; goats &gt; bats [209]. Further evidence demonstrates that the host restriction of MERS-CoV remarkably depends on the sequence of DPP4, such as the characterization of amino acid residues at the connector of DPP4 with the RBD of S proteins in mice [187,210], hamsters, and cotton rats [210]. However, the multiplicity in severity of disease between rhesus macaques and common marmosets indicate that other host factors can perhaps affect the infection and replication of the virus, such as the presence of S-cleaving proteases [187]. In general, although the structural analysis of receptors-S protein interactions cannot fully explain all the observations for host restriction, they agree with the improved replication in several animal models and that it should be the premier and remarkable focus of small-animal model development. These special residues for host affinity are important to build up transgenic animal models enhancing the permissiveness and infection of SARS and MERS.","So far a lot of dynamic models have been developed and used in the mechanic analysis and prediction of animal epidemics. Among them the differential equations based models are the mainstream methods, including SIR model (Kermack and McKendrick, 1927) , Anderson-May model (Anderson and May, 1981) , the models of Zhang et al. (1997 , 2011 ), etc. Zhang et al. (1997 model was a group of differential-integral equations mainly treating susceptible and infected insect populations. The improved model (Zhang et al., 2011) was composed of nearly twenty differential equations supplemented by other equations. In these models, both susceptible and infected populations were treated as population density, and susceptible population interacts with infected population mainly through feeding on virus on the leaves spread by insects that died from virus infection. Serving as both explanatory and simulation models, they have demonstrated the better performance. Both SIR model (Kermack and McKendrick, 1927) and Anderson-May model (Anderson and May, 1981) include differential equations (correspondingly, difference equations) for susceptible (s) and infected (i) populations rather than population density, and the two populations interact with each other through the interaction term, ps(t)i(t) (Fuxa and Tanada, 1987) . Nevertheless, numerous simulation results showed that both of their models are extremely sensitive to some of the key parameters and initial population sizes, especially the infection coefficient, p. Given true parameters and initial conditions, it was so difficult to synchronously obtain realistic results for population size and key time points (such as the peak time) although both of them are better explanatory models for the epidemic dynamics. Furthermore, the important parameters such as incubation period, hospitalization term, etc., were not included in such explanatory models and most of the other models (Chen et al., 2020a) . In present paper we developed a generalized discrete dynamic model for human epidemics, and sensitivity analysis and scenario prediction was made, aiming to provide a novel simulation tool for future uses.","A number of animal models for SARS were developed during and after the SARS outbreak. Three excellent reviews of these models are available Roberts et al., 2007b; Subbarao and Roberts, 2006) ; thus these models will be only be briefly reviewed here. These include nonhuman primate models employing SARS-CoV isolates from later phases of the epidemic and cynomolgus macaques (M. fascicularis) Kuiken et al., 2003; Rowe et al., 2004) , rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) Qin et al., 2005; Rowe et al., 2004) African Green monkeys (Cercopithecus atheiops or Chlorocebus sabeus) , and in marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) (Greenough et al., 2005) . Although all of these animals support the replication of SARS-CoV in their respiratory tracts, most develop relatively mild disease. In addition, the degree of the severity of the disease and pathology observed in cynomolgus macaques by different workers was variable. SARS-CoV is able to infect cats (Felis domesticus) and ferrets (Mustela furo) (Martina et al., 2003) and although infection does not produce severe disease in either species, the ferret model has been utilized in protection studies and to study the host response to infection (Chu et al., 2008; Czub et al., 2005; Danesh et al., 2011; ter Meulen et al., 2004; Weingartl et al., 2004) .","Since the large global outbreak of 2003, a limited number of cases of SARS have occurred that included four community-acquired infections associated with mild disease the following winter, and at least four laboratory-acquired infections, one of which resulted in secondary spread and severe illness and mortality in contacts. Although it is difficult to predict whether another outbreak of SARS will occur, exposure to infected animals and laboratory-acquired infections that are not immediately recognized are two potential sources for infections. The high morbidity and mortality rate and economic consequences of the 2003 outbreak, together with the potential for infections in the future, are reasons for continued global interest in the development of measures to prevent and control SARS. Antiviral drugs, immunotherapy and vaccines against SARS will have to be evaluated in animal models, and a rational selection of an appropriate model for these studies will depend on a careful assessment and review of available models. We summarize the findings in the current animal models for SARS and discuss what we have learned from these models. The utility, benefits, limitations and controversy surrounding these models are also discussed. Furthermore, we suggest directions for future research that will facilitate the resolution of controversial findings, and we present some of the outstanding research questions in the field.","The outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003 was controlled by public health measures at a time when specific interventions such as antiviral drugs, vaccines and immunotherapy were not available. Since then, several animal models have been developed for the study of SARS and, although no model replicates the human disease in all aspects, the use of animal models for SARS has led to the establishment of several important principles for vaccine and immunotherapy. Consistency and reproducibility of findings in a given model must be demonstrated to establish the superiority of one model over others. Here, we suggest aspects of an ideal animal model for studies of SARS pathogenesis and vaccine development and present our assessment of the strengths and limitations of the current animal models for SARS.","DNA vaccines have been used in a variety of animal models for different infectious diseases, including influenza, HIV, Ebola, West Nile and other viruses (reviewed in ref. 20). Despite their success in animal models, this approach has only recently been used in human studies, and its potential to protect against human diseases has yet to be established. For this reason, as well as the limitations of the animal model for SARS-CoV infections, it is important to ascertain the immunogenicity of these plasmids in humans. Should the response be suboptimal, it can be readily augmented using prime-boost combinations with inactivated viral vaccine candidates or with adenoviral or poxvirus vectors. The definition of effective viral genes reported here can guide the choice of inserts for such gene-based vaccination approaches. For example, the S\u0394CD mutant can be expressed in other vector delivery systems for analysis, alone or in various combinations. Although the murine model allows assessment of various antiviral approaches and examination of the effect of immunity on pulmonary virus replication, it does not show sustained infection or high lethality. The model of infection that has been described in ferrets shows prominent pulmonary pathology associated with infection, and the efficacy of such vaccines in this and other pathogenic animal models will be of interest in future studies. At the same time, it is not known whether even the ferret model faithfully replicates the complex pathology and symptomatology of the human disease, and it will be necessary to test potential SARS vaccine candidates for their immunogenicity, safety and efficacy in humans in the event of future outbreaks.","Protein models were generated initially from inter-residue distance predictions rather than templatebased modeling because of a lack of experimentally determined close homolog structures. The resulting models were then further refined by a molecular dynamics simulation-based refinement protocol to improve the physical realism at the atomistic level of the structures. We also applied the same refinement protocol to the models predicted by DeepMind's AlphaFold method. The detailed procedures are described in METHOD section. We compared our models with the other available models, i.e. the original AlphaFold models and the predictions from the Zhang group. As shown in Table 1 , our models and the models from the Zhang group provide more complete sequence coverage than the AlphaFold models.","We then modelled the number of secondary cases following importation assuming a Poisson process. Several versions of the model were explored to test potential determinants of the observed heterogeneity in transmission. The first factor considered was the presence/absence of dependence of transmission on the setting (community vs. hospital), as accounted for by models S+ and S- respectively. We then considered possible dependence on the total duration of the transmission risk period (with, model D+, vs. without, model D-). This was defined as the duration from symptoms onset or date of travel, if travelling after symptoms onset, to isolation or death. For models S+ we used setting-specific transmission risk periods. Eventually we compare presence/absence of heterogeneity in transmission between patients (with, model P+, vs. without, model P-). The decomposition tested in the models accounts for the aspects that were shown to be relevant in the heterogeneity of transmission by the risk analysis. Notice that in all models tested we assumed that no transmission is possible after patient isolation. To account for duration we set the mean of the Poisson distribution to \u03bcCdC + \u03bcHdH, where dC and dH were the number of days in the community and in hospital, and \u03bcC and \u03bcH the average number of secondary cases per day in each setting. Overdispersion in transmission was introduced by replacing \u03bcH with a Gamma-distributed random parameter mH with mean \u03bcH and standard deviation \u03c3H. We further distinguished between a model with over-dispersion of transmission only in the hospital (P+/D+/S+), and a model accounting for such a level of heterogeneity in both hospital and community (P++/D+/S+). All listed transmission hypotheses yielded 8 different models that were fitted to the data and compared by the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC). More details on the analysis are reported in the Additional file 1.","As human SARS has disappeared, the role of an exuberant (but perhaps appropriate for the titre of the virus) immune response will need to be addressed using animal models of SARS. Mice, cats, ferrets, macaques and civet cats are all susceptible to SARS-CoV, but none, with the exception of aged mice, develop severe disease (reviewed in Ref. 129). In efforts to develop models that closely mimic human disease, mice that are transgenic for the expression of human ACE2 were developed and infected with SARS-CoV130,131. Although these mice develop more severe pulmonary disease than non-transgenic mice, they also develop an overwhelming neuronal infection, accompanied by high cytokine and/or chemokine expression and minimal cellular infiltration in the brain132. Although the severity of the brain infection observed in human ACE2 transgenic mice is greater than that seen in human patients, infection of this organ has been detected in some studies and patients who survived SARS had a greater incidence of neurological and psychiatric sequelae than anticipated63,133,134. The high susceptibility of these mice to infection with SARS-CoV makes them useful for vaccine and therapeutic trials. Another approach to developing an animal model for SARS was to adapt the virus by passage 10\u201315 times through the lungs of BALB/c mice or rats103,135,136. Three to six mutations were detected in the adapted viruses, with changes most commonly observed in the S protein and in nsp5 (3CLpro). The adapted virus caused extensive pulmonary infection and disease was most severe in aged animals. These viruses will be useful for studies of pathogenesis and for vaccine and therapeutic trials.","The emergence of both SARS- and MERS-CoVs emphasized the importance of establishing animal models for human coronaviruses. Currently, a few animal models for MERS-CoV have been established. Mice carry their own variant of the viral receptor DDP4 that differs from the human in regions important for MERS-CoV spike interaction and by replacing this receptor with the human one, MERS-CoV can infect mouse cells but the method of hDPP4 insertion has an effect on the degree of pathogenesis observed in these mice [65, 66]. Various non-human primates (NHPs) can be naturally infected with both SARS- and MERS-CoVs. However, disease presentation and pathogenesis differs between the different subspecies and NHP models are expensive, although ideal to study human infection due to their genetic similarity [62].","Attempts to control transmissible gastroenteritis virus of pigs and feline coronavirus of cats through the use of vaccines have not been successful although vaccines for the avian disease infectious bronchitis virus has been modestly effective. The fact that natural infections with 229E or OC43 do not provide long-lasting immunity is instructive in this regard. Thus, so far, there is no vaccine for a HCoV that is in clinical use. The severity of SARS led to a concerted effort to develop vaccines for SARS CoV and range of vaccine strategies including inactivated whole virus vaccines, spike-subunit vaccines, DNA vaccines and vaccinia or parainfluenza virus type 3 vectored vaccines have all been tried in experimental animal models, with some providing evidence of efficacy. It has been established that antibody to the spike protein is the key correlate of protection in animal models. However, as there is perceived to be no imminent public health threat from SARS, few of these vaccines have been taken to human clinical trials. Passive immunotherapy using monoclonal antibodies that neutralize SARS CoV has also been developed and evaluated in experimental animal models of SARS. ","Mathematical models have become important instruments in the analysis and control of infectious diseases. Several models corresponding to epidemic with different characteristics have been proposed and discussed in literature. The fundamental assumption in epidemic models is that the population can be divided into distinct groups; the most common are: the susceptible (S) that are the subjects that may catch the disease; the infected (I) that are the subjects that are already infected and can spread the disease to susceptible individuals; the removed (R) that are the subject that are immune for life. Therefore these models are referred to as SIR models.","We have learned much about correlates of immunity using the current animal models for SARS research. Experiments in mice with targeted defects in the immune system suggest that innate immunity has an important role in clearance of SARS-CoV [10, 11] . Additional studies have shown that intranasally administered SARS-CoV replicates in the respiratory tract of several animal species and protects animals from re-infection with SARS-CoV [8, 24, 35] . In addition to primary infection, active immunization with inactivated whole virus vaccines, DNA vaccines, subunit vaccines and live, vectored vaccines expressing the SARS-CoV spike protein also elicit neutralizing antibodies to SARS-CoV that provide protection from subsequent challenge (Table 2) . Furthermore, passive transfer of post-infection or post-immunization sera or monoclonal antibodies against the spike protein can also protect mice, ferrets and hamsters from infection, and modulate disease (Table 2) . Moreover, depletion of T-cells in mice immunized with a DNA vaccine encoding the spike protein gene did not abrogate protection from SARS-CoV challenge, and adoptive transfer of T-cells from immunized mice to na\u00efve mice did not confer protection from SARS-CoV challenge. These findings strongly suggest that vaccines that elicit humoral immunity to SARS-CoV spike protein or immunotherapy that targets the spike protein will be sufficient to protect from SARS infection and associated disease. Research in animal models has led to the identification of correlates of immunity such as the protective ability of actively induced neutralizing antibodies [8, 13, 14, 16, 17, 23, 35, 36] or passively transferred neutralizing antibodies [8, 15, 21, 22] . These principles will provide the basis for prevention and intervention strategies in the event that SARS-CoV reappears in humans.","Correlates of protection from coronavirus disease have been studied in animal models. Coronavirus experts have emphasized that there is a wide range of coronavirus diseases, and that the clinical manifestations of the disease and the correlates of protection can vary widely between pathogens and between animal models.","SARS-CoV is a highly pathogenic respiratory virus where the mechanisms of severe disease are largely mediated by innate immune pathways. Excellent models exist for studying SARS-CoV pathogenesis that replicate findings from the SARS outbreak in humans: cell lines for studying in vitro responses in human lung epithelial cells, mouse models of fibrosis and GWAS mapping of traits, as well as primate models of comparative species infection and agedependent phenotypes. Due to the development of these models, SARS-CoV is uniquely suited for a systems biology based platform to compare respiratory virus infection in multiple relevant model systems as an unbiased approach to identify novel host modulators of innate immunity in the context of viral infections. In addition, SARS-CoV encodes many proteins that antagonize the host's Interferon response, but questions remain about the effects of these antagonists of viral pathogenesis during SARS-CoV infection in vivo. Of the currently well-described innate immune signaling pathways, there is evidence to support that RLR and TLR sensors detect and respond to SARS-CoV infection, but no mechanism or SARS-CoV ligand for these receptors has been determined. Unique gene transcription signatures associated with defined temporal expression of proinflammatory cytokines and ISGs in models of severe SARS-CoV disease have been described, but few of these genes have been evaluated for their role in SARS pathogenesis or the host antiviral response to SARS-CoV, which could help identify novel immunomodulatory therapies in the event of SARS-CoV re-emergence. In future studies, SARS-CoV could be particularly useful as a comparative model for Influenzavirus or RSV infection to evaluate common targets for antiviral strategies as well as unique mechanisms of innate immune pathogenesis across multiple virus families with similar tropisms.","In an attempt to assess the dynamics of the outbreak for forecasting purposes as well as to estimate epidemiological parameters that cannot be computed directly based on clinical data, such as the transmission rate of the disease and 30 the basic reproduction number R 0 , defined as the expected number of exposed cases generated by one infected case in a population where all individuals are susceptible, many mathematical modelling studies have already appeared since the first confirmed COVID-19 case. The first models mainly focused on the estimation of the basic reproduction number R 0 using dynamic mechanistic 35 mathematical models ( [3, 4, 5, 6] ), but also simple exponential growth models (see e.g. [7, 8] ). Compartmental epidemiological models like SIR, SIRD, SEIR and SEIRD have been proposed to estimate other important epidemiological parameters, such as the transmission rate and for forecasting purposes (see e.g. [6, 9] ). Other studies have used metapopulation models, which include data 40 of human mobility between cities and/or regions to forecast the evolution of the outbreak in other regions/countries far from the original epicenter in China [3, 10, 11, 5] , including the modelling of the influence of travel restrictions and other control measures in reducing the spread ( [12] .","Models to predict hospital admission for COVID-19 pneumonia in the general population. The \"CV-19 vulnerability index\" to detect hospital admission for COVID-19 pneumonia from other respiratory infections (e.g. pneumonia, influenza), is available as an online tool. 7 44 Diagnostic models. The \"COVID-19 Early Warning Score\" to detect COVID-19 infection in adults is available as a score chart in an article. 24 A decision tree to detect severe disease for pediatric COVID-19 confirmed patients is also available in an article. 18 Diagnostic models based on CT imaging. Three of the seven AI models to assist with diagnosis based on CT results, are available via web applications. 17 20 23 45-47 Prognostic models. To assist in the prognosis of mortality, a nomogram (a graphic aid to calculate mortality risk), 6 a decision tree, 15 and a CT-based scoring rule are available in the articles. 16 All other 9 reports did not include any usable equation, format or reference for use of their prediction model. Because all models were at high risk of bias, we cannot recommend their routine use before they are properly externally validated.","Suitable animal models for evaluating vaccines for SARS- and MERS-CoV are lacking or highly limited, making the process of vaccine development highly challenging.42,43 Development of an efficient animal model that mimics the clinical disease can inform on pathogenesis as well as to develop vaccines and therapeutics against these CoVs. Several animal models have been evaluated for SARS- and MERS CoVs including mouse, guinea pigs, hamsters, ferrets, rabbits, rhesus macaques, marmosets, and cats.42,44-50","Autoimmunity could also result from superantigenic stimulation of T cells by viral or bacterial proteins. Superantigens are capable of binding to specific T-cell receptor proteins, producing nonspecific stimulation of relatively large numbers of T cells, which might cause clonal expansion of T cells reactive to myelin or oligodendrocyte antigens.47s48 ANIMAL MQDELS OF DEMYELINATING DISEASE CNS demyelination associated with inflammation is present in animal models of experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE) and Theiler murine encephalomyelitis (TME). These models provide an opportunity for the investigation of autoimmune and virus-associated disease, respectively. EAE is an autoimmune disease of the CNS and a model for immunotherapy. A CD4+ T-cell population specific for a myelin antigen, either MBP or proteolipid protein, is required for initiation EAE. EAE and MS share characteristics that include CNS demyelination, perivascular T cells, association with MHC class II antigens, and possibly restricted TCR V-gene utilization.4g The murine adoptive transfer model has another important feature of MS: the chronic relapsing clinical course.4g This clinical course is useful for investigations of the immune response and immunotherapy not only during onset of the disease but also during relapse. The pathologic features of this murine transfer model are inflammation and prominent demyelination.4g-51 EAE is not associated with an environmental factor.","Primate models have been used for many years to study respiratory tract infection and immunity to measles virus ( Figure 34 .1) (Blake and Trask, 1921b; Putz et al., 2003) , influenza (Renegar, 1992; Rimmelzwaan et al., 2001; Soike et al., 1984) , parainfluenza (Durbin et al., 2000; Hall et al., 1993; Schmidt et al., 2002) , respiratory syncytial virus (Belshe et al., 1977; Cheng et al., 2001; Hancock et al., 2000; Kakuk et al., 1993; Leaman et al., 2002; Teng et al., 2000) and, more recently, monkeypox (Zaucha et al., 2001) . The majority of published work is focused on vaccine development. Possibly the best studied example of differing host species pathogenicity, and hence the use of an animal model, is the case of measles virus. Both rodent and primate animal models have been used for measles vaccine research, but wildtype strains of measles virus do not replicate in rodent species, with the exception of cotton rats, so that vaccine-induced protective immunity can be tested only in humans or susceptible nonhuman primates (Putz et al., 2003) . Similar restrictions are a concern for animal models of influenza virus (Renegar, 1992; Soike et al., 1984) .","While vaccine-mediated cellular immunity has been demonstrated to play a role in protection in preclinical models of NiV infection,61 the most advanced vaccine modalities demonstrating clear efficacy across multiple animal models have primarily induced humoral immunity. A soluble glycoprotein (sG) subunit vaccine from the related henipavirus Hendra virus (HeV) is an extensively studied vaccine that can protect ferrets and AGM from experimental challenge with NiV or HeV. Prime-boost regimens with adjuvanted HeV-sG subunit proteins are efficacious in stringent NiV challenge models, across a range of doses (4\u2013100ug), and with pre-challenge neutralising antibody titres as low as 1:28.62,63 The HeV sG vaccine (Equivac\u00ae HeV) has been licensed to vaccinate horses in Australia against HeV.64 A number of viral vectored vaccines have also been tested and show promising immunogenicity and/or efficacy against NiV-mediated disease. These include poxvirus (canarypoxvirus ALVAC strain), vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), rabies virus (RABV), adeno-associated virus (AAV), Newcastle disease virus (NDV) and Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV); this topic has recently been comprehensively reviewed.56,65","The continuing emergence of virulent human coronaviruses emphasizes the need for animal models for studying viral replication, pathogenesis and transmission. Thus far, this work has largely focused on SARS-CoV infection. SARS-CoV replication has been reported in mice, hamsters, cats, civets and primates, and the most severe disease symptoms have been observed in aged animals. MERS-CoV has a broad host range in vitro55, which provides some promise for the development of a small animal model for human disease in the near future. However, a functional small animal model for MERS-CoV replication or pathogenesis has not yet been characterized or reported; the possibility of ongoing selection in the receptor-binding sequence in the spike protein or other sequences that are important for host specificity might contribute to this limitation. Inoculation of rhesus macaques with 7 \u00d7 106 half-maximal tissue culture infectious doses (TCID50) of a MERS-CoV isolate results in transient mild-to-moderate clinical disease, which includes localized or widespread pneumonia56; however, the lack of a small animal model is clearly a major obstacle to furthering our understanding of viral pathogenesis and to testing vaccines and therapeutics.","The proposed mechanisms of SARS have significant implications for the prevention, diagnosis, therapy and future research on this newly emerged disease. A better understanding of the distribution of target cells and viral concentration will provide a guide for accurate and early detection of the virus. The status of the immune function should be a key parameter in gauging the treatment of SARS infection. The state of the immune system at different stages of the disease gives clues as to how immune suppressive, immune supportive and steroid therapy may best be administered in treating the disease, and may also help to determine the timing and the dosage of the treatment. Due to the lack of a good understanding of the pathogenesis and the role of immunopathology during the SARS epidemic, the administration of steroids in treating SARS was a controversial topic, and the outcome of such treatment was not uniformly beneficial. The wide spread distribution of the virus in the body and the high concentration of the virus in the blood and leukocytes imply that the virus may be transmissible through blood and body fluid. The detection of virus in the intestine, the kidney, the stool and the urine indicate that the contaminated stool and urine may also be a vehicle of viral transmission. The development of vaccine to SARS depends on the establishment of appropriate animal models. As immune dysfunction and immune pathology play pivotal roles in the pathogenesis of SARS, the measurement of immune indices should be important parameters to be monitored in evaluating animal models and effectiveness of any vaccine under investigation. Unfortunately, this important fact has to date been neglected by investigators developing vaccines to SARS. Infections of the central nervous system and the pathology of other organs should also be taken into consideration when conducting the follow up examinations of recovered SARS patients.","Aerosol administration is more effective than parenteral dosing in animal models of influenza and RSV infection. Parenteral ribavirin has antiviral and therapeutic activity in animal models of infection with Lassa virus, other arenaviruses, and bunyavirus (see Chapters 47, 168, and 169). Combinations of ribavirin with immunoglobulin in RSV infection and with M2 or neuraminidase inhibitors in influenza A infection or with neuraminidase inhibitors in influenza B infection show enhanced antiviral activity. 12 The use of ribavirin in treatment of hepatitis B and C is discussed in Chapter 46.","Megan Miller (Colorado State University, Fort Collins, CO, USA) used experimental infections to determine if a sexual transmission model for Zika virus is possible. Zika virus (ZIKV) is a mosquito borne flavivirus that has been prevalent in Asia, parts of Africa, and Central and South America. The recent pandemic in South and North America resulted in over 1,000,000 cases. The most common symptoms of Zika virus disease are rash, arthralgia, conjunctivitis and headache; however compilations have been observed, including Guillain-Barre syndrome and birth defects, in infected newborns. Interestingly, ZIKV is the only known flavivirus to be able to transmit sexually. This study was undertaken to determine an immunecompetent, non-primate, small animal model that would be valuable for understanding the mechanism of ZIKV sexual transmission. Previous published evidence showed that cottontail rabbits seroconvert after inoculation with ZIKV, and other infection studies suggested that both guinea pigs and the Jamaican fruit bats develop viremias and seroconvert after inoculation. They are looking for evidence of infections in male tissues and body fluid of these three animal models; rabbits (NZW strain), guinea pigs (Hartley strain) and the local colony of Artibeus jamaicensis (Jamaican fruit bat). Groups of each species are being inoculated with ZIKV or uninfected cell culture media, and then blood, oral swab, urine and semen samples are collected and tested for ZIKV by quantitative real time-PCR (qRT-PCR) and plaque assays. To date, they have determined that NZW rabbits are not a competent model for ZIKV sexual transmission. Additional results are pending. By determining an immune-competent, non-primate, sexual transmission animal model for ZIKV they hope to begin addressing many unknown questions about this mode of transmission and its influence on ZIKV disease.","We evaluated MolProbity score 11 for all available models ( Table 3) . Although this score does not indicate whether a model reflects the overall correct structure or not, it can tell if a given model satisfies basic protein stereochemistry or not. All of the models generated from our modeling pipeline has less than 1.5 MolProbity score. Especially, steric clashes and rotamer outliers, rarely exist. Most of the AlphaFold models also have good MolProbity scores, although there are sometimes a few numbers of steric clashes between atoms and some rotamer outliers. After refining those models, most of the poor local geometries could be resolved, and the resulting MolProbity scores after refinement of the AlphaFold models are very good. In contrast to these models, models from Zhang group have poor local geometries as measured by the MolProbity score. These models have numerous atomic clashes, poor side-chain conformations, and bad backbone dihedral angles that generally suggest poor stereochemistry.

This would facilitate preclinical evaluations of candidate COVID-19 vaccines and drugs.","While modeling CEP_C30, 8 models were built according to 8 automatically found templates. The top-rated model in the 8 models is a homo-dimer with no ligand, and was selected to represent the structure of CEP_C30. While modeling PLVP, 29 models were built according to 16 automatically found templates. The top-rated model in the 29 models is a monomer with a zinc ion ligand, and was selected to represent the structure of PLVP. The structures of the two selected models are available in Supplemental Files S1 and S2. The detailed information, evaluation scores and Ramachandran plots of the two models are shown in Figure 1 .","extension. Reliable estimates place the R0 value of the COVID-19 in 1.4-2.5, similar to the R0 of the coronavirus SARS at the beginning of the epidemic (2.2-3.7). This value was reduced to an R0 of 0.67-1.23 at the end of the epidemic. By contrast, the coronavirus MERS has always remained at lower R0 values (0.29-0.80). 4 It seems that the COVID-19 could be more easily transmitted than SARS. However, there is a need to exercise caution. The R0 value indicates the transmission potential of an infectious disease. A higher R0 does not mean a more extensive disease. The flu, for example, whose R0 value ranges around 1.3 each year, infects millions of people worldwide. Neither does the R0 indicate the transmission rate either. R0 is also an average value: there are people who, although infected, will not transmit the disease to anyone, while others may transmit it to many more people. These individuals, called \u00absuper-spreaders\u00bb, were protagonists of two extraordinary events during the SARS epidemic in Toronto (Canada) and MERS in Seoul (South Korea) when, from one patient who was a \u00absuper-spreader\u00bb, dozens of patients, visitors and health personnel from two hospitals were infected. Control measures, such as those used in China, can significantly reduce the R0 of a disease. In this initial phase of the COVID-19 epidemic, its R0 value is being estimated from multiple assumptions and using complex mathematical models. As epidemiologists, some of us approach these mathematical models with circumspect: a popular saying states \u00abAll the models are wrong, but some are useful\u00bb.","No matter what the obstacles were, research about the causative factor(s) of BEN started almost immediately after its recognition as a discrete nosological entity. For a disease with such a narrow, defined, and well-preserved geographic distribution, it was a logical assumption that the causative factor should be an environmental one endemic to the afflicted regions. Nonetheless, along with this ecological influence, other factors had to be taken into consideration. For example, an obvious question was how could such an environmental trigger selectively affect certain villages and households and leave the ones just next to them undisturbed? Could these differences be explained by the existence of genetic variability between diseased and healthy families? Or could it be an infectious agent prevalent to the inflicted foci? Another pivotal question related to the long incubation period of the disease, which pointed to a long exposure to a low-dose harming agent that existed in the environment for many years. If that is the case, why then did BEN appear only during the second half of the century in the endemic areas and not before? Such a temporal association requires a major local environmental change before the first appearance of the disease, and such an alteration is not easy to identify in the history of the region. In addition, any etiologic hypothesis should take into consideration not only the nephropathy itself, but also the increased incidence of upper urothelial neoplasms in the patients. Finally, if somebody were to solve the mystery of BEN, he or she should use information from both animal models of interstitial nephropathy and the recognized effects of the candidate environmental factors in human health and disease. Given all these varied questions, it is not surprising that throughout the years, the effort to solve the riddle of BEN involved not only nephrologists, but also scientists from such diverse fields as occupational medicine, animal models of human disease, environmental sciences and epidemiology, oncology, genetics, and geology.","Thus far, MERS-CoV vaccines have been shown to provide efficacious protection in animal models, though none of the vaccines developed has been tested in human clinical trials. Major strategies for vaccine development are focused on the elicitation of serum antibodies against the major antigen (S protein) of MERS-CoV . Further, passive immunotherapy using convalescent phase human plasma is being considered in MERS patients after its success in animal models . However, studies also demonstrate that MERS-CoV S protein-derived vaccines induce specific CD8 \u00fe T-cell and virus-neutralizing antibodies, which could contribute to complete protection against MERS-CoV in animal models (Lan et al., 2014; Volz et al., 2015) . Based on the investigations of immune memory against SARS-CoV in follow-up studies of recovered patients (discussed above), T-cell responses can provide robust long-term memory and possess a considerable potential for cross-reactivity with heterotypic coronaviruses. Thus, vaccines combining both cellular and humoral responses should be considered for coronavirus prevention. The similarities between the immunopathogenesis of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV through interaction with cell receptors and blockage of host innate immune responses also point to potential therapeutic targets in patients infected with other pathogenic coronaviruses.","All the m336-based fusion proteins could be easily produced in E. coli in large amount and low production cost. Their sizes are larger than m336 scFv or HR2P peptides, suggesting that they would possess longer in vivo half-life. Still, their half-life would be shorter than full-size IgG due to the lack of Fc region. Therefore, their prophylactic and therapeutic efficacy against MERS-CoV should be assessed carefully using different approaches and doses in vivo. However, the RBD of MERS-CoV specifically targets on human DPP4 [29], and most small animal models are not susceptible to MERS-CoV infection [55], which pose a significant barrier to the development of anti-MERS-CoV inhibitors. Fortunately, researchers have constructed several animal models recently that simulate the morbidity and mortality of human infections, of which nonhuman primates (NHP) models and human DPP4-expressing mouse model are considered to be ideal candidates [56] and the latter is promising to be utilized in our following studies.","acids of different mammals to determine which mammalian ACE2 could interact with S protein of human SARSr-CoV. By analyzing the protein sequence of mammalian ACE2, we found that the ACE2 of Camelus dromedarius, Procyon lotor, Rhinolophus ferrumequinum, Rattus norvegicus, Mus musculus, Ornithorhynchus anatinus, Loxodonta africana, Erinaceus europaeus, Nyctereutes procyonoides, Suricata suricatta, Dipodomys ordii, and Cavia porcellus lose the capability to associate with S protein (Table 1) . These mammals could be ruled out from the potential host list for SARS-CoV-2. We found that S protein may bind to ACE2 from some wild mammals, which suggests that we should investigate whether these animals may be intermediate hosts for SARS-CoV-2. It has been reported that the RBM region in S protein of pangolin coronavirus is similar to that of S protein of SARS-CoV-2 [11, 12] , which may be involved in the recombination of SARS-CoV-2. We identified that N82 of pangolin ACE2 showed closer contact with RBD than human ACE2 (Fig. 3C) , indicating that pangolin ACE2 might show better affinity to SARS-CoV-2. This finding further supports the hypothesis that pangolin is involved in SARS-CoV-2 evolution. In current study, only a limited list of wild mammals is covered. In the future, we should select more mammals for study. Although no SARS-CoV-2 has been found in domestic cats and dogs, cat/dog ACE2 may bind to S protein of SARS-CoV-2. In the future, we should pay attention to monitoring whether domestic cats and dogs could be infected by SARS-CoV-2. Animal model is an important tool in the study of infectious diseases. ACE2 of mice cannot interact with SARS-CoV-2, so it cannot be used as animal model of SARS-CoV-2 directly. Some studies have generated mice transfected with human ACE2 as the models to study SARS-CoV [20] , and these mice can also be used as animal models for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Interestingly, we identified that N82 in ACE2 is closer to RBD than M82 (Fig. 3C and D) , indicating a novel strategy to design an optimized ACE2 for SARS-CoV-2 infection. We speculated that small peptide based on N82 of ACE2 might show higher affinity to SARS-CoV-2 RBD. We proposed that if M82 in human ACE2 was mutated to N82, the modified human ACE2 will enhance SARS-CoV-2 infection. In the future, those ideas will be tested in cell culture and animal model. We noticed that the ACE2 proteins from Circetidae (Mesocricetus auratus, Phodopus campbelli, Ictidomys tridecemlineatus, and Cricetulus griseus) are capable to recognize RBD. Mesocricetus auratus (golden hamster) and Cricetulus griseus (Chinese hamster) are experimental animals and our finding indicates the possibility to develop small animal models for SARS-CoV-2 infection using Chinese hamster and golden hamster.","Efficacy testing in animal models that mimic the major pathophysiological and immunological features of human LF are a prerequisite before licensure. Rodents are an obvious first species to establish immunogenicity, but as LASV has a rodent host reservoir and the response to LASV varies depending on mouse strain, age and inoculation route, rodents are not suitable as a valid LF disease model. Guinea pigs are the most sensitive model to study lung pathology,81,82 while common marmosets (CM) are surrogates to study liver involvement.83 However, LASV-infected rhesus and cynomolgus monkeys are considered the gold-standard models and are the only available and relevant challenge models for human LF.","Strategies for producing effective coronavirus vaccines have focussed on expression of either the spike protein or nucleocapsid proteins or, in some cases a combination of both, in a range of vectors including rabies viruses, VSV and VEE (reviewed in99,100). A report from a recent workshop in Riyadh on countermeasures for MERS CoV bringing together funders, public health experts and researchers concluded that progress with vaccine development is still hindered by the lack of animal models for evaluating efficacy.100 Small animals do not naturally express a functional form of the dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) receptor; however, transgenic mice expressing human DPP4 are susceptible to infection.101,102 Despite this advance, mouse models are likely to be less useful for the assessment of immune correlates than larger animal models such as rhesus macaques and common marmosets, which exhibit the severe clinical syndromes observed in humans.103,104 MVA and ChAd viral vectors for MERS have reached GMP manufacture, while a DNA vaccine is now being tested in clinical trials.105,106"],"title":["2019-nCoV (Wuhan virus), a novel Coronavirus: Human-to-human transmission, travel-related cases, and vaccine readiness","Is there an ideal
