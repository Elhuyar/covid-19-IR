E1 All data were reviewed at the EMNet Coordinating Center (Boston, Mass), and site investigators were queried about missing data and discrepancies identified by manual data checks. In addition to the clinical data, blood and nasopharyngeal airway samples were collected within 24 hours of hospitalization and stored at 2808C using standardized protocols. E1 Nasopharyngeal samples were analyzed for 17 respiratory pathogens using real-time PCR assays E4 as well as for microbiota using 16S rRNA gene sequencing at Baylor College of Medicine (Houston, Tex).","On the basis of the historical nomenclature procedure, I suggest to establish a standardized nomenclature process for coronaviruses. One approach may be to name the new coronavirus under the four existing genus, i.e. \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3, and \u03b4. [3] For example, the current new name suggested This nomenclature is controversial. Several significant discrepancies between these two viruses should be noted. First, although both viruses may have originated from bats, the intermediate host involved is likely to be different, indicating that the transmission paths are distinct. Second, SARS-CoV results in more than 40% of patients developing severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and 10% patient deaths. [9, 10] In contrast, the new coronavirus only leads to SARS in approximately 10% of cases and 3% cases of death, respectively, [11] [12] [13] including all the cases from Hubei province. Third, treatment regimens or vaccines for SARS are not indicated for the new coronavirus. Altogether, there exist significant differences in transmission, pathogenesis, clinical treatment, and vaccine development between these two viruses.","The decisions and actions of large-scale epidemic prevention and control depend on data support. The development and application of big data will undoubtedly contribute to quickly identifying the spatiotemporal process of epidemic development, prevention and control measures, and the resulting effectiveness. Strategies for gathering and integrating massive geographic and social-spatial information in the face of prevention and control of an epidemic emergency is the most basic problem for subsequent temporal and spatial mining and analysis. Based on the unified geographical framework, this research quickly absorbed and integrated geographical big data, including the WHO data released internationally, daily domestic health and disease control data, professional population health platform data, Tencent location request data, Baidu migration data, microblog text data, patient spatiotemporal trajectory data, international airline data, census data, education enrollment data, land cover data, remote sensing imagery and other multi-source data through statistical data collection, network data mining, API interface connection, and international and domestic data platform exchange. With the support of unified spatial registration, raster-vector transformation, statistical normalization, format transformation, etc., these data were rapidly merged and applied to the spatiotemporal analysis and visualization systems for the COVID-19 epidemic. In this process, due to the weakness of current research on the classification and security management of spatiotemporal big data, it is clear that GIS needs to be developed in the aspects of automatic correlation aggregation of data, historical data tracing, adaptive conversion of heterogeneous data, and standardized storage of multi-source data.","Dag Harmsen (Universit\u00e4tsklinikum M\u00fcnster, M\u00fcnster, Germany) opened the session by giving an overview of concepts and available software tools for rapid HTS analysis in clinical and public health microbiology. He elaborated on the current switch from traditional typing tools, which are standardized and broadly used but provide only partial information, to more complete genome-wide approaches [23] . Genomebased approaches promise to increase the capacity to discriminate isolate genotypes to its theoretical maximum, providing possibilities that have been lacking thus far, e.g. for outbreak investigation. This change in scale not only refines the resolution of microbial characterization, but also opens up novel opportunities, such as identifying individual transmission events [24, 36] . The challenges of HTS include the need for development of large storage capacity and databases and for standardization. Various genome-based characterization methods exist, from multi-species to lineage specific ones. The species-specific standard multilocus sequence typing (MLST) approach is expected to remain useful as strain nomenclature is well known and this provides a basis on which to build genome typing approaches [22] .","Matthew W. Gilmour (Diagnostic Services Manitoba, Winnipeg, Canada) discussed \"Real-time genomics for bacterial pathogen surveillance\". He considered the benefits and challenges represented by pathogen genomics to clinical and public health sectors. The speaker also underlined the potential of proteomics to facilitate the investigation of outbreaks. An integrated network coordinating the monitoring, assessment, investigation, outbreak response and recovery with standardized genomic analyses and unified laboratory workflows was envisioned.","Much confusion abounds in the therapeutic tactics employed in COVID-19. It is imperative that a structured approach to clinical phenotyping be undertaken to distinguish the phase where the viral pathogenicity is dominant versus when the host inflammatory response overtakes the pathology. In this editorial we propose a clinical staging system to establish a standardized nomenclature for uniform evaluation and reporting of this disease, to facilitate therapeutic application and evaluate response. We propose the use of a 3-stage classification system, recognizing that COVID-19 illness exhibits three grades of increasing severity which correspond with distinct clinical findings, response to therapy and clinical outcome (Figure) .","MIoT can also be used for the prevention and control of COVID-19. We can establish a three-level linkage nCapp system based on the medical theory and technology of the IoT to diagnose and treat COVID-19. The IoT nCapp cloud medical system platform contains the basic functions of the IoT and has a core graphics processing unit (GPU). Cloud computing systems connected to existing electronic medical records, image archiving, and picture archiving and communication can better assist in deep mining and intelligent diagnosis. The ten functions of the IoT (Table 1 ) are considered beneficial time assistance, supervision, and control of medical quality. [15] [16] [17] [18] Among them, the functions of online monitoring, location tracking, alarm linkage, and follow-up scheduling are conducive to online discovery, monitoring, management, and treatment assistance for COVID-19. Plan management, remote maintenance, command management, and statistical decision-making functions can expand the massive information mining of COVID-19 and complete management and timely treatment of COVID-19 by applying preset guidelines or standardized criteria. Security privacy and online upgrade functions are nCapp guarantee that can ensure the normal operation of the IoT cloud plus terminal system. It can also assist in asking questions; registering patients' details; coordinating with patients, community doctors, and experts; and providing safe diagnosis treatment programs and two-way referrals (Fig. 1) .","To efficiently cope with the 2019-nCoV outbreak, the Chinese Government has implemented rapid and comprehensive public health emergency interventions. To date, all of the 31 provincial-level regions in mainland China with confirmed 2019-nCoV cases have activated socalled level 1 public health emergency responses (ie, the highest level of emergency public health alerts and responses within the national public health management system). 6 The provincial governments are responsible for organising, coordinating, and handling all emergency public health treatments, disclosing information, and gathering emergency materials and facilities under the guidance of the State Council. For health-care sectors, in addition to public health interventions, dealing with public psychological barriers and performing psychological crisis intervention is included in the level 1 response. The National Health Commission has released guidelines for local authorities to promote psychological crisis intervention for patients, medical personnel, and people under medical observation during the 2019-nCoV outbreak. 7 Peking University is preparing a mental health handbook for the public that describes how to deal with stress and other psychological problems occurring due to the outbreak of 2019-nCoV. 8 The Chinese Government strives to improve the public's awareness of prevention and intervention strategies by providing daily updates about surveillance and active cases on websites and social media. Increasingly, psychologists and psychiatrists use the internet and social media (eg, WeChat, Weibo, etc) to share strategies for dealing with psychological stress. For example, experts from Peking University Sixth Hospital made six suggestions for the public to cope with mental stress. 9 These included assessing the accuracy of information disclosed, enhancing social support systems (eg, families and friends), eliminating stigma associated with the epidemic, maintaining a normal life under safe conditions, and using the psychosocial service system, particularly telephone-based and internet-based counselling for health-care staff, patients, family members, and the public. Numerous psychiatric hospitals, psychological counselling centres, and psychology departments within universities have launched specialised hotlines to provide psychological counselling services for people in need. 7 We believe that including mental health care in the national public health emergency system will empower China and the world during the campaign to contain and eradicate 2019-nCoV.","Stefan Niemann (National Reference Centre for Mycobacteria, Borstel, Germany) reported on genomic epidemiology studies of tuberculosis (TB). Understanding transmission is crucial for control of TB, a major public health issue that accounts for nine million cases per year worldwide. Among these, approximately 0.5 million cases are caused by multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB). HTS is particularly suited to longitudinal epidemiological study of TB due to the high genetic homogeneity of M. tuberculosis. Estimated times and patterns of divergence of M. tuberculosis lineages mirror those of human mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and the 'Out-of-Africa' model of evolution of modern human populations [7] . HTS can also be applied to estimate the efficacy of therapy and to track global spread of strains and transmission dynamics. S. Niemann concluded his talk by stressing the urgency of integrated standardized tools, including databases and nomenclature, if NGS is to become a standard in clinical microbiology laboratories.","Currently, there are no standardized nomenclature guidelines for coronaviruses. Looking back in history, the first two human coronaviruses (HCoVs) were named after 229E and OC43. In recent years, two seasonal HCoVs have been named NL63 and HKU1 according to the country (e.g., NL = the Netherlands) or the organization (e.g., HKU = Hong Kong University) in which they were identified. The two highly pathogenic viruses, i.e., SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), were named primarily according to the key features of disease caused. [3] The genomic sequences of the new coronavirus are distinct from those of SARS-CoV (approximately 79% identity). [4] Most individuals (approximately 80%) infected with 2019-nCoV develop mild or moderate symptoms and signs and asymptomatic individuals may also be infectious. [5, 6] These may make it hard to control the epidemic. It is highly possible that COVID-19 will eventually evolve into a seasonal epidemic. Thus, the virus causing COVID-19 is largely different from SARS-CoV. To avoid conceptual confusion and considerable public fear associated with SARS, the new coronavirus should not be named SARS-CoV-2.","Genotyping of measles viruses to monitor the elimination process of the disease S. Santibanez, A. Wolbert, A. Mankertz, A. Siedler, D. Burki, A. Tischer (Berlin, DE; Basel, CH) WHO has set the goal for elimination of measles in the European Region by the year 2010. A very low incidence of measles (&lt; 1 case per 1 Mio population and year) and an absence of endemic transmission have to be achieved. This implies that the transmission of indigenous measles virus (MV) has been interrupted and that an imported MV can not establish long-term circula-tion. Therefore, the level of measles susceptibility in the population has to be kept as low as possible by maintaining very high immunization coverage (&gt; 95%) with two doses of measles vaccine. Genetic data of the detected MVs are essential to trace the pathway of the virus transmission. This information is required to discriminate whether local appearance of measles is due to virus importation or if it reflects a still ongoing circulation of an indigenous virus. The standardized nomenclature for genotyping of MVs, introduced by the WHO in 1998, enables description of MV circulation in a global context. At present, 23 distinct MV genotypes are recognized by the WHO. Experience shows that in countries with an area-wide and continuous monitoring of measles, the level of incidence correlates with the pattern of MV genotypes. This can be demonstrated for Germany where a laboratory supported nation-wide measles sentinel was established in 1999. Genotyping data over a period of &gt; 6 years revealed that the few sporadic cases observed recently in the eastern part were mainly caused by imported MVs (genotypes B3, D4, D5, G2, H1, B2). In contrast, in the western part, endemic transmission has been observed until 2002. It was associated with the MV genotypes C2, D6 and the newly emerged D7. In 2003, endemic transmission was tapering off and in 2004, measles occurred only sporadically. The nation-wide incidence of measles decreased from 7.3 in 2001 7.3 in to 0.2 in 2004 7.3 in . However, in 2005 , local outbreaks occurred in the federal states of Hesse and Bavaria. The Hesse outbreak was due to importation of a D4 MV from Romania where an epidemic has been observed since the last quarter of 2004. The origin of the D6 MV that caused the Bavarian outbreak, however, remains unknown. The observation of two independent outbreaks demonstrates that despite the decline of measles incidence in recent years, the potential for a limited circulation of MV is still present in Germany. A study performed in Switzerland from 2003 onwards also indicates absence of endemic transmission. Imported MVs (genotypes D5, D8, D4) were predominantly detected and some could even establish limited circulation in 2003. This corresponds with the incidence of measles that remarkably increased from 0.8 in the years 2001/2002 to 10.2 in 2003 and decreased again to 0. 8 in 2004/ 2005 . Our studies demonstrate that for assessment of the level achieved in the process of measles elimination, it is essential to combine both MV genotype information and epidemiological data, even in the WHO European Region where the circulation of the former widespread MV genotypes may be interrupted in many countries, but nonetheless continues in some other countries.","Results: We could screen 12.4% (41/329) positive samples by PCR based method while this rate was 4.5% (15/329) for Adenolex assay. Moreover, all adenolex detected types were only Ead 41 but PCR-based assay could not only identify up to 21 samples of Ead41, but also by application of this PCR method, Ead 31, 7 and 40 were detected in 8, 2 and one stool samples respectively. We could also identify 2 specimens belonging to both genus C or D and one to genus E. Seven other positive samples were not processed for typing. Conclusion: Prevalence rate of Ead in Iranian children with acute diarrhoea might be higher (&gt;12.4%) than previously reported data (6.7%) which was based on application of commercial serologic assay. The reasons behind this difference may be new emerging types and mutants of Ead in different geographic regions and inability of most commercial assays to detects serotypes other than 40 and 41. Finally, despite the general anticipation that type 40 and 41 are considered for cause of most childhood gastroenteritis, our results indicated that types 41, 31 and 7 were the most frequently found Eads in Iranian children with acute diarrhoea. Objectives: Trichoderma spp. are known as cosmopolitan soil inhabiting filamentous fungi. Certain members of the genus are emerging as causative agents of opportunistic infections in humans. Here we present the discriminatory power of different phenetic and phylogenetic approaches applied for the taxonomic characterization of clinical Trichoderma isolates. Methods: Twelve clinical Trichoderma isolates were involved in the experiments. Molecular phylogenetic analysis was performed for the sequences of the internal transcribed spacer 1 and 2 (ITS1 and 2) regions of the rDNA cluster and for the 4th large intron of the gene encoding translation elongation factor 1-alpha (tef1). RFLP patterns of mtDNA were generated by BsuRI and Hin6I. Phenotype profiles were examined by isoenzyme analysis of 7 enzyme systems with cellulose-acetate electrophoresis (CAE) and by carbon source utilization arrays performed on BIOLOG FF microplates. Results: Based on morphological characters, the 12 clinical Trichoderma isolates were originally identified as members of 3 species from section Longibrachiatum: T. longibrachiatum (5), T. pseudokoningii (3), T. citrinoviride (1); and 2 species from section Trichoderma: T. viride (2) and T. koningii (1). However, the ITS barcode identification by TrichOKEY 1.0 (www.isth.info) revealed that all of them belong to the triplet of species T. longibrachiatum/Hypocrea orientalis/ H. cerebriformis. Phylogenetic analysis of tef1 sequences shows that 11 strains belong to the clade of T. longibrachiatum, while one is attributed to H. orientalis. The examination of further, non-clinical isolates indicated that the tef1 marker clearly separates these two species. RFLP of mtDNA revealed 7 and 10 different patterns with BsuRI and Hin6I, respectively, resulting in 4 groups on the dendrogram, while CAE separated the strains into 4 distinct electrophoretic types. BIOLOG Phenotype Microarrays were performed for all clinical and a series of non-clinical isolates from several closely related species. Comparisons were done at 9 time points and at 3 temperatures in order to detect possible physiological shifts specific for clinical isolates. Conclusions: Our results support that fungal opportunists belonging to the genus Trichoderma are restricted almost exclusively to section Longibrachiatum. Besides sequence analysis, the methods of CAE, mtDNA RFLP and BIOLOG Phenotype Microarrays proved also appropriate for the characterization of clinical Trichoderma strains. Objectives: SeqNet.org is an initiative of currently 28 laboratories from 20 European countries in order to establish a European network of excellence for sequence based typing of microbial pathogens. The principle goal of SeqNet.org is to establish unambiguous, electronic portable, easily comparable typing data for local infection control and national and European surveillance of sentinel microorganisms. Here, we describe (i) the harmonization of sequencing methods for sequence based typing, (ii) the capacity building for DNA sequencing in diagnostic microbiology, and (iii) the certification trail for sequencebased typing of MRSA. Methods: After the 'kick-off' meeting in M\u00fc nster, Germany (November 2004), the participants received a protocol for typing of MRSA by Staphylococcus aureus protein A gene (spa) typing. Subsequent, five strains, 5 DNAs, and 5 forward and reverse chromatogram files of representative and well characterized MRSA strains were distributed to all participating laboratories to be typed until the end of 2005. The typing results were analysed and synchronized with the central server by using the Ridom StaphType software. Results: All participating European laboratories built up capacities for sequence-based typing and established the spa typing method for typing of MRSA in the laboratories. Until today, the typing results for the certification trial were submitted by 24 of the participating laboratories. Each laboratory determined 2,783 bp (range, 206-422 bp per strain) and all participants reported exactly the same spa type for each of the analysed isolates and for the additional 5 chromatograms. Therefore, the intra-and inter-laboratory reproducibility of the sequencing results was 100% each. Online synchronization of the results proved the rapid exchange of high quality typing data based on nucleotide sequencing. Conclusion: The SeqNet.org initiative enables laboratories European-wide to build up capacity for sequence-based methods. The spa typing results proved the unambiguous and highly reproducible nature and high portability of sequence data. The usage of a standardized nomenclature based on the software enabled an easy exchange of data. Enteroviruses are associated with a wide variety of diseases in humans and are responsible for summer outbreaks of acute meningitis in both children and adults. After the last and large meningitis outbreak in 2000, enteroviruses continued to be isolated until April 2005 and a virus alert from the French Health Ministry was declared in June because of the increasing number of occurring meningitis cases. Objectives: Genetic typing of enteroviruses by sequencing of a specific PCR-based amplified portion of the genome (the VP1 encoding sequence) followed by phylogenetic analysis, for identifying viruses isolated in patients hospitalised during the year 2005. Methods: Viruses were isolated in patients hospitalised in Clermont-Ferrand (n = 38) and Paris-H\u00f4 pital Trousseau (n = 16). They were recovered from 48 patients with meningitis (positive RT-PCR in cerebrospinal fluid specimens, n = 44) and 6 patients with cardiac manifestations (n = 2), sudden infant death syndrome (n = 1), neonatal infection (n = 1), hand-foot-and-mouth disease (n = 1) and pharyngitis (n = 1). A genetic typing method relying on the PCR amplification and sequencing of the complete VP1 sequence was designed with three sets of species specific primers. Virus identification was done by sequence comparisons (BLAST search) with enterovirus sequences in Genbank and was confirmed by phylogenetic analysis with the VP1 sequences of the enterovirus prototype strains. Results: Virus isolates were identified in all patients with only one set of primers. All viruses were assigned to 11 different types within the Human Enterovirus B species by BLAST search and phylogenetic analysis confirmed the identification in all cases. In patients with meningitis (n = 48), echovirus 30 (E30) was involved in 25 cases (52 %). The other types were E18 (n = 5), E13 (n = 5), coxsackievirus B5 (CB5, n = 4), CB3 (n = 3), E6 (n = 2) and E11, E33, E7 and E4 (each n = 1). In patients with other symptoms, 3 types were observed CB5, CB3 and E3 (each n = 2). CB5 and CB3 were associated with cardiac manifestations and other symptoms. Among patients with an E30 infection, four different virus variants were evidenced by the phylogenetic analysis. Conclusions: Genetic typing allowed the prospective identification of all isolates more effectively and rapidly than seroneutralization tests used during the 2000 outbreak in Clermont-Ferrand. E30 persists as the major type involved in meningitis despite it co-circulated with other enteroviruses in both outbreaks. Objectives: Brucellosis is one of the most important and widespread zoonotic diseases. Therefore, rapid and unambiguous assays for the detection of Brucella species are essential. Here we describe a novel SNP based assay that can speciate Brucella isolates into their six classically recognised species. Previously, molecular approaches to speciation have been hampered by the homogeneity of the genus that has made identification of species-specific markers difficult. The SNP assay described here was developed to overcome the problems presented by this genetic homogeneity as well as mitigating the need for classical culture based biotyping which is both laborious and time consuming. Methods: Several housekeeping genes were sequenced from a large number of Brucella isolates. This sequence data was analysed and a number of stable single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were identified that appeared to unambiguously define the six classically recognised members of the genus Brucella. Using the primer extension approach to SNP detection a single-tube multiplex assay was developed which incorporated six SNP interrogation primers. Results: To date more than 400 culturally confirmed isolates have been correctly identified using this assay. These included 73 isolates from human blood cultures that encompassed the pathogenic species B. melitensis, B. suis and B. abortus. The SNP multiplex assay can be used to rapidly and clearly differentiate between the six Brucella species. Conclusion: In comparison to current molecular based assays this approach is all encompassing and will identify members of all currently recognised biovars within Brucella species. Future objectives involve the inclusion of additional SNPs to facilitate higher resolution beyond the species level. Objectives: Current Multi Locus Sequence Typing (MLST) methods do not offer an automated, fast, and accurate workflow for determining allelic profiles and sequence types of bacteria and other microorganisms. The current manual workflow can take a researcher about 4-5 hours of analysis time alone to determine the allelic profile for one bacterial sample. With our new workflow, we will show an example of S. aureus typing that significantly reduces this analysis time. Methods: The following seven housekeeping genes were used in the MLST experiments: carbamate kinase (arcC), shikimate dehydrogenase (aroE), glycerol kinase (glpF), guanylate kinase (gmk), phosphate acetyltransferase (pta), triosephosphate isomerase (tpi), and acetyl coenzyme A acetyltransferase (yqiL) as specified by the MLST web site (www.mlst.net). The genes were amplified using two sets of primers. One set of primers were derived from the MLST website, while the second set are the same MLST primers tailed with )21 M13 Forward or M13 Reverse primers. The samples were sequenced using the Applied Biosystems 3130 Series Genetic Analyzers, BigDye\u00d2 Terminator v1.1 Cycle Sequencing kit and automated data analysis and library matching with SeqScape\u00d2 Software v2.5. Results: For our experiments, we accurately determined the sequence types for eight unknown samples provided by M. Langvik. These samples were used in epidemiological studies. The use of M13-tailed MLST Primers, instead of the MLST primers for the sequencing reaction, gave more uniformed results and significantly streamlined the sequencing workflow. Furthermore, automated analysis between the 3130 Data Collection v3.0 with SeqScape\u00d2 Software v2.5 significantly reduced the time to analyse and type the alleles for each sample of several S. aureus strains. With minimal sequence checking, the sequence type of each bacterial sample was obtained in 5 minutes or less. Conclusion: The sequence types of eight unknown S. aureus samples were correctly determined using SeqScape Software. The amount of time to analyse the samples was fast and accurate, eliminating laborious manual sequence checking, trimming, alignment and allelic typing. This workflow will help enable researchers to accurately determine sequence types quickly for all pathogens, bacteria, and other organisms.","Data quality and safety will be monitored by each site's PI, the study Medical Coordinating Center (MCC) and a Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB). The site PIs will continuously monitor the data quality according to data quality measures. In addition, recruitment rate, deviation from inclusion/exclusion criteria and protocol, and confidentiality of data and database will be monitored. A DSMB, drawing from persons with expertise in the area will be constituted.","Data monitoring Data will be monitored by the principal investigator (PI) in collaboration with an independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB). PI, and DSMB will monitor adverse events and quality of the data and provide recommendations. The PI will monitor compliance to safety rules every 20 patients. Every violation will be reported to the DSMB. Peripheral centers will be provided with a data sheet providing safety rules and will be instructed to report every violation to the coordinating hospital. Before the beginning of the study, the DSMB will meet to decide safety rules and stopping guidelines.","Harms. Organ failure, prolonged hospitalization and mortality will be recorded as part of the study defined outcomes. Other adverse events will be monitored by the site PI and research specialist in real time from the start of randomization to hospital discharge or death. Reportable adverse events will include hemodynamic change and deterioration of oxygenation related to NO inhalation and require the adjustment of NO concentration. A serious adverse event in this study will be defined as a reportable adverse event that is fatal, life-threatening, or permanently disabling. All adverse events will be indicated on the data forms for the study and on the specific adverse event report forms and all serious adverse events will be reported to the site IRB within 48 hours of the research team learning about the event followed by more detailed written report to the local IRB. The following information about adverse events will be collected: 1) the onset and resolution of the event, 2) an assessment of the severity or intensity of the event, 3) an assessment of the relationship of the event to the intervention, and 4) any action taken because of event. Sites will inform the principle investigators (CL and LB) at the coordinating centers (Xijing Hospital and Massachusetts General Hospital) for any related adverse events directly caused by inhalation of NO (non-serious) within 14 days of discovery. All fatal, life-threatening, or permanently disabling (regardless of relatedness) events due to inhalation of NO must be reported to the coordinating centers within 48 hours of discovery. The principle investigators will report these events to the DSMB and to the coordinating centers IRBs.","The application of molecular typing methods to relevant public health pathogens has become deeply integrated into infection control strategies as an aid in understanding the introduction and spread of pathogens at the local, national and international levels. Clinical microbiologists and public health specialists clearly recognize the need for greater investment in whole genome sequencing. The first talk of the session entitled \"Implementing whole genome sequencing: early experiences from a Salmonella Reference Laboratory\" by Kathie Grant (PHE, Colindale, UK) offered a first insight into a switch from conventional, standardized methods to HTS, taking Salmonella as an example. In the face of the &gt;1500 existing S. enterica serovars, serotyping as well as molecular typing methods such as PFGE are unsatisfactory due to technical issues and their limitations in recovering phylogenetic relationships. As it was shown that MLST is a desirable alternative to serotyping [1] , HTS was tested for applicability within current routine services. Clearly, this approach provides more information than conventional typing methods, revealing information about the presence of virulence factors, antimicrobial genes and SNPs. Although the speaker expressed optimism that HTS can be performed routinely in parallel with conventional typing methods, she also stressed that application and interpretation have to be extensively validated and standardized.","The nomenclature used to describe different blood groups and types can be confusing, as these terms are used interchangeably. The nomenclature used in this article is the feline AB blood group system (comprising of types A, B and AB), and","A number of surveillance systems currently exist, as well as a few initiatives to create an inter-operable network of coordinating systems. We discuss one of these surveillance systems and two of the initiatives under way. The Real-Time Outbreak and Disease Surveillance (RODS) system [23] [24] [25] is a syndromic surveillance system developed in the RODS Laboratory at the University of Pittsburgh. A syndromic surveillance system is designed to identify outbreaks based on reported symptoms that precede a diagnosis [26] . In the RODS system, data is collected from patients' chief complaints during emergency department visits, as well as patient registration at acute care clinics. After removing patient identifying information, the data is automatically sent to the RODS system using a Health Level-7 (HL7) message. The RODS HL7 listener parses this message and routes it to a Bayesian text classifier, which assigns it to a syndromic category. The data is then stored in the database for other applications to use. This data can then be analyzed to detect disease and bioterrorism outbreaks. The RODS system is deployed within several health systems in the United States.","Another noteworthy point is the public gathering events. Since the epidemic is overlapped with the Chinese Lunar New Year, public gathering events such as banquet of one thousand families in Wuhan could promote the spread of the epidemic. By adding a small turbulence (5%) in transmission parameter \u03b1 on Jan 20 th , 2020, 4,194 more people would be infected at the end point, which indicated the public gathering events at the early period of the epidemic should be stopped. Thus, the Chinese government prohibited the public gathering events with policies such as close large public places, extend the winter holiday for both staff and students. It is noted that, Japan and Koran also organized public gathering activities such as marathons, sacrifices activities, and rally in early February, 2020, which would be inconducive to the prevention and control of the epidemic.","Methods: This multicentre trial tested SPN strains using an investigative use only (IUO) card (SPCA3) containing ERT, GAR, and TEL. Test cards were inoculated from a standard inoculum for each SPN strain. Challenge (80 isolates), reproducibility (34 isolates), and quality control (SPN ATCC 49619) isolates were tested by automatic and manual dilution using the SPCA3 IUO card. The 311 clinical isolates were tested by automatic dilution. Broth microdilution reference testing was assayed on each challenge, quality control and clinical isolate from the same standard inoculum used for the SPCA3 cards. Reproducibility tests were performed in triplicate daily for three days. Twenty replicate tests of SPN ATCC 49619 were performed at each site for quality control. Results: Essential agreement for all 311 clinical isolates was &gt;99.7%, while category agreement was 95.5%, 98.7%, and 99.7% for ERT, GAR, and TEL, respectively. Best-case reproducibility results revealed an essential agreement of 100% and &gt;99.6% for the automatic and manual dilution, respectively, of ERT, GAR, and TEL. QC in-range results for the SPCA3 card were &gt;98.5% for all three antibiotics. Essential agreement for automatic and manual dilution method challenge experiments was &gt;97.5% for ERT, GAR, and TEL. No very major errors were observed. Conclusions: This evaluation provides convincing evidence that the performance of antimicrobial susceptibility tests for ERT, GAR, and TEL on the VITEK\u00d22 platform is comparable to conventional testing in a clinical laboratory. typing (MLST), SCCmec typing, antimicrobial susceptibility testing, and PCR for detection of Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL) genes. Results: The number of frequently found MRSA in Denmark, Finland and Sweden were 8, 31 and 20, respectively. PVL genes were detected in ten of the isolates (3/8, 1/31, 6/20). The 59 isolates gave 54 indistinguishable PFGE patterns, of which the following five were found in two countries each: (i) UK E15 (UK EMRSA-15, t032, ST22, PVL negative), in Finland and Sweden; (ii) SE98-6a (UK EMRSA-15 variant, t032, ST22, PVL negative), in Finland and Sweden; (iii) SE00-3 (UK EMRSA-16 variant, t019, ST30, PVL positive), in Denmark and Sweden; (iv) SE97-3 (Berlin IV variant, t015, ST45, PVL negative), in Finland and Sweden; (v) SE00-7 (France B variant, t008, ST8, PVL positive) in Denmark and Sweden. Although not indistinguishable, many of the other PFGE patterns were closely related, and most of them belonged to internationally well-known MRSA clones. Conclusion: Many of the frequently found MRSA types in the three Nordic countries were clonally related. However, no single MRSA type was seen in all three countries. The overall result showed national differences and a rather high diversity among the MRSA isolated within this limited geographical region. Objectives: We used several molecular genotyping methods of S. aureusto analyze clonal grouping of the EMRSA strains in Finland with a purpose of renewing their nomenclature. The other objective was to refine the genotyping scheme to better support local outbreak investigations. Methods: Finnish epidemic MRSA strains from years 1991 to 2004 were tested with several molecular genotyping methods. Pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) was used as the primary method to distinguish different EMRSA strains. In addition, multi locus sequence typing (MLST) of seven housekeeping gene alleles, staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec (SCCmec) analysis of mobile methicillin-resistance genetic element (I-V), and spa-typing to identify the polymorphic X-region of protein A of S. aureus were used. The clonal complex analysis based on spa and MLST results was performed by BURP and eBURST programs, respectively. Results: PFGE identified 44 different EMRSA strains. These strains represented all SCCmec elements (I-V). Spa-typing found 27 different spa-types among the 44 EMRSA strains, six of them being new spa-types that were not found previously from the Ridom SpaServer. The spa-types divided into four different clonal complexes and into six singletons. With MLST, we were able to find 20 different allelic profiles and those divided into 15 different clonal complexes. When all typing results were combined, the EMRSA strains clustered into 26 more closely related groups (FIN-1 to FIN-26) based on PFGE, SCCmec, spa-typing and MLST results. MLST and spa-typing results supported and specified clonal groupings of the Finnish EMRSA strains. Conclusion: PFGE can be used as the primary molecular method for naming of MRSA strains in Finland. SSCmec, MLST and spa-typing are needed to verify clonal complexes. Usage of several different molecular typing methods is necessary for accurate nomenclature of MRSA, also in outbreak situations.","As described by Pan et al. [9] the percentage of lesion to lung size was evaluated in particular lobes. This study extended beyond previously described methods [9] by The evaluation of lesion density manually was based on the proportion of three major CT signs, that is, ground glass opacity (GGO), consolidation, and fibrosis, which were judged according to the international standard nomenclature defined by the Fleischner Society glossary [11] and peer-reviewed literature on viral pneumonia [8, 12] . The composition of each CT sign was evaluated on a scale of 0-10, with a sum score of 10. The proportion of GGO, consolidation, and fibrosis was recorded as P GGO , P consolidation , and P fibrosis , respectively.","Effective planning for pandemic influenza and the global vaccine supply will require the skills of experts in virology, epidemiology and vaccination. Equally important, however, will be the skills of experts in politics, economics and law. Coordinating their efforts at an international level will be very difficult. That the task must be undertaken cannot be questioned. Because the health benefits of its success are certain, the challenge it presents is extraordinarily compelling. 5.6. How good are the rapid diagnostic tests really? (Peter Wright, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN and Ruth Karron, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD) Rapid diagnostic tests for respiratory viral illness has become an increasingly important tool because of the advent of effective antiviral agents that are maximally effective if started early in the course of the illness, the need to isolate patients who could pass their infection to other ill patients, and the need to differentiate between these viral illnesses and other respiratory tract pathogens, including bioterrorism agents. However, currently available rapid testing has many limitations. Areas of improvement that need to be addressed include the ability to test for all or most know agents, improved collection methods, improved integration of diagnosis with use of medications and clinical care, use of diagnostics for epidemiology and vaccine development, increased sensitivity in adults and immunocompromised patients, and improved ease and accuracy of testing.","We thank Municipal Centre of Disease Control and Prevention of Qingdao for coordinating data collection for COVID-19 patients in Qingdao. We thank all patients and their families involved in the study. We thank all health-care workers involved in the diagnosis and treatment of patients. And we thank Prof Gary WK Wong for guidance in study design and interpretation of results. author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.","Impact of public gathering events. Since the time of the epidemic was overlapped with the Chinese Spring Festival and winter holiday, people were gathering together for celebration during the epidemic time. Thus, public gathering events would frequently happen if no prevention policies were imposed. For example, Wuhan conducted the banquet for ten thousand families on Jan 18 th , 2020 20 , 5 days before the city lockdown. Here, we simulated the impact of public gathering events by increasing the transmission parameter \u03b1 from 5% to 25% in an individual day such as Jan 20 th , 2020.","Biological entity identification is a key step in the literature mining process. To ensure functionality of the extracted entity, we first compared the entity from the subject dictionary with the human official gene symbols in the Hugo Gene Nomenclature Commission (HGNC) database to generate subject candidate genes using standard nomenclature. In addition, the entities in the abstract were capitalized to avoid errors in the identification process. To obtain widely used gene entities that are precisely related to the subject and to determine the significance of the gene distribution in the specific texts, we calculated the difference in the distribution proportions. We searched for the subject candidate genes in the subject dictionary and the randomized control dictionary, respectively. We also counted the number of abstracts containing each subject author/funder. All rights reserved.

The two main variables one needs to consider when one decides to choose such a mask is the filter efficiency and whether it provides an airtight fit around the personnel's mouth and nose. Filter efficiency is tested by assessing the proportion of a 300 nanometer (0.3 microns) aerosol challenge, which is filtered by the device. To understand the nomenclature mentioned in the following Now, the size of coronavirus is around 100 nanometers (0.1 microns) 4 and hence simple mathematics would suggest that these particles would pass through most of these filters, which are tested for a 300nm particle challenge. However, particles smaller than 300nm do not travel in a linear motion but travel in a zig-zag movement as they are bounced randomly by molecules of comprising air (Brownian motion) 2 .","The study was conducted in accordance with the International Coordinating Council for Clinical Trials and the Helsinki Declaration, and was approved by the Hospital Ethics Review Committee (Ethics No 2020PS038K), and the patient's informed consent was exempted.","Biological entity identification is a key step in the literature mining process [7, 8] .

There must also be a continuous means of communication between the temporary holding area and the team coordinating the overall process.","The antiviral activity of interferons against SARS coronavirus has been measured in vitro and interferon beta appears to be particularly active. 17 The World Health Organisation is currently coordinating plans for clinical trials of interferons in the event of re-emergence of the disease. Recommendation None can be given at this time.","To date, the IOC coordinating commission confirmed that the location of the Games would not be modified, nor will any contingency plan for the competition be carried out. The IOC continues to work closely with the World Health Organization (WHO) and persists to analyze the situation of Chinese athletes traveling to qualifying competitions for Tokyo 2020.","\u2022 According to the World Health Organization, the Ministry of Health of Chad has launched an emergency mass\u2013vaccination campaign against yellow fever, following laboratory confirmation of two cases in the country in December 2012. The campaign is supported by the Chad\u2019s Ministry of Health, the International Coordinating Group on Yellow Fever Vaccine Provision (YF\u2013ICG11), and GAVI Alliance. (PANA, 14 Feb 2013)","The enzyme is only very weakly inhibited by puromycin (see Distinguishing Features). Based on such inhibitory data, a selective enzyme assay for mAAP has been devised (Gillespie et al., 1992) . A new range of potent and selective inhibitors of mAAP have been described based on derivatives of 3-amino-2-tetralone (Schalk et al., 1994) , some of which exhibit K x values in the nanomolar range. The proposed mode of binding of these compounds is as bidentate ligands with the amino and carbonyl functions coordinating to the active-site zinc. Highly potent and selective mAAP inhibitors have been designed, which utilize phosphinic compounds that mimic the transition state of substrates of the enzyme (Chen et al., 1999) . Prodrugs of dual inhibitors of the two enkephalin-degrading enzymes, mAAP and neprilysin, also based on a phosphinic acid design, are highly effective as anti-nociceptive compounds (Chen et al., 2001) .","We applied a standard approach for tokenization, lemmatization and part-of-speech tagging to preprocess the biomedical texts. We also removed the following words to get the clean corpus: 1) punctuation; 2) digits; 3) special characters; 4) words that appeared fewer than 5 times in the corpus; 5) useless words from text collection, including coordinating conjunctions, cardinal numbers, prepositions, pronouns and so on; 6) common terms in scientific articles, e.g., 'method'","Diagnostic tests for 2019-nCoV are already available internationally. As a marker of global forward planning, the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium has prepared standard forms and these were used to record data in the Lancet report on initially affected patients [5] . The ECDC and the WHO Regional Office for Europe are coordinating the rapid reporting of data [9] . Public health measures in place in China since late January include bans on travel from the city of Wuhan, with overall 15 cities -a population of 57 million -under full or partial travel lockdown [11] , major sporting events cancelled and gatherings banned, including for weddings and birthdays, and limits on how many family members can leave home each day. On 28th January 2020, Hong Kong announced closure of many border crossings with mainland China [8] . USA, Japan, Russia and Australia and many other countries have now closed their borders to arrivals from China. Checks are now in place at many international airports for symptoms and fever in travelers from China, with international 14 day quarantine for travellers at risk. With remarkable speed, new 10 0 0 bed containment hospital for suspected coronavirus cases was built and opened in Wuhan on 3rd February and a further new 1500 bed hospital is under construction.","To overcome inconsistency in categorizing antimicrobial resistance across countries, the European Committee for Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) operating under the joint auspices of ECDC and the European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases has developed standard methods and nomenclature and advocated their use for in vitro AST of bacteria and fungi of medical interest. They have published evidence-based criteria for categorization of clinical isolates as wild-type/non-wild phenotype or clinically susceptible/resistant to antimicrobial agents (35). In 2012, EU case definitions enforced the EUCAST clinical breakpoints for surveillance of antimicrobial resistance in humans (6). Between 2011 and 2015, use of EUCAST breakpoints has rapidly progressed in clinical microbiology laboratories across Europe (36). The percentage of EU clinical laboratories reporting to the ECDC coordinated European Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance Network (EARS-Net) which are using EUCAST susceptibility breakpoints increased from 29 to 84% over this 5-year period (37, 38). Likewise, the percentage of national reference laboratories participating in the ECDC coordinated European Gonococcal Antimicrobial Surveillance Programme (Euro-GASP) that use EUCAST breakpoints increased from 62 to 85% from 2014 to 2016 (12, 39). This harmonization across laboratories, encouraged by ECDC, improves the quality of surveillance of antimicrobial resistance in Europe.","Apart from disease, geography and the organism from which a given virus was isolated also dominate the nomenclature, occasionally engraving connections that may be accidental (rather than typical) or even stigmatizing, which should be avoided. Establishing a universal nomenclature for viruses was one of the major tasks of the ICTV when it was founded more than 50 years ago 4 . When the species rank was established in the taxonomy of viruses 6 , ICTV's responsibility for naming viruses was shifted to naming and establishing species. ICTV Study Groups may also be involved in virus naming on a case-by-case basis as an extension of their official remit, as well as using the special expertise of their members. As virus species names are often very similar to the name of the founding member of the respective species, they are frequently confused in the literature with names of individual viruses in this species. The species name is italicized, starts with a capital letter and should not be spelled in an abbreviated form 7 ; hence the species name Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus. In contrast, this convention does not apply to virus names, hence severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, or SARS-CoV, as it is widely known.","In the study, we involved the measures including personal protection, isolation-and-quarantine, gathering restriction, and community containment. We combined these measures to form various joint intervention strategies. Four joint interventions were formulated: program A: personal protection and isolation-and-quarantine, program B: gathering restriction and isolation-and-quarantine, program C: personal protection and community containment, program D: personal protection, isolation-and-quarantine, and gathering restriction. We compared different single and joint strategies versus no-interventions.","Slow wave, segmental, and peristaltic contractions of the SI are generated by the coordinated contraction of smooth muscle in response to spontaneous electrical activity. [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] Interstitial cells of Cajal are considered coordinating/pacemaker cells and smooth muscle contraction is also modulated by coordinated neurohumoral and neurochemical molecule release. Many of these molecules are also involved in the regulation of intestinal secretion and absorption and the mucosal immune response, producing a complex coordinated process for the digestion of food.","Items for data abstraction included guideline scope, target audience, guideline development methods, recommendations, and level of evidence for reach recommendation. A standardized data abstraction form was developed. Prior to data abstraction, a calibration exercise was completed by 2 team members independently. Following successful completion of the calibration exercise, included guidelines were abstracted by single reviewers.","The World Health Organization responded admirably to the SARS epidemic, taking international leadership in addressing questions to the public, coordinating scientific investigations, and quickly reporting all new advances from the laboratory and field epidemiological studies (15) . There is no question that WHO emerged as a global leader in epidemic investigation and control, and their suggestions for management and prevention were quickly respected and adopted. They were especially effective in forging important partnerships with national public health authorities such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, GA, as well as with basic scientific laboratories in Asia, Europe and the Americas.","Risk assessment Potential problems related to dental care include immunosuppression and bleeding tendency. Periapically involved teeth can become a medical emergency. Hence all HSCT candidates should be evaluated and receive dental treatment before immunosuppression to establish a rigorous oral hygiene programme, eliminate dental infections and stabilise carious lesions. This involves working as a part of the multidisciplinary team and coordinating care with the oncologists. For 6 months after HSCT, elective dental care is best deferred. If surgical treatment is needed during that period, antibiotic prophylaxis is probably warranted after medical consultation. After a full recovery, a programme of periodic check-ups is needed.","The recent bioterrorist events and the worldwide outbreaks of highly contagious infectious diseases have evidenced the need for institutional preparedness at each hospital, for identification of referral centers for patient isolation and of laboratories with adequate capabilities. Moreover, hospitals should develop a plan for coordinating all hospital components to respond to critical situations deriving from the admission of patients with highly contagious infectious diseases. In our article, we reviewed the main components of hospital preparedness in the initial response to sporadic or clustered highly contagious diseases, and illustrated the model of the \"Spallanzani\" Institute for copying with the challenge posed by emerging and re-emerging agents.","Public health officials at the SCH, including members of the EPR team, engaged in intensive consultations with WHO and the Health Protection Agency (HPA) in the United Kingdom (UK) over the three days that followed the first confirmed case. The primary purpose of these consultations was to share information including: providing updates on the clinical status of the patient, assessing the potential risk for the spread of the disease, and informing the decisions regarding the national alertness level and appropriate disease control strategies, as based on a set of potential scenarios of how the outbreak could evolve. This action was in accordance with the CERC framework recommendation of coordinating and collaborating with credible sources.","However, we believe that our assay designed for high-throughput molecular testing could be useful in the ongoing outbreak situation. It demonstrates how commercial PCR platforms can enhance outbreak readiness for emerging pathogens, allowing for large numbers of patients to be screened in a reasonable timeframe, if necessary. It has to be noted that by its nature as a screening test targeting only a single viral gene, positive results should always be confirmed with an independent PCR as recommended [4]. Finally, we want to stress the importance of closely coordinating with local reference centres and public health authorities for determining clinical indications for testing, as well as the handling of confirmed cases and contact precautions.","It is imperative to strengthen information sharing and other coordinating mechanisms for health-related humanitarian issues. This includes sharing examples and experiences of preventive and treatment systems, new vaccine and preventive medicine information, means to protect the community from spreading through breaking the line of infection, and also basic awareness on sanitation. Future complexities and uncertainties on global health, along with environmental and societal changes will only increase in the future. The scientific methodologies to deal with uncertainties are being developed and should be utilised further in decision making. As stated in a March 17 editorial in Nature, it is critical to \"Follow World Health Organization advice, end secrecy in decision-making and cooperate globally\" [14] .","11 Create a workflow to provide a clear job description and designation of authority with backup plans. Separate the workflow to minimize cross-contamination. For example, consider dividing the clinical workforce into 2 teams, alternating roles at predefined intervals (such as weekly). One team is on-site and providing direct clinical care. The second team is coordinating clinical care off-site, minimizing risk of exposure and providing back-up coverage if an on-site provider were to become ill or require quarantine. 12 In the staff lounge/eating area, we allow sitting in one direction, thus preventing infection from face-to-face transmission. 13 The bathroom is a potential site of transmission. Ideally patient and staff bathrooms are separated and disinfected frequently.","Once a contagious infectious disease has been identified, the EMICT must consider four main areas of response: data gathering, collaboration, needs assessment, and expert advice [7] . Data gathering includes dissemination of up-to-date case definitions and information about confirmatory tests to all staff with direct patient contact to allow appropriate barrier precautions to be taken. All typical and atypical imaging features of the disease should be made known to all radiologists to assist in recognition of the disease on images and to allow accurate reporting of these findings. We have stored images of all probable cases of COVID-19 in the PACS so that these images were readily available for any radiologist to review, and images from previous imaging studies are also available for comparison.","One of the critical lessons from the SARS experience was the absolute necessity to be able to coordinate the international resources that are available in an outbreak and to get them focussed on identifying priorities and solving problems. The WHO established the means to do this for SARS and it has since been further developed and integrated into global preparedness, especially after the West Africa Ebola epidemic. Organisations such as the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN), the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), the Global Research Collaboration For Infectious Disease Preparedness (GloPID-R) and the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID) have been supported by the WHO Research Blueprint and its Global Coordinating Mechanism to provide a forum where those with the expertise and capacity to contribute to managing new threats can come together both between and during outbreaks to develop innovative solutions to emerging problems. This global coordination has been active in the novel coronavirus outbreak. WHO's response system includes three virtual groups based on those developed for SARS to collate real time information to inform real time guidelines, and a first candidate vaccine is ready for laboratory testing within 4 weeks of the virus being identified.","The immune system is the key defense line for the body to resist and eliminate the virus. In the antiviral immune response, cellular immunity (including T cells and NK cells) plays a central role, while humoral immunity plays a coordinating role. The underlined mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 inflicted harmful effects leading to severe condition or death in COVID-19 patients is the over response against the virus by immune system and large amount of cytokines production (cytokine storm) [13] .

By July 2007, more than 3000 coronavirus sequence records, including 264 complete genomes, are available in GenBank. The number of coronavirus species with complete genomes available has increased from 9 in 2003 to 25 in 2007, of which six, including coronavirus HKU1, bat SARS coronavirus, group 1 bat coronavirus HKU2, groups 2c and 2d coronaviruses, were sequenced by our laboratory. To overcome the problems we encountered in the existing databases during comparative sequence analysis, we built a comprehensive database, CoVDB (http://covdb.microbiology.hku.hk), of annotated coronavirus genes and genomes. CoVDB provides a convenient platform for rapid and accurate batch sequence retrieval, the cornerstone and bottleneck for comparative gene or genome analysis. Sequences can be directly downloaded from the website in FASTA format. CoVDB also provides detailed annotation of all coronavi...","","The present outbreak of a coronavirus-associated acute respiratory disease called coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) is the third documented spillover of an animal coronavirus to humans in only two decades that has resulted in a major epidemic. The Coronaviridae Study Group (CSG) of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses, which is responsible for developing the classification of viruses and taxon nomenclature of the family Coronaviridae, has assessed the placement of the human pathogen, tentatively named 2019-nCoV, within the Coronaviridae. Based on phylogeny, taxonomy and established practice, the CSG recognizes this virus as forming a sister clade to the prototype human and bat severe acute respiratory syndrome coronaviruses (SARS-CoVs) of the species Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus, and designates it as SARS-CoV-2. In order to facilitate communication, the CSG proposes to use the following naming convention for individual isolates: SARS-CoV-2/host/lo...","The last decades have been characterized by the appearance of a substantial number of newly recognized or novel infectious agents and by the re-emergence of infectious diseases with a global impact. The objective of this article is to briefly describe the model of hospital response for early diagnosis and prompt management of patients with highly contagious infectious diseases. We reviewed the main components of hospital preparedness in response to clustering of highly contagious diseases. A model for the initial hospital response to an epidemic in our referral Institute is discussed. Prompt recognition and identification is the initial and indispensable step in facing any communicable diseases, regardless of whether it is a prevalent, a newly emerging one or deliberately released. The importance of developing and implementing nontraditional methods of public health surveillance and a system that allows a wide and immediate dissemination of information and exchange of views on risk ass...","Abstract Only a month after the outbreak of pneumonia caused by 2019-nCoV, more than forty-thousand people were infected. This put enormous pressure on the Chinese government, medical healthcare provider, and the general public, but also made the international community deeply nervous. On the 25th day after the outbreak, the Chinese government implemented strict traffic restrictions on the area where the 2019-nCoV had originated\u2014Hubei province, whose capital city is Wuhan. Ten days later, the rate of increase of cases in Hubei showed a significant difference (p = 0.0001) compared with the total rate of increase in other provinces of China. These preliminary data suggest the effectiveness of a traffic restriction policy for this pandemic thus far. At the same time, solid financial support and improved research ability, along with network communication technology, also greatly facilitated the application of epidemic prevention measures. These measures were motivated by the need to provid...","SUMMARY The French public health institute is responsible for promoting and coordinating threats the detection and assessment of health risks, and for suggesting possible responses. Transmissible diseases affecting both human and animal health are the focus of surveillance networks. Early detection of potential infectious threats is based on the screening of \u201c alert signals \u201c identified through routine surveillance networks and other systems. The quality and accuracy of these signals is first verified, before assessing, through a multidisciplinary approach, the risk of introduction and dissemination. This article examines specific cases illustrating the process of detection, risk analysis and response, with respect to infectious threats that are endemic in tropical regions and have the potential to be imported into metropolitan France. For both novel pathogens and exotic diseases \u2014 which, not being endemic in France, are less well known \u2014 the analysis and response process must regularl...","ABSTRACTOn December 31, 2019, the World Health Organization was notified about a cluster of pneumonia of unknown aetiology in the city of Wuhan, China. Chinese authorities later identified a new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) as the causative agent of the outbreak. As of January 23, 2020, 655 cases have been confirmed in China and several other countries. Understanding the transmission characteristics and the potential for sustained human-to-human transmission of 2019-nCoV is critically important for coordinating current screening and containment strategies, and determining whether the outbreak constitutes a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC). We performed stochastic simulations of early outbreak trajectories that are consistent with the epidemiological findings to date. We found the basic reproduction number, R0, to be around 2.2 (90% high density interval 1.4\u20143.8), indicating the potential for sustained human-to-human transmission. Transmission characteristics appear t...","Abstract Mass gathering (MG) medicine emerged against the backdrop of the 2009 pandemic H1N1 Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) when the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) hosted the largest annual mass gathering of over 3 million pilgrims from 180 plus countries. However, the events surrounding the latest threat to global health, the PHEIC COVID-19, may be sufficient to highlight the role of mass gatherings, mass migration, and other forms of dense gatherings of people on the emergence, sustenance, and transmission of novel pathogens. The COVID-19 spread illustrates the role of MGs in exacerbation of the scope of pandemics. Cancellation or suspension of MGs would be critical to pandemic mitigation. It is unlikely that medical countermeasures are available during the early phase of pandemics. Therefore, mitigation of its impact, rather than containment and control becomes a priority during pandemics. As the most systematically studied MG-related respiratory disease dat...","","Abstract Background: The protocols of WHO network laboratories facilitated development of rapid diagnosis for SARS coronavirus (CoV) using reverse transcription (RT)-PCR assays. However, several reports have shown that conventional and real-time PCR assays were very specific for SARS CoV but lack sensitivity depending on the assay, specimen, and time course of disease. Objective: To evaluate an automatic nucleic acid extraction system and two standardized real-time PCR assays for rapid diagnosis of SARS CoV during outbreak and post-epidemic periods in Hong Kong. Study design: Specimens from clinically suspected SARS patients collected during outbreak and post-epidemic periods were tested by an automatic nucleic acid extraction system followed by our first generation conventional RT-PCR and two standardized real-time PCR assays (Artus GmbH, Germany and Roche Diagnostics, Germany). Paired serum samples were assayed for increasing titer against SARS CoV. Results: In the SARS epidemic, Art...","Background The epidemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 was first reported in Wuhan, China, and now is spreading worldwide. The Chinese government responded to this epidemic with multiple public health policies including locking down the city of Wuhan, establishing multiple temporary hospitals, and prohibiting public gathering events. Here, we constructed a new real-time status dynamic model of SEIO (MH) to reveal the influence of national public health policies and to model the epidemic in Wuhan. Methods A real-time status dynamic model was proposed to model the population of Wuhan in status Susceptible (S), Exposed (E), Infected with symptoms (I), with Medical care (M), and Out of the system (O) daily. Model parameters were fitted according to the daily report of new infections from Jan. 27th, 2020 to Feb. 2nd, 2020. Using the fitted parameters, the epidemic under different conditions was simulated and compared with the current situation. Finding According to our study, the first patient is mos...","Resumen Las crisis sanitarias conmocionan la sociedad y ponen al l\u00edmite los servicios sanitarios. A partir de la experiencia personal de los autores y de las publicaciones al respecto, se analizan algunos aspectos de los \u00faltimos 30 a\u00f1os de crisis sanitarias en Espa\u00f1a desde una m\u00faltiple perspectiva: poblaci\u00f3n, pacientes, cl\u00ednicos, especialistas en salud p\u00fablica (salubristas), pol\u00edticos, periodistas y grupos de inter\u00e9s. Del conjunto y de la interacci\u00f3n de estas partes involucradas depende la respuesta y la gesti\u00f3n de las crisis, tanto en sentido negativo como positivo.

We performed whole genome sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 directly from PCR-positive clinical specimens and conducted a haplotype network analysis of the outbreak. All tested isolates exhibited a transversion at G11083T, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 dissemination on the DP originated from a single introduction event before the quarantine started. Although further spreading might have been prevented by quarantine, some progeny clusters were linked to transmission through mass-gathering events in the recreational areas and direct transmission among passengers who shared cabins during the quarantine. This study demonstrates the usefulness of haplotype network analysis in identifying potential infection routes.","Severe acute respiratory syndrome Covid-19 (SARS-CoV-2) has been declared a worldwide emergency and a pandemic disease by the World Health Organisation (WHO). It started in China in December 2019, and it is currently rapidly spreading throughout Italy, which is now the most affected country after China. There is great attention for the diffusion and evolution of the CoVid-19 infection which started from the north (particularly in the Lombardia region) and it is now rapidly affecting other Italian regions. We investigate on the impact of patients hospitalisation in Intensive Care Units (ICUs) at a regional and subregional granularity. We propose a model derived from well-known models in epidemic to estimate the needed number of places in intensive care units. The model will help decision-makers to plan resources in the short and medium-term in order to guarantee appropriate treatments to all patients needing it. We analyse Italian data at regional level up to March 15th aiming to: (i) s...","Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) has emerged in the Arabian Gulf region, with its epicentre in Saudi Arabia, the host of the \u2018Hajj\u2019 which is the world\u2019s the largest mass gathering. Transmission of MERS-CoV at such an event could lead to its rapid worldwide dissemination. Therefore, we studied the frequency of viruses causing influenza-like illnesses (ILI) among participants in a randomised controlled trial at the Hajj 2013. We recruited 1038 pilgrims from Saudi Arabia, Australia and Qatar during the first day of Hajj and followed them closely for four days. A nasal swab was collected from each pilgrim who developed ILI. Respiratory viruses were detected using multiplex RT-PCR. ILI occurred in 112/1038 (11%) pilgrims. Their mean age was 35 years, 49 (44%) were male and 35 (31%) had received the influenza vaccine pre-Hajj. Forty two (38%) pilgrims had laboratory-confirmed viral infections; 28 (25%) rhinovirus, 5 (4%) influenza A, 2 (2%) adenovirus, 2 (2%) human cor...","Within last 17 years two widespread epidemics of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) occurred in China, which were caused by related coronaviruses (CoVs): SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. Although the origin(s) of these viruses are still unknown and their occurrences in nature are mysterious, some general patterns of their pathogenesis and epidemics are noticeable. Both viruses utilize the same receptor&amp;mdash;angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)&amp;mdash;for invading human bodies. Both epidemics occurred in cold dry winter seasons celebrated with major holidays, and started in regions where dietary consumption of wildlife is a fashion. Thus, if bats were the natural hosts of SARS-CoVs, cold temperature and low humidity in these times might provide conducive environmental conditions for prolonged viral survival in these regions concentrated with bats. The widespread existence of these bat-carried or -released viruses might have an easier time in breaking through human defenses when harsh wi...","AbstractBackgroundThe ongoing outbreak of COVID-19 has spread rapidly and sparked global concern. While the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 through human respiratory droplets and contact with infected persons is clear, the aerosol transmission of SARS-CoV-2 has been little studied.MethodsThirty-five aerosol samples of three different types (total suspended particle, size segregated and deposition aerosol) were collected in Patient Areas (PAA) and Medical Staff Areas (MSA) of Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University (Renmin) and Wuchang Fangcang Field Hospital (Fangcang), and Public Areas (PUA) in Wuhan, China during COVID-19 outbreak. A robust droplet digital polymerase chain reaction (ddPCR) method was employed to quantitate the viral SARS-CoV-2 RNA genome and determine aerosol RNA concentration.ResultsThe ICU, CCU and general patient rooms inside Renmin, patient hall inside Fangcang had undetectable or low airborne SARS-CoV-2 concentration but deposition samples inside ICU and air sample in Fa...","The 2009 influenza A (H1N1) pandemic highlighted the importance of quality hospital care of the severely ill, yet there is evidence that the impact of the 2009 pandemic was highest in low\u2010 and middle\u2010income countries with fewer resources. Recent data indicate that death and suffering from seasonal influenza and severe illness in general are increased in resource\u2010limited settings. However, there are limited clinical data and guidelines for the management of influenza and other severe illness in these settings. Life\u2010saving supportive care through syndromic case management is used successfully in high\u2010resource intensive care units and in global programs such as the Integrated Management of Childhood Illness (IMCI). While there are a variety of challenges to the management of the severely ill in resource\u2010limited settings, several new international initiatives have begun to develop syndromic management strategies for these environments, including the World Health Organization's Integrated M...","Background A recently developing pneumonia caused by SARS-CoV-2 was originated in Wuhan, China, and has quickly spread across the world. We reported the clinical characteristics of 82 death cases with COVID-19 in a single center. Methods Clinical data on 82 death cases laboratory-confirmed as SARS-CoV-2 infection were obtained from a Wuhan local hospital\u2032s electronic medical records according to previously designed standardized data collection forms. Findings All patients were local residents of Wuhan, and the great proportion of them were diagnosed as severe illness when admitted. Most of the death cases were male (65.9%). More than half of dead patients were older than 60 years (80.5%) and the median age was 72.5 years. The bulk of death cases had comorbidity (76.8%), including hypertension (56.1%), heart disease (20.7%), diabetes (18.3%), cerebrovascular disease (12.2%), and cancer (7.3%). Respiratory failure remained the leading cause of death (69.5%), following by sepsis syndrome/...","Extracts of Echinacea species have been used traditionally in North America for the control of symptoms of colds, influenza, and other diseases, and some of them have become very popular as \u201cherbal medicines\u201d. Recent studies have revealed that preparations derived from certain species and plant parts, but not all of them, possess potent antiviral activities, at non-cytotoxic concentrations, particularly against membrane-containing viruses. Thus all strains of human and avian influenza viruses tested (including a Tamiflu-resistant strain), as well as herpes simplex virus, respiratory syncytial virus, and rhinoviruses, were very sensitive to a standardized Echinacea purpurea preparation. In mechanistic studies the influenza virus-specific hemagglutinin and neuraminidase were inhibited. In addition some extracts displayed anti-inflammatory activity in virus-infected cells, and numerous other effects on the expression of cellular genes. Multiple components, either discrete compounds or mix...","Extracts of Echinacea purpurea (EP, purple coneflower) have been used traditionally in North America for the treatment of various types of infections and wounds, and they have become very popular herbal medicines globally. Recent studies have revealed that certain standardized preparations contain potent and selective antiviral and antimicrobial activities. In addition, they display multiple immune-modulatory activities, comprising stimulation of certain immune functions such as phagocytic activity of macrophages and suppression of the proinflammatory responses of epithelial cells to viruses and bacteria, which are manifested as alterations in secretion of various cytokines and chemokines. These immune modulations result from upregulation or downregulation of the relevant genes and their transcription factors. All these bioactivities can be demonstrated at noncytotoxic concentrations of extract and appear to be due to multiple components rather than the individual chemical compounds th...","Background: Severe ill patients with 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection progressed rapidly to acute respiratory failure. We aimed to select the most useful prognostic factor for severe illness incidence. Methods: The study prospectively included 61 patients with 2019-nCoV infection treated at Beijing Ditan Hospital from January 13, 2020 to January 31, 2020. Prognostic factor of severe illness was selected by the LASSO COX regression analyses, to predict the severe illness probability of 2019-CoV pneumonia. The predictive accuracy was evaluated by concordance index, calibration curve, decision curve and clinical impact curve. Results: The neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) was identified as the independent risk factor for severe illness in patients with 2019-nCoV infection. The NLR had a c-index of 0.807 (95% confidence interval, 0.676-0.38), the calibration curves fitted well, and the decision curve and clinical impact curve showed that the NLR had superior standardized net...","Background Since late December 2019, the outbreak of the novel coronavirus disease, COVID-19, that began in Wuhan, has become endemic in China and more than 100 countries and regions in the world. There is no report about the prevalence of COVID-19 in CML patients untill now. We aimed to describe the clinical course, outcomes of CML patients with COVID-19 and prevalence of COVID-19 in CML patients. Methods In this multi-center survey, cross-sectional survey, observational study, the clinical data of CML patients with COVID-19 in each center were collected. Simultaneously, an online survey was conducted for information about the CML patients under the management at each center by asking the CML patients to complete a questionnaire,from February 15, 2020 to February 21, 2020. The questionnaire includes demographic data, place of residence, smoking status, CML diagnosis and treatment, comorbidities, combined medications, epidemiological history, symptoms(fever, cough, shortness of breath,...","Abstract Context In 2012, the French Infectious Diseases Society (French acronym SPILF) initiated the \u201cCoordination of epidemic and biological risk\u201d (SPILF-COREB - Emergences [SCE]) group to support the readiness and response of healthcare workers (HCWs) to new alerts. Objective To present the SCE group, its functioning, and the main support it provided for frontline HCWs. Methods A multidisciplinary group of heads of infectious disease departments from reference hospitals was created to build a network of clinical expertise for care, training, and research in the field of epidemic and biological risk (EBR). The network developed a set of standardized operational procedures (SOPs) to guide interventions to manage EBR-suspect patients. Results A working group created the SOP aimed at frontline HCWs taking care of patients. Priority was given to the development of a generic procedure, which was then adapted according to the current alert. Five key steps were identified and hierarchized: ...","Background: South Korea was among the first countries to report a case of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) outside of China. As of 22 March, 2020, South Korea reported 8897 confirmed cases of and 104 deaths from COVID-19. Methods: We collected the number of laboratory-confirmed cases and deaths in South Korea from the World Health Organization (as of 21 March, 2020) and case distribution and fatality rates by age from the Korean Center for Disease Control and Prevention (as of 22 March, 2020). We estimated population-level mortality rates by fitting a negative binomial regression model with the number of deaths as the outcome and population by age as an offset. We then calculated the age-standardized death rate (ASDR) based on the current COVID-19 figures and for alternative scenarios of increased prevalence. Findings: The COVID-19 population-level mortality rate (per 100,000 person-years) increased with age: from 0.1 deaths among 30-39 year olds to 9.5 deaths among \u226580 year olds. The ...","Summary Background Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) causes severe community and nosocomial outbreaks. Comprehensive data for serial respiratory viral load and serum antibody responses from patients infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are not yet available. Nasopharyngeal and throat swabs are usually obtained for serial viral load monitoring of respiratory infections but gathering these specimens can cause discomfort for patients and put health-care workers at risk. We aimed to ascertain the serial respiratory viral load of SARS-CoV-2 in posterior oropharyngeal (deep throat) saliva samples from patients with COVID-19, and serum antibody responses. Methods We did a cohort study at two hospitals in Hong Kong. We included patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19. We obtained samples of blood, urine, posterior oropharyngeal saliva, and rectal swabs. Serial viral load was ascertained by reverse transcriptase quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR). Antibody le...","Background: Viral clearance is one important indicator for the recovery of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients. Suboptimal T and B cell responses can delay viral clearance in MERS and SARS patients. The role of leukomonocytes in viral clearance of COVID-19 patients is not yet well defined.Methods: From January 26 to February 28, 2020, an observational study was launched at Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China. We enrolled 25 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients, whose throat-swab specimens were tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection by qRT-PCR. We comprehensively analyzed clinical records, counts of lymphocyte subsets including CD3+, CD4+, CD8+ T cells, B cells and NK cells in the patients who successfully cleared SARS-CoV-2, and compared to those that failed to, after a standardized treatment of 8-14 days. Findings: In 25 enrolled COVID-19 patients, lymphopeniawas a common feature. After the treatment, 14 patients were tested negative for SARS-CoV-2. The patients that clea...","Abstract A diet containing high levels of fruit has been associated with a lowered risk of chronic diseases as, in addition to their vitamin and mineral content, they also contain various compounds with health-protective effects, in particular antioxidant and antiinflammatory compounds. Wild plant species are of interest to the food industry because of their ability to replace synthetic chemicals and nutraceuticals; however, the nutritional, economical, and sociocultural values of some neglected and underutilized natural resources have not yet been fully exploited. Some of these less well-known and underutilized fruits, which have the potential to provide novel sources of health-promoting agents, are presented in this chapter (i.e., Asimina triloba (L.) Dunal, Crataegus azarolus L., Lycium barbarum L., Morus nigra L., and Amelanchier canadensis (L.) Medicus). Underutilized fruits could represent an opportunity for growers to gain access to these special markets where consumers place em...","Background: Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) was first identified in humans in 2012. A systematic literature review was conducted to synthesize current knowledge and identify critical knowledge gaps. Materials and Methods: We conducted a systematic review on MERS-CoV using PRISMA guidelines. We identified 407 relevant, peer-reviewed publications and selected 208 of these based on their contributions to four key areas: virology; clinical characteristics, outcomes, therapeutic and preventive options; epidemiology and transmission; and animal interface and the search for natural hosts of MERS-CoV. Results: Dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4/CD26) was identified as the human receptor for MERS-CoV, and a variety of molecular and serological assays developed. Dromedary camels remain the only documented zoonotic source of human infection, but MERS-like CoVs have been detected in bat species globally, as well as in dromedary camels throughout the Middle East and Africa. Howeve...","Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) has plagued the Middle East since it was first reported in 2012. Recently, at the end of December 2019, a cluster of pneumonia cases were reported from Wuhan city, Hubei Province, China, linked to a wet seafood market with a new coronavirus identified as the etiologic agent currently named SARS-CoV-2. Most cases are in Mainland China with international spread to 25 countries. The novelty of the virus, the rapid national and international spread, and the lack of therapeutic and preventative strategies have led the WHO International Health Regulation emergency committee to declare the disease as Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) on January 30, 2020. As it relates to countries with the ongoing MERS-CoV community cases and hospital acquired infections, there will be a huge challenge for HCWs to deal with both coronaviruses, especially with the lack of standardized and approved point of care testing. This challen...","Background The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was first reported in China, which caused a respiratory disease known as Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). Since its discovery, the virus has spread to over 100 countries and claimed more than 4000 deaths. This study aimed to assess the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of various response public health measures. Method The stochastic agent-based model was used to simulate the process of COVID-19 outbreak in scenario I (imported one case) and II (imported four cases) with a series of public health measures, involving the personal protection, isolation-and-quarantine, gathering restriction, and community containment. The virtual community was constructed following the susceptible-latent-infectious-recovered framework. The epidemiological and economic parameters derived from the previous literature and field investigation. The main outcomes included avoided infectors, cost-effectiveness ratios (CERs), and i...","Background A pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been spreading over the world. However, the viral dynamics, host serologic responses, and their associations with clinical manifestations, have not been well described in prospective cohort. Methods We conducted a prospective cohort and enrolled 67 COVID-19 patients admitting between Jan 26 and Feb 5, 2020. Clinical specimens including nasopharyngeal swab, sputum, blood, urine and stool were tested periodically according to standardized case report form with final follow-up on February 27. The routes and duration of viral shedding, antibody response, and their associations with disease severity and clinical manifestations were systematically evaluated. Coronaviral particles in clinical specimens were observed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Results The median duration of SARS-CoV-2 RNA shedding were 12 (3-38), 19 (5-37), and 18 (7-26) days i...","Up to 25% of patients with profound neutropenia lasting for &gt;10 days develop lung infiltrates, which frequently do not respond to broad-spectrum antibacterial therapy. While a causative pathogen remains undetected in the majority of cases, Aspergillus spp., Pneumocystis jirovecii, multi-resistant Gram-negative pathogens, mycobacteria or respiratory viruses may be involved. In at-risk patients who have received trimethoprim\u2013sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) prophylaxis, filamentous fungal pathogens appear to be predominant, yet commonly not proven at the time of treatment initiation. Pathogens isolated from blood cultures, bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) or respiratory secretions are not always relevant for the etiology of pulmonary infiltrates and should therefore be interpreted critically. Laboratory tests for detecting Aspergillus galactomannan, \u03b2-d-glucan or DNA from blood, BAL or tissue samples may facilitate the diagnosis; however, most polymerase chain reaction assays are not yet standardi...","The Brighton Collaboration Viral Vector Vaccines Safety Working Group (V3SWG) was formed to evaluate the safety and characteristics of live, recombinant viral vector vaccines. A recent publication by the V3SWG described live, attenuated, recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (rVSV) as a chimeric virus vaccine for HIV-1 (Clarke et al., 2016). The rVSV vector system is being explored as a platform for development of multiple vaccines. This paper reviews the molecular and biological features of the rVSV vector system, followed by a template with details on the safety and characteristics of a rVSV vaccine against Zaire ebolavirus (ZEBOV). The rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine is a live, replication competent vector in which the VSV glycoprotein (G) gene is replaced with the glycoprotein (GP) gene of ZEBOV. Multiple copies of GP are expressed and assembled into the viral envelope responsible for inducing protective immunity. The vaccine (designated V920) was originally constructed by the National Microbi...","Abstract The outbreak of the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has caused more than 100,000 people infected and thousands of deaths. Currently, the number of infections and deaths is still increasing rapidly. COVID-19 seriously threatens human health, production, life, social functioning and international relations. In the fight against COVID-19, Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and big data technologies have played an important role in many aspects, including the rapid aggregation of multi-source big data, rapid visualization of epidemic information, spatial tracking of confirmed cases, prediction of regional transmission, spatial segmentation of the epidemic risk and prevention level, balancing and management of the supply and demand of material resources, and social-emotional guidance and panic elimination, which provided solid spatial information support for decision-making, measures formulation, and effectiveness assessment of COVID-19 prevention and control. GIS has d...","Backgrounds: In December 2019, a novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pneumonia hit Wuhan, Hubei Province, China and spread to the rest of China and overseas. The emergence of this virus coincided with the Spring Festival Travel Rush in China. It is possible to estimate total number of cases of COVID-19 in Wuhan, by 23 January 2020, given the cases reported in other cities and population flow data between cities. Methods: We built a model to estimate the total number of cases in Wuhan by 23 January 2020, based on the number of cases detected outside Wuhan city in China, with the assumption that if the same screening effort used in other cities applied in Wuhan. We employed population flow data from different sources between Wuhan and other cities/regions by 23 January 2020. The number of total cases was determined by the maximum log likelihood estimation. Findings: From overall cities/regions data, we predicted 1326 (95% CI: 1177, 1484), 1151 (95% CI: 1018, 1292) and 5277 (95% CI: 4732, 5859) ...","Objective: Establishing a social contact data sharing initiative and an interactive tool to assess mitigation strategies for COVID-19. Results: We organized data sharing of published social contact surveys via online repositories and formatting guidelines. We analyzed this social contact data in terms of weighted social contact matrices, next generation matrices, relative incidence and R0. We incorporated location-specific isolation measures (e.g. school closure or telework) and capture their effect on transmission dynamics. All methods have been implemented in an online application based on R Shiny and applied to COVID-19 with age-specific susceptibility and infectiousness. Using our online tool with the available social contact data, we illustrate that social distancing could have a considerable impact on reducing transmission for COVID-19. The effect itself depends on assumptions made about disease-specific characteristics and the choice of intervention(s). Keywords: social contact ...","Abstract On the Internet, there is a lot of open access information related to infectious diseases, e.g., official announcement, media news, bulletin boards, blogs, and other social media. If proper data retrieval and screening methods were applied on these Internet-based data, it would be very useful to improve the timeliness of early detection for infectious diseases. In China, we practice early warning using Internet-based data with routine intelligence screening assessment every day, and respond to any unusual event in a timely manner. Through this mechanism, the surveillance and early warning of Internet-based data for infectious disease and public health emergency plays an important supplemental role to the traditional surveillance systems.","Abstract Since the emergence of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in 2012, many questions remain on modes of transmission and sources of virus. In outbreak situations, especially with emerging organisms causing severe human disease, it is important to understand the full spectrum of disease, and shedding kinetics in relation to infectivity and the ability to transmit the microorganism. Laboratory response capacity during the early stages of an outbreak focuses on development of virological and immunological methods for patient diagnosis, for contact tracing, and for epidemiological studies into sources, modes of transmission, identification of risk groups, and animal reservoirs. However, optimal use of this core public health laboratory capacity requires a fundamental understanding of kinetics of viral shedding and antibody response, of assay validation and of interpretation of test outcomes. We reviewed available data from MERS-CoV case reports, and compared this...","ABSTRARCTThe fast accumulation of viral metagenomic data has contributed significantly to new RNA virus discovery. However, the short read size, complex composition, and large data size can all make taxonomic analysis difficult. In particular, commonly used alignment-based methods are not ideal choices for detecting new viral species. In this work, we present a novel hierarchical classification model named CHEER, which can conduct read-level taxonomic classification from order to genus for new species. By combining k-mer embedding-based encoding, hierarchically organized CNNs, and carefully trained rejection layer, CHEER is able to assign correct taxonomic labels for reads from new species. We tested CHEER on both simulated and real sequencing data. The results show that CHEER can achieve higher accuracy than popular alignment-based and alignment-free taxonomic assignment tools. The source code, scripts, and pre-trained parameters for CHEER are available via GitHub: https://github.com/...","AbstractThe novel coronavirus disease first identified in 2019 in Wuhan, China (COVID-19) has become a serious global public health concern. One current issue is the ability to adequately screen for the virus causing COVID-2 (SARS-CoV-2). Here we demonstrate the feasibility of shotgun proteomics as a SARS-CoV-2 screening method, through the detection of viral peptides in proteolytically digested body fluids. Using in silico methods, we generated trypsin-based shotgun proteomics methods optimized for LCMS systems from 5 commercial instrument vendors (Thermo, SCIEX, Waters, Shimadzu, and Agilent). First, we generated protein FASTA files and their protein digest maps. Second, the FASTA files were used to generate spectral libraries based on experimental data. Third, transition lists were derived from the spectral libraries using the vendor neutral and open Skyline software environment. Finally, we identified 17 post-translational modifications using linear motif modeling.Abstract Figure","","Introduction: Recent events highlight how emerging and re-emerging pathogens are becoming global challenges for public health. In December 2019, a novel coronavirus has emerged. This has suddenly turned out into global health concern. Objectives: Aim of this research is to focus on the bibliometric aspects in order to measure what is published in the first 30-days of a global epidemic outbreak Methods: We searched PubMed database in order to find all relevant studies in the first 30-days from the first publication. Results: From the initial 442 identified articles, 234 were read in-extenso. The majority of papers come from China, UK and USA. 63.7% of the papers were commentaries, editorials and reported data and only 17.5% of the sources used data directly collected on the field. Topics mainly addressed were epidemiology, preparedness and generic discussion. NNR showed a reduction for both the objectives assessed from January to February. Conclusions: Diagnosis and effective preventive...","The authors have withdrawn this manuscript because the statistical methods in our manuscript need to be modified and we are going to improve the statistical methods and try to give more precise model. Therefore, the authors do not wish this work to be cited as reference for the project.

Daily intercity migration data for 367 cities in China are collected from Baidu Migration, a mobile-app based human migration tracking data system. Historical data of infected, recovered and death cases from official source are used for model fitting. The set of model parameters obtained from best data fitting using a constrained nonlinear optimization procedure is used for estimation of the dynamics of epidemic spreading in the coming weeks. Our results show that the number of infections in most cities in China will peak between mid February to early March 2020, with about 0.8%, less than 0.1% and less than 0.01% of the population eventually infected in Wuhan, Hubei Province and the rest of China, respectively.","We analyzed age- and sex-specific morbidity and mortality data from SARS-COV-2 pandemic in China and Republic of Korea (ROK). Data from China exhibit a standard Gaussian distribution with peak morbidity in the 50-59 years cohort, while the ROK data have a bimodal distribution with highest morbidity in the 20-29 years cohort.","Abstract In this paper, we have proposed a two-phase procedure (combining discrete graphs and wavelets) for constructing true epidemic growth. In the first phase, a graph-theory-based approach was developed to update partial data available and in the second phase, we used this partial data to generate plausible complete data through wavelets. We have provided two numerical examples. This procedure is novel and implementable and adaptable to machine learning modeling framework.","BACKGROUND: Prior to emergence in human populations, zoonoses such as SARS cause occasional infections in human populations exposed to reservoir species. The risk of widespread epidemics in humans can be assessed by monitoring the reproduction number R (average number of persons infected by a human case). However, until now, estimating R required detailed outbreak investigations of human clusters, for which resources and expertise are not always available. Additionally, existing methods do not correct for important selection and under-ascertainment biases. Here, we present simple estimation methods that overcome many of these limitations. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Our approach is based on a parsimonious mathematical model of disease transmission and only requires data collected through routine surveillance and standard case investigations. We apply it to assess the transmissibility of swine-origin influenza A H3N2v-M virus in the US, Nipah virus in Malaysia and Bangladesh, and also present...","We present a data-driven machine learning analysis of COVID-19 from its early infection dynamics, with the goal of extracting actionable public health insights. We focus on the transmission dynamics in the USA starting from the first confirmed infection on January 21 2020. We find that COVID-19 has a strong infectious force if left unchecked, with a doubling time of under 3 days. However it is not particularly virulent. Our methods may be of general interest.","As the international community responds to an outbreak of coronavirus-induced pneumonia in Wuhan, China, early and open data sharing \u2014 which are vital for its control \u2014 depend on the trust that the data will not be used without proper attribution to those who generated it."],"title":["CoVDB: a comprehensive database for comparative analysis of coronavirus genes and genomes","Voice from China: nomenclature of the novel coronavirus and related diseases","The species Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus: classifying 2019-nCoV and naming it SARS-CoV-2","The Initial Hospital Response to an Epidemic","Lessons learned from the 2019-nCoV epidemic on prevention of future infectious diseases","Risques d\u2019importation des maladies infectieuses exotiques en France m\u00e9tropolitaine : d\u00e9tection, alerte et r\u00e9ponse","Pattern of early human-to-human transmission of Wuhan 2019-nCoV","COVID-19 \u2013 the role of mass gatherings","Mass gathering events and reducing further global spread of COVID-19: a political and public health dilemma","Clinical evaluation of real-time PCR assays for rapid diagnosis of SARS coronavirus during outbreak and post-epidemic periods","Revealing the influence of national public health policies for the outbreak of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in Wuhan, China through status dynamic modeling","Aciertos y errores en la gesti\u00f3n de las crisis de salud p\u00fablica en Espa\u00f1a","Haplotype networks of SARS-CoV-2 infections in the Diamond Princess cruise ship outbreak","Intensive Care Unit Resource Planning During COVID-19 Emergency at the Regional Level: the Italian case.","Viral respiratory infections among Hajj pilgrims in 2013","Potential Factors Influencing Repeated SARS Outbreaks in China","Aerodynamic Characteristics and RNA Concentration of SARS-CoV-2 Aerosol in Wuhan Hospitals during COVID-19 Outbreak","Clinical care for severe influenza and other severe illness in resource\u2010limited settings: the need for evidence and guidelines","Clinical characteristics of 82 death cases with COVID-19","Echinacea\u2014A Source of Potent Antivirals for Respiratory Virus Infections","Applications of the Phytomedicine Echinacea purpurea (Purple Coneflower) in Infectious Diseases","Neutrophil-to-Lymphocyte Ratio Predicts Severe Illness Patients with 2019 Novel Coronavirus in the Early Stage","Recommendations for standardized management of CML patients in the core epidemic area of COVID-19 (Multi-center survey results in Hubei Province, China)","The French Infectious Diseases Society's readiness and response to epidemic or biological risk\u2013the current situation following the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus and Ebola virus disease alerts","Population-Level Mortality Rates from Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) in South Korea","Temporal profiles of viral load in posterior oropharyngeal saliva samples and serum antibody responses during infection by SARS-CoV-2: an observational cohort study","Restoration of leukomonocyte counts is associated with viral clearance in COVID-19 hospitalized patients","Chapter 9 Nutraceuticals in Alternative and Underutilized Fruits as Functional Food Ingredients: Ancient Species for New Health Needs","What Have We Learned About Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus Emergence in Humans?
