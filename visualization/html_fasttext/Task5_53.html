To investigate the potential route of 2019-nCov infection on the mucosa of oral cavity, bulk RNA-seq profiles from two public databases including The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Functional Annotation of The Mammalian Genome Cap Analysis of Gene Expression (FANTOM5 CAGE) dataset were collected. RNA-seq profiling data of 13 organ types with para-carcinoma normal tissues from TCGA and 14 organ types with normal tissues from FANTOM5 CAGE were analyzed in order to explore and validate the expression of ACE2 on the mucosa of oral cavity. Further, single-cell transcriptomes from an independent data generated in-house were used to identify and confirm the ACE2-expressing cell composition and proportion in oral cavity. The results demonstrated that the ACE2 expressed on the mucosa of oral cavity.

There is no licensed or proven treatment. Passive immunotherapy approaches are being developed to prevent and treat several human medical conditions where alternative therapeutic options are absent. We report the safety of a fully human polyclonal IgG antibody (SAB-301) produced from the hyperimmune plasma of transchromosomic cattle immunised with a MERS coronavirus vaccine. Methods We did a phase 1 double-blind, placebo-controlled, single-dose escalation trial at the National Institutes of Health Clinical Center. We recruited healthy participants aged 18\u201360 years who had normal laboratory parameters at enrolment, a body-mass index of 19\u201332 kg/m2, and a creatinine clearance of 70 mL/min or more, and who did not have any chronic medical problems that required daily oral medications, a positive rheumatoid factor (\u226515 IU/mL), IgA deficiency (&lt;7 mg/dL), or history of...","Abstract Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) was the first pandemic in the 21st century to claim more than 700 lives worldwide. However, effective anti-SARS vaccines or medications are currently unavailable despite being desperately needed to adequately prepare for a possible SARS outbreak. SARS is caused by a novel coronavirus, and one of its components, a viral helicase, is emerging as a promising target for the development of chemical SARS inhibitors. In the following review, we describe the characterization, family classification, and kinetic movement mechanisms of the SARS coronavirus (SCV) helicase\u2014nsP13. We also discuss the recent progress in the identification of novel chemical inhibitors of nsP13 in the context of our recent discovery of the strong inhibition of the SARS helicase by natural flavonoids, myricetin and scutellarein. These compounds will serve as important resources for the future development of anti-SARS medications.","","BACKGROUND: A recent outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 infection occurs mainly in China, with rapidly increasing the number of cases (namely COVID-19). Abnormal liver functions are frequently present in these patients, here we aimed to clarify the clinical features of COVID-19-related liver damage to provide some references for the clinical treatment. METHODS: In this retrospective, single-center study, we included all confirmed COVID-19 cases in Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center from January 20 to January 31, 2020. The outcomes were followed up until February 19, 2020. A total of 148 cases were analyzed for clinical features, laboratory parameters (including liver function tests), medications and the length of stay. FINDINGS: Of 148 confirmed SARS-CoV-2-infected patients, 49.3% were females and 50.7% were males. The median age was 50.5 years (interquartile range, 36-64). Patients had clinical manifestations of fever (70.1%), cough (45.3%), expectoration (26.7%) at admission. 75 patients (50...","In December 2019, a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) caused an outbreak in Wuhan, China, and soon spread to other parts of the world. It was believed that 2019-nCoV was transmitted through respiratory tract and then induced pneumonia, thus molecular diagnosis based on oral swabs was used for confirmation of this disease. Likewise, patient will be released upon two times of negative detection from oral swabs. However, many coronaviruses can also be transmitted through oral\u2013fecal route by infecting intestines. Whether 2019-nCoV infected patients also carry virus in other organs like intestine need to be tested. We conducted investigation on patients in a local hospital who were infected with this virus. We found the presence of 2019-nCoV in anal swabs and blood as well, and more anal swab positives than oral swab positives in a later stage of infection, suggesting shedding and thereby transmitted through oral\u2013fecal route. We also showed serology test can improve detection positive rate thus...","2019-nCoV is a newly identified coronavirus with high similarity to SARS-CoV. We performed a structural analysis of the receptor binding domain (RBD) of spike glycoprotein responsible for entry of coronaviruses into host cells. The RBDs from the two viruses share 72% identity in amino acid sequences, and molecular simulation reveals highly similar ternary structures. However, 2019-nCoV has a distinct loop with flexible glycyl residues replacing rigid prolyl residues in SARS-CoV. Molecular modeling revealed that 2019-nCoV RBD has a stronger interaction with angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). A unique phenylalanine F486 in the flexible loop likely plays a major role because its penetration into a deep hydrophobic pocket in ACE2. ACE2 is widely expressed with conserved primary structures throughout the animal kingdom from fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds, to mammals. Structural analysis suggests that ACE2 from these animals can potentially bind RBD of 2019-nCoV, making them all poss...","Background: Concerns have been raised regarding the safety of Angiotensin Converting Enzyme Inhibitors (ACEIs) and Angiotensin Receptor Blockers (ARBs) in patients with COVID-19, based on the hypothesis that such medications may raise expression of ACE2, the receptor for SARS-CoV-2. Methods: We conducted a literature review of studies (n=12) in experimental animals and human subjects (n=11) and evaluated the evidence regarding the impact of administration of ACEIs and ARBs on ACE2 expression. We prioritized studies that assessed ACE2 protein expression data, measured directly or inferred from ACE2 activity assays. Results: The findings in animals are inconsistent with respect to an increase in ACE2 expression in response to treatment with ACEIs or ARBs. Control/sham animals show little to no effect in the plurality of studies. Those studies that report increases in ACE2 expression tend to involve acute injury models and/or higher doses than typically administered to patients. Data from...","Background: COVID-19 is an emerging disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus; no specific medication has been identified to date. We aimed to investigate the administered medications and intervention times for patients who completely recovered from COVID-19. Methods: This single-center, retrospective, and observational study included 55 patients with COVID-19 who were transferred to Shenyang Sixth People's Hospital between January 20 and March 15, 2020. Demographic information, symptoms, laboratory indicators, treatment processes, and clinical outcomes were collected. Administered drugs and intervention times were compared in 47 and eight patients with mild and severe symptoms, respectively. Findings: All 55 patients recovered. Fifty-three patients (96.36%) received antiviral therapy, including 45 in the mild group (median treatment: 14 days; 17 received umifenovir) and all eight severe-group patients (median treatment: 17.5 days; four received lopinavir/ritonavir). Twenty-nine patients ...","Most pathogens initiate their infections at the human mucosal surface. Therefore, mucosal vaccination, especially through oral or intranasal administration routes, is highly desired for infectious diseases. Meanwhile, protein-based antigens provide a safer alternative to the whole pathogen or DNA based ones in vaccine development. However, the unique biopharmaceutical hurdles that intranasally or orally delivered protein vaccines need to overcome before they reach the sites of targeting, the relatively low immunogenicity, as well as the low stability of the protein antigens, require thoughtful and fine-tuned mucosal vaccine formulations, including the selection of immunostimulants, the identification of the suitable vaccine delivery system, and the determination of the exact composition and manufacturing conditions. This review aims to provide an up-to-date survey of the protein antigen-based vaccine formulation development, including the usage of immunostimulants and the optimization ...","Summary Background Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) due to the 2019 novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in Wuhan city and rapidly spread throughout China. We aimed to compare arbidol and lopinavir/ritonavir(LPV/r) treatment for patients with COVID-19 with LPV/r only. Methods In this retrospective cohort study, we included adults (age\u226518years) with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 without Invasive ventilation, diagnosed between Jan 17, 2020, and Feb 13, 2020. Patients, diagnosed after Jan 17, 2020, were given oral arbidol and LPV/r in the combination group and oral LPV/r only in the monotherapy group for 5\u201321 days. The primary endpoint was a negative conversion rate of coronavirus from the date of COVID-19 diagnosis(day7, day14), and assessed whether the pneumonia was progressing or improving by chest CT (day7). Results We analyzed 16 patients who received oral arbidol and LPV/r in the combination group and 17 who oral LPV/r only in the monotherapy group, and both initiated after di...","Abstract The coronavirus (CoV) family consists of viruses that infects a variety of animals including humans with various levels of respiratory and fecal-oral transmission levels depending on the behavior of the viruses' natural hosts and optimal viral fitness. A model to classify and predict the levels of respective respiratory and fecal-oral transmission potentials of the various viruses was built before the outbreak of MERS-CoV using AI and empirically-based molecular tools to predict the disorder level of proteins. Using the percentages of intrinsic disorder (PID) of the nucleocapsid (N) and membrane (M) proteins of CoV, the model easily clustered the viruses into three groups with the SARS-CoV (M PID=8%, N PID = 50%) falling into Category B, in which viruses have intermediate levels of both respiratory and fecal-oral transmission potentials. Later, MERS-CoV (M PID=9%, N PID =44%) was found to be in Category C, which consists of viruses with lower respiratory transmission potential...","Abstract Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is a recently emerged virus that has caused a number of human infections and deaths, primarily in the Middle East. The transmission of MERS-CoV to humans has been proposed to be as a result of contact with camels, but evidence of human-to-human transmission also exists. In order to work with MERS-CoV in a laboratory setting, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has determined that MERS-CoV should be handled at a biosafety level (BSL) 3 (BSL-3) biocontainment level. Many processes and procedures used to characterize MERS-CoV and to evaluate samples from MERS-CoV infected animals are more easily and efficiently completed at BSL-2 or lower containment. In order to complete experimental work at BSL-2, demonstration or proof of inactivation is required before removal of specimens from biocontainment laboratories. In the studies presented here, we evaluated typical means of inactivating viruses prior to handl...","Objective To provide an overview of supply and demand issues in the vaccine industry and the policy options that have been implemented to resolve these issues. Data sources Medline, Policy File, and International Pharmaceutical Abstracts were searched to locate academic journal articles. Other sources reviewed included texts on the topics of vaccine history and policy, government agency reports, and reports from independent think tanks. Keywords included vaccines, immunizations, supply, demand, and policy. Study selection Search criteria were limited to English language and human studies. Articles pertaining to vaccine demand, supply, and public policy were selected and reviewed for inclusion. Data extraction By the authors. Data synthesis Vaccines are biologic medications, therefore making their development and production more difficult and costly compared with \u201csmall-molecule\u201d drugs. Research and development costs for vaccines can exceed $800 million, and development may require 10 y...","BACKGROUND: Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) is a respiratory disease caused by a novel coronavirus that was identified in 2012 in Saudi Arabia. It is associated with significant mortality and morbidity. We identified factors associated with the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus (MERS\u2010CoV) infection among suspected cases presented with sign and symptoms of upper respiratory infection or exposure to the virus. We also looked at the impact of medication history on virus transmission. METHOD: We included subjects with suspected MERS-CoV infection and confirmed cases of MERS infection. Subjects were excluded if there were any missing data that prevent the final analysis. Descriptive statistics were used to report demographic data. Percentages and frequencies were used to summarize the categorical variables, while means and standard deviations were calculated for continuous variables. Logistic regression was used to assess the risk of MERS-CoV infection among the suspected...","Effective treatments for Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak are urgently needed. While anti-viral approaches and vaccines are being considered immediate countermeasures are unavailable. The aim of this article is to outline a perspective on the pathophysiology of COVID-19 in the context of the currently available clinical data published in the literature. This article appreciates clinical data published on COVID-19 in the context of another respiratory illness - high altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE). Both conditions have significant similarities that portend pathophysiologic trajectories. Following this potential treatment options emerge. Both COVID-19 and HAPE exhibit a decreased ratio of arterial oxygen partial pressure to fractional inspired oxygen with concomitant hypoxia and tachypnea. There also appears to be a tendency for low carbon dioxide levels in both as well. Radiologic findings of ground glass opacities are present in up to 86% of patients with COVID-19 in additi...","Background Since late December 2019, the outbreak of the novel coronavirus disease, COVID-19, that began in Wuhan, has become endemic in China and more than 100 countries and regions in the world. There is no report about the prevalence of COVID-19 in CML patients untill now. We aimed to describe the clinical course, outcomes of CML patients with COVID-19 and prevalence of COVID-19 in CML patients. Methods In this multi-center survey, cross-sectional survey, observational study, the clinical data of CML patients with COVID-19 in each center were collected. Simultaneously, an online survey was conducted for information about the CML patients under the management at each center by asking the CML patients to complete a questionnaire,from February 15, 2020 to February 21, 2020. The questionnaire includes demographic data, place of residence, smoking status, CML diagnosis and treatment, comorbidities, combined medications, epidemiological history, symptoms(fever, cough, shortness of breath,...","The most distinctive comorbidities of 32 non-survivors from a group of 52 intensive care unit patients with novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in the study by Xiaobo Yang and colleagues1 were cerebrovascular diseases (22%) and diabetes (22%). Another study2 included 1099 patients with confirmed COVID-19, of whom 173 had severe disease with comorbidities of hypertension (23\u00b77%), diabetes mellitus (16\u00b72%), coronary heart diseases (5\u00b78%), and cerebrovascular disease (2\u00b73%). In a third study,3 of 140 patients who were admitted to hospital with COVID-19, 30% had hypertension and 12% had diabetes. Notably, the most frequent comorbidities reported in these three studies of patients with COVID-19 are often treated with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors; however, treatment was not assessed in either study. Human pathogenic coronaviruses (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus [SARS-CoV] and SARS-CoV-2) bind to their target cells through angiotensin-converting enzyme 2...","A novel \u03b2-coronavirus (2019-nCoV) caused severe and even fetal pneumonia explored in a seafood market of Wuhan city, Hubei province, China, and rapidly spread to other provinces of China and other countries. The 2019-nCoV was different from SARS-CoV, but shared the same host receptor the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). The natural host of 2019-nCoV may be the bat Rhinolophus affinis as 2019-nCoV showed 96.2% of whole-genome identity to BatCoV RaTG13. The person-to-person transmission routes of 2019-nCoV included direct transmission, such as cough, sneeze, droplet inhalation transmission, and contact transmission, such as the contact with oral, nasal, and eye mucous membranes. 2019-nCoV can also be transmitted through the saliva, and the fetal\u2013oral routes may also be a potential person-to-person transmission route. The participants in dental practice expose to tremendous risk of 2019-nCoV infection due to the face-to-face communication and the exposure to saliva, blood, an...","","","","Protection of healthcare workforce is of paramount relevance for the care of infected and non-infected patients in the setting of a pandemic such as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Healthcare workers are at increased risk to become infected because of contact to infected patients, infected co-workers and their community outside the hospital. The ideal organisational strategy to protect the healthcare workforce in a situation in which social distancing cannot be maintained at the workplace remains to be determined. In this study, we have mathematically modelled strategies for the employment of hospital workforce with the goal to simulate health and productivity of the workers. Therefore, deterministic models were extended to account for stochastic influences potentially occurring in rather small populations. The models were also designed to determine if desynchronization of medical teams by dichotomizing the workers may protect the workforce. Our studies model workforce productivit...","Abstract Hypertension is a diverse illness interlinked with cerebral, cardiovascular (CVS) and renal abnormalities. Presently, the malady is being treated by focusing on Renin- angiotensin system (RAS), voltage-gated calcium channels, peripheral vasodilators, renal and sympathetic nervous systems. Cardiovascular and renal abnormalities are associated with the overactivation of RAAS, which can be constrained by angiotensin- converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs), angiotensin II (Ang-II) -AT1 receptor blockers (ARBs) and renin inhibitors. The latter is a new player in the old system. The renin catalyzes the conversion of angiotensinogen to Angiotensin I (Ang-I). This can be overcome by inhibiting renin, a preliminary step, eventually hinders the occurrence of the cascade of events in the RAAS. Various peptidomimetics, the first-generation renin inhibitors developed six decades ago have limited drug-like properties as they suffered from poor intestinal absorption, high liver first-pass meta...","AbstractFinding vaccine or specific antiviral treatment for global pandemic of virus diseases (such as the ongoing COVID-19) requires rapid analysis, annotation and evaluation of metagenomic libraries to enable a quick and efficient screening of nucleotide sequences. Traditional sequence alignment methods are not suitable and there is a need for fast alignment-free techniques for sequence analysis. Information theory and data compression algorithms provide a rich set of mathematical and computational tools to capture essential patterns in biological sequences. In 2013, our research group (Nagaraj et al., Eur. Phys. J. Special Topics 222(3-4), 2013) has proposed a novel measure known as Effort-To-Compress (ETC) based on the notion of compression-complexity to capture the information content of sequences. In this study, we propose a compression-complexity based distance measure for automatic identification of SARS coronavirus strains from a set of viruses using only short fragments of nu...","We estimate the growth in demand for ICU beds in Chicago during the emerging COVID-19 epidemic, using state-of-the-art computer simulations calibrated for the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The questions we address are these: (1) Will the ICU capacity in Chicago be exceeded, and if so by how much? (2) Can strong mitigation strategies, such as lockdown or shelter in place order, prevent the overflow of capacity? (3) When should such strategies be implemented? Our answers are as follows: (1) The ICU capacity may be exceeded by a large amount, probably by a factor of ten. (2) Strong mitigation can avert this emergency situation potentially, but even that will not work if implemented too late. (3) If the strong mitigation precedes April 1st, then the growth of COVID-19 can be controlled and the ICU capacity could be adequate. The earlier the strong mitigation is implemented, the greater the probability that it will be successful. After around April 1 2020, any strong mitigation will not avert the emerg...","AbstractTilorone is a 50-year-old synthetic small-molecule compound with antiviral activity that is proposed to induce interferon after oral administration. This drug is used as a broad-spectrum antiviral in several countries of the Russian Federation. We have recently described activity in vitro and in vivo against the Ebola Virus. After a broad screening of additional viruses, we now describe in vitro activity against Chikungunya virus (CHIK) and Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV).","BACKGROUND: A novel human coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), was identified in China in December 2019. There is limited support for many of its key epidemiologic features, including the incubation period for clinical disease (coronavirus disease 2019 [COVID-19]), which has important implications for surveillance and control activities. OBJECTIVE: To estimate the length of the incubation period of COVID-19 and describe its public health implications. DESIGN: Pooled analysis of confirmed COVID-19 cases reported between 4 January 2020 and 24 February 2020. SETTING: News reports and press releases from 50 provinces, regions, and countries outside Wuhan, Hubei province, China. PARTICIPANTS: Persons with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection outside Hubei province, China. MEASUREMENTS: Patient demographic characteristics and dates and times of possible exposure, symptom onset, fever onset, and hospitalization. RESULTS: There were 181 confirmed cases with iden...","Italy recorded its first case of confirmed acute respiratory illness because of coronavirus on February 18, 2020, soon after the initial reports in China. Since that time, Italy and nations throughout the world have adopted very stringent and severe measures to protect populations from spread of infection. Despite these measures, the number of infected people is growing exponentially, with a significant number of patients developing acute respiratory insufficiency. Endoscopy departments face significant risk for diffusion of respiratory diseases that can be spread via an airborne route, including aspiration of oral and fecal material via endoscopes. The purpose of this article is to discuss the measures, with specific focus on personal protection equipment and dress code modalities, implemented in our hospital to prevent further dissemination of COVID-19 infection.","The rapid spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) raises concern about a global pandemic. Knowledge about the duration of viral shedding remains important for patient management and infection control. We report the duration of viral detection in throat and rectum of a COVID-19 patient treated at the Hospital for Tropical Diseases in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. Despite clinical recovery, SARS-CoV-2 RNA remained detectable by real time RT-PCR in throat and rectal swabs until day 11 and 18 of hospitalization, respectively. Because live SARS-CoV-2 has been successfully isolated from a stool sample from a COVID-19 patient in China, the results demonstrate that COVID-19 patients may remain infectious for long periods, and fecal-oral transmission may be possible. Therefore, our finding has important implications for infection control.","The new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) outbreak originating from Wuhan, China, poses a threat to global health. While it's evident that the virus invades respiratory tract and transmits from human to human through airway, other viral tropisms and transmission routes remain unknown. We tested viral RNA in stool from 73 SARS-CoV-2-infected hospitalized patients using rRT-PCR. 53.42% of the patients tested positive in stool. 23.29% of the patients remained positive in feces even after the viral RNA decreased to undetectable level in respiratory tract. The viral RNA was also detected in gastrointestinal tissues. Furthermore, gastric, duodenal and rectal epithelia showed positive immunofluorescent staining of viral host receptor ACE2 and viral nucleocapsid protein in a case of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our results provide evidence for gastrointestinal infection of SARS-CoV-2, highlighting its potential fecal-oral transmission route.","Summary Hong Kong has been severely affected by severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). Contact in households and healthcare settings is thought to be important for transmission, putting children at particular risk. Most data so far, however, have been for adults. We prospectively followed up the first ten children with SARS managed during the early phase of the epidemic in Hong Kong. All the children had been in close contact with infected adults. Persistent fever, cough, progressive radiographic changes of chest and lymphopenia were noted in all patients. The children were treated with high-dose ribavirin, oral prednisolone, or intravenous methylprednisolone, with no short-term adverse effects. Four teenagers required oxygen therapy and two needed assisted ventilation. None of the younger children required oxygen supplementation. Compared with adults and teenagers, SARS seems to have a less aggressive clinical course in younger children.","AbstractThe World Health Organization (WHO) has declared the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection outbreak a global health emergency. Currently, there is no effective anti-2019-nCoV medication. The sequence identity of the 3CL proteases of 2019-nCoV and SARS is 96%, which provides a sound foundation for structural-based drug repositioning (SBDR). Based on a SARS 3CL protease X-ray crystal structure, we construct a 3D homology structure of 2019-nCoV 3CL protease. Based on this structure and existing experimental datasets for SARS 3CL protease inhibitors, we develop an SBDR model based on machine learning and mathematics to screen 1465 drugs in the DrugBank that have been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). We found that many FDA approved drugs are potentially highly potent to 2019-nCoV.","Abstract Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) poses an occupational health risk to healthcare workers. Several thousand healthcare workers have already been infected, mainly in China. Preventing intra-hospital transmission of the communicable disease is therefore a priority. Based on the Systems Engineering Initiative for Patient Safety model, the strategies and measures to protect healthcare workers in an acute tertiary hospital are described along the domains of work task, technologies and tools, work environmental factors, and organizational conditions. The principle of zero occupational infection remains an achievable goal that all healthcare systems need to strive for in the face of a potential pandemic.","Recent study reported in this journal that the threats of continuous evolution and dissemination of 2019 human coronaviruses.1 Since its emergence in December 2019, a \u201cseventh\u201d member of the family of 2019 human coronavirus named \u201cSARS-CoV-2\u201d was responsible for an outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in Wuhan, China.2 As of February 23, 2020, China had reported more than 77,042 confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2, with 2,445 fatalities and counting (http://www.nhc.gov.cn). Strikingly, SARS-CoV-2 had been transmitted rapidly in more than 29 countries to date (https://www.who.int), including Asia, Europe, North America, Africa, and Oceania, posing serious concerns about its pandemic potential. Despite of droplet and contact transmissions of SARS-CoV-2, recent studies demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 might be transmitted via aerosol and fecal\u2013oral routes 3 (Figure 1), which needs to be paid attention in particular.","Abstract Background/Purpose To assess how the current COVID-19 epidemic influenced peoples' utilization of emergency dental services in Beijing, China. Methods The first-visit patients seeking emergency dental services before or at the beginning of the COVID-19 epidemic were retrieved. Their demographic characteristics and the reasons for visiting were recorded and analyzed. Results There were 2,537 patients involved in this study. Thirty-eight percent fewer patients visited the dental urgency at the beginning of the COVID-19 epidemic than before. The distribution of dental problems has changed significantly. The proportion of dental and oral infection raised from 51.0% of pre-COVID-19 to 71.9% during COVID-19, and dental trauma decreased from 14.2% to 10.5%. Meanwhile, the non-urgency cases reduced to three-tenths of pre-COVID-19. Conclusion Within the limitation of this study, the COVID-19 epidemic had a strong influence on the utilization of emergency dental services.","BACKGROUND: In December 2019, a novel strain of SARS-CoV-2 emerged in Wuhan, China. Since then, the city of Wuhan has taken unprecedented measures and efforts in response to the outbreak. METHODS: We quantified the effects of control measures on population contact patterns in Wuhan, China, to assess their effects on the progression of the outbreak. We included the latest estimates of epidemic parameters from a transmission model fitted to data on local and internationally exported cases from Wuhan in the age-structured epidemic framework. Further, we looked at the age-distribution of cases. Lastly, we simulated lifting of the control measures by allowing people to return to work in a phased-in way, and looked at the effects of returning to work at different stages of the underlying outbreak. FINDINGS: Changes in mixing patterns may have contributed to reducing the number of infections in mid-2020 by 92% (interquartile range: 66-97%). There are benefits to sustaining these measures unti...","Since 2000, scientists and students from the greater Rocky Mountain region, along with invited speakers, both national and international, have gathered at the Mountain Campus of Colorado State University to discuss their area of study, present recent findings, establish or strengthen collaborations, and mentor the next generation of virologists and prionologists through formal presentations and informal discussions concerning science, grantsmanship and network development. This year, approximately 100 people attended the 17th annual Rocky Mountain Virology Association meeting, that began with a keynote presentation, and featured 29 oral and 35 poster presentations covering RNA and DNA viruses, prions, virus-host interactions and guides to successful mentorship. Since the keynote address focused on the structure and function of Zika and related flaviviruses, a special session was held to discuss RNA control. The secluded meeting at the foot of the Colorado Rocky Mountains gave ample tim...","AbstractCoronaviruses (CoVs) traffic frequently between species resulting in novel disease outbreaks, most recently exemplified by the newly emerged SARS-CoV-2. Herein, we show that the ribonucleoside analog \u03b2-D-N4-hydroxycytidine (NHC, EIDD-1931) has broad spectrum antiviral activity against SARS-CoV 2, MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, and related zoonotic group 2b or 2c Bat-CoVs, as well as increased potency against a coronavirus bearing resistance mutations to another nucleoside analog inhibitor. In mice infected with SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV, both prophylactic and therapeutic administration of EIDD-2801, an orally bioavailable NHC-prodrug (b-D-N4-hydroxycytidine-5\u2019-isopropyl ester), improved pulmonary function, and reduced virus titer and body weight loss. Decreased MERS-CoV yields in vitro and in vivo were associated with increased transition mutation frequency in viral but not host cell RNA, supporting a mechanism of lethal mutagenesis. The potency of NHC/EIDD-2801 against multiple coronaviruses,...","Background The outbreak of a new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) disease (Covid-19) has become pandemic. To be more effectively controlling the disease, it is critical to set up an optimal quarantine period so that about 95% of the cases developing symptoms will be retained for isolation. At the moment, the WHO-established quarantine period is 14 days based on previous reports which had studied small sizes of hospitalized cases (10 and ~100, respectively), however, over 80% of adult- and 95% of child-cases were not necessary to stay in hospitals, and therefore, had not been hospitalized. Therefore, we are questioning if the current-inferred median incubation time is representative for the whole Covid-19 population, and if the current quarantine period is optimal. Methods We compiled and analyzed the patient-level information of 2015 laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 cases including 99 children in 28 Chinese provinces. This cohort represents a wide-range spectrum of Covid-19 disease with both hosp...","Publisher Summary Kawasaki disease (KD) is an acute febrile systemic vasculitis usually occurring in children younger than five years, and rarely reported in neonates and adults. This chapter discusses the epidemiology, etiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and treatments of KD. The etiology still remains unknown, although epidemiological and clinical features strongly suggest an infectious cause. Immunological abnormalities in the acute phase of the disease reflect activation of immune system and marked production of cytokines by activated cells. KD has some similarities to toxin-mediated diseases, both from a clinical and an immunological point of view. The role of one or more superantigens competent of stimulating large numbers of T cells produced by certain strains of Staphylococcus or Streptococcus is discussed in the chapter, in the context of the etiology of KD. Atypical cases are those with fever, acute surgical symptoms, or neurological manifestations as presenting ...","The recent pandemic of COVID-19 has involved tens of thousands of patients in numerous countries and the causative virus, SARS COV-2 is highly transmissible. Molecular diagnostic tools are central to containment of the virus and initiating proper clinical care. Rapidity, user-friendliness, and high degree of sensitivity and specificity are desirable features of diagnostic assays for screening purposes. Herein, we present a single step reverse transcriptase LAMP assay (RT-LAMP), which can detect up to 500 viral copies in 30 minutes. We challenged our assay with a large number of clinical samples collected from 47 confirmed cases and 213 negative patients. Our LAMP assay showed a high degree of sensitivity and specificity compared to two commercialized qRT-PCR assay as gold standard. We present a rapid RT-LAMP assay that could extend the capacity of laboratories to process 2.5 more clinical samples relative to qRT-PCR and potentially could be used for high-throughput screening purposes.","Abstract The development of strategies to augment the immunogenicity of DNA vaccines is critical for improving their clinical utility. One such strategy involves using the different immune routes with DNA vaccines. In the present study, the immunogenicity of SARS-CoV nucleocapsid DNA vaccine, induced by using the current routine vaccination routes (intramuscularly, by electroporation, or orally using live-attenuated Salmonella typhimurium), was compared in mouse model. The comparison between the three vaccination routes indicated that immunization intramuscularly induced a moderate T cell response and antibody response. Mice administrated by electroporation induced the highest antibody response among the three immunization groups and a mid-level of cellular response. In contrast, the orally DNA vaccine evoked vigorous T cell response and a weak antibody production. These results indicated that the distinct types of immune responses were generated by the different routes of DNA immuniza...","R\u00e9sum\u00e9 Aujourd\u2019hui, nous disposons de donn\u00e9es suffisantes qui confortent l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat d\u2019utiliser des bact\u00e9ries lactiques (BL), notamment des souches des lactocoques et lactobacilles, pour le d\u00e9veloppement de nouvelles strat\u00e9gies de vaccination mucosale. Les BL sont des bact\u00e9ries \u00e0 Gram positif utilis\u00e9es depuis des mill\u00e9naires dans la production d\u2019aliments ferment\u00e9s. Elles sont donc de bonnes candidates pour le d\u00e9veloppement de nouvelles strat\u00e9gies de vectorisation orale et constituent des alternatives attractives aux strat\u00e9gies vaccinales bas\u00e9es sur des bact\u00e9ries pathog\u00e8nes att\u00e9nu\u00e9es dont l\u2019utilisation pr\u00e9sente des risques sanitaires.

One reason is that the challenges underneath sequencing HCoV-19 directly from clinical samples have not been completely tackled. Here we illustrate the application of amplicon and hybrid capture (capture)-based sequencing, as well as ultra-high-throughput metatranscriptomic (meta) sequencing in retrieving complete genomes, inter-individual and intra-individual variations of HCoV-19 from clinical samples covering a range of sample types and viral load. We also examine and compare the bias, sensitivity, accuracy, and other characteristics of these approaches in a comprehensive manner. This is, to date, the first work systematically implements amplicon and capture approaches in sequencing HCoV-19, as well as the first comparative study across methods. Our work offers practical solutions for genome sequencing and analyses of HCoV-19 and other emerging ...","SARS-CoV-2 viral infection is a global pandemic disease (COVID-19). Reaching a swift, reliable diagnosis of COVID-19 in the emergency departments is imperative to direct patients to proper care and to prevent disease dissemination. COVID-19 diagnosis is based on the identification of viral RNA through RT-PCR from oral-nasopharyngeal swabs, which however presents suboptimal sensitivity and may require several hours in overstressed laboratories. These drawbacks have called for an additional, complementary first line approach. CT is the gold standard method for the detection of interstitial pneumonia, a hallmark feature of COVID-19, often present in the asymptomatic stage of the disease. Here, we show that CT scan presents a sensitivity of 95.48% (std.err=0.35%), vastly outperforming RT-PCR. Additionally, as diagnostic accuracy is influenced by disease prevalence, we argue that predictive values provide a more precise measure of CT reliability in the current pandemics. We generated a mode...","Abstract Objective This document summarizes the limited experience of SARS in pregnancy and suggests guidelines for management. Outcomes Cases reported from Asia suggest that maternal and fetal outcomes are worsened by SARS during pregnancy. Evidence Medline was searched for relevant articles published in English from 2000 to 2007. Case reports were reviewed and expert opinion sought. Values Recommendations were made according to the guidelines developed by the Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care. Sponsors The Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Canada. Recommendations 1. All hospitals should have infection control systems in place to ensure that alerts regarding changes in exposure risk factors for SARS or other potentially serious communicable diseases are conveyed promptly to clinical units, including the labour and delivery unit. (III-C) 2. At times of SARS outbreaks, all pregnant patients being assessed or admitted to the hospital should be screened for sympto...","Abstract Objective This document summarizes the limited experience of SARS in pregnancy and suggests guidelines for management.

If this international research effort is going to be as swift and effective as possible, it will need to rely on a principle of open science. When researchers share data, code, and software and generally make their work as transparent as possible, it allows other researchers to verify and expand upon their work. Furthermore, it allows public officials to make informed decisions. In this study, we analyzed 535 preprint articles related to COVID-19 for eight transparency criteria and recorded study location and funding information. We found that individual researchers have lined up to help during this crisis, quickly tackling important public health questions, often without funding or support from outside organizations. However, most authors could improve their data sharing and scientific reporting practices.

Codeine, and to a lesser extent hydrocodone, are prescribed for cough and are thought to work through similar opioid-mediated mechanisms. As such, these medications have side effects including sedation, constipation, and, potentially, respiratory suppression. While most patients and clinicians agree that these remedies work, there is considerable debate over effect size and mechanism of action due to a lack of appropriate evidence. [288] [289] [290] The best systematic review of cough remedies for children and adults concluded: \"there is no good evidence for or against the effectiveness of OTC medicines in acute cough.\" 291 Benzonatate (Tessalon perles) is licensed as a prescription antitussive but appears to have been given this indication despite a lack of good evidence.","Retail pharmacies in China provide some prescription medications, over-the-counter medications, 65 supplements, and health-related products and devices for sale. They are not considered part of 66 the healthcare system as they practice follow different companies' regulations.

Pharmacists should be both health generalists and health specialists, which will have an impact on public health. Even the American Public Health Association (1981) supports the pharmacists' role in public health. Should community pharmacists move beyond their traditional role? Even when dispensing medicines through paper-based prescription services, pharmacists should comply with some fundamental standards. Safety issues must be considered when dispensing medications. The Pharmacy Board of Australia published guidelines for medication dispensing (i.e., guidelines for scanned and faxed prescriptions and steps to take when handling Internet or mail-order dispensing); guidelines for dispensing extemporaneous medications; guidelines when handling errors (e.g., dispensing errors); guidelines for appropriate medication labeling; guidelines for patient counseling, privacy, and confidentiality; and pharmacy technicians' functions, responsibilities, and competencies (Pharmacy Board of Australia, n.d.). In addition, for pharmacies that use electronic and computer systems, the Royal Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain (n.d.) has provided several guidelines and principles for good dispensing and appropriate dispensing procedures (e.g., professional checking, medication substitution, and labeling). Malaysia, a developing country, has also developed Guide to Good Dispensing Practice (Malaysian Pharmaceutical Services Division, 2016) . These guidelines aim to have both public and private facilities dispensing medications according to the law and guidelines, which may ensure that patients receive the correct medications, adherence is improved, adverse effects are minimized, and errors are avoided. The document's contents relate to processing prescriptions, preparing medications, labeling, recoding, and issuing medications to the patient. In geographical areas where no pharmacists are available, a guide about managing medicines would be a handy document indeed (Andersson &amp; Snell, 2010) .","Disciplines such as molecular biology and immunology have given rise to medical therapies and tools such as vaccines and drugs to control disease vectors that seem, on their surface, to promise more global solutions with fewer requirements to consider the political and social dimensions of the work being done. However, the idea that such narrowly defined, but scientifically sophisticated, medical interventions can respond to the global challenge of disease emergence is receiving criticism (Birn, 2005). This is, in part, because recent and ongoing outbreaks of avian flu, SARS, Marburg virus, Ebola, and numerous other diseases (Lashley, 2004), have drawn public and scientific attention to the fact that problems of emerging diseases are not easily solved by \u201cmagic bullet\u201d interventions. Stirring political debates about access to costly AIDS medications, participation in polio eradication programs, and the ethics of clinical trials in Africa and Asia that test medications that may not be available to participants post-trial, have also drawn broad sectors of society into discussions of the political aspects of health and disease.","In responding to the pressing need for anti-2019-nCoV medications, we develop mathematics-based deep learning models to systematically eventuate FDA approved drugs in the DrugBank for 2019-nCoV 3CL protease inhibition. With the consensus of two deep learning models based on convolutional neural networks and multitask deep learning, we report the top 15 potentially highly potent anti-2019-nCoV 3CL inhibitors, which provide timely guidance for the further development of anti-2019nCoV drugs.","Open-ended questions about a donor's general state of health, medications, previous surgeries, or current health care Medications are rarely of significance from the aspect of donor safety. Although angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors have fostered concern about potential hypotensive episodes, medications often serve to alert the screener to health problems that otherwise may have been inadvertently left out of the donor history. Use of a coronary artery dilator, for example, would indicate a history of ischemic heart disease, which might have gone unmentioned. Experienced screeners are often impressed by the lack of information that many individuals have about their own health history. Some pre-existing disease states are not mentioned by donors when completing the DHQ, as are medications and the reasons for which the medications are being taken. This may be a matter of denial or may be symptomatic of a language problem. The latter is of increasing significance as our donor population becomes more diverse.","Physical examination includes palpating the lateral aspect of the hip for tenderness and identifying limp, leglength discrepancy, the presence of masses, abnormal gait, muscle strength, and range of motion. The Harris hip score is frequently used to evaluate hip function and is also useful in monitoring the effectiveness of treatment (Figure 103 -2). [156] [157] [158] The Harris hip score is a multidimensional observational assessment based on eight items that address pain, high index of suspicion is necessary for all patients taking oral or parenteral steroids. The following information should be elicited: any history of trauma; underlying disease; alcohol use; tobacco use; current medications; past medications; history of joint anomalies; presence of pain or limitation of motion; involvement in sports, especially high-impact sports; occupational history; gestational history; and the presence of liver disease or lipid abnormalities. (Figure 103-4) . The appearance of radiographic \"density\" is secondary to compression of bone trabeculae after microfracture of the nonviable bone, calcification of detritic marrow, and repair of the necrotic area by deposition of new bone, the so-called \"creeping substitution.\" Flattening of the articular surface of bone is a sign of further bone collapse ( Figure 103-5) . To show best the radiographic appearance of osteonecrosis in the femoral head and to better visualize the extent of the necrotic lesion, anteroposterior and frogleg lateral radiographs of the hip should be obtained. Skeletal scintigraphy (i.e., a radionuclide bone scan) using technetium-labeled diphosphonates has also been walking function, daily activity, and range of motion. Scores range from 0 (maximum disability) to 100 (no disability).","When a pediatric traveler develops diarrhea, oral rehydration solution to maintain hydration is the treatment of choice. Parents also should be educated about the signs of mild, moderate, and severe dehydration and instructed in management of diarrhea, especially oral rehydration therapy. Antimotility agents, such as Lomotil (active ingredient, diphenoxylate; Pfizer Inc, New York, NY) and Imodium (active ingredient, loperamide; McNeil-PPC, Inc., Ft Washington, PA), are not recommended in children because of potential toxic megacolon and toxicity (extrapyramidal symptoms with diphenoxylate). Empiric treatment of traveler's diarrhea with antimicrobial agents, typically ciprofloxacin, because of resistance to other agents such as trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, is used for adults. Few studies of empiric antimicrobial treatment have been performed in children, and it is not a routinely recommended intervention for children. Parents should be advised that severe diarrhea requires urgent medical attention, especially in younger pediatric travelers. Prophylaxis for travelers' diarrhea with medications such as bismuth subsalicylate (the active ingredient in Pepto-Bismol; Proctor &amp; Gamble, Cincinnati, OH) is not recommended because of the potential accumulation of salicylate. Prophylactic regimens with antimicrobial agents also are not recommended in children; the benefits usually are outweighed by potential risks, including allergic drug reactions, antimicrobial-associated colitis, and emergence of antibiotic-resistant strains. Moreover, limited information is available about destination-specific antimicrobial resistance patterns. 37 ","In order to investigated the potential routes of 2019-nCov infection on the mucosa of oral cavity, we explored whether the ACE2 is expressed and the ACE2-expressing cell composition and proportion in oral cavity based on the public bulk RNA-seq profiles from two public databases and single-cell transcriptomes from an independent data generated in-house. The result showed that the ACE2 could be expressed in the oral cavity, and was highly enriched in epithelial cells. Moreover, among different oral sites, ACE2 expression was higher in tongue than buccal and gingival tissues. These findings indicate that the mucosa of oral cavity may be a potentially high risk route of 2019-nCov infection.","The medications before hospitalization were not available, thus we only summarized the medications during hospitalization in Table 4 . On the first day of admission, antivirus (73.0%), antibiotics (71.0%), and glucocorticoid (36.9%) were the three most common medications among patients with COVID-19, and the percentage of treatment with antivirus (p=0.041) and glucocorticoid (p=0.006) was significant higher in patients with AKI. However, when it comes to specific antivirus, including arbidol, ganciclovir, interferon, lopinavir and ritonavir, oseltamivir and ribavirin, there is no significant difference between patients with AKI and those without. Throughout the hospitalization, the percentage of medications increased, especially for antivirus, diuretic and glucocorticoid. In addition, the percentage of diuretic during hospitalization were significant higher in patients with AKI than those without (72.2% versus 6.2%, p&lt;0.001).","Patient access and positioning Access to dental surgery With progressive disease, access may be significantly compromised. Escorts and/or domiciliary care are often required. Medications such as antidepressants administered to patients with Alzheimer's have been shown to increase the incidence of hip fracture, further restricting access. Timing of treatment Dental appointments and instructions are often forgotten unless a carer/family member is also involved. Treatment should, as far as possible, be carried out in the morning, when cooperation tends to be best. The usual carers should be present, and treatment undertaken in a familiar environment, with time allowed to explain every procedure before it is carried out. Time-consuming and complex treatments should be avoided. Patient positioning Particularly in the end stages of diseases, the patient should be treated sitting upright in the dental chair or slightly reclined, in order to avoid aspiration and postural hypotension. Hazardous and contraindicated 2 Tolerance of sedatives drugs *0 = No special considerations. 1 = Caution advised. 2 = Specialised medical advice recommended in some cases. 3 = Specialised medical advice mandatory. 4 = Only to be performed in hospital environment. 5 = Should be avoided. sooner or later become unmanageable for treatment under local analgesia. Later, there is progressive neglect of oral health as a result of forgetting the need or even how to brush the teeth or clean dentures. Dentures are also frequently lost or broken or cannot be inserted or tolerated. Complex dental treatment such as dental implants, which require follow-up and meticulous oral hygiene, are not indicated.","Designated schemes exist in the UK and Canada that enable community pharmacists to assess individuals who present with particular minor ailments and offer appropriate self-care advice and treatment options. 10 These include OTC and certain prescription medications from agreed formularies. These schemes vary across jurisdictions in terms of their availability and structural characteristics but are intended to reduce the associated burden of treating these ailments on high-cost settings such as general practice and emergency departments. 10, 19 In many cases, patients who are eligible for free healthcare do not have to pay for the consultation or any medication that is supplied. Although further high quality evaluations of community pharmacy-based management of minor ailments and their impact on clinical outcomes are needed, 20 these types of schemes are of particular importance in the midst of the current public health crisis as they could potentially reduce GPs' minor ailment-related workload by more than 50%. 19","Although the main focus of healthcare services over the coming weeks and months will undoubtedly be on responding to COVID-19, people will also continue to develop other non-COVID-19 related symptoms and conditions that require attention. Depending on the nature and severity of these ailments, previous research has shown that a sizeable proportion of cases can be effectively managed in the community pharmacy setting with a high degree of patient satisfaction. 14 This is vital to maximising the efficiency of health service delivery as data from the UK indicates that more than one in 10 general practitioner (GP) visits and one in 20 emergency department visits are for minor ailments that could be managed in community pharmacies. 15 Work has been undertaken to develop a definitive list of low acuity conditions (i.e. common self-limiting or uncomplicated conditions) that can be clinically assessed and managed by community pharmacists. 16 These include allergies and skin rashes, coughs and colds, and gastrointestinal complaints, and serve to highlight the vast range of symptoms and conditions that can be managed in the community pharmacy setting. For example, springtime typically marks the commencement of hay fever symptoms which affect many patients worldwide. 17 A range of effective treatments are available over the counter (OTC) in community pharmacies to help treat and prevent hay fever symptoms (e.g. antihistamines, intranasal corticosteroids). 18 However, in order for eligible patients to obtain these medications (or medications for other minor ailments) free of charge on public health schemes, they typically need a prescription from their GP to avoid paying for the OTC medication out-of-pocket.","The definition of a patient in need of critical care has evolved over the years. To allow for policy development of new PICUs across the US, the American Academy of Pediatrics published PICU admission criteria in 1999 that were reaffirmed in 2008 (15). As one could expect, the criteria were broad and deliberately vague: (1) severe, life-threatening, or unstable cardiovascular, neurologic, hematologic/oncologic emergencies, (2) endocrine/metabolic, gastrointestinal, renal and/or multisystem disease, (3) postoperative patients requiring frequent monitoring and potentially requiring intensive intervention, and (4) conditions that necessitate the application of special technologic needs, monitoring, complex intervention, or treatment, including medications associated with the disease that exceed individual patient care unit policy limitations. The Society of Critical Care Medicine (SCCM) guidelines recommend only that \u201cICU admission criteria should select patients who are likely to benefit from ICU care (16).\u201d Limited information exists to support which patients fall into this category. This variation in admission practices makes quantification of critical illness difficult (17).","Severe acute respiratory syndrome is a highly infectious disease with high rates of morbidity and mortality. The major therapeutic modalities in its treatment have been empirical. Critically, affected pregnant women had to be treated with potentially teratogenic drugs. The most commonly used firstline medications during the outbreak were ribavirin and corticosteroids [5, 8, 9] . Ribavirin has an FDA pregnancy category X, indicating high teratogenic probability based on consistent animal studies and biological plausibility. Hence, the drug is contraindicated in women who are or may become pregnant. If the use of ribavirin is considered critical by the physician, the pregnant patient should be made aware of the potential teratogenic effects of ribavirin and the limited information on its use in human pregnancy. While concerns of teratogenicity are higher in the first trimester during organogenesis, ribavirin may theoretically also cause functional defect even after the first trimester [17] . The manufacturer (Schering Corp. http://www.ribavirinpregnancyregistry.com) maintains a registry of pregnancy-related exposures and advises all women to wait 6 months following discontinuation of ribavirin before attempting to get pregnant.","Medications may interfere with the quality of certain blood products. This is especially true of medications that inhibit platelet function, such as aspirin. Platelet donors must have not taken aspirin within 36 hours of donation. Other medications interfering with platelet function include clopidogrel (Plavix) and ticlopidine (Ticlid).","This is the first report of the long-term adverse effects of widespread chronic pain, fatigue, psychological distress and disturbed sleep after acute SARS that contributed to the failure to return to productive work of a small cohort of health care professionals at least one year after their acute illness. After their initial SARS symptoms of severe respiratory distress, fever with evidence for infiltrates in their lungs had remitted so that they were considered to be no longer in need of special quarantine and acute treatment measures, a constellation of symptoms persisted that interfered with their ability to function in their occupations. This was then a potentially biased selection process of 22 patients who were members of a group of 50 chronically ill survivors of SARS. A larger study of 107 patients from Toronto, with a more widely selected population [26] had shown that, at the one year mark some continued to describe problems with pain, reduced vitality, physical, mental, and social functioning. Only 14 (13%) were asymptomatic, leaving 93 patients (87%) symptomatic, where 18 (17%) had not returned to work, and 10 (9%) had returned to modified work. If one presumes that the asymptomatic group was most likely to return to unmodified work, then of the 79 patients returning to unmodified work, only 14 were asymptomatic. This leads to the arithmetic conclusion that 65 (82%) of their patients who returned to unmodified work were nevertheless continuing to work despite ongoing symptoms.","From the database, all patients who had a consultation at any public practice and who were prescribed their first-ever antihypertensive agents between the calendar years 2001 to 2003 and in 2005 (the index date) were included. The details from the calendar year 2004 were excluded due to the substantial disruption on the clinical services as a result of the outbreak of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome. Patients who received any antihypertensive medications before the index date were excluded. We captured patients who died from diabetes and renal diseases, and treated the deaths due to conditions other than these two diseases within the observation period as being censored. Each patient was allocated based on the initial prescription of antihypertensive agents, namely, \u03b1-blockers, \u03b2-blockers, thiazide diuretics, CCBs and ACEIs. Patients who were prescribed ARBs and combination therapy were excluded in our data analysis because these prescriptions were relatively rare. Concomitant comorbidities include cardiovascular risk factors and medical conditions which could potentially confound the choice of antihypertensive drug class, as indicated by the respective ICPC-2 or ICD-9/ICD-10 codes. Patients were followed up until the occurrence of mortality within the study period or at the end of five years.","Oral lopinavir and ritonavir were used for the treatment of a 64 years old Korean male with confirmed MERS-CoV infection. These medications were started on the fourth day of admission and the patient achieved full recovery after nine days of treatment [63] . One patient was treated with pegylated interferon, ribavirin and lopinavir/ritonavir and viremia was detected for two days following therapy with triple therapy [64] . In a case series, eight patients received mycophenolate mofetil and all survived [66] .","Conclusion: No dose adjustments are required for glipizide, zidovudine, lamivudine, indinavir, or ritonavir when coadministered with POS, as the small differences in exposure are not considered clinically significant. However, when POS was given with glipizide, glucose concentrations decreased in some healthy volunteers more so than after glipizide administered alone. Monitoring of cyclosporine and tacrolimus blood levels is warranted with POS coadministration, and dose adjustments of cyclosporine and tacrolimus should be made accordingly. Concomitant use of POS with rifabutin, phenytoin, or cimetidine should be avoided unless the benefits outweigh the risks, due to the decrease in POS concentrations. Objectives: The pharmacokinetics (PK) of many medications may be altered in the elderly population. Because alterations in PK can potentially affect clinical outcomes, the PK parameters of Posaconazole (POS), an extended-spectrum investigational triazole antifungal agent, were examined in healthy elderly persons ( \u202165 years), and the clinical implications of age-related PK differences were evaluated. Methods: We conducted a meta-analysis of POS steady-state PK data from 5 clinical studies in healthy volunteers. PK data from elderly healthy volunteers were compared with those of elderly patients with invasive fungal infections ( Objective: To develop a bioassay for measurement of CSP blood levels using the hypersusceptible C. albicans cell wall sensor mutant delta-mid2.","\u25a0 The patient may have swallowing difficulties and poor control of oral secretions; drooling of saliva may therefore be troublesome \u25a0 Conversely, medications routinely used to control the effects of the disease (i.e. antimuscarinic drugs) may cause xerostomia \u25a0 Caries is less common than in controls \u25a0 Periodontal disease may be advanced and can progress due to xerostomia \u25a0 Levodopa may cause reddish saliva \u25a0 Orofacial involuntary movements (dyskinesia) such as 'flycatcher tongue' and lip pursing are side effects of levodopa and bromocriptine \u25a0 Impaired chewing and slow speech are common.","Conclusion: There was no clinically relevant effect of enteral feeding on the pharmacokinetics of oral MFX in healthy volunteers. This results has to be evaluated in patients, especially those from ICU, who are characterised by severe infectious and/or concomitant diseases, which might influence absorption of MFX. In the healthy volunteer studies, compliance with dosing regimens was strictly enforced and participants had no significant underlying diseases or concomitant medications that could confound interpretation of safety data. Therefore, for the purpose of this analysis, the healthy volunteers served as a control group for the patient population. In both groups, most subjects received POS 800 mg/d in divided doses.","Interactions between medications administered to a patient contribute to concomitant morbi-mortality and, in many cases, could be preventable. A study carried out in Denmark upon 26 337 patients with at least 2 prescribed medications detected 21 293 different combinations, of which 4.4% carried a risk of producing a severe interaction. In this same study, 1.2% of hospitalisations were related to medicinal interactions. 1 In Spain, the APEAS study 2 found that 47.8% of adverse events detected in the primary health care field were due to medications, of which 3.5% were a consequence of medicinal interaction. Another published study reveals that 9.9% of the population over 65 years of age is at risk of clinically significant interactions. The study notes that there is an exponential growth in the risk of interactions being produced with a higher number of medications. 4, 6 Polymedication could therefore present a risk of interaction. In Australia 14% of the general population uses more than 4 medications, and in the population over 75 years of age this figure increases to 40%. Data from the UK indicates that 30% of the population over 75 years takes more than 4 medicines. In Spain, a study carried out in a rural area with basic health care indicated that 11.37% of the population was over 65, with an ageing population of 65% and an average prescription rate of 4 medications, and a greater number of prescribed medicines tallying with increased age. 7 However, management of medicinal interactions in clinical consultation is not easy. The introduction of new technologies PALABRAS CLAVE Interacciones medicamentosas; Bases de datos; Evaluaci\u00f3n de calidad in primary health care and hospitals has brought a development in the form of computerised clinical history, which has opened up the possibility of incorporating decision support systems (DSS) with regard to interactions, which alert the user at the moment of prescribing medicines and report on possible courses of action. However, the introduction of these systems is not yet widespread. According to an investigation carried out in Spain in 2007, computer-assisted prescription is in place in only 22.4% of hospitals. 8 In primary health care, the development of electronic prescription has not apparently been accompanied (thus far) by tools for the clinical management of interactions. However, many have incorporated complete databases in consultation format, in order that the clinic may utilise them at their discretion and in specific cases.","injectible medication like streptomycin, or if the organism is resistant to streptomycin, then capreomycin or amikacin are chosen. If possible, at least three other oral medications should be used along with the injectable. Duration of therapy is at least 18 months; the injectable should be included in the regimen for at least the first 6 months of therapy if tolerated. For patients who have localized disease and do not have culture conversion by 2 months of therapy, consideration should be given to surgical removal of the diseased lung. Treatment regimens for patients coinfected with HIV are the same although therapy should be extended to 24 months. Patients coinfected with HIV and MDRTB have a high mortality rate.","The current pneumonia outbreak caused by a new coronavirus (CoV), called 2019-nCoV in China, has evolved into a global health emergency declared by the World Health Organization. Although there is no effective anti-viral medicine for the 2019-nCoV, the 3CL proteases of 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV have a sequence identity of 96%, which provides a foundation for us to hypothesize that all potential anti-SARS-CoV chemotherapies are also effective anti-2019-CoV molecules. We build a three-dimensional (3D) 2019-nCoV 3CL protease structure using a SARS-CoV 3CL protease crystal structure as a template and collect a set of 84 SARS-CoV inhibition experimental data. The molecules of this set are docked to the 3D 2019-nCoV 3CL protease structure to form a machine learning training set. Additionally, the PDBbind 2018 general set of 15,843 protein-ligand complexes is also included as an additional machine learning training set. Using these training sets, we develop two deep learning models based on low-dimensional algebraic topology representations of macromolecular complexes. A total of 1465 FDA-approved drugs is evaluated by their binding affinities predicted by the consensus of two models built with 1) a combination of algebraic topology and deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and 2) a combination of algebraic topology and deep multitask CNNs. According to the predicted binding affinities, we recommend many FDA-approved drugs as potentially highly potent medications to 2019-nCoV, which serve as a crucial step for the development of anti-2019-nCoV drugs.","Occurrence of oropharyngeal candidiasis in immunocompromised patients carries a high burden, not only in terms of patient discomfort. Since mucosal colonisation is a risk factor for systemic dissemination, oropharyngeal candidiasis implies an early treatment initiation. Systemically active antifungals carry the challenge of drug-drug interactions as well as the potential for a variety of organ toxicities. Although topical treatment is clearly preferable for localised superficial infections, systemically active antifungals are used frequently. Most likely these will be azoles. Different patient groups will benefit from additional topical treatment options for oropharyngeal candidiasis. These are in particular patients with HIV/AIDS and patients with neoplastic disease. In HIV infected subjects receiving multiple concomitant medications and suffering from oropharyngeal candidiasis, the risk of interaction of systemic antifungal treatments with HAART needs to be minimised and thus guidelines do recommend first line local antifungal therapy. The incidence rates of oropharyngeal candidiasis vary within the highly complex cancer patient population and depend on the type of tumour, treatment modalities and cytostatics used. Consequences of oropharyngeal candidiasis may be: decreased food and sometimes even liquid intake, loss of weight, and reduced general state and quality of life. Potentially subsequent decreased chemotherapy doses and increased intervals between cycles may have a negative impact on therapeutic success. For both groups of immunocompromised patients, it is important to detect and treat oropharyngeal candidiasis from the start. The availability of a new local antifungal agent with a limited systemic exposure and a once daily dosing favouring patients' compliance should optimise the management of oropharyngeal candidiasis in immunocompromised patients.","After treatment, the patient's symptoms improved, and oxygen saturation maintained above 96% with nasal cannula oxygen. Intravenous medications were then stopped, and oral administration of moxifloxacin 0.4 g/day and arbidol (a non-nucleoside antiviral and immunomodulating drug given for influenza), at a dose of 0.2 g three times a day was administered for 5 days. Immunosuppressive and antihypertensive drugs were resumed on Feb 12 th , 2020. The patient's temperature normalized for more than 20 days, without cough for 10 days and preserved oxygen saturation. Two consecutive RT-PCR throat swabs for 2019-nCoV on Feb 14 th and 18 th 2020, were negative. CT scan on Feb 24 th showed significant resolution of lung lesions ( Figure   1 ). The patient was discharged on Feb 27 th 2020. Typical imaging demonstrated dynamic progress of the disease (Figure 1 ). However, resolution of lung lesions lagged behind symptoms relief.","In those cases where an underlying cause is found, this should be treated. Often if the cause of a PLE is inflammatory bowel disease, the response to glucocorticoids and other immunosuppressive medications is good. If lymphangiectasia is present, treatment centers on dietary intervention. A highly digestible, low-fat, high-calorie diet is optimal. Reducing fat content decreases lymph flow. At one time supplementation with medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs) was recommended because it was thought that MCTs bypassed the lymphatics. Some recent work suggests that this is not the case. In addition, MCT oil generally is poorly palatable.","\u25a0 Many elderly people are edentulous but, of those with remaining teeth, at least 75% have periodontal disease \u25a0 Coronal dental caries is usually, however, less acute but root caries is more common \u25a0 Impaired salivation may contribute to a high prevalence of root caries and oral candidosis, which especially affect hospitalised patients; xerostomia is even more likely if there is medication with neuroleptics or antidepressants \u25a0 Nutrition may be defective due to poverty, apathy, mental disease or dental defects; malnutrition may in turn lead to poor tissue healing and predispose to ill health \u25a0 Oral malignant disease is mainly a problem of the elderly and is a reason for regular oral examination of these patients \u25a0 Some studies have demonstrated mucosal lesions in up to 40% of elderly patients but most of these are fibrous lumps or ulcers, with a minority of potentially malignant lesions such as keratoses \u25a0 Atypical facial pain (often related to depressive illness), migraine, trigeminal neuralgia, zoster and oral dysaesthesias are more common as age advances.","Although no prospective, controlled studies of antiviral treatment of viral pneumonias have been reported in adults, antiviral therapy is warranted for influenza, varicella, herpesvirus, and other viruses in selected circumstances (Table 4 ). In ambulatory adults with influenza, early treatment with inhaled zanamivir or oral oseltamivir seems to reduce the likelihood of lower respiratory tract complications [68] [69] [70] . The use of influenza antiviral medications seems to reduce the likelihood of respiratory tract complications as reflected by reduced rates of antibacterial agent use in ambulatory patients with influenza. In one retrospective study of hospitalized adults with influenza, a minority of whom had radiographically documented pneumonia, no obvious benefit of amantadine treatment was found [71] ; however, because such patients often have recoverable virus after hospitalization (median duration, 4 days), antiviral treatment seems reasonable. Because of its broad influenza spectrum, low risk for resistance emergence, and lack of bronchospasm risk, oseltamivir is an appropriate treatment choice in hospitalized patients.","\u2022 ice chips for 30 minutes before administration of 5-fluorouracil (5FU), methotrexate or melphalan \u2022 folinic acid (as calcium folinate), levofolinic acid or disodium folinate before administration of methotrexate or fluorouracil. \u25a0 Other approaches include use of: \u2022 biological response modifiers; various cytokines such as interleukin-1, interleukin-11, TGF-beta 3 and keratinocyte growth factor \u2022 anti-inflammatory medications \u2022 colony-stimulating factors -granulocyte macrophage (GM-CSF) and granulocyte (G-CSF) \u2022 thalidomide -an angiogenesis-inhibiting drug \u2022 cytoprotective agents (primarily free radical scavengers or antioxidants, such as amifostine, N-acetyl cysteine and vitamin E). \u25a0 Mucositis often necessitates the use of: \u2022 opioid analgesics for pain control \u2022 special diet (Box 3.6) or tube feeding \u2022 good oral hygiene with twice-daily 0.2% aqueous chlorhexidine mouth rinses \u2022 viscous 2% lidocaine or benzydamine rinse or spray can help lessen discomfort, and is particularly helpful before food \u2022 prophylaxis for infectious complications.","Inappropriate affect can be a problem in patients with MS. Many patients have severe mood swings that can affect both their work and their social relationships. Low-dose amitriptyline or another tricyclic antidepressant is frequently helpful in controlling mood swings.13g Depression is a common problem in MS.130J32,140 The suicide rate among persons with MS is estimated to be 7.5 times that of the healthy population. 130 Whether the depression is a primary symptom of MS or a situational problem is not known. Physicians should be alert to the possibility of depression in their patients. Full-dose antidepressant medications and psychological counseling may be beneficial.","r. Place a nasogastric tube, suction gastric fluid every few hours and reduce the stimulus to vomit. g.

After preparing the site aseptically, a 22-gauge hypodermic or spinal needle is inserted in the proximal humerus or femur and can be bandaged in place for repeated or longterm use. Most fluids, medications and transfusions administered IV can also be given IO. \u2022 The peritoneum provides a large surface area for absorption of fluids, blood products and drugs, but systemic blood levels following intraperitoneal (IP) administration may be delayed compared to IV and IO routes. \u2022 The small muscle mass of neonatal kittens makes repeated intramuscular (IM) administration of medications impractical. \u2022 Fluids and medications can also be administered subcutaneously (SC), although absorption may be poor if peripheral vasoconstriction is present.","The results of our single cell RNA-seq profiles validated the ACE2 expression in oral cavity, and the level of ACE2 expression in oral tissues was higher in tongue than buccal or gingival tissues. Furthermore, we have also demonstrated that the ACE2-positive cells were enriched in epithelial cells, which was also reported by previous study10\u201312,16. These findings indicated that oral cavity could be regarded as potentially high risk for 2019-nCov infectious susceptibility.","The ACE2-expressing cells in oral tissues, especially in epithelial cells of tongue, might provide possible routes of entry for the 2019-nCov, which indicate oral cavity might be a potential risk route of 2019-nCov infection. Those preliminary findings have explained the basic mechanism that the oral cavity is a potentially high risk for 2019-nCoV infectious susceptibility and provide a piece of evidence for the future prevention strategy in clinical practice as well as daily life.","Peak milk production in ewes occurs approximately 30 days after lambing, and ewe nutrition in the early lactation period should be geared to maximize this production. Ewe's milk provides most of the nutrient requirements for lambs until they reach 30 to 45 days of age. At 10 days of age, lambs will start to consume small amounts of solid feed, but depending on the availability of ewe's milk, intakes of solid feed are low until weaning. To increase intake of solid feed, texturized 16% protein \"creep feed\" should be available, consisting of mixed grain, pellets containing minerals and medications, and a binding compound, commonly molasses. Feeders should be structured to prevent fecal contamination and wastage of feed. Restricted-access turkey or pig feeders work well for lambs.","There is evidence that the use of these severity assessment indices is increasing the percentage of patients with CAP who are receiving outpatient treatment. 291 However, it is critical to recognize that any severity assessment index serves only as a guideline, not as an absolute. Clinical judgment regarding presence of other comorbid conditions, hypoxia, stability of the home situation, ability to take oral medications, reliability in taking medication, likelihood of returning for follow-up, and likelihood of calling for help when needed all play a role in deciding whether a patient can be treated at home or in a hospital. In addition, the initial validation studies for the PSI, CURB-65, and CRB-65 indexes excluded patients who were HIV infected or otherwise immunocompromised or who had recently been hospitalized. There have recently been several studies on the utility of these indices for patients with HCAP that indicate that they can be used for such patients who are not immunocompromised, 292, 293 but the data are still very limited for HCAP and these indices are not applicable for immunocompromised patients.","One of the major questions clinicians face in treating SOTRs with available antivirals, such as cidofovir or RBV, is when to intervene with therapy. Not all SOTRs will develop LRTI or respiratory failure, and the adverse effects of these medications may be significant. Having predictors of poor outcomes would be extremely useful. Some studies have shown a correlation of viral loads with severe disease due to RVIs [86,135], but more work is needed to identify viral load cutoffs that predict LRTI or respiratory failure and whether quantification of upper respiratory tract viral loads predict viral burden in the lower respiratory tract [136]. As noted above, the strategy of preemptive therapy for AdV infection via monitoring quantitative viral loads in blood has been advocated in allogeneic HSCT recipients [30], but such strategies have yet to be established as beneficial in SOTRs [30].","We compared the medications on the first day of admission and during the hospitalization in patients with AKI and non-AKI. We found that patients with AKI were more likely to have higher proportion of glucocorticoid and lower proportion of antiviral drugs and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) inhibitors treatment on admission. The difference in the use of glucocorticoid may be explained by the condition of patients with AKI that was more severe , thus physicians tended to use glucocorticoid in the most critically ill patients, even if there is a controversy on the use of glucocorticoid in COVID-19 patients. 22, 23 However, the oral antiviral drugs, including arbidol (umifenovir), oseltamivir, lopinavir and ritonavir, were preferred in moderate patients on admission. Given that ACE2 is a functional receptor for SARS-CoV-2, the safety and potential effects of RAAS inhibitors in patients with COVID-19 should be carefully considered. 24 Even though this study included a large number of patients from a tertiary teaching hospital in Wuhan, it has several limitations. First, an accurate baseline serum creatinine was not available, which may have led to an underestimation of AKI or erroneous associations. Second, although we attempted to adjust for many confounders, other unmeasured or unknown confounders might have played a role.","Thus, antimicrobial resistance is both a community problem and a hospital problem. There is great concern over multiple drug-resistant tuberculosis, which is defined as tuberculosis that is resistant to two first-line medications, and extensively resistant tuberculosis, which has a more complex definition specifying several medications.","Current investigations of MS center on the concept of autoimmunity, possibly mediated by a viral illness. Studies designed to define the role of the immune system in MS may be useful. Medications designed to reduce a specific autoimmune response and medications that assist in stimulation of remyelination or improvements in quality of life are being developed.","The consequences of mass quarantines to contain the spread of the viral epidemic have highlighted the challenges of delivering psychiatric care to chronic patients with serious mental illness living in the community. According to the regulations of Chinese health insurance, clinically stable patients with major psychiatric disorders are usually required to visit hospital outpatient clinics, often far from their homes, to obtain their monthly maintenance medications. The suspension of public transportation in Wuhan and many other cities in China have created significant barriers for patients to access treatments and are likely to widen the treatment gap for serious mental disorders, at least in the short to medium term. To address the over-dependence on psychiatric hospitals, appropriate reform of the health insurance and development of community-based mental health services could increase the availability of psychotropic medications at community health clinics, and reduce patients' need to travel, thereby decreasing pressure on psychiatric hospital outpatient clinics. Furthermore, community psychiatric outreach services by psychiatrists and nurses should be developed for clinically stable patients. To avoid the need to attend hospitals, mental health professionals could use special designated vehicles to visit patients at home to assess their symptoms, and provide necessary medications. In addition, it is important to establish an infection disease alarm and control system in psychiatric hospitals. The health authorities should hire specialists to monitor, implement and adopt the preventive and control measures for infectious diseases, and establish infectious units in psychiatric hospital settings 12.","Although, many studies have suggested the prognosis of confirmed MERS-Cov and the contribution of underlying comorbidities on the severity of the disease, yet no studies have highlighted the characteristics of those who tested positive with RT-PCR test among suspected cases, especially the contribution of medications. Thus, it is the intent of this paper is to identify factors associated with the MERS-CoV confirmation among suspected cases and impact on medications history on virus transmission.","Medication shortages occur when the total supply of a medication is insufficient to meet current or projected demands at the patient-level. 30 The reported frequency of medication shortages worldwide has been increasing in recent years and has been described as a healthcare crisis in itself. 30, 31 The underlying reasons for medication shortages under normal circumstances (i.e. in the absence of a pandemic) are complex and multifaceted and can include problems with ordering, manufacturing or distributing medications at a local or national level. 30, 32 The clinical consequences of medication shortages can be substantial and include increased patient safety risks such as medication errors and adverse patient outcomes. 30 Further adverse consequences of medication shortages include a drain on pharmacy resources whereby additional time needs to be devoted to either sourcing or compounding suitable therapeutic alternatives and liaising with clinicians to amend prescriptions. [33] [34] [35] Although guidelines and frameworks exist to aid health systems in managing medication shortages, 36, 37 no single approach can completely eliminate the clinical implications and associated risks for patients. Pharmacists are well positioned to reduce risks of further medication shortages arising from COVID-19 by reassuring patients and members of the public of the continued availability of OTC and prescription medications based on rational levels of demand and implementing policies to prevent unnecessary stockpiling. These could include limits on the quantity of medication dispensed (e.g. one month's supply at time). Preventing stockpiling of OTC medications may, however, prove more challenging.","Because of the risk of aerosolized virus particles or droplet spread of the virus, nebulizers for respiratory medications, such as albuterol (Salbutamol), were used only when absolutely necessary, and only under controlled situations, generally in a closed single room and with the health care worker in PAPR. Wherever possible, spacer devices, to which the medications' pocket inhalers could be connected, were substituted. Care was also taken when using nasal intermittent positive pressure ventilation devices for respiratory rehabilitation patients.","In this study, we retrospectively investigated the liver function change in SARS-CoV-2-infected patients from a single center study in Shanghai, China, and compared the clinical features, medications and length of stay of COVID-19 patients with/without liver damage. The purpose of this study is to clarify the clinical features of COVID-19-related liver damage, evaluate the association between current medications and liver damage, and therefore provide a reference for clinical treatment of patients with COVID-19."],"title":["Chapter 18 Viral Upper Respiratory Infection","Recommendations and guidance for providing pharmaceutical care services during COVID-19
