Many questions remain unanswered and should be addressed with urgency, including the infectiousness of cases over the duration of their illness-particularly how much transmission could occur from people who are unaware that they have illness, including asymptomatic and mildly symptomatic people. Initial reports suggest that live virus can be recovered from asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic people, 3 which is of great concern as it will make disease much harder to detect and therefore control. However, what contribution such people make to the overall epidemic is unknown. Additionally, the infection severity, including the infection-fatality rate across different ages and risk groups, must be established. Early reports provide estimates of case fatality of 2\u00b73% within China. 8 However, it is notoriously difficult to make such estimates early in an outbreak, 9 and it is clear that not all infections become cases and studies of many tiers of severity (deaths measured as a proportion of hospitalisations, notified cases and syndromic surveillance, and even potentially serosurveillance testing when available) will be needed to establish infection-fatality rates.","Coronaviruses are a group of enveloped viruses named for their coronary appearance with positive single-stranded RNA genomes [2] . In addition to six known strains of coronaviruses that are infectious to humans, a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) was detected recently in Wuhan, China [3, 4] . Like the other two highly pathogenic coronaviruses SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 also caused severe respiratory illness and even death. Moreover, the population's susceptibility to these highly pathogenic coronaviruses has contributed to large outbreaks and evolved into the public health events, highlighting the necessity to prepare for future reemergence or the novel emerging viruses [5] . Similar to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 is initiated by zoonotic transmission likely from bats and spreads rapidly among humans [6] . The basic reproduction number (R0) of person-to-person spread is about at 2.6, which means that the SARS-CoV-2 infected cases grow at an exponential rate. As of February 07, 2020, 57,620 cases of the SARS-CoV-2 have been reported in China, including 26,359 suspected cases, and a sustained increase is predictable. The initial patient cluster with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection was reported Wuhan pneumonia with unknown aetiology, which bore some resemblance to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infections and was associated with ICU admission and high mortality. Moreover, High concentrations of cytokines were recorded in plasma of patients requiring ICU admission, such as GCSF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNF\u03b1, suggesting that the cytokine storm was associated with disease severity [7] . A retrospective clinical study indicated the risk of fatality among hospitalized cases at 4.3% in single-center case series of 138 hospitalized patients [8] , and the infection fatality risk could be below 1% or even below 0.1% in a large number of undetected relatively mild infections [9] . However, It is challenging to judge the severity and predict the consequences with the information available so far. Since no specific antiviral treatment for COVID-19 is currently available, supportive cares, including symptomatic controls and prevention of complications remain the most critical therapeutic regimens, especially in preventing acute respiratory distress syndrome [10] . Although the control of SARS-CoV-2 still presents multiple challenges in the short term, more potent antiviral drugs are urgent to be developed [4] . At present, some drugs are effective in eliminating SARS-CoV-2 and improving symptoms. The most promising antiviral drug for SARS-CoV-2 is remdesivir that is currently under clinical development for the treatment of Ebola virus infection [11] . However, the efficacy and safety of remdesivir for SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia patients need to be assessed by further clinical trials. In addition, in the prevention and treatment of COVID-19, Tranditonal Chinese medicines have received broad adoption, especially in treating cases of mild symptoms [12] . Lianhuaqingwen (LH), a Chinese patent medicine composed of 13 herbs, has played a positive role in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2. A retrospective analysis of clinical records was conducted in the SARS-CoV-2 infected patients at Wuhan Ninth Hospital and CR &amp; WISCO General Hospital. LH combination could significantly relieve cardinal symptoms and reduce the course of the COVID-19 [13] , making it successively included in the Guideline for the Diagnosis and Treatment of Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) Pneumonia (On Trials, the Fourth/Fifth/Sixth/Seventh Edition) issued by National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China and also recommended by 20 provincial health commissions including Hubei, Beijing, and Shanghai as well as National Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine for the treatment of COVID-19. Moreover, LH exerted broad-spectrum effects on a series of influenza viruses by inhibiting viral propagation and regulating immune function and achieved similar therapeutic effectiveness with Oseltamivir in reducing the course of H1N1 virus infection [1, 14, 15] . Notably, the anti-influenza activity of LH in infected mice might depend on the regulation of cytokines, particularly in cytokine storm associated cytokines, such as IP-10, MCP-1, MIP1A, and TNF-\u03b1 [1] . In the present study, we evaluated the antiviral and anti-inflammatory efficiency of LH against a clinical isolate of SARS-CoV-2 from Guangzhou in vitro.","Evidence before this study We searched PubMed, medRxiv, bioRxiv, arXiv, SSRN, Research Square, Virological, and Wellcome Open Research for peer-reviewed articles, preprints, and research reports on the severity of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), using the search terms \"coronavirus\", \"2019-nCoV\", and similar terms, and \"fatality\", up to March 6, 2020. Several studies have estimated the case fatality ratio (the percentage of individuals with symptomatic or confirmed disease who die from the disease) and infection fatality ratio (the percentage of all infected individuals who die from the disease, including those with mild disease) of COVID-19 using a range of different statistical and modelling methods. Studies done solely in hospitalised patients report the highest fatality ratios (8-28%), representing the outcome for the most severely ill patients. Estimates of the population-level case fatality ratio from all case reports are in the range of 2-8%. Estimates of the infection fatality ratio averaged across all age-groups range from 0\u00b72% to 1\u00b76%, while estimates of the infection fatality ratio in the oldest age group (\u226580 years) range from 8% to 36%. None of the identified studies had adjusted for differences in the denominator populations to obtain estimates that could be applied across populations. No other studies have estimated the proportion of infected individuals who will require hospitalisation.","It is challenging to judge severity from the information available to date. We estimated the risk of death among hospitalised cases of around 14% (Figure 2). For both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infections, the risk of severe disease increases substantially with age and with the presence of underlying conditions [23-25]. One other caveat with estimating severity is that there can be long delays between hospitalisation and death for infections that are ultimately fatal. For SARS in Hong Kong, the average time from illness to death for fatal cases was 24 days [26]. This means that early estimates of the case fatality risk that ignore the potential outcomes of cases still in hospital are typically underestimates of the final severity profile [27]. We accounted for that by only including cases that either died or recovered in our estimate of the hospital fatality risk. Given that the cases reported outside Wuhan have mostly not been severe, it would be reasonable to infer that there might be a large number of undetected relatively mild infections in Wuhan and that the infection fatality risk is below 1% or even below 0.1%.","A mathematical model of MERS-CoV transmission in South Korea is suggested based on the model in Chowell et al [12]. It categorizes each individual into one of six epidemiological classes; susceptible (S), exposed (or high-risk latent) (E), symptomatic and infectious (I), infection but asymptomatic class (A), hospitalized (H), and recovery class (R). It is assumed that only infectious and hospitalized individuals can infect others and asymptomatic individuals cannot. In Chowell et al [12], the actual data of the zoonotic case were gathered so they were able to take secondary cases as well as index cases into account. By contrast, there was no zoonotic transmission except the primary case in South Korea, thus we do not consider the zoonotic case of MERS-CoV model in the present study. The model takes the following form:(1)dSdt=\u2212S\u03b2(I+lH)NdEdt=S\u03b2(I+lH)N\u2212\u03baEdIdt=\u03ba\u03c1E\u2212(\u03b3a+\u03b3I)IdAdt=\u03ba(1\u2212\u03c1)EdHdt=\u03b3aI\u2212\u03b3rHdRdt=\u03b3II+\u03b3rHwhere \u03b2 is the human-to-human transmission rate per unit time (day) and l quantifies the relative transmissibility of hospitalized patients; \u03ba is the rate at which an individual leaves the exposed class by becoming infectious (symptomatic or asymptomatic); \u03c1 is the proportion of progression from exposed class E to symptomatic infectious class I, and (1\u2212\u03c1) is that of progression to asymptomatic class; A; \u03b3a is the average rate at which symptomatic individuals hospitalize and \u03b3I is the recovery rate without being hospitalized; \u03b3r isthe recovery rate of hospitalized patients. Using these parameters, we will estimate the transmission rate (\u03b2) and transmissibility of hospitalized (l) in next section.","i.e. these instruments can be reprocessed according to best practice and returned to use. Optimal reprocessing standards must be observed. Additionally, dentists are reminded that any instruments labelled by the manufacturer as 'single use' should not be re-used under any circumstances. \u25a0 There is no reason why any of the categories of patients defined in Box 3.7 or their relatives should be refused routine dental treatment. They can be treated in the same way as any member of the general public. \u25a0 When patients 'at risk' of CJD/vCJD undergo maxillofacial surgery that may disrupt certain cranial nerves, CNS, orbit or lymphoid tissues of the head and neck, special infection control precautions may need to be taken, as described in the TSE Infection Control Guidance. \u25a0 There are several groups of patients who are identified as being at an additional risk of CJD (i.e. a risk over and above the risk in the general UK population that is around 1 in a million for sporadic CJD and is currently unknown for vCJD). These patients are considered 'at risk' of CJD for public health purposes. \u25a0 There has been a considerable increase in the number of patients classified as 'at risk' of vCJD due to the notification of patients considered at risk due to receipt of UK blood products. This number may increase further if more blood donors develop vCJD. \u25a0 Patients identified as 'at risk' of CJD (including vCJD) for public health purposes are asked to take the following precautions to reduce any possible risk of spreading CJD: \u2022 not to donate blood, organs or tissues \u2022 to inform health care staff before they undergo medical, surgical or dental treatment \u2022 to inform their families in case they need emergency surgery in the future. \u25a0 The health care professionals who notify these patients of their 'at risk' status have been asked to arrange for the information to be recorded in patients' hospital medical records and/or primary care notes. \u25a0 The responsibility for informing Primary Dental Carers lies with the patients themselves. \u25a0 When treating a patient with CJD, or a patient who informs you that he/she has been identified as 'at risk' of CJD, you should ensure that satisfactory standards of decontamination are observed. Under these conditions, routine dentistry is understood to be low risk, and therefore no special infection control precautions are advised for the instruments used on symptomatic or 'at risk' patients. Primary Dental Carers should also ensure information about patients' CJD status is included in any referrals for head and neck surgery. \u25a0 Dental health care staff infected or potentially infected with prion disease should not practise invasive clinical procedures if there is a risk of motor and cognitive dysfunction.","We estimated the hospital fatality risk, i.e. the risk of fatality among hospitalised cases [21] using the formula (fatal cases)/(fatal cases + recovered cases), which provides a more accurate early estimate of the hospital fatality risk compared with (fatal cases)/(all cases) [22]. We estimated the associated 95% CI for the hospital fatality risk using the binomial distribution. According to the update on 21 January 2020 when information on deaths and recoveries were reported, four cases had died while 25 had recovered, and our estimate of the hospital fatality risk is therefore 14% (95% CI: 3.9\u201332%). The estimate of the hospital fatality risk remained fairly stable over the 10 day period since the first death was announced on 11 January (Figure 2). If deaths continue to be reported without any corresponding increase in reported recoveries, the formula will overestimate the risk of fatality.","Sick people die from the disease (case fatality risk) 0.45% Given the relatively high quality of the healthcare systems in Europe, we considered the lower end of the range reported by the WHO for the infection fatality risk (IFR) of 0.3% to 1% (based on 3 publications) [21] . This IFR was then adjusted by the proportion assumed to be symptomatic (at 67%, as above) to give a case fatality risk (CFR) of 0.45% (i.e., 0.3% x 100%/67% = 0.45%). Nevertheless, we note that higher estimates exist, including a CFR for \"China outside of Hubei Province\" of 0.81% (95%CI: 0.67 to 0.98; and adjusted for the time delay in reporting deaths) [22] . Another CFR for \"China outside of Hubei Province\" was similar, at 0.9% (95% credible interval: 0.6-1.3%; also adjusted for the time delay in reporting deaths) [23] . A value","Given these estimates of the incubation period, we predicted the number of symptomatic infections we would expect to miss over the course of an active monitoring program. We classified persons as being at high risk if they have a 1-in-100 chance of developing a symptomatic infection after exposure. For an active monitoring program lasting 7 days, the expected number of symptomatic infections missed for every 10 000 high-risk persons monitored is 21.2 (99th percentile, 36.5) (Table 2 and Figure 3). After 14 days, it is highly unlikely that further symptomatic infections would be undetected among high-risk persons (mean, 1.0 undetected infections per 10 000 persons [99th percentile, 4.8]). However, substantial uncertainty remains in the classification of persons as being at \u201chigh,\u201d \u201cmedium,\u201d or \u201clow\u201d risk for being symptomatic, and this method does not consider the role of asymptomatic infection. We have created an application to estimate the proportion of missed COVID-19 cases across any active monitoring duration up to 100 days and various population risk levels (16).","Today, hospital-acquired, antibiotic resistance may occur in both gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial (Table  9 .2). Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was first described in 1968 (Zitterkopf, 2008) . Bacterial culture on chromagar requires greater than 24 hours for MRSA growth. Meanwhile, the patient being tested should be in isolation, since MRSA transmission in 24 hours from person to person may be as high as 5% to 15%, depending on the distance between the two individuals. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with probes to identify the mecA gene, which encodes methicillin resistance, can decrease the turnaround time for detection to 2-4 hours and is more sensitive than culture. Since this screening assay is currently not reimbursed for hospitalized patients, this effort to reduce MRSA prevalence in the hospital becomes an exercise in cost avoidance. The additional cost for caring for a patient with an MRSA infection ranges from $27,000 to $35,000 per patient compared to a patient with methicillinsensitive S. aureus (Zitterkopf, 2008) . The rate of subsequent MRSA infection after identification of MRSA colonization is approximately 30% (Davis et al., 2004) . The dilemma rests in the ethical question related to who should be screened. There are two viewpoints. The first approach would screen all hospitalized patients at the time of admission. The other approach uses targeted active surveillance, only screening patients at a high risk for MRSA colonization or infection. Examples of high-risk groups are listed Table 9 .3. The goal of each of these screening programs is to eradicate MRSA from the patient to reduce the risk of subsequent MRSA infection during the hospitalization. Healthcare workers at the hospital and the patient's relatives are usually not included in these MRSA screening programs since the goal of the program is not complete eradication of MRSA in a community. The carbapenem-hydrolyzing \ue062-lactamase known as K. pneumoniae carbapenemase produces a resistant strain associated with a higher mortality in infected patients compared to patients infected with carbapenem-sensitive strains. The use of surveillance cultures can identify the population of asymptomatic colonized patients and enhance the effectiveness of a carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae infection prevention program (Calfee and Jenkins, 2008) . This ","were associated with a poor clinical outcome. 11 Moreover, a substantially 18 elevated case-fatality rate included the following patient characteristics: male sex, \u2265 60 years of age, baseline diagnosis of severe pneumonia, and delay in diagnosis. 15 Similarly, the China CDC reported that patients aged \u2265 80 years had the highest case fatality rate, 14.8%, among different age groups, and the case fatality rate of patients in which disease severity was critical was 49.0%. 8 Together, these findings suggest that old age and increased disease severity could predict a poor outcome.","were associated with a poor clinical outcome. 11 Moreover, a substantially 18 elevated case-fatality rate included the following patient characteristics: male sex, \u2265 60 years of age, baseline diagnosis of severe pneumonia, and delay in diagnosis. 15 Similarly, the China CDC reported that patients aged \u2265 80 years had the highest case fatality rate, 14.8%, among different age groups, and the case fatality rate of patients in which disease severity was critical was 49.0%. 8 Together, these findings suggest that old age and increased disease severity could predict a poor outcome.","As pandemic infl uenza H1N1 spread around the world in 2009, disease severity was one of the main areas of interest. The case fatality ratio (CFR) is a representative measurement of severity of a disease that directly captures virulence (ie, the conditional risk of death for patients with a disease or infection), whereas mortality (ie, the risk of death in a population) depends not only on the disease severity but also the risk of infection in a population. Because there have been several confl icting estimates of the CFR for pandemic H1N1, 1-6 I off er an interpretation of these reports and identify key areas that need to be clarifi ed.","Our cCFR estimates of 5.3% and 8.4% indicate that the severity of COVID-19 is not as high as that of other diseases caused by coronaviruses, including severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), which had an estimated CFR of 17% in Hong Kong [9,10,20], and Middle East respiratory syndrome, which had an estimated CFR of 20% in South Korea [21]. Nonetheless, considering the overall magnitude of the ongoing epidemic, a 5%\u20138% risk of death is by no means insignificant. In addition to quantifying the overall risk of death, future research must identify groups at risk of death (e.g., the elderly and people with underlying comorbidities) [22,23]. Moreover, considering that about 9% of all infected individuals are ascertained and reported [24], the infection fatality risk (IFR), i.e., the risk of death among all infected individuals, would be on the order of 0.5% to 0.8%.","Our cCFR estimates of 5.3% and 8.4% indicate that the severity of COVID-19 is not as high as that of other diseases caused by coronaviruses, including severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), which had an estimated CFR of 17% in Hong Kong [9, 10, 20] , and Middle East respiratory syndrome, which had an estimated CFR of 20% in South Korea [21] . Nonetheless, considering the overall magnitude of the ongoing epidemic, a 5%-8% risk of death is by no means insignificant. In addition to quantifying the overall risk of death, future research must identify groups at risk of death (e.g., the elderly and people with underlying comorbidities) [22, 23] .

To understand the severity of infection, i.e., the virulence of the causative agent of COVID-19, the common epidemiological practice is to estimate the case fatality risk (CFR) as the risk of death among cases (for the sake of practical interpretation, we refer to it as the case fatality risk rather than the case fatality rate [2]). Depending on the CFR value, the government response toward COVID-19 may vary, and estimates of CFR can also influence the strictness of policy judgement and the extent of containment and mitigation measures. For instance, a well-known CFR estimate for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in Hong Kong in 2003 was approximately 17% [3], roughly indicating that one out of five diagnosed cases would die of the disease. SARS containment measures were implemented as early as possible due to high estimates of CFR. The total volume of deaths, i.e., mortality, is determined by the product of the CFR and the total number of cases; it should be remembered that our perceived severity of the COVID-19 epidemic can be directly influenced by the absolute number of deaths.","In December 2019, Wuhan, China witnessed the outbreak of the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) that would soon become an international public health emergency and world pandemic. 1 In the U.S., we are at a time where preparation for healthcare systems is critical. Given the rapidity with which the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) is spreading, we can expect an increased burden of cancer patients diagnosed with COVID-19 at oncology treatment clinics and a need to address this diagnosis. As of the date of this writing, the U.S. has witnessed an increase in confirmed cases, not far behind the large outbreaks of European countries. 2, 3 Since the outbreak in Wuhan, Chinese researchers have published on their experience with COVID- 19 and have highlighted high-risk groups, including, the elderly and patients with comorbidities, including cancer. In one of the largest series reported from Wuhan, elderly patients were at a higher risk for disease severity with an 8.0% case fatality rate in those aged 70 to 79 years, and 14.8% in those aged 80 years and older. 4 The case fatality rate for cancer patients in that cohort was notably higher than noncancer patients at 5.6% versus 2.1% in the whole sample; it must be noted that this series is very small. How these numbers will evolve in the U.S. population remains to be determined. Based on available data, the impact of patients both at risk for and suffering from COVID-19 will be felt throughout oncology clinics. The burden this may have on Radiation Oncology clinics is of particular concern, due to the potential need for screening of patients for daily treatment, treatment interruptions, delays in restarting treatment, and a decreased workforce.","It is recommended that high-risk groups be vaccinated annually, because the severity of the season will only be known in retrospect. High-risk groups include children aged 6 to 23 months; people aged 65 or older; residents of long-term care facilities; adults and children who have chronic illnesses, including asthma, diabetes, and immunosuppression; and pregnant women. In 2000, 73 million people in the United States were considered high-risk [4] . Unfortunately, up to 50% of these high-risk patients do not receive annual vaccination.","The findings reported here are in keeping with current knowledge that the elderly and those with comorbidities are more susceptible to severe infection. those with: cardiovascular disease (10.5%), diabetes (7.3%), chronic respiratory disease (6.3%) and hypertension (6.0%) (19) . Unlike the China CDC study (19) that presented case fatality rates for different groups, our findings compare those with particular comorbidities to those without, allowing us to estimate the effect of a particular comorbidity on COVID-19 severity. Although we did not investigate death (and included COPD rather than chronic respiratory disease), our analysis similarly suggests that comorbidities are not uniform in terms of the risk of severe COVID-19 disease. Despite being uncommon in our study population, COPD was by far the strongest risk factor for COVID-19 severity, followed by CVD and hypertension.","The demographic characteristics of case-patients with probable SARS are shown in Table 2. Children &lt;10 years of age accounted for 0.9% of probable cases, and the median age of those who became ill was 33 years. Age-specific attack rates were highest in those 20\u201339 years of age (relative risk [RR] 1.7, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.53 to 1.89, compared with those 40\u201364years, and significantly lower in children (1\u20134 years of age, RR 0.12 [CI 0.05 to 0.28], 5\u20139 years, RR 0.17 [CI 0.09 to 0.31] and 10\u201319 years, RR 0.53 [CI 0.44 to 0.64], compared with those aged 40\u201364 years). Overall, male patients had similar rates as female patients, but the risk differed significantly in certain age groups: among those 10\u201319 years of age, the RR for SARS in male patients was 1.96, 95% CI 1.36 to 1.83, compared with that of females; and in those &gt;75 years, RR for male patients was 1.88 (95% CI 1.08 to 3.29) (Figure 3). The attack rate for probable SARS among healthcare workers in Beijing is estimated as 465 per 100,000. Consistent with the case definitions in use in Beijing during the outbreak, chest x-ray changes were evident in &gt;85% of probable case-patients. As of May 20, the case-fatality rate was 6.4% for probable SARS case-patients. Case-fatality rates increased with age (0.5% in &lt;20 year olds; 4.8% for those 20\u201364 years; and 27.7% for &gt;65 years of age, p &lt; 0.001). By June 16, 2003, a total of 190 deaths among 2,521 probable SARS case-patients were reported from Beijing, and 2,053 patients had been discharged from the hospital. The case fatality rate among probable case-patients, excluding those still hospitalized, was 8.4%.","As of end of December 2018, the global case fatality rate for MERS-CoV infection was reported as 35.3% (806/2279). It is thought this number overestimates the case fatality rate of the disease, because milder and asymptomatic cases are likely to be underrepresented in the reported cases. This was suggested in a study that estimated the number of undetected human symptomatic cases to be 62% (Cauchemez et al., 2014) . In a cohort of 47 MERS-CoV infected patients, case fatality rate was higher with increasing age (Assiri et al., 2013a) . In another study that studied 939 MERS-CoV infected patients, independent risk factors for mortality were, age more 80 years, underlying cardiac comorbidity or cancer, and healthcare acquisition of the virus (Alsahafi and Cheng, 2016) . In a South Korean cohort of 159 patients, risk factors for death were older age and underlying comorbidities (Majumder et al., 2015) .","The lack of widespread testing, national surveillance and standardized data collection, as well as the potential sampling bias in sicker, hospitalized patients with more comorbidities such as CVD has complicated efforts to accurately estimate the prevalence of CVD in patients with COVID-19. Moreover, there is marked variation in testing by country. A number of studies in the available literature suggest an association between preexisting CVD and severe COVID-19, which are summarized in Tables 1 and 2 . A meta-analysis of six studies inclusive of 1,527 patients with COVID-19 examined the prevalence of CVD and reported the prevalence of hypertension, cardiac and cerebrovascular disease, and diabetes to be 17.1%, 16.4%, and 9.7%, respectively (4). Patients who required intensive care unit (ICU) admission were more likely to have these comorbidities compared to non-ICU patients. Increased case-fatality rates in the previously referenced analysis of 44,672 confirmed COVID-19 cases from Wuhan, China were noted in patients with CVD (10.5%), diabetes (7.3%), hypertension (6.0%), all notably higher than the overall case-fatality rate of 2.3% (15) . Several smaller cohort studies have yielded similar results suggesting higher risk for adverse events in patients with CVD who contract COVID-19, although biases related to testing and standardized data apply here as well (1, 19, (25) (26) (27) (28) . Notably, while reports outside of China are limited, data from Italy suggest similar mortality rates and an elevated risk for death in patients with comorbidities (29) . As emerging international data become available, analysis from multinational cohorts can help inform risk stratification for severe disease especially for patients with prior CVD.","Many factors associated with risk of infant hospitalization have been found such as preterm birth, chronic lung disease, congenital heart disease, low birth weight, acquired or congenital immunodeficiency along with others. However, around half of infants hospitalized by HRSV infection are otherwise healthy. To date, very few protective factors have been found, although breast feeding, and the level of maternally derived antibodies correlate with a decreased likelihood of hospitalization. There is debate over whether there are any viral determinants of disease severity. Various studies suggest that serotype A viruses are more virulent, while others suggest serotype B causes more severe disease. Other studies show no particular impact of viral serotype on disease severity. However, it is established that a higher viral load is associated with increased risk of severe disease; a higher viral load on day 3 of hospitalization was found to be associated with an increased risk of admittance to the intensive care unit (ICU) and respiratory failure.","Using these estimates of the incubation period, we quantified the expected number of undetected symptomatic cases in an active monitoring program, adapting a method detailed by Reich and colleagues (14). We accounted for varying durations of the active monitoring program (1 to 28 days) and individual risk for symptomatic infection (low risk: 1-in-10 000 chance of infection; medium risk: 1-in-1000 chance; high risk: 1-in-100 chance; infected: 1-in-1 chance). For each bootstrapped set of parameter estimates from the log-normal model, we calculated the probability of a symptomatic infection developing after an active monitoring program of a given length for a given risk level. This model conservatively assumes that persons are exposed to SARS-CoV-2 immediately before the active monitoring program and assumes perfect ascertainment of symptomatic cases that develop under active monitoring. We report the mean and 99th percentile of the expected number of undetected symptomatic cases for each active monitoring scenario.","The crude case fatality ratio (CFR), the number of reported deaths divided by the number of reported cases at a specific time point, is not a reliable indicator of overall mortality [8, 2] . Other reported measures such as the confirmed, symptomatic or hospitalized CFR, based on different denominators, are sometimes used, adding confusion. The crude CFR can be misleading if used to assess the overall mortality because of two opposing biases [9, 10] . First, because of the delay of several weeks between disease onset and death, the number of confirmed and reported Covid-19 deaths at a certain time point does not consider the total number of deaths that will occur among already infected individuals (right-censoring). Second, surveillance-based Covid-19 case reports underestimate the total number of SARS-CoV-2-infected patients, because testing focuses on symptomatic individuals, and, among symptomatic cases, on patients with more severe manifestations (preferential ascertainment). It is often assumed that the crude CFR overestimates true mortality [11] , but it depends on the relative influence of the two opposing biases, so it could differ in different situations.","The main symptoms found in our study group were tachypnea, followed by fever and cough. The H1N1-positive subgroup presented a higher frequency of fever, cough and tachypnea and lower leukocyte count when compared to the H1N1-negative subgroup. Cough is a characteristic of H1N1 infection, [21] [22] [23] as well as leukopenia. 9 In Taiwan, leukopenia was found in 64.2% of cases and was more frequent in H1N1positive. 22 During the 2009 pandemic, H1N1 was more frequent in young adults and in children younger than five years of age. 6, [24] [25] [26] In addition, the incidence of SARI for H1N1 was higher in children younger than two years 24 and this group was included as a priority in the first vaccination campaigns in Brazil. 13 This phenomenon can be explained by the high susceptibility of children to H1N1, a virus with a high potential for transmission and completely new to the pediatric population, who had no antibodies with cross-reactivity. 27, 28 In our study, however, H1N1-positive children were older than the H1N1-negative children. Although this may have been only an effect of the small sample size, other studies have found similar results. 6, 21, 29 The main hypothesis raised by some of these authors is that the presence of previous acquired nonprotective antibodies in older children and young adults might lead to a cross-reaction with the H1N1 virus, which could lead to immunecomplex formation and severe lung disease. 29 Smaller children would have a less robust immune response to H1N1 virus, preventing progression to immune-mediated lung disease. 21 Another possible explanation would be an earlier and more aggressive treatment in younger children, because they are a risk group. 21 In our study, chest X-ray imaging showed diffuse infiltrates in 52.8% of the cases and alveolar consolidations in 43.4%, which is consistent with previously published studies. 4 We observed a high case fatality rate of 15.5%, possibly related to the severity of illness in our study population, which is comparable to literature data. A fatality rate of 18.6% was found in a German study with a similar population of PICUadmitted children during the pandemic period. 20 In Porto Alegre, Brazil, 10 a fatality rate of 9.1% was described among younger hospitalized children.","A great deal of concern has been directed toward the expected burden of COVID-19 in low and middle income countries (LMIC), which have lower population median age than many high income countries. Our results show that these demographic differences, coupled with a lower symptomatic fraction in younger ages, can result in proportionally fewer clinical cases than would be expected in higher-income countries with flatter demographic pyramids. This should not be interpreted as few cases in LMIC, because the projected epidemics are still very large, resulting in high numbers infected. Moreover, the particular relationship found with age here is drawn from high income countries, primarily in East Asia, and may reflect not only age, but also the increasing frequency of comorbidities with age. This relationship, therefore, may differ in LMIC for two key reasons: first, the distribution of non-communicable comorbid conditions-which are already known to increase the risk of severe disease from COVID-19 21 may be differently distributed by age, often occurring in younger age groups 34 , along with other possible risk factors such as undernutrition 36 ; and second, communicable comorbidities such as HIV 33 , TB coinfection (which has been suggested to increase risk 37 ), and others 38 may alter the distribution of severe outcomes by age. Observed severity and burden in LMIC may also be higher due to a lack of health system capacity for intensive treatment of severe cases.","While vaccine development continues, prophylactic use of polyclonal RSV intravenous immunoglobulin (RespiGam) or human anti-F monoclonal antibodies (palivizumab and motavizumab \u2013 which is not yet licensed for use) in high-risk infants has been shown to reduce the risk of RSV-associated acute lower respiratory tract infections and disease severity (121). Palivizumab is a human, monoclonal antibody targeted to block viral infected cells from fusing with adjacent cells (122). Palivizumab has been shown to be most effective in high-risk populations, specifically premature infants and those with chronic lung disease or congenital heart disease (123). The use of palivizumab as treatment for RSV infection in mechanically ventilated pediatric patients has not been shown to be effective (124). Furthermore, studies have also shown that palivizumab prophylaxis in these patients has a limited effect on the total disease burden of RSV infection, including overall RSV-related hospital admissions and resource utilization (12, 125). Although not approved for use in the United States, motavizumab, the second-generation derivative of palivizumab, decreased viral load compared with placebo (126). However, in a more recent study of hospitalized RSV infected infants treated with motavizumab or placebo, no antiviral effect was demonstrated (127). Furthermore, both therapies produce only temporary, passive immunity (128).","We found that lack of strength, a symptom often neglected by clinical physicians, was a significant manifestation of COVID-19 patients. Although the degree of lack of strength seemed unrelated to disease severity at the onset of initial symptoms, this symptom was never alleviated in hospitalized patients and continued to exacerbate over time. On the other hand, this symptom was nearly gone on day 4 in non-hospitalized patients( figure 3D ). In addition, we observed that the mental state of Furthermore, while muscle soreness was significantly alleviated on day 4 for both non-hospitalized and hospitalized patients(figure 3F), the progression of diarrhea was inconsistent for both groups of patients, which may be associated with the side effects of certain antiviral drugs( figure 3G ).","The copyright holder for this preprint . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.25.20043679 doi: medRxiv preprint Hokkaido. Fig. 1 suggests that Hokkaido was not or incompletely exposed to S type and the current epidemic is due to the L type. Mathematical modeling has shown that undocumented infections of SARS-CoV-2 were the infection source for most documented cases. 7 Because children infected with SARS-CoV-2 are asymptomatic 8 or mildly symptomatic, 4 Europe has become the center of the pandemic. But why mortality rates vary from country to country remains enigmatic. We arranged influenza epidemic curves of European countries in descending order of COVID-19 mortality (Supplementary Figs. 1 and 2). There seems to be a pattern in the curve related to COVID-19 case fatality rates (CFR). Depending on the likelihood of S-type SRS-CoV-2 transmission, a scoring system was developed to model the mortality-related curve patterns. As shown in Fig. 3 , this score correlates with the SARS-CoV-2 CFR in each country, implying that the extent of S type SARS-CoV-2 transmission determines the severity of the current infection. This scoring system is useful as a country-specific COVID-19 severity risk score. As shown in Fig. 4 , the risk score reveals geographic effects on the spread of the","Our estimate of the case fatality ratio is substantially lower than the crude case fatality ratio obtained from China based on the cases and deaths observed to date, which is currently 3\u00b767%, as well as many of the estimates currently in the literature. The principle reason for this difference is that the crude estimate does not take into account the severity of cases. For example, various estimates have been made from patient populations ranging from those with generally milder symptoms (for example international travellers detected through screening of travel history) 13 through to those identified in the hospital setting. 14, 15 It is clear from the data that have emerged from China that case fatality ratio increases substantially with age. Our results suggest a very low fatality ratio in those under the age of 20 years. As there are very few cases in this age group, it remains unclear whether this reflects a low risk of death or a difference in susceptibility, although early results indicate young people are not at lower risk of infection than adults. 28 Serological testing in this age group will be crucial in the coming weeks to understand the significance of this age group in driving population transmission. The estimated increase in severity with age is clearly reflected in case reports, in which the mean age tends to be in the range of 50-60 years. Different surveillance systems will pick up a different age case mix, and we find that those with milder symptoms detected through a history of travel are younger on average than those detected through hospital surveillance.","Objectives: Two different indexes have been developed for prediction of the 30-day mortality in community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). The pneumonia severity index (PSI) score is calculated from 19 parameters, and divides the patients into severity risk classes I-V, while the CURB-65 score is based on 5 parameters (confusion, urea value, respiration rate, blood pressure, and age) and yields a score of 0-5. We aimed to compare the two scores for identification of CAP patients with low and high risk of death. Methods: The records of all patients hospitalized at our clinic with a discharge code of CAP during a 4-year period were retrospectively screened. Patients with chest X-ray infiltrates and two symptoms indicating CAP were included in the study. The PSI and CURB-65 scores were calculated, and data on survival at day 30 from admission was collected from the population register. Clinical features not specified were considered normal. Results: Among 705 identified episodes of CAP an initial serum-urea value was available in 612. Thirty-four of these episodes (5.6%) were followed by death within 30 days. The table shows the distribution of the PSI risk classes and the CURB-65 score correlated to the 30-day mortality.","To understand the clinical burden of MERS, it is necessary to quantify the risk of developing severe clinical manifestations. The case fatality risk (CFR) is a measure of the risk of death among those who satisfy the case condition [5], while risks of admission to an intensive care unit (ICU) and that of requiring mechanical ventilation are also useful to measure the extent of developing severe MERS complications. However, it is not only necessary to estimate such risks, but it is also critically important to identify epidemiological determinants of those risks to then predict the risk of severe complications for each patient before the onset of disease exacerbation [6]. In previous studies, the risk of death among secondary cases was estimated based on statistical modelling and was found to range from 20 to 22%, approximately [7\u201311]. Meanwhile, among the primary cases, the risk of death was estimated to be greater at approximately 40%, perhaps because of biases associated with case detection and diagnosis [6\u20138]. As for epidemiological determinants of MERS death, elderly patients with underlying comorbidities have been identified as the most susceptible population with a high risk of death [6, 9, 11].","As a household contact, Patient 2 was the only community member who had a high-risk exposure. He became a PUI and subsequently the only other patient with COVID-19 in this investigation. Of the remaining 43 PUIs, all tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 while symptomatic; 32 of these PUIs were health-care personnel and 11 were community contacts. Although 18 (41%) of 44 PUIs had low-risk exposures, 26 (59%) had exposures of medium risk or greater. 32 health-care personnel contacts who were not PUIs had one-time nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal specimens collected 7-14 days after their highest-risk exposure. All of these exposures occurred on or after the date of first positive specimen collection of a patient with COVID-19. 21 (66%) of these asymptomatic health-care personnel had exposures of medium risk or greater. All were negative for SARS-CoV-2 at the time of testing.","J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Background New coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19) is a health emergency due to its high infectiousness [1] and high case fatality in critically ill patients. The pathological and physiological processes and diagnostic methods of COVID-19 are still in the exploratory stage. Clinical monitoring and appropriate treatment strategies were essential to improve case fatality. CT scan played an important role in assessing the disease [2] . Other sensitive indicators able to reflect lung lesion changes and disease severity had to be explored. C-reactive protein (CRP) levels can be used in the early diagnosis of pneumonia [3] , and patients presenting with severe pneumonia had high CRP levels. We assessed the correlation between CRP levels, lung lesions, and disease severity to provide reference for clinical treatment.","Patients with underlying cardiovascular comorbidities are at increased risk of morbidity and mortality from SARS-CoV-2 infection (39) . Studies so far have not detailed in a granular fashion the risk of individual cardiovascular complications in patients with underlying cardiovascular disease who are infected with SARS-CoV-2. While no studies on COVID-19 have included patients with congenital heart disease, it stands to reason that patients with congenital heart disease could be considered at higher risk for complications from COVID-19. Certain adult patients with congenital heart disease (ACHD) are likely at higher risk than others. Based on the ACHD Anatomy and Physiological Stage Classification, any patient with complex congenital heart disease (Anatomy Stage III) or Physiological Stage B, C, or D symptoms could be considered high risk for complications related to COVID-19 infection on the basis of decreased functional reserve (50) ( Table 2) . Those with reduced immunity, including Down syndrome, DiGeorge syndrome and asplenia may be at even higher risk for poor outcomes with COVID-19 infection. Studies have tried to risk-stratify patients suffering from a viral pneumonia (51) , and the MuLBSTA score may be a tool providers can use to see which patients are at high risk of decompensation and death (31) .","The COVID-19 pandemics is posing unprecedented challenges and threats to patients and 28 healthcare systems worldwide. Acute respiratory complications that require intensive care unit 29 (ICU) management are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in COVID-19 patients. Patients 30 with worst outcomes and higher mortality are reported to include immunocompromised 31 subjects, namely older adults and polymorbid individuals and malnourished people in general. 32 ICU stay, polymorbidity and older age are all commonly associated with high risk for 33 malnutrition, representing per se a relevant risk factor for higher morbidity and mortality in 34 chronic and acute disease. Also importantly, prolonged ICU stays are reported to be required 35 for COVID-19 patients stabilization, and longer ICU stay may per se directly worsen or cause 36 malnutrition, with severe loss of skeletal muscle mass and function which may lead to disability, 37 poor quality of life and additional morbidity. Prevention, diagnosis and treatment of 38 malnutrition should therefore be routinely included in the management of COVID-19 patients. 39 In the current document, the European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism (ESPEN) 40 aims at providing concise guidance for nutritional management of COVID-19 patients by 41 proposing 10 practical recommendations. The practical guidance is focused to those in the ICU 42 setting or in the presence of older age and polymorbidity, which are independently associated 43 with malnutrition and its negative impact on patient survival. The breaking of a COVID-19 pandemic is posing unprecedented challenges and threats to 48 patients and healthcare systems worldwide (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) . The disease primarily involves the respiratory 49 tract (1-5) but it may deteriorate to multi-organ failure and be fatal (3). Acute respiratory 50 complications that are reported to require prolonged ICU stays are a major cause of morbidity 51 and mortality in COVID-19 patients, and older adults and polymorbid individuals have worst 52 outcomes and higher mortality (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) . ICU stays, and particularly their longer duration, are per se 53 well-documented causes of malnutrition, with loss of skeletal muscle mass and function which 54 in turn may lead to poor quality of life, disability and morbidities long after ICU discharge (6). 55 Many chronic diseases such as diabetes and cardiovascular diseases and their clustering in 56 polymorbid individuals (7) as well as older age per se (8) are also very commonly associated 57 with high risk and prevalence of malnutrition and worse outcomes. Causes of ICU-and disease-58 related malnutrition include reduced mobility, catabolic changes particularly in skeletal muscle 59 as well as reduced food intake, all of which may be exacerbated in older adults (6-8). In (Table   101 1). According to GLIM, diagnosis of malnutrition requires at least 1 phenotypic criterion and 1 102 etiologic criterion. 103 The above considerations appear to be fully applicable to patients at risk for severe SARS-CoV-2 104 infection or hospitalized for COVID-19 infection, since poor outcomes in COVID-19 are reported 105 in patients that are most likely to present with malnutrition (such as older adults and comorbid 106 individuals). Preserving nutritional status and preventing or treating malnutrition also 107 importantly has the potential to reduce complications and negative outcomes in patients at 108 nutritional risk who might incur in COVID-19 in the future. In particular, COVID-19 can be 109 accompanied by nausea, vomiting and diarrhea impairing food intake and absorption (2), thus a 110 good nutritional status is an advantage for people at risk for severe COVID-19. In a recent 111 6 review about potential interventions for novel coronavirus based on the Chinese experience 112 authors suggested that the nutritional status of each infected patient should be evaluated 113 before the administration of general treatments (11) . 114 Looking at influenza infections, particular predictors of mortality could be identified by 115 multivariate analysis such as type of virus (OR 7.1), malnutrition (OR 25.0), hospital-acquired 116 infection (OR 12.2), respiratory insufficiency (OR 125.8) and pulmonary infiltrate on X-ray (OR 117 6.0) were identified as predictors (12) . It should be considered that also malnourished children (11) . Malnutrition and famine were associated with high disease severity 130 and was related to mortality also in the younger population. Undernutrition remains a problem 131 for viral pandemics of the twenty-first century and beyond. Indeed, chronic malnutrition was 132 thought to have contributed to the high morbidity and mortality seen in Guatemalan children 133 7 during the 2009 influenza pandemic (12) . In a future virus pandemic, we might face a \"double 134 burden\" of malnutrition, when both undernutrition and overnutrition will promote severity of 135 disease. It is now well accepted that obesity increases one's risk of being hospitalized with, and 136 dying from, an influenza virus infection, and that obesity inhibits both virus-specific CD8+ T cell 137 responses and antibody responses to the seasonal influenza vaccine (11) . The challenge for 138 future virus pandemics is therefore not only to protect those affected by undernutrition, but 139 also the growing number of people living with obesity (11) . This is particularly important for the 140 WHO European Region as in many European countries obesity and overweight affects 30-70% 141 of the population. (14) In a recent Japanese study, malnutrition and pneumonia were identified 142 as the prognostic factors in influenza infection, which are amenable to medical intervention. 143 Using Cox proportional hazards modeling with prescribed independent variables, male sex, 144 severity score, serum albumin levels, and pneumonia were associated with survival 30 days 145 from the onset of influenza (13). 146 We provide suggestions based on various ESPEN Guidelines, with particular regard to those on 147 polymorbid internal medicine patients (7) and those on geriatrics (8). We refer the reader to 255 We suggest that general guidance on prevention and treatment of malnutrition by using ONS is 276 targets. 277 Enteral nutrition should be implemented when nutritional needs cannot be met by the oral 278 route, e.g if oral intake is expected to be impossible for more than three days or expected to be 279 below half of energy requirements for more than one week. In these cases, the use of EN may General comments: When patients are stabilized and even in prone position, enteral feeding 369 can be started ideally after measuring indirect calorimetry targeting energy supply to 30% of 370 the measured energy expenditure. Energy administration will be increased progressively. 371 During emergency times, the predictive equation recommending 20 kcal/kg/day could be used 372 and energy increased to 50-70% of the predictive energy at day 2 to reach 80-100% at day 4.","is the (which was not peer-reviewed) The copyright holder for this preprint . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03. 15.20036707 doi: medRxiv preprint patient subgroups which demonstrated a different viral shedding pattern and our results is likely applicable to COVID-19 patients generally. Whereas a recent study from Wuhan reported that virus was detected for a median of 20 days (up to 37 days amongst survivors) after symptom onset, 11 infectiousness may decline significantly after 10 days. 12 Together this supports our findings that the infectiousness profile may more closely resemble that of influenza than of SARS (Figure 1a ), although we did not have data on viral shedding before symptom onset for COVID-19. 9, 13 Our results are also supported by reports on asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic transmission. 14, 15 For a reproductive number of 2.5, 2 contact tracing and isolation alone are less likely to be successful if more than 30% of transmission occurred before symptom onset, unless &gt;90% of the contacts can be traced. 16 Such high ascertainment is more likely achievable if the definition of contacts covered 2-3 days prior to symptom onset of the index case, as is being done in Hong Kong since 22 February and in mainland China since 21 February. Even when control strategy is shifting away from containment to mitigation as the pandemic unfolds, contact tracing would still be an important measure, such as when there are superspreading events that may occur in frail and high-risk groups such as nursing homes or hospitals. Preliminary indications of pre-symptomatic infectivity of COVID-19 cases has already prompted enhanced pre-emptive preventive measures in the nosocomial setting and in the community, especially for high risk groups such as older adults and those with pre-existing medical conditions. With a substantial proportion of pre-symptomatic transmission, measures such as enhanced personal hygiene among the general population .

Data from two randomized, double-blind studies of adults hospitalized for CAP have demonstrated that parenteral azithromycin monotherapy was as effective as intravenous cefuroxime therapy with or without intravenous erythromycin (the azalide monotherapy regimen had greater tolerability) [63, 64] . Feldman et al [65] reviewed the records of patients with CAP who were admitted to a Veterans Affairs facility between December 1997 and July 2001 and compared the outcomes of patients who received azithromycin monotherapy with the outcomes of patients who received ATS-recommended antibiotics or non-ATS-recommended antibiotics. Outcomes included time to stability, length of stay (LOS), and mortality and were adjusted for severity of illness (mean PSI score: 89.2 for azithromycin group versus 95.0 for the ATS groups; P = 0.07) and processes of care. Patients requiring ICU management were excluded. Mortality and re-admission rates were similar among the groups, but mean LOS was shorter in the azithromycin group. None of the 10 patients with erythromycin-resistant S pneumoniae infections died or was transferred to the ICU, including the six patients who received azithromycin. In a retrospective analysis of the impact of initial antibiotic choice on 30-day mortality rates in patients admitted to the hospital for CAP, Brown et al [66] observed that patients who received monotherapy with macrolides had the lowest mortality rate, but were the least ill. Such patients were younger and were more likely to be in low-risk groups.","Box 3.7 TSE Infection Control Guidelines: categorisation of patients by risk 1. Symptomatic patients 1.1 Patients who fulfil the diagnostic criteria for definite, probable or possible CJD or vCJD (see text for diagnostic criteria). 1.2 Patients with neurological disease of unknown aetiology who do not fit the criteria for possible CJD or vCJD, but where the diagnosis of CJD is being actively considered. 2. Asymptomatic patients at risk from familial forms of CJD linked to genetic mutations 2.1 Individuals who have or have had two or more blood relatives affected by CJD or other prion disease, or a relative known to have a genetic mutation indicative of familial CJD. 2.2 Individuals who have been shown by specific genetic testing to be at significant risk of developing CJD or other prion disease. 3. Asymptomatic patients potentially at risk from iatrogenic exposure* 3.1 Recipients of hormone derived from human pituitary glands, e.g. growth hormone, gonadotrophin. 3.2 Individuals who have received a graft of dura mater (people who underwent neurosurgical procedures or operations for a tumour or cyst of the spine before August 1992 may have received a graft of dura mater, and should be treated as at risk, unless evidence can be provided that dura mater was not used). 3.3 Patients who have been contacted as potentially 'at risk' because of exposure to instruments used on, or receipt of blood, plasma derivatives, organs or tissues donated by, a patient who went on to develop CJD or vCJD**.","The symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, dry cough, fatigue, nasal congestion, sore throat and diarrhoea. On February 14th, the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (China CDC) published the first details of 44,672 confirmed cases, in the biggest study since the outbreak began [3]. Their findings show that COVID-19 was mild for 81% of patients and had an overall case fatality rate of 2.3%. Of those confirmed cases, only 2.2% were under 20 years old. Compared to adults, children generally present with much milder clinical symptoms. It is likely that future serological studies will show much asymptomatic disease in children. As opposed to H1N1, pregnant women do not appear to be at higher risk of severe disease. The severity of the disease appears to be associated with age, with the elderly most at risk; those over 80 years of age had a Case Fatality Rate (CFR) of 14.8%. The CFR was also increased in those with comorbidities including cardiovascular, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, hypertension, and cancer. The cause of death is respiratory failure, shock or multiple organ failure.","Most previous studies of COVID-19 have focused primarily on epidemiological and clinical characteristics. [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] Wang and co-workers compared the clinical features of 138 hospitalized patients with non-severe and severe COVID-19. 10 Guan and colleagues updated the clinical characteristic and disease severity in 1,099 laboratory-confirmed cases throughout China. 12 Only a few studies have investigated risk factors and clinical outcomes. 13, 14 So, it is urgent to identify potential novel risk factors and treatments associated with patient-centered outcomes of COVID-19.","Most current recommendations for SARS-CoV-2 screening aim at limiting diagnostic testing to symptomatic, high-risk patients; others are instructed to selfisolation/quarantine. Full blood counts will be performed only in patients with signs of severity and confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. As 50-75% of patients with acute leukemia are febrile at diagnosis [3] , they are at high risk of missed or delayed diagnosis. This also applies to other oncological conditions such as primary mediastinal lymphoma or lung cancer, which often present with a cough with or without fever, symptoms that are likely to be considered trivial after a negative SARS-CoV-2 test.","The coronavirus disease-19 pandemic threatens to overwhelm the healthcare resources of the country, 1 but also poses a personal hazard to healthcare workers, including physicians. 2 Physicians are at an elevated risk of acquiring the disease through exposure to patients who may be symptomatic with the disease or its asymptomatic carriers across the spectrum of clinical specialties. Notably, the physician workforce is not only at risk of losing time spent in clinical care due to these exposures, but at a personal risk from severe disease that requires hospitalization and is associated with high morbidity and mortality. Notably, physicians 60 years of age and older are at a particularly elevated risk, with 80% of deaths in China concentrated in this age group. 3, 4 In the early experience in the US, nearly half of all hospitalizations and intensive care unit admissions, and nearly 80% of deaths have occurred in this age group as well. 4 To address the potential impact of excluding physicians with a high risk of adverse outcomes based on age, we evaluated the current patterns of age of licensed physicians across the United States.","Michael Ison, Northwestern University, Chicago, IL, USA. The choice of endpoints for therapeutic studies in respiratory viral diseases will depend on the clinical setting and population studied. Prior guidance from the FDA has noted a \"single best endpoint has not been identified in seriously ill hospitalized patients\" and \"sponsors are encouraged to provide evidence for the ability of their proposed endpoint to directly measure how a patient feels, functions, or survives\" (U.S. Food and Drug Administration, 2011). In order to construct these endpoints, we need to better categorize severity of disease in those hospitalized with a respiratory virus. The National Early Warning Score (NEWS) was developed in the United Kingdom for identifying patients at risk for deterioration or escalation of care. Several studies have used or proposed using NEWS to define a population with severe influenza, but this score has not been validated for this purpose. A retrospective study was conducted at Northwestern University Hospital evaluating 315 patients hospitalized with influenza, and were categorized by NEWS (1-3, 4-6, &gt; 6) and an ordinal scale of clinical outcomes (death, in the ICU on a mechanical ventilator, in the ICU but not on a mechanical ventilator, hospitalized on supplemental oxygen, hospitalized not on supplemental oxygen, discharge but has not resumed normal activities, and discharged with resumption of normal activities). Prior studies had demonstrated early treatment led to better clinical outcomes, and this was used as a surrogate for therapeutic benefit from antivirals in the current analysis. When analyzed using an ordinal scale endpoint, a higher baseline NEWS was associated with greater but later therapeutic benefit from neuraminidase inhibitors (NAI) based treatment. However, recruitment may be affected as there were fewer numbers of patients as the NEWS increased (Ison, 2016) .","This is the first report to demonstrated that the diabetes was associated with greater disease severity and poorer prognosis in COVID-19 patients. An increasing number of studies have shown that diabetic patients had higher mortality and morbidity of severe medical illness, such as myocardial infarction, and high FBG plays an independent predictive role in hospitalized non-diabetic patients as well [17, 18, 19] . Diabetes has also been identified as a significant risk factor for severe disease following respiratory tract infections [20] . Several studies demonstrated that diabetes was associated with increased the risks of severity and mortality after SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV .

On the one hand, in fact, the potential role of external microorganisms in producing acute and chronic arthritis in the form of either the direct colonization of the joints by the pathogen or the aberrant autoimmune reaction produced by the host response to the infection is well known [23, 24] . Few studies have investigated a potential link between respiratory viral infections and the development of RA [25] and in particular a Korean study reported parainfluenza and coronavirus to be associated with the number of incident RA [26] . In addition, in patients with overt inflammatory arthritis, infections are a major concern as they can contribute to disease flares [27] [28] [29] . On the other hand, RA patients carry a documented increased risk of infection compared with the general population. A population-based study by Doran and colleagues compared two matched groups of 609 patients with or without RA showing that RA patients had a significantly higher risk of serious (RR 1.53, 95% CI 1.41-1.65) and hospitalized (RR 1.88, 95% CI 1.71-2.07) infections [30] . Similarly, a prospective cohort study conducted on 2108 patients with inflammatory polyarthritis reported a 2-to 4-fold increased risk of hospitalized infection compared to healthy population [31] . This trend is primarily the result of a general impairment of the immune system typical of all autoimmune disorders and strictly dependent on the degree of disease activity. In fact, it has been demonstrated by an analysis conducted in 16,242 RA patients from the US CORRONA registry that each 0.6 unit increase in Disease Activity Score 28 (DAS28) corresponded to a 25% increased rate of infections requiring hospitalization (Incident rate ratio [IRR] 1.25, p = .03) and a 4% increased rate of outpatient infections (IRR 1.04, p = .01) [32] . In addition, a subsequent report from the same registry showed that the risk of serious infections increased progressively from patients achieving clinical remission to those achieving low (adjusted IRR 1.69, 95% CI 1.32-2.15) or moderate (adjusted IRR 1.30, 95% CI 1.09-1.56) disease activity, demonstrating the importance of maintaining a good disease control in order to reduce infectious complications [33] .","Among the infected Chinese healthcare workers whose symptoms onset appeared during the same ten-day period, the percentage of those in severe conditions decreased statistical significantly from 19.7% (Jan 11 -20) to 14.4% (Jan 21 -31) to 8.7% (Feb 1 -11). Across the country, there was also a significant difference in the disease severity among patients symptoms onset during the same period, with Wuhan being the most severe (17%), followed by Hubei Province (10.4%), and the rest of China (7.0%). The case fatality rate for the 1,688 infected Chinese healthcare workers was significantly lower than that for the 29,798 infected patients aged 20-59 years-0.3% (5/1,688) vs. 0.65% (193/29,798), respectively.

However, the high CFRs observed in Wuhan are likely to be overestimated, as the cited studies have mainly considered patients with severe symptoms who were hospitalized, excluding mild and asymptomatic patients who are less likely to be admitted to the hospital 7 . The most recent estimation of an overall 2.3% CFR reported by China CDC 8,9 is thus tentative, and more specific figures will remain undetermined until a later point.","Fourth, clinical manifestations were variable and modulated by underlying conditions such as cardiac, neurologic, or pulmonary diseases, and tobacco smoking. Some cases present as community-acquired pneumonia or as a decompensated chronic condition. Fever was not universal and, if present, was of low grade; upper respiratory illness was not a hallmark. Fifth, to the best of our knowledge, mortality risk factors have not been described for HRV infection in adults, 3,28,30,33,34 although a high severity score has been linked to pneumococcal co-infection. 3 The higher mortality registered for those with a CURB 65 \u2265 3 is in line with the original report of this scoring system 22 and provides evidence that it is a suitable approach for HRV infections even when patients do not have pneumonia. In fact, the AUC of the CURB-65 ROC analysis for the whole group and the pneumonia subgroup did not reveal differences, suggesting that the distinction between patients with and without respiratory infiltrates is perhaps not necessary in patients affected by HRV infections. On the other side, despite their severity at admission, nearly 40% of patients had a low score (&lt;2) of CURB-65, and the specificity of a higher score was low to predict mortality (\u223c70%) indicating a limited utility as a surrogate marker of risk. CAP-PIRO score demonstrated to be uselessness and no cutoff calculation was attempted. The limitations observed with CURB-65 to recognize patients in need of admission were probably related to the infrequent presence of hypotension in most viral respiratory illness and to the fact that a low digital pulse oxymetry is not considered for risk evaluation. In this sense, the current criteria adopted by the Chilean Ministry of Health together with the Pan American Health Organization appears to be better adapted to recognize severely ill patients affected by respiratory viral diseases. 17 HRV infection appears associated to a wide spectrum of disease and is able to rapidly decompensate vulnerable patients as reflected by the relatively short symptomatic period before admission and the high rate of hospitalization at the first medical visit.","In the presence of this rapidly emerging, novel infection uncharacteristic of the era of modern medicine, identification of biomarkers that could predict disease severity and prognosis are essential to guiding clinical care. Uniquely to COVID-19, a wide range of variability in disease severity is observed ranging from asymptomatic to critical [2] . As such, biomarkers are needed to identify severe disease among hospitalized patients. In this study, we found that platelet count may be a simple, economic, rapid and commonly available laboratory parameter, that could straightforwardly discriminate between COVID patients with and without severe disease. Moreover, we observed that thrombocytopenia is also associated with threefold enhanced risk of severe COVID-19."],"title":["The value of early transmission dynamic studies in emerging infectious

Older age and elevated d-dimer are reported risk factors for Covid-19. However, whether early radiographic change is a predictor of fatality remains unknown. We retrospectively reviewed records of all laboratory-confirmed patients admitted to a quarantine unit at Tongji Hospital, a large regional hospital in Wuhan, China, between January 31 and March 5, 2020. The Tongji Hospital ethics committee approved this study. A total of 128 patients were admitted. 102 patients were confirmed to have severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection using RNA detection. As of March 20, 82 confirmed patients were discharged, 15 died, and 5 remained hospitalized. The median age was 57 years (range, 27 - 85), 59 (58%) were male, and 44 (43%) patients had a comorbidity. The most common symptoms were fever, cough, and dyspnea. When compared with survivors, no...","Background With evidence of sustained transmission in more than 190 countries, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been declared a global pandemic. As such, data are urgently needed about risk factors associated with clinical outcomes. Methods A retrospective chart review of 323 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in Wuhan was conducted. Patients were classified into three disease severity groups (non-severe, severe, and critical), based on their initial clinical presentation. Clinical outcomes were designated as favorable and unfavorable, based on disease progression and response to treatments. Logistic regression models were performed to identify factors associated with clinical outcomes, and logrank test was conducted for the association with clinical progression. Results Current standard treatments did not show significant improvement on patient outcomes in the study. By univariate logistic regression model, 27 risk factors were significantly associated with clinical outcomes. ...","There is large uncertainty around the case fatality risk (CFR) for COVID-19 in China. Therefore, we considered symptomatic cases outside of China (countries/settings with 20+ cases) and the proportion who are in intensive care units (4.0%, 14/349 on 13 February 2020). Given what is known about CFRs for ICU patients with severe respiratory conditions from a meta-analysis, we estimated a CFR of 1.37% (95%CI: 0.57% to 3.22%) for COVID-19 cases outside of China.","Background: Since the outbreak of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in China, respiratory manifestations of the disease have been observed. However, as a fatal comorbidity, acute myocardial injury (AMI) in COVID-19 patients has not been previously investigated in detail. We investigated the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients with AMI and determined the risk factors for AMI in them. Methods: We analyzed data from 53 consecutive laboratory-confirmed and hospitalized COVID-19 patients (28 men, 25 women; age, 19-81 years). We collected information on epidemiological and demographic characteristics, clinical features, routine laboratory tests (including cardiac injury biomarkers), echocardiography, electrocardiography, imaging findings, management methods, and clinical outcomes. Results: Cardiac complications were found in 42 of the 53 (79.25%) patients: tachycardia (n=15), electrocardiography abnormities (n=11), diastolic dysfunction (n=20), elevated myocardial enzymes (n=...","To understand the severity of infection for a given disease, it is common epidemiological practice to estimate the case fatality risk, defined as the risk of death among cases. However, there are three technical obstacles that should be addressed to appropriately measure this risk. First, division of the cumulative number of deaths by that of cases tends to underestimate the actual risk because deaths that will occur have not yet observed, and so the delay in time from illness onset to death must be addressed. Second, the observed dataset of reported cases represents only a proportion of all infected individuals and there can be a substantial number of asymptomatic and mildly infected individuals who are never diagnosed. Third, ascertainment bias and risk of death among all those infected would be smaller when estimated using shorter virus detection windows and less sensitive diagnostic laboratory tests. In the ongoing COVID-19 epidemic, health authorities must cope with the uncertaint...","Abstract Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by SARS-CoV-2, has rapidly spread throughout China, but the clinical characteristics of Tibetan patients living in the Qinghai-Tibetan plateau are unknown. We aimed to investigate the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory and radiological characteristics of these patients. We included 67 Tibetan patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. The patients were divided into two groups based on the presence of clinical symptoms at admission, with 31 and 36 patients in the symptomatic and asymptomatic groups, respectively. The epidemiological, clinical, laboratory and radiological characteristics were extracted and analysed. No patient had a history of exposure to COVID-19 patients from Wuhan or had travelled to Wuhan. The mean age of Tibetan patients was 39.3 years and 59% of the patients were male. Seven patients presented with fever on admission and lymphocytopenia was present in 20 patients. 47 patients had abnormal chest CTs at admis...","Background: Information on kidney impairment in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is limited. This study aims to assess the prevalence and impact of abnormal urine analysis and kidney dysfunction in hospitalized COVID-19 patients in Wuhan. Method: We conducted a consecutive cohort study of COVID-19 patients admitted in a tertiary teaching hospital with 3 branches following a major outbreak in Wuhan in 2020. Hematuria, proteinuria, serum creatinine concentration and other clinical parameters were extracted from the electronic hospitalization databases and laboratory databases. Incidence rate for acute kidney injury (AKI) was examined during the study period. Association between kidney impairment and in-hospital death was analyzed. Results: We included 710 consecutive COVID19 patients, 89 (12.3%) of whom died in hospital. The median age of the patients was 63 years (inter quartile range, 51-71), including 374 men and 336 women. On admission, 44% of patients have proteinur...","Background: COVID-19 pandemic has developed rapidly and the ability to stratify the most vulnerable patients is vital. However, routinely used severity scoring systems are often low on diagnosis, even in non-survivors. Therefore, clinical prediction models for mortality are urgently required. Methods: We developed and internally validated a multivariable logistic regression model to predict inpatient mortality in COVID-19 positive patients using data collected retrospectively from Tongji Hospital, Wuhan (299 patients). External validation was conducted using a retrospective cohort from Jinyintan Hospital, Wuhan (145 patients). Nine variables commonly measured in these acute settings were considered for model development, including age, biomarkers and comorbidities. Backwards stepwise selection and bootstrap resampling were used for model development and internal validation. We assessed discrimination via the C statistic, and calibration using calibration-in-the-large, calibration slope...","Objective To determine the correlation between menstruation status/sex hormones and prognosis of COVID-19, and to identify potential protective factors for female patients. Design, Setting, and Participants A cross-sectional study of COVID-19 patients who were hospitalized at Tongji and Mobile Cabin Hospitals from Jan 28, 2020 to March 8, 2020. Sex differences in severity and composite endpoints (admission to intensive care unit (ICU), use of mechanical ventilation, or death) of COVID-19 patients were compared. The correlation analysis and cox/logistic regression modeling of menstruation status/sex hormones and prognosis were conducted. Correlation between cytokines related to immunity and inflammation and disease severity or estradiol (E2) was revealed.Results Chi square test indicated significant differences in distribution of composite endpoints (p&lt;0.01) and disease severity (p=0.05) between male and female patients (n=1902). 435 female COVID-19 patients with menstruation records we...","Background The 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) emerged in Wuhan, Hubei province, China, and was characterized as pandemic by the World Health Organization. Diabetes mellitus is an established risk factor for poor clinical outcomes, but the association of diabetes with the prognosis of COVID-19 have not been reported yet. Methods In this cohort study, we retrospectively reviewed 258 consecutive hospitalized COVID-19 patients with or without diabetes at the West Court of Union Hospital of Huazhong University of Science and Technology in Wuhan, China, recruited from January 29 to February 12, 2020. The cases were confirmed by real-time PCR and the demographic, clinical, laboratory, radiological, and treatment data were collected and analyzed. Prognosis was defined as hospitalization, discharged survivor and death, which was followed up until March 12, 2020. Results Of the 258 hospitalized patients (63 with diabetes) with COVID-19, the median age was 64 years (range 23-91), and 1...","Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an evolving infectious disease that dramatically spread all over the world in the early part of 2020. No studies have yet summarised the potential severity and mortality risks caused by COVID-19 in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and we update information in smokers. Methods: We systematically searched electronic databases from inception to March 24, 2020. Data were extracted by two independent authors in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses guidelines. Study quality was assessed using a modified version of the Newcastle Ottawa Scale. We synthesised a narrative from eligible studies and conducted a meta-analysis using a random-effects model to calculate pooled prevalence rates and 95% confidence intervals (95%CI). Results: In total, 123 abstracts were screened and 61 full-text manuscripts were reviewed. A total of 15 studies met the inclusion criteria, which ...","OBJECTIVE: Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is an emerging and easily clustering infectious disease. We describe an outbreak of SARS in a chest ward of a medical center in southern Taiwan and seek to identify the risk factors of those SARS patients who required mechanical ventilation. We focus on previous health patients. DESIGN: This retrospective case series was collected during the SARS outbreak. Degrees of severity were established, based on whether intubation and mechanical ventilation was necessary. SETTING: A 2500-bed medical center in southern Taiwan. PATIENTS: Forty-four patients exhibited symptoms that met the modified World Health Organization (WHO) definition of SARS. These included of three subgroups: health-care workers (n=16), relatives (n=14), and patients already admitted for other ailments (n=14). Of these, 20 eventually required mechanical ventilation. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Laboratory analyses showed statistically significant differences between intubated...","Abstract Background There are no clear expert consensus or guidelines on how to treat 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19). The objective of this study is to investigate the short-term effect of risk-adapted treatment strategy on patients with COVID-19. Methods We collected the medical records of 55 COVID-19 patients for analysis. We divided these patients into mild, moderate and severe groups, and risk-adapted treatment approaches were given according to the illness severity. Results Twelve patients were in mild group and 22 were in moderate group (non-severe group, n=34), and 21 patients were in severe group. At the end of the first two weeks after admission, clinical manifestations had completely despeared in 31(91.2%)patients in non-severe group, and 18(85.7%) patients in severe group (p=0.85). Both groups had a satisfied chest CT imaging recovery, which includes 22(64.7%) patients in non-severe group and 12(57.1%) patients in severe group recovered at least 50% of the whole leision...","From 29 to 31 January 2020, a total of 565 Japanese citizens were evacuated from Wuhan, China on three chartered flights. All passengers were screened upon arrival in Japan for symptoms consistent with novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection and tested for presence of the virus. Assuming that the mean detection window of the virus can be informed by the mean serial interval (estimated at 7.5 days), the ascertainment rate of infection was estimated at 9.2% (95% confidence interval: 5.0, 20.0). This indicates that the incidence of infection in Wuhan can be estimated at 20,767 infected individuals, including those with asymptomatic and mildly symptomatic infections. The infection fatality risk (IFR)\u2014the actual risk of death among all infected individuals\u2014is therefore 0.3% to 0.6%, which may be comparable to Asian influenza pandemic of 1957\u20131958.","Background: COVID-19 is still becoming an increasing global threat to public health. More detailed and specific characteristics of COVID-19 are needed to better understand this disease. Additionally, durations of COVID-19, e.g., the average time from exposure to recovery, which is of great value in understanding this disease, has not been reported so far. Aims: To give the information on clinical characteristics and different durations of COVID-19 and to identify the potential risk factors for longer hospitalization duration. Methods: In this retrospective study, we enrolled 77 patients (mean age: 52 years; 44.2% males) with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 admitted to Beijing YouAn Hospital during 21st Jan and 8th February 2020. Epidemiological, clinical and radiological data on admission were collected; complications and outcomes were followed up until 29th February 2020. The study endpoint was the discharge within two weeks. Cox proportional-hazards regression was performed to identify...","Background: Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) is a rapidly escalating epidemic caused by SARS-CoV-2. Identification of a simple and effective indicator to assess disease severity and outcome is urgently needed. Methods: This study retrospectively analyzed dynamic changes of lymphocyte percentage (LYM%) in 15 death cases, 15 severe cases as well as 40 moderate cases of COVID-19 patients. Next, prognostic role of lymphopenia in COVID-19 were verified in 92 hospitalized cases. Results: Our results from death and severe cases showed that LYM% in blood test were inversely associated with the progression and severity of COVID-19. LYM% in patients with moderate COVID-19 remained higher than 20% 10-12 days after symptom onset. In contrast, LYM% was lower than 20% in severe cases. However, LYM% in severe cases was higher than 5% 17-19 days after the onset of the disease, while it fell below 5% in death cases. Therefore, we established a reliable Time from symptom onset-LYM% model (TLM), which...","The SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) novel coronavirus represents a significant health risk, particularly in older patients. Cancer is one of the leading causes of death in most rich countries, and delivering chemotherapy may be associated with increased risk in the presence of a pandemic infection. Estimating this risk is crucial in making decisions about balancing risks and benefits from administering chemotherapy. However, there are no specific data about chemotherapy risks per se. Here we develop a simple model to estimate the potential harms in patients undergoing chemotherapy during a COVID outbreak. We use age-related case fatality rates as a basis for estimating risk, and use previous data from risk of death during influenza outbreaks to estimate the additional risk associated with chemotherapy. We use data from randomised trials to estimate benefit across a range of curative and palliative settings, and address the balance of benefit against the risk of harm. We then use those data to es...","Background The outbreak of COVID-2019 is becoming a global public health emergency. Although its basic clinical features have been reported, the dynamic characteristics of immune system in COVID-2019 patients, especially those critical patients with refractory hypoxemia, are not yet well understood. We aim to describe the dynamic characteristics of immune system in 3 critical patients with refractory hypoxemia, and discuss the relationship between hypoxemia severity and immune cell levels, and the changes of gut microbes of COVID-2019 patient. Methods This is a retrospective study from 3 patients with 2019-nCoV infection admitted to Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, a COVID-2019 designated hospital in Wuhan, from January 31 to February 6, 2020. All patients were diagnosed and classified based on the Diagnosis and Treatment of New Coronavirus Pneumonia (6th edition) published by the National Health Commission of China4. We recorded the epidemiological history, demographic features, c...","Abstract Risk factors associated with Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection outcome were established by analyses of WHO data from September 23, 2012 to 18 June 2018. Of the 2220 reported cases, 1408 cases, including 451 MERS-CoV deaths, were analyzed. The case fatality rate was 32% (95% CI: 29.4\u201334.5). Compared to MERS patients \u226430 years old, those with &gt;30 years had the adjusted odds ratio estimate for death of 2.38 [95% CI: 1.75\u20133.22]. This index was 1.43 [95% CI: 1.06\u20131.92] for Saudi patients in comparison to non-Saudi; 1.76 [95% CI: 1.39\u20132.22] for patient with comorbidity in comparison to those without comorbidity; 0.58 [95% CI: 0.44\u20130.75] for those who had close contact to a camel in the past 14 days and 0.42 [95% CI: 0.31\u20130.57] for patients with &gt;14 days with onset of signs and hospital admission compared to patients with \u226414 days.","Background: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) broke out in Wuhan, Hubei, China. This study sought to elucidate a novel predictor of disease severity in patients with coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) cased by SARS-CoV-2. Methods: Patients enrolled in this study were all hospitalized with COVID-19 in the Central Hospital of Wuhan, China. Clinical features, chronic comorbidities, demographic data, and laboratory and radiological data were reviewed. The outcomes of patients with severe pneumonia and those with non-severe pneumonia were compared using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA) to explore clinical characteristics and risk factors. The receiver operating characteristic curve was used to screen optimal predictors from the risk factors and the predictive power was verified by internal validation. Results: A total of 377 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 were enrolled in this study, including 117 with severe pneumonia ...","BACKGROUND We described the epidemiological features of the coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) outbreak, and evaluated the impact of non-pharmaceutical interventions on the epidemic in Wuhan, China. METHODS Individual-level data on 25,961 laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 cases reported through February 18, 2020 were extracted from the municipal Notifiable Disease Report System. Based on key events and interventions, we divided the epidemic into four periods: before January 11, January 11-22, January 23 - February 1, and February 2-18. We compared epidemiological characteristics across periods and different demographic groups. We developed a susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered model to study the epidemic and evaluate the impact of interventions. RESULTS The median age of the cases was 57 years and 50.3% were women. The attack rate peaked in the third period and substantially declined afterwards across geographic regions, sex and age groups, except for children (age &lt;20) whose attack ...","Aims: Corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has rapidly become the most severe public health issue all over the world. Despite respiratory symptoms, hepatic injury has also been observed in clinical settings. This study aimed to investigate the risk factors involved with hepatic injury in the patients with COVID-19. Methods: A total of 85 hospitalized patients who were diagnosed with COVID-19 in Beijing Youan Hospital were retrospectively analyzed. According to liver function, they were divided into ALT normal group (n=52) and ALT elevation group (n=33). Clinical features and laboratory data were compared between the two groups. The independent risk factors for liver injury were analyzed. Results: There were 33 patients with hepatic injury in our study, accounting for 38.8% (33/85). The patients in ALT elevation group were older than those in ALT normal group. The levels of lactic acid, CRP, myoglobin, and neutrophils were significantly higher in ALT elevation group. The lymphocytes and...","BACKGROUND: While the risk of severe complications of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and its determinants have been explored in previous studies, a systematic analysis of published articles with different designs and populations has yet to be conducted. The present study aimed to systematically review the risk of death associated with MERS as well as risk factors for associated complications. METHODS: PubMed and Web of Science databases were searched for clinical and epidemiological studies on confirmed cases of MERS. Eligible articles reported clinical outcomes, especially severe complications or death associated with MERS. Risks of admission to intensive care unit (ICU), mechanical ventilation and death were estimated. Subsequently, potential associations between MERS-associated death and age, sex, underlying medical conditions and study design were explored. RESULTS: A total of 25 eligible articles were identified. The case fatality risk ranged from 14.5 to 100%, with the p...","Background Notwithstanding the clinical hallmarks of COVID-19 patients were reported, several critical issues still remain mysterious, i.e., prognostic factors for COVID-19 including extrinsic factors as viral load of SARS-CoV-2 and intrinsic factors as individual's health conditions; myocarditis incidence rate and hallmarks. Methods Demographic, epidemiologic, radiologic and laboratory data were collected by medical record reviews of adult hospitalized patients diagnosed as COVID-19. Cycle threshold (Ct) value data of real-time PCR (RT-PCR) were collected. The time duration was from 21 January to 2 March, 2020. Pulmonary inflammation index (PII) values were used for chest CT findings. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to identify independent severity risk factors. RESULTS In total, 84 hospitalized adult patients diagnosed as COVID-19 were included, including 20 severe and 64 nonsevere cases. The viral load of the severe group was significantly higher than that of the ...","Summary Background The novel Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) had, as of Aug 8, 2013, caused 111 virologically confirmed or probable human cases of infection worldwide. We analysed epidemiological and genetic data to assess the extent of human infection, the performance of case detection, and the transmission potential of MERS-CoV with and without control measures. Methods We assembled a comprehensive database of all confirmed and probable cases from public sources and estimated the incubation period and generation time from case cluster data. Using data of numbers of visitors to the Middle East and their duration of stay, we estimated the number of symptomatic cases in the Middle East. We did independent analyses, looking at the growth in incident clusters, the growth in viral population, the reproduction number of cluster index cases, and cluster sizes to characterise the dynamical properties of the epidemic and the transmission scenario. Findings The estimated...","Summary Background In the face of rapidly changing data, a range of case fatality ratio estimates for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have been produced that differ substantially in magnitude. We aimed to provide robust estimates, accounting for censoring and ascertainment biases. Methods We collected individual-case data for patients who died from COVID-19 in Hubei, mainland China (reported by national and provincial health commissions to Feb 8, 2020), and for cases outside of mainland China (from government or ministry of health websites and media reports for 37 countries, as well as Hong Kong and Macau, until Feb 25, 2020). These individual-case data were used to estimate the time between onset of symptoms and outcome (death or discharge from hospital). We next obtained age-stratified estimates of the case fatality ratio by relating the aggregate distribution of cases to the observed cumulative deaths in China, assuming a constant attack rate by age and adjusting for demography ...","An analysis of the time evolution of the 2019-nCoV outbreak event in Italy is proposed and is based on the preliminary data at disposal (till March 11th, 2020) on one side, and on an epidemiological model recently used to describe the same epidemic event in the Wuhan region (February 2020) on the other side. The equations of the model include the description of compartments like Susceptible (S), exposed (E), infectious but not yet symptomatic (pre-symptomatic) (A), infectious with symptoms (I), hospitalized (H) and recovered (R). Further stratification includes quarantined susceptible (Sq), isolated exposed (Eq) and isolated infected (Iq) compartments. The equations are numerically solved for boundary (initial) conditions tuned on the Italian event. The role of quarantine is specifically emphasized and supports the strategies adopted providing a numerical description of the effects.","Since late December 2019 a new epidemic outbreak has emerged from Whuhan, China. Rapidly the new coronavirus has spread worldwide. China CDC has reported results of a descriptive exploratory analysis of all cases diagnosed until the 11th February 2020, presenting the epidemiologic curves and geo-temporal spread of COVID-19 along with case fatality rate according to some baseline characteristics, such as age, gender and several well-established high prevalence comorbidities. Despite this, we intend to increase even further the predictive value of that manuscript by presenting the odds ratio for mortality due to COVID-19 adjusted for the presence of those comorbidities and baseline characteristics such as age and gender. Besides, we present a way to determine the risk of each particular patient, given his characteristics. We found that age is the variable that presents higher risk of COVID-19 mortality, where 60 or older patients have an OR = 18.8161 (CI95%[7.1997; 41.5517]). Regarding c...","Objective: Retrospectively analyze the clinical data of Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients and explore the value of serum phosphorus level in evaluating the severity and prognosis of the disease. Methods: COVID-19 patients transferred from the first emergency ward of Taiyuan fourth people's Hospital from February 8 to March 3, 2020 were selected. The information of general conditions, clinical manifestations, laboratory indexes, nucleic acid detection and treatment were collected. The changes of blood phosphorus level and absolute value of lymphocytes in ordinary and severe/critical patients were recorded and compared. Results: A total of 32 patients with COVID-19 were collected, including 12 cases of common type and 20 cases of severe/critical type. Before treatment, the serum phosphorus levels of the two groups were significantly lower than the normal level, and the serum phosphorus levels of the severe/critical patients were lower than those of the common type patients (t...","Abstract Background Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CO-V-2), was first reported in Wuhan, Hubei province, China has now rapidly spread over 50 countries. For the prevention and control of infection, Taiwan Centers for Disease Control initiated testing of SARS-CoV-2 on January 24th 2020 for persons suspected with this disease. Until February 28th, 43 flu-like symptomatic patients were screened in China Medical University Hospital. Methods Two patients were confirmed positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection by rRT-PCR as COVID-19 patients A and B. Causative pathogens for included patients were detected using FilmArray\u2122 Respiratory Panel. We retrospectively analyzed the clinical presentations, laboratory data, radiologic findings, and travel and exposure contact histories, of the COVID-19 patients in comparison to those with other respiratory infections. Results Through contact with Taiwan No. 19 case patient on 27th January, C...","A novel coronavirus (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, SARS-CoV-2) causing a cluster of respiratory infections (coronavirus disease 2019, COVID-19) in Wuhan, China, was identified on 7 January 2020. The epidemic quickly disseminated from Wuhan and as at 12 February 2020, 45,179 cases have been confirmed in 25 countries, including 1,116 deaths. Strengthened surveillance was implemented in France on 10 January 2020 in order to identify imported cases early and prevent secondary transmission. Three categories of risk exposure and follow-up procedure were defined for contacts. Three cases of COVID-19 were confirmed on 24 January, the first cases in Europe. Contact tracing was immediately initiated. Five contacts were evaluated as at low risk of exposure and 18 at moderate/high risk. As at 12 February 2020, two cases have been discharged and the third one remains symptomatic with a persistent cough, and no secondary transmission has been identified. Effective collaboration be...","Given the rapidly progressing COVID-19 pandemic, this report on a US cohort of 54 COVID-19 patients from Stanford Hospital and data regarding risk factors for severe disease obtained at initial clinical presentation is of high importance and is immediately clinically relevant. We identified low presenting oxygen saturation as predictive of severe disease outcomes, such as diagnosis of pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and admission to the ICU, and also replicated data from China suggesting a link between hypertension and disease severity. Clinicians will benefit by tools to rapidly risk stratify patients at presentation by likelihood of progression to severe disease.","Before January 22, 2020, only one pediatric case of COVID-19 was reported in mainland China1,2. However, a retrospective surveillance study3 identified six children who had been hospitalized for COVID-19 in one of three central Wuhan hospitals between January 7th and January 15th. Given that Wuhan has over 395 other hospitals, there may have been far more severe pediatric cases than reported. There were six and 43 children out of 336 who tested positive for COVID-19 and influenza, respectively among all pediatric admissions during the 9-day period3. By using this ratio in a detailed analysis of influenza surveillance data and COVID-19 epidemic dynamics (see Appendix), we estimate that there were 313 [95% CI: 171-520] children hospitalized for COVID-19 in Wuhan during January 7-15, 2020 (Figure). Under an epidemic doubling time of 7.31 days4, we estimate that there were 1105 [95% CI: 592, 1829] cumulative pediatric COVID-19 hospitalizations prior to the January 23rd lockdown, which far ...","Summary Background Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), first detected in China in December, 2019. In January, 2020, state, local, and federal public health agencies investigated the first case of COVID-19 in Illinois, USA. Methods Patients with confirmed COVID-19 were defined as those with a positive SARS-CoV-2 test. Contacts were people with exposure to a patient with COVID-19 on or after the patient's symptom onset date. Contacts underwent active symptom monitoring for 14 days following their last exposure. Contacts who developed fever, cough, or shortness of breath became persons under investigation and were tested for SARS-CoV-2. A convenience sample of 32 asymptomatic health-care personnel contacts were also tested. Findings Patient 1\u2014a woman in her 60s\u2014returned from China in mid-January, 2020. One week later, she was hospitalised with pneumonia and tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Her husband (Pat...","Background/introduction COVID\u221219, a novel coronavirus outbreak starting in China, is now a rapidly developing public health emergency of international concern. The clinical spectrum of COVID\u221219 disease is varied, and identifying factors associated with severe disease has been described as an urgent research priority. It has been noted that elderly patients with pre-existing comorbidities are more vulnerable to more severe disease. However, the specific symptoms and comorbidities that most strongly predict disease severity are unclear. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to identify the symptoms and comorbidities predictive of COVID\u221219 severity. Method This study was prospectively registered on PROSPERO. A literature search was performed in three databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE and Global Health) for studies indexed up to 5th March 2020. Two reviewers independently screened the literature and both also completed data extraction. Quality appraisal of studies was performed using...","The largest nosocomial outbreak of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) occurred in South Korea in 2015. Health Care Personnel (HCP) are at high risk of acquiring MERS-Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infections, similar to the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) infections first identified in 2003. This study described the similarities and differences in epidemiological and clinical characteristics of 183 confirmed global MERS cases and 98 SARS cases in Taiwan associated with HCP. The epidemiological findings showed that the mean age of MERS-HCP and total MERS cases were 40 (24~74) and 49 (2~90) years, respectively, much older than those in SARS [SARS-HCP: 35 (21~68) years, p = 0.006; total SARS: 42 (0~94) years, p = 0.0002]. The case fatality rates (CFR) was much lower in MERS-HCP [7.03% (9/128)] or SARS-HCP [12.24% (12/98)] than the MERS-non-HCP [36.96% (34/92), p&lt;0.001] or SARS-non-HCP [24.50% (61/249), p&lt;0.001], however, no difference was found between MERS-HC...","The need for accurate statistics has never been felt so deeply as the novel COVID-19 pathogen spreads around the world and quantifying its severity is a primary clinical and public health issue. In Italy, the magnitude and increasing trend of the case-fatality risk (CFR) is fueling the already high levels of public alarm. In this paper, we highlight that the widely used crude CFR is an inaccurate measure of the disease severity since the pandemic is still unfolding. With the goal to improve its comparability over time and across countries at this stage, we then propose a demographic adjustment of the CFR that addresses the bias arising from differential case ascertainment by age. When applied to publicly released data for Italy, we show that until March 16 our adjusted CFR was similar to that of Wuhan, the most affected Chinese region, where COVID-19 has now been contained. This indicates that our adjusted CFR improves its comparability over time, making an important tool to chart the ...","We developed a computational tool to assess the risk of novel coronavirus outbreaks outside China. We estimate the dependence of the risk of a major outbreak in a country from imported cases on key parameters such as: (i) the evolution of the cumulative number of cases in mainland China outside the closed areas; (ii) the connectivity of the destination country with China, including baseline travel frequencies, the effect of travel restrictions, and the efficacy of entry screening at destination; (iii) the efficacy of control measures in the destination country (expressed by the local reproduction number Rloc). We found that in countries with low connectivity to China but with relatively high Rloc, the most beneficial control measure to reduce the risk of outbreaks is a further reduction in their importation number either by entry screening or travel restrictions. Countries with high connectivity but low Rloc benefit the most from policies that further reduce Rloc. Countries in the midd...","BACKGROUND: Rapid triaging, as in the current COVID-19 pandemic, focuses on age and pre-existing medical conditions. In contrast, preoperative assessments use cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) to categorise patients to higher and lower risk independent of diagnostic labels. Since CPET is not feasible in population-based settings, our aims included evaluation of a triage/screening tool for cardiorespiratory risk. METHODS: CPET-derived anaerobic thresholds were evaluated retrospectively in 26 patients with pulmonary arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) who represent a challenging group to risk-categorise. Pulmonary AVM-induced hypoxaemia secondary to intrapulmonary right-to-left shunts, anaemia from underlying hereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasia and metabolic equivalents derived from the 13-point Veterans Specific Activity Questionnaire (VSAQ) were evaluated as part of routine clinical care. Pre-planned analyses evaluated associations and modelling of the anaerobic threshold and p...","OBJECTIVE To investigate the relationship between the ABO blood group and the COVID-19 susceptibility. DESIGN The study was conducted by comparing the blood group distribution in 2,173 patients with COVID-19 confirmed by SARS-CoV-2 test from three hospitals in Wuhan and Shenzhen, China with that in normal people from the corresponding regions. Data were analyzed using one-way ANOVA and 2-tailed \u03c72 and a meta-analysis was performed by random effects models. SETTING Three tertiary hospitals in Wuhan and Shenzhen, China. PARTICIPANTS A total of 1,775 patients with COVID-19, including 206 dead cases, from Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital, Wuhan, China were recruited. Another 113 and 285 patients with COVID-19 were respectively recruited from Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan and Shenzhen Third People's Hospital, Shenzhen, China. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Detection of ABO blood groups, infection occurrence of SARS-CoV-2, and patient death RESULTS The ABO group in 3694 normal people in Wuhan sh...","Abstract Background Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a newly recognized infectious disease that caused an outbreak in south China in 2003. The cause of SARS was identified as a novel coronavirus (CoV). The existence of asymptomatic seroconvertors and the detection of the SARS-CoV RNA in plasma during the course of infection all suggest that SARS could, as least theoretically, be transmitted by transfusion. An estimate of the risk of SARS transmission through blood transfusion will contribute to decisions concerning blood safety monitoring and may be useful in the design of strategies to decrease the risk of transfusion-transmitted infections. Study design and methods Case onset dates from the 2003 Shenzhen SARS epidemic and investigational results from Taiwan on viremia in humans are used to estimate the number of cases that were viremic throughout the epidemic. Estimates of the asymptomatic-to-clinically confirmed SARS-CoV infection ratio, the proportion of asymptomatic inf...","Background: To explore the cellular immunity and cytokines status of NCP patients and to predict the correlation between the cellular immunity levels, cytokines and the severity of patients. Methods: 123 NCP patients were divided into mild and severe groups. Peripheral blood was collected, lymphocyte subsets and cytokines were detected. Correlation analysis was performed on the lymphocyte subsets and cytokines, and the differences between the indexes of the two groups were analyzed. Results: 102 mild and 21 severe patients were included. Lymphocyte subsets were reduced in two groups. The proportion of CD8 + T reduction in the mild and severe group was 28.43% and 61.9%, respectively; The proportion of B cell reduction was 25.49% and 28.57%; The proportion of NK cell reduction was 34.31% and 47.62%; The detection value of IL-6 was 0 in 55.88% of the mild group, mild group has a significantly lower proportion of patients with IL-6 higher than normal than severe group; There was no signifi...","AbstractThe current practice for diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection relies on PCR testing of nasopharyngeal or respiratory specimens in a symptomatic patient at high epidemiologic risk. This testing strategy likely underestimates the true prevalence of infection, creating the need for serologic methods to detect infections missed by the limited testing to date. Here, we describe the development of a coronavirus antigen microarray containing immunologically significant antigens from SARS-CoV-2, in addition to SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, common human coronavirus strains, and other common respiratory viruses. A preliminary study of human sera collected prior to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic demonstrates overall high IgG reactivity to common human coronaviruses and low IgG reactivity to epidemic coronaviruses including SARS-CoV-2, with some cross-reactivity of conserved antigenic domains including S2 domain of spike protein and nucleocapsid protein. This array can be used to answer outstanding questions ...","The SARS-CoV-2 outbreak is causing widespread infections and significant mortality. Previous studies describing clinical characteristics of the disease contained small cohorts from individual centers or larger series consisting of mixed cases from different hospitals. We report analyses of mortality and disease severity among 402 patients from a single hospital. The cohort included 297 patients with confirmed and 105 with suspected diagnosis. The latter group met the criteria for clinical diagnosis but nucleic acid tests results were initially interpreted as suspicious. Data were compared between genders and among different age groups. The overall case fatality is 5.2%. However, patients 70 years of age or older suffered a significantly higher mortality (17.8%), associated with more patients having severe or critical illness (57.5%). Patients 50 years of age or older had a mortality of 8.0%, and those younger than 50 years, 1.2%. Male patients had a mortality of 7.6% versus 2.9% in fem...","This paper identifies the \u201csafe ventilation rate\u201d for eliminating airborne viral infection and preventing cross-infection of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in a hospital-based setting. We used simulation approaches to reproduce three actual cases where groups of hospital occupants reported to be either infected or not infected when SARS patients were hospitalized in nearby rooms. Simulations using both computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and multi-zone models were carried out to understand the dilution level of SARS virus-laden aerosols during these scenarios. We also conducted a series of measurements to validate the simulations. The ventilation rates (dilution level) for infection and non-infection were determined based on these scenarios. The safe ventilation rate for eliminating airborne viral infection is to dilute the air emitted from a SARS patient by 10000 times with clean air. Dilution at lower volumes, specifically 1000 times, is insufficient for protecting non-infec...","Importance: The recent outbreak of Novel Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) Disease (COVID-19) has put the world on alert, that is reminiscent of the SARS outbreak seventeen years ago. Objective: We aim to compare the severity and mortality between male and female patients with both COVID-19 and SARS, to explore the most useful prognostic factors for individualized assessment. Design, Setting, and Participants: We extracted the data from a case series of 43 hospitalized patients we treated, a public data set of the first 37 cases died of COVID-19 in Wuhan city and 1019 survived patients from six cities in China. We also analyzed the data of 524 patients with SARS, including 139 deaths, from Beijing city in early 2003. Main Outcomes and Measures: Severity and mortality. Results: Older age and high number of comorbidities were associated with higher severity and mortality in patients with both COVID-19 and SARS. The percentages of older age (\u226565 years) were much higher in the deceased group than i...","Background: Management of high mortality risk due to significant progression requires prior assessment of time-to-progression. However, few related methods are available for COVID-19 pneumonia. Methods: We retrospectively enrolled 338 adult patients admitted to one hospital between Jan 11, 2020 to Feb 29, 2020. The final follow-up date was March 8, 2020. We compared characteristics between patients with severe and non-severe outcome, and used multivariate survival analyses to assess the risk of progression to severe conditions. Results: A total of 76 (31.9%) patients progressed to severe conditions and 3 (0.9%) died. The mean time from hospital admission to severity onset is 3.7 days. Age, body mass index (BMI), fever symptom on admission, co-existing hypertension or diabetes are associated with severe progression. Compared to non-severe group, the severe group already demonstrated, at an early stage, abnormalities in biomarkers indicating organ function, inflammatory responses, blood ...","Objective: To determine the predictive value of CT and clinical characteristics for short-term disease progression in patients with 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP). Materials and Methods: 224 patients with confirmed 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) infection outside Wuhan who had chest CT examinations were retrospectively screened. Clinical data were obtained from electronic medical records. CT images were reviewed and scored for lesion distribution, lobe and segment involvement, ground-glass opacities, consolidation, and interstitial thickening. All included patients with moderate NCP were observed for at least 14 days from admission to determine whether they exacerbated to severe NCP (progressive group) or not (stable group). CT and clinical characteristics between the two groups were compared, and multivariate logistic regression and sensitivity analyses were performed to identify the risk factors for developing severe NCP. Results: A total of 141 patients with moderate NCP ...","Background: Excessive monocyte/macrophage activation with the development of a cytokine storm and subsequent acute lung injury, leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a feared consequence of infection with COVID-19. The ability to recognize and potentially intervene early in those patients at greatest risk of developing this complication could be of great clinical utility. Methods: We performed detailed flow cytometric analysis of peripheral blood samples from 28 COVID-19 patients treated at Xian No.8 Hospital and the First Affiliated Hospital of Xian Jiaotong University in early 2020 in an attempt to identify factors that could help predict severity of disease and patient outcome. Findings: While we did not detect significant differences in the number of monocytes between patients with COVID-19 and normal healthy individuals,we did identify significant morphological and functional differences, which are more pronounced in patients requiring prolonged hospitalization ...","BACKGROUND: Few previous studies have investigated the association between the severity of an infectious disease and the length of incubation period. METHODS: We estimated the association between the length of the incubation period and the severity of infection with the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus, using data from the epidemic in 2003 in Hong Kong. RESULTS: We estimated the incubation period of SARS based on a subset of patients with available data on exposure periods and a separate subset of patients in a putative common source outbreak, and we found significant associations between shorter incubation period and greater severity in both groups after adjusting for potential confounders. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that patients with a shorter incubation period proceeded to have more severe disease. Further studies are needed to investigate potential biological mechanisms for this association."],"title":["Radiographic Findings and other Predictors in Adults with Covid-19","Risk Factors Associated
