We discuss vaccine-preventable diseases and the substantial successes and persistent challenges in their control; health-care-associated infections (HAIs), a leading preventable cause of death; emerging zoonotic and vector-borne diseases and their spread across a globalised world; foodborne infections, increasingly linked to new sources of contamination; and the intersecting epidemics of HIV, sexually transmitted infections (STIs), chronic viral hepatitis, and tuberculosis. Antimicrobial-resistant pathogens, several of which have become or are becoming resistant to all available drugs, are intensifying these threats. In addition to their eff ect \u2022 Despite major advances towards their control, infectious diseases continue to present substantial challenges to health and health-care resources in the USA \u2022 Priority actions to meet these challenges include addressing high-burden diseases such as HIV and chronic hepatitis, foodborne diseases, and health-care-associ ated infections; targeting outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases; and controlling endemic and emerging vector-borne and zoonotic infections \u2022 Antimicrobial resistance has become a global health crisis that demands new multidisciplinary approaches and collaborations across local, state, regional, national, and international levels \u2022 Rapidly evolving molecular technologies and increases in microbial understanding off er new opportunities for treatment, prevention, and control of infectious diseases \u2022 Ongoing enhancements in communication capacities, including social media, are bringing new techniques to monitor infectious diseases and rapidly share prevention information on human health, these diseases cause substantial health-care, workplace, and other societal costs. We discuss priority actions needed to meet these challenges including modernisation of existing surveillance systems to better inform public health action; enhancement of public health laboratories to incorporate the latest molecular technologies for improved disease detection and outbreak response; and strengthening of the clinical and public health interface to facilitate information exchange and leverage changes in health care to improve prevention and control of infectious diseases.","More recent efforts have focused on the use of new technologies and host targets to better understand and reduce antimicrobial resistance. Whole-genome sequencing techniques have been used to track bacterial transmission from person to person and to better define and determine transmission linkages in outbreaks of resistant HAIs. [496] [497] [498] As these technologies continue to advance, rapid, point-of-care diagnostic tests could be used to quickly identify resistant infections and target treatment. Efforts to prevent and control infectious diseases by altering the host-microbe interaction as opposed to targeting microbes FIGURE parasitic disease drug service regarding requests from physicians in New York and California for pentamidine isethionate for treatment of Pneumocystis carinii (now Pneumocystis jirovecii) pneumonia in patients with no known cause of immunodeficiency hinted at the first U.S. cases of AIDS. 510 Recognition of unusually severe respiratory disease by observant clinicians signaled hantavirus pulmonary syndrome in 1993, and suspicion of anthrax by alert clinical and laboratory staff in Florida in 2001 suggested a possible bioterrorist event. A February 10, 2003, email posted by a physician on ProMED, an informal online infectious disease reporting program of the International Society for Infectious Diseases, is widely regarded as the first notification of the global outbreak of SARS. 511 Such observations have not been limited to the medical and scientific community, however. In the mid-1970s, two Connecticut mothers questioning what was believed to be an unusually large number of juvenile rheumatoid arthritis cases in their community led researchers to the discovery of Lyme disease and a concerned American Legion official provided the first indication to health authorities of the emergence of legionnaires' disease. 512 Although today's globalized world has created a perfect environment for rapid emergence and spread of infectious diseases, it has also brought significant scientific, technologic, and communication advances for their control. Next-generation sequencing technologies and expanded bioinformatics capacities are revolutionizing the field of microbiology, reducing the amount of time needed for pathogen detection and analysis and generating data for a more detailed understanding of infectious agents. 503, 513 These tools offer new opportunities to improve public health efforts to detect and control outbreaks, determine antimicrobial susceptibility, and develop and target vaccines. 313, 314, 497, 498 Scientists are also gaining new understanding of the role of the microbiome and microbial sensors in infectious diseases, 514, 515 offering new insight into pathogen-host complexities and disease treatment and prevention. Continued advances in electronic communications are facilitating earlier recognition of emerging problems and rapid exchange of information. In particular, early warning systems such as ProMED-mail, the Public Health Agency of Canada's Global Public Health Intelligence Network (GPHIN), and HealthMap, collect, categorize, and display outbreak and disease information from a variety of formal and informal sources-enhancing disease surveillance and tracking capabilities. [516] [517] [518] Expansions in Internet access and use and far-reaching social media networks have also increased the exchange of health information and broadened public health partnerships to include nontraditional partners such as law enforcement, the media, and members of the public at local, national, and global levels.","Although a number of drugs have been evaluated for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV there are no approved therapeutic agents available for coronaviruses. Integrating clinical trials of experimental therapeutics is an increasingly recognized part of the response during infectious disease outbreaks. Since the Ebola outbreak in West Africa and subsequent outbreaks in the Democratic Republic of Congo, clinical trials of investigative drugs have been fully integrated in the epidemic response. [5] [6] [7] The COVID-19 pandemic is unique because of its scale, the speed of its spread, the lack of pre-existing scientific data and the importance of media and scientific coverage. 2 To encourage the development of clinical trials that test therapeutics against SARS-CoV-2, the WHO has suggested a number of candidate antiviral agents that have to be tested in clinical trials. 8 Concomitantly, numerous clinical trials have been registered since the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak numerous to evaluate therapeutic strategies for this disease. In the epidemic context, it is crucial for clinicians and researchers to have access to rapid and quality information on clinical trials that the various teams around the world are setting up. The results will inform about the antiviral agents that are used, their dosing and duration, the inclusion and exclusion criteria for patients, the outcomes that will be evaluated, as well as the design of the clinical trials. We believe that it is essential to carry out a review of these early phase clinical trials before the results are even available in order to best inform the teams wishing to test new therapies, choose therapeutic candidates or to design clinical trials.","If COVID-19 can be controlled by isolation and contact tracing, then public health efforts should be focused on this strategy; however, if this is not enough to control outbreaks, then additional resources might be needed for additional interventions. Several key characteristics of the transmissibility and natural history of COVID-19 are currently unknown\u2014eg, whether transmission can occur before symptom onset. Therefore, we explored a range of epidemiological scenarios that represent potential transmission properties based on current information about COVID-19 transmission. We assessed the ability of isolation and contact tracing to control disease outbreaks in areas without widespread transmission using a mathematical model.6, 15, 16, 17 By varying the efficacy of contact-tracing efforts, the size of the outbreak when detected, and the promptness of isolation after symptom onset, we show how viable it is for countries at risk of imported cases to use contact tracing and isolation as a containment strategy.","On January 31, CDC published its third Health Advisory with interim guidance for clinicians and public health practitioners.\u2020\u2020\u2020 In addition, CDC issued a Clinical Action Alert through its Clinician Outreach and Communication Activity network on January 31.\u00a7\u00a7\u00a7 Interim guidance for health care professionals is available at https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-nCoV/hcp/clinical-criteria.html. Health care providers should identify patients who might have been exposed and who have signs or symptoms related to 2019-nCoV infection, isolate these patients, and inform public health departments. This includes obtaining a detailed travel history for patients being evaluated with fever and lower respiratory tract illness. Criteria to guide evaluation and testing of PUIs for 2019-nCoV include 1) fever or signs or symptoms of lower respiratory tract illness (e.g., cough or shortness of breath) in any person, including health care workers, who has had close contact\u00b6\u00b6\u00b6 with a patient with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection within 14 days of symptom onset; 2) fever and signs or symptoms of lower respiratory tract illness (e.g., cough or shortness of breath) in any person with a history of travel from Hubei Province, China, within 14 days of symptom onset; or 3) fever and signs or symptoms of lower respiratory tract illness (e.g., cough or shortness of breath) requiring hospitalization in any person with a history of travel from mainland China within 14 days of symptom onset. Additional nonhospitalized PUIs may be tested based on consultation with state and local public health officials. Clinicians should evaluate PUIs for other possible causes of illness (e.g., influenza and respiratory syncytial virus) as clinically indicated.","Characterization of the first 12 patients with COVID-19 identified in the United States, including 7 hospitalized patients, provides key insight into the epidemiology, clinical characteristics, and natural history of SARS-CoV-2 infection. These patients experienced mild to moderately severe illness. Clinicians should anticipate that some patients may worsen in the second week of illness. Early and prolonged detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA suggest the window for diagnosis of COVID-19 is long. Although duration of infectiousness is unclear, our early data show viable virus can be cultured readily from upper respiratory tract specimens soon after illness onset. Further investigations are needed to understand clinical course, immunologic response, SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection, virus culture, and transmission, to inform clinical management and public health strategies to prevent disease spread.","As of Feb 13, 2020, an outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 has resulted in 46 997 confirmed cases. 1 The outbreak was first identified in Wuhan, China, in December, 2019, with most early cases being reported in the city. Most internationally exported cases reported to date have history of travel to Wuhan. 2 In the early stages of a new infectious disease outbreak, it is crucial to understand the transmission dynamics of the infection. Estimation of changes in transmission over time can provide insights into the epidemiological situation 3 and identify whether outbreak control measures are having a measurable effect. 4, 5 Such analysis can inform predictions about potential future growth, 6 help estimate risk to other countries, 7 and guide the design of alternative interventions. 8 However, there are several challenges to such analyses, particularly in real time. There can be a delay to symptom appearance resulting from the incubation period and delay to confirmation of cases resulting from detection and testing capacity. 9 Modelling approaches can account for such delays and uncertainty by explicitly incorporating delays resulting from the natural history of infection and reporting processes. 10 Additionally, individual data sources might be biased, incomplete, or only capture certain aspects of the outbreak dynamics. Evidence synthesis approaches, which fit to multiple data sources rather than a single dataset (or datapoint) can enable more robust estimation of the underlying dynamics of transmission from noisy data. 11, 12 Combining a mathematical model of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) transmission with four datasets from within and outside Wuhan, we estimated how transmission in Wuhan varied between December, 2019, and February, 2020. We used these estimates to assess the potential for sustained human-to-human transmission to occur in locations outside Wuhan if cases were introduced.","To decrease the damage associated with COVID-19, public health and infection control measures are urgently required to limit the global spread of the virus [35] . Experience from the early phase of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia strongly highlighted that travel history, rather than chest radiography, is of paramount importance for early detection and isolation of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia cases [41] . It is essential to limit human-to-human transmission in order to reduce secondary infections among close contacts and healthcare workers and to prevent transmission amplification events and further international spread from China. Based on previous experience of management of MERS and SARS infections, the WHO recommend infection control interventions to reduce the general risk of transmission of acute respiratory infections, including avoiding close contact with people suffering from acute respiratory infections, frequent hand-washing especially after direct contact with ill people or their environment, and avoiding unprotected contact with farm or wild animals. Moreover, people with symptoms of acute respiratory infection should practice cough etiquette, which is to maintain distance, cover coughs and sneezes with disposable tissues or clothing, and wash hands, and within healthcare facilities enhanced standard infection prevention and control practices are recommended in hospitals, especially in emergency departments [42] . The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has established interim clinical guidance for the COVID-19 outbreak to implement aggressive measures to slow the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in the USA [43] . These measures include identification of cases and their contacts in the USA as well as appropriate assessment and care of travellers arriving from mainland China to the USA [43] . All effort s are being made to slow the spread of the illness in order to provide time to better prepare healthcare systems and the general public, to better characterise COVID-19 to guide public-health recommendations, and to develop timely diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines [43] . Finally, although the improvement of internet communication largely enhances the availability and dissemination of knowledge, the internet also has the potential for the development and spread of misinformation or fake news. Governments should be responsible for providing accurate knowledge and clarifying misinformation to help the public face this novel infection.","If 2019-nCoV can be controlled by isolation and contact tracing, then public health efforts should be focussed on this strategy. However, if this is not enough to control outbreaks, then additional resources may be needed for additional interventions. There are currently key unknown characteristics of the transmissibility and natural history of 2019-nCoV; for example, whether transmission can occur before symptom onset. Therefore we explored a range of epidemiological scenarios that represent potential transmission properties based on current information about 2019-nCoV transmission. We assessed the ability of isolation and contact tracing to control disease outbreaks using a mathematical model 6, [15] [16] [17] [18] . By varying .

A review of the strategies that are already registered in official clinical registries of clinical trials is an important asset for researchers and methodologists. These results might inform the adaptation of existing clinical trials and the development of additional trials.","Zhou and coworkers [1] set the stage to address this public health emergency. They developed quantitative PCR-based methods to detect SARS-CoV-2 infections. Using these methods, they verified the respiratory tract as a principal infection site and established preliminary time courses of virus amplification and clearance in patients. Subsequent detailed clinical investigations demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 is detected within 1-2 days after patient symptoms, peaking 4-6 days later and clearing within 18 days [4] . Seroconversion was evident at that time, with abundant virus-specific IgG measured approximately 20 days after disease onset. These are the findings that help to define transmissibility periods and inform public health authorities on appropriate quarantine measures.","While there is a high level of agreement amongst key agencies that masks and respirators play a role in the protection of health workers, there are currently discrepancies between these agencies regarding how and when the different products are used. The World Health Organization (WHO), the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and other leading health organisations have different recommendations for the selection of respiratory protec-tion. For example, the WHO recommends using masks to protect health workers from COVID-19 during routine care and respirators during aerosol generating procedures ( World Health Organisation (WHO) 2020 ). In contrast, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) 2020 ) and the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control ( European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) 2020 ) recommend using respirators during both routine care of COVID19 patients and high risk situations. Individual countries also have different policies; some are in line with the WHO, and others with the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. For example, the Australian ( Communicable Diseases Network Australia (CDNA) ) and Canadian guidelines ( Government of Canada ) align with the WHO, while UK ( Public Health England ) and Chinese guidelines ( Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention 2020 ) align with the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and European Center for Disease Prevention and Control. While all organisations recommend using N95/ P2/FFP2 or equivalent respirators, Public Health England (UK) recommends using filtering facepiece 3 (FFP3) respirators for all cases and the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control recommends using FFP3 during aerosol generating procedures. Australian guidelines also recommend powered air purifying respirators while performing aerosol generating procedures on multiple patients. Although US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines also discuss powered air purifying respirators indication of their use is not clear.","The FDA has published a Guidance for Industry to assist sponsors in the clinical development of drugs for the treatment and prevention of disease caused by RSV (U.S. Food and Drug Administration, 2017). Although the guidance focuses primarily on the development of drugs for RSV in infants and children, special populations are also given attention. New drugs for treatment and prevention should demonstrate broad antiviral activity against diverse RSV strains and sponsors should monitor for the emergence of amino acid substitutions that may confer resistance. Randomized, double-blind, comparative trials should be conducted for both treatment and prevention products. Optimal endpoints have not been established for treatment trials. Phase 2 studies should evaluate a combination of clinical and virologic endpoints, while phase 3 trial endpoints should reflect improvement in clinical signs and symptoms of RSV-associated illness (\"feel, function, and survive\"). For prevention trials, FDA's preferred endpoint is laboratoryconfirmed, medically attended LRTI. In order to facilitate development of novel drugs, collaborative efforts are needed to develop definitions of disease severity, establish consensus definitions of LRTI, and develop reliable instruments to measure clinical improvement.","1. Describe patterns of infection and disease occurrence in populations. 2. Identify outbreaks or unusual rates of disease occurrence. 3 . Facilitate laboratory-based efforts to identify infectious agents. 4 . Describe the occurrence of asymptomatic infection and the spectrum of disease associated with specific agents. 5. Provide population-based descriptions of clinical illness to improve the specificity of diagnosis for individual diseases. 6. Assist in the understanding of disease pathogenesis. 7. Identify and characterize factors in the chain of infection that contribute to agent transmission and the development of disease. 8. Develop and evaluate treatment protocols through clinical trials. 9 . Develop and evaluate primary, secondary, and tertiary prevention and control measures for individuals. 10 . Describe and assess the use of prevention measures on a community-wide basis. These comprehensive goals far exceed the often-considered goal of epidemiologic analysis to investigate and control epidemics or outbreaks.","Social and economic effects of lockdown and other interventions and knock-on effects on health, including mental health and interpersonal violence, should also be empirically evaluated and incorporated into future models. Modelling entertainment, leisure venue, and mass-transport system closures would also be useful in subsequent efforts, as would the effects of closing different kinds of institutions for different durations. Such models would require empirical data on social contacts per day in each type of venue (in each country). Importantly, Prem and colleagues 1 model of the effect of distancing interventions on the Wuhan COVID-19 epidemic in 2020 also usefully explores uncertainty in the infectiousness of children and the duration of infectiousness. As more data emerge to inform these and all relevant parameters that influence transmission of this novel coronavirus, models can more accurately predict the success or failure of different strategies to control the epidemic and limit mortality.","This important amount of work conducted by researchers is encouraging for the therapeutic research for this new disease. However, care should be taken when designing a clinical trial in this complicated context as robust results are needed in order to be able to find the appropriate treatment. Finding the best agents for rapid implementation in clinical trials for a new outbreak is challenging. Our study underlines the need to register as much details as possible on clinical trials registries during outbreaks in order to inform the development of future trials. The scientific background supporting the use of a treatment should be clear and detailed as much as possible. The dose and duration of drugs evaluated, as well as details on the study design, the population of interest and the primary outcome, are crucial elements that have to be shared in the context of the epidemic response. Reporting as much details as possible is key to have consistent clinical trials and to enhance the reproducibility of the results, especially as studies are more often associated with a low number of planned inclusions and composite or weak outcomes that can limit the efficacy assessment of the treatments. That is why transparency and consistency are crucial when reporting clinical trials in order to improve statistical power by conducting, for example, meta-analyses.","The clinical trial is cited as the gold standard of epidemiologic research. However, many epidemiologic studies cannot take place under such rigorously controlled conditions. Taking advantage of opportunities to study diseases in clinical and community settings is one of the strengths of epidemiology. In the setting of a clinical practice, epidemiology may involve studying a series of patients, participating in multicenter trials, or being a reporting source for cases of disease to public health officials. This last aspect of epidemiologic study may be a legal obligation, but it should also be viewed as an opportunity for all practicing clinicians to participate in the practice of community-based epidemiology. Academic-based research centers are often settings for clinical trials, studies requiring newly developed laboratory methods, or studies derived from referrals to clinical specialty groups. Public health departments typically do not have direct access to or contact with patients for clinical trials, but they are responsible for surveillance of reportable diseases and the investigation of outbreaks. There has been a debate about how to distinguish public health surveillance from research and the ethical considerations of that distinction. 36 Each of the described settings provides opportunities for epidemiologic studies that can make major contributions to the understanding, prevention, and control of infectious diseases.","Clinical trials are research activities that involve the administration of a treatment or prevention regimen to humans to evaluate its safety and efficacy. 1 In general, these trials involve a comparison of clinical outcomes of a group of patients receiving treatment with the outcomes of a comparable control group. Most clinical trials of interest in infectious disease epidemiology are trials of antimicrobial agents and vaccines. An early forerunner to the modern clinical trial was a U.S.-based smallpox trial conducted in 1800. 80 During the 1950s, several multicenter trials were developed to evaluate chemotherapy in the treatment of tuberculosis. 81 In 1953, the U.S. poliomyelitis vaccine trials were conducted in collaboration with the U.S. Public Health Service and state health departments. 82 Many considerations are necessary when designing a clinical trial. First, should the trial be conducted at all? Is enough known about the safety and biologic activity of the treatment or vaccine to allow it to be administered to patients? This consideration requires some knowledge of the immunogenicity of candidate vaccines or the in vitro activity of an antibiotic against specific pathogens. Second, would patients be harmed by withholding the treatment or vaccine? These issues gained particular attention regarding trials of drugs and vaccines for introduction of certain normal microbial flora from the gastrointestinal tract into the bloodstream, infection can result. This type of infection is known as endogenous. If the agent is transported from an external source to the host (exogenous infection) and the balance between the agent and host favors the agent, infection usually develops.","This can inform actions that can minimize the risk that the estimated mean TP reaches the threshold prevalence ThreTP (Fig. 1 , phase C) at which the related number of hospitalized people could be too high, so that the health care system could be excessively stressed (Fig. 1, phase D) . The decision -maker could also choose to use any limit of the TP\u00b4s confidence interval rather than the mean, depending on risk-appetite and room for uncertainty in the health system. Some examples of how to define threshold prevalences, as well as setting (or comparing) survey prevalence results in the public health, are in [13] [14] .","The feasibility of enhancing model capacity to assess transmission risk and evaluating intervention effectiveness has also been substantially increased due to the improvement of the quality of the data, specially from other Chinese cities and provinces where the complete lock-down of major cities such as Wuhan in the Hubei province has prevented a significant portion of infection importation, so the reduction of imported cases coupled with intensive contact tracing produced some high quality data with rather complete information on symptom onset time and transmission-chain, as will be discussed in the data section below. This enhanced model capacity for near-casting is particularly important, since the gradually relaxing of the travel restriction demands proactive-and real-time assessment of the risk of a potential second outbreak in other Chinese cities. An objective of our study is to provide this assessment, and to use this assessment along with the incorporation of feasible public health interventions into our stochastic disease transmission model to suggest the scale of interventions for these cities to prevent a second outbreak. As COVID-19 spread has occurred in many regions globally, we believe our study provides an important tool to inform public health decisions regarding travel restriction and social distancing in these regions according to their public health capacity to maintain an effective contact tracing, quarantine and isolation procedure.","Full implementation of the best evidence-based science in health care epidemiology and infection control is essential if patient outcomes are to be optimized and health care costs minimized. With the rapid expansion of the health care epidemiology, infection control, and patient safety literature, it is increasingly difficult to stay up to date with the latest science in the field and to identify promptly and implement lifesaving prevention interventions. Guideline recommendations for prevention of health careassociated infections (HAI) are published periodically, but, often, important prevention measures or other advances in the science occur between guideline updates and may not be brought to the attention of infection control personnel (ICP). The purpose of the State of the Science presentation at the annual meeting of the Association for Professionals in Infection Control and Epidemiology, Inc (APIC) is to review the latest scientific advances in the field each year and to bring these findings to the attention of the infection control community. This paper will summarize the advances in the state of the science of health care epidemiology, infection control, and patient safety during the last year.","Nevertheless, our ongoing investigation has only detected transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in a single household contact with frequent, prolonged interactions with the index patient. The absence of COVID-19 among healthcare personnel supports recommendations regarding appropriate infection control. These findings also support CDC's assessment that, without using appropriate PPE, people living in the same household as, or providing care in a non-health-care setting for, a person with symptomatic laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 have high-risk exposure. 21 In these contexts, CDC's recommendation for people with high-risk exposures to remain quarantined with no public activities might be effective in reducing onward person-toperson transmission of SARS-CoV-2. 11 Given the difficulty in detecting new symptoms in patients with underlying lung disease, CDC recommends that clinicians considering a diagnosis of COVID-19 should discuss testing with public health departments on a case-by-case basis. 22 Patients with potential exposure to SARS-CoV-2 with a fever, cough, or shortness of breath should call their health-care provider before seeking care so that appropriate preventive actions can be implemented. 21 Healthcare facilities should rapidly triage and isolate suspected PUIs and notify infection prevention services and local health departments for support in testing, management, and containment efforts. 22 Contributors IG, TDM, JCH, and HLK each led aspects of the contact investigation and JRV and JEL provided overall leadership and guidance to the investigation.

Future directions to control the spread of the disease Extensive measures to reduce person-to-person transmission of COVID-19 are required to control the current outbreak. Special attention and efforts to protect or reduce transmission should be applied in susceptible populations including children, health care providers, and elderly people. A guideline was published for the medical staff, healthcare providers, and, public health individuals and researchers who are interested in the 2019-nCoV [29] . The early death cases of COVID-19 outbreak occurred primarily in elderly people, possibly due to a weak immune system that permits faster progression of viral infection [8, 12] . The public services and facilities should provide decontaminating reagents for cleaning hands on a routine basis. Physical contact with wet and contaminated objects should be considered in dealing with the virus, especially agents such as faecal and urine samples that can potentially serve as an alternative route of transmission [15, 16] . China and other countries including the US have implemented major prevention and control measures including travel screenings to control further spread of the virus [13] . Epidemiological changes in COVID-19 infection should be monitored taking into account potential routes of transmission and subclinical infections, in addition to the adaptation, evolution, and virus spread among humans and possible intermediate animals and reservoirs. There remains a considerable number of questions that need to be addressed. These include, but are not limited to, details about who and how many have been tested, what proportion of these turned positive and whether this rate remains constant or variable. Very few paediatric cases have so far been reported; is this due to lack of testing or a true lack of infection/susceptibility? Of the ones that have so far been tested, how many have developed severe disease and how many were tested positive but showed no clinical sign of disease? There are some basic questions that would provide a framework for which more specific and detailed public health measures can be implemented.","It is important for public health agencies, health care providers, and the public to be aware of this new 2019-nCoV so that coordinated, timely, and effective actions can help prevent additional cases or poor health outcomes. The critical role that the U.S. health care system plays in halting or significantly slowing U.S. transmission of 2019-nCoV is already evident: eight of the first 11 U.S. cases were detected by clinicians collaborating with public health to test persons at risk. The early recognition of cases in the United States reduces transmission risk and increases understanding of the virus, including its transmission and severity, to inform national and global response actions.","Public health efforts to control and prevent infectious diseases are based on epidemiologic and laboratory surveillance systems that detect and monitor disease incidence, define pathogen characteristics, and track cases 'by person, place and time' [25]. Molecular epidemiology has long been a mainstay of public health surveillance; now, increasingly powerful molecular methods, including sequencing of whole pathogen genomes, help investigators to identify epidemiologically related cases, describe patterns of transmission, pinpoint sources of infection, and explain antimicrobial resistance [26-33]. Combining the methods of molecular pathogenomics with population genetics and epidemiology can provide new insights into the episodic behavior of epidemics of familiar pathogens, such as group A streptococcus [7]. Archived biological samples can also provide new insights into the emergence and evolution of infectious threats, from HIV [34] to influenza [35]. Building the capacity for human biological sample collection into existing surveillance networks has the potential to facilitate a more comprehensive, population-based evaluation of genomic and environmental determinants of health outcomes. For example, a meta-analysis of surveillance cohorts from Arizona, Colorado, California, and Illinois demonstrated that human homozygosity for CCR5delta32 (a non-functional variant of chemokine receptor CCR5) is consistently associated with symptomatic West Nile virus infection [36]. When disease surveillance is conducted independently in multiple jurisdictions, the capacity to share biological samples and epidemiologic and clinical data provides important infrastructure for research.","If transdisciplinary approaches yield longer-lasting effects, make medical interventions more successful or less necessary, provide health-care access to more sectors of the community, and more effectively address economic and gender inequities than do standard biomedical interventions alone, these gains can help achieve a fundamental shift in devising and implementing disease-prevention strategies. The successes, and policy relevance, of these approaches will be key to their institutionalization (Lebel, 2004). Additionally, teams and communities of transdisciplinary researchers must communicate their successes and failures so that they are understood by a wide range of audiences and measured by appropriate indices, particularly because holistic systems-based research can take a long time to complete and tends not to make the same splash as large drug or vaccine trials. Substantial outreach and education efforts will be required to achieve these goals, which include communication with, and participation by, those whose health is being studied as well as by decision-makers at multiple levels, from emergency physicians and veterinarians to funding agencies and global policy makers.","As the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID- 19) is rapidly expanding in China and beyond, with the potential to become a worldwide pandemic, 1 real-time analyses of epidemiological data are needed to increase situational awareness and inform interventions. 2 Previously, real-time analyses have shed light on the transmissibility, severity, and natural history of an emerging pathogen in the first few weeks of an outbreak, such as with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), the 2009 influenza pandemic, and Ebola. [3] [4] [5] [6] Analyses of detailed line lists of patients are particularly useful to infer key epidemiological parameters, such as the incubation and infectious periods, and delays between infection and detection, isolation, and reporting of cases. 3, 4 However, official individual patient data rarely become publicly available early on in an outbreak, when the information is most needed.","As the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID- 19) is rapidly expanding in China and beyond, with the potential to become a worldwide pandemic, 1 real-time analyses of epidemiological data are needed to increase situational awareness and inform interventions. 2 Previously, real-time analyses have shed light on the transmissibility, severity, and natural history of an emerging pathogen in the first few weeks of an outbreak, such as with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), the 2009 influenza pandemic, and Ebola.

Seroincidence surveys allow the investigator to (1) define total infection rates, (2) relate infection rates to prior antibody levels, and (3) identify risk factors for infection. 66 Prospective cohort studies are limited because of the enrollment size and observation period requirements for diseases of low incidence. Retrospective cohort studies in which previous exposures can be identified offer the advantage of not requiring additional observation periods. However, they may be limited by the recall of study subjects or the adequacy of available medical records. the treatment of HIV infection. The initial double-blind, placebocontrolled study of oral azidothymidine (AZT) in AIDS patients was stopped early because of the marked effectiveness of the treatment. 83 Over the past decade, multiple efficacy trials of an HIV-1 vaccine were terminated early when an interim analysis demonstrated that the vaccine did not protect against HIV infection or reduce viral loads after infection and may have increased susceptibility in some subjects. 84, 85 An overriding concern in HIV-related clinical trials is the need to maintain behavior-related educational interventions for all participants in the trials. Although this may reduce the likelihood of demonstrating vaccine efficacy because of the lack of new infections among placebo recipients, to withhold such education would be unethical.","To date, no specific antiviral treatment has been confirmed to be effective against COVID-19. Regarding patients infected with COVID-19, it has been recommended to apply appropriate symptomatic treatment and supportive care [3, 16]. There are six clinical trials registered in both the International Clinical Trials Registry platform and the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry to evaluate the efficacy or safety of targeted medicine in the treatment or prognosis of COVID-19 (Additional file 2) [51, 52]. Regarding infected patients with COVID-19, it has been recommended to apply appropriate symptomatic treatment and supportive care [3, 16]. Studies have also explored the prevention of nosocomial infection and psychological health issues associated with COVID-19. A series of measures have been suggested to reduce nosocomial infection, including knowledge training for prevention and control, isolation, disinfection, classified protections at different degrees in infection areas, and protection of confirmed cases [18, 50, 53]. Concerning psychological health, some suggested psychological intervention for confirmed cases, suspected cases, and medical staff [18, 54].","The overriding epidemiological priority to inform public health control would be to compile and release a line list of suspected, possible, probable, and confirmed cases and close contacts that is updated daily and linked to clinical outcomes and laboratory test results. A robust line list is essential for the generation of accurate and precise epidemiological parameters as inputs into transmission models to inform situational awareness and optimising the responses to the epidemic. 41 Additionally, given the extent of spread and level of public concern it has already generated, the clinical spectrum and severity profile of 2019-nCoV infections needs rapid ascertainment by unbiased and reliable methods in unselected samples of cases, especially those with mild or subclinical presentations.","The protection of public health from external impact caused by the spread of diseases such as epidemics or pandemics. 5. The adequacy of efforts to inform and update the population, to create a mechanism to protect public health which is in constant readiness through a permanent cross-European body.","Rapid guidelines, typically completed within 1-3 months, are needed to provide guidance in response to a time-sensitive need such as during a public health emergency. 95,96 Using a rapid guideline process, the AGA aims to provide timely guidance on appropriate PPE and triage of GI endoscopy in context of the COVID-19 pandemic in the U.S. Due to the paucity of evidence specific to SARS-CoV-2 infection, many questions regarding clinical management remain unanswered, including implications and clinical considerations for vulnerable populations, such as individuals with IBD or other autoimmune GI or liver conditions on immunosuppression, patients with cirrhosis or end-stage liver disease, and individuals with GI malignancies requiring systemic chemotherapy. International registries such as the Surveillance Epidemiology of Coronavirus (COVID-19) Under Research and Exclusion, or SECURE-IBD, (https://covidibd.org), may serve as a valuable data source in the future as clinicians engage in information sharing to inform stronger evidence-based guidance. Ongoing clinical trials for COVID-19 treatment may be associated with GI adverse effects and increase the demands for GI consultative care. Furthermore, the severity and duration of resource limitations for SARS-CoV-2 testing and PPE may further challenge clinical management decisions. Importantly, due to the rapidly evolving nature of the COVID-19 pandemic, these recommendations will likely need to be updated within a short timeframe. We are very confident that the true effect lies close to that of the estimate of the effect.","Mathematical models can help us understand how SARS-CoV-2 could spread across the population and inform control measures that might mitigate future transmission. 25, 26 We simulated the trajectory of the ongoing outbreak of COVID-19 in Wuhan using an agestructured SEIR model. 17, 18 As individuals' mixing patterns are non-random, they influence the transmission dynamics of the disease. 11 Models that assess the effectiveness of physical distancing interventions, such as school closure, need to account for social structures and heterogeneities in mixing of individuals. [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] In our model, we incorporated changes to age-specific and location-specific social mixing patterns to estimate the effects of location-specific physical distancing interventions in curtailing the spread of the outbreak. The measures put in place to reduce contacts at schools and workplaces are helping control the outbreak by providing the health-care system with the time and opportunity to expand and respond. Consequently, if these restrictions are lifted prematurely, while there are still enough susceptible people to keep the R e &gt;1 once contacts increase, the number of infections would increase. Realistically, interventions are lifted slowly, partly as an attempt to avoid a sharp increase in infection, but also for logistical and practical reasons. Therefore, we simulated lifting the interventions in a staggered fashion. Evidence of the effects of various physical dis tancing measures on containing the outbreak are scarce and little is known about the behavioural changes of individuals over time, either during an outbreak or otherwise. Therefore, to model the effects of the physical distancing measures implemented in Wuhan, we assumed the effect that certain types of physical distancing have on age-specific and location-specific contact rates.","As of 13 th February 2020, an outbreak of COVID-19 has resulted in 46,997 confirmed cases (1) . The outbreak was first identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, with the majority of early cases being reported in the city. The majority of internationally exported cases reported to date have a travel history to Wuhan (2) . In the early stages of a new infectious disease outbreak, it is crucial to understand the transmission dynamics of the infection. In particular, estimation of changes in transmission over time can provide insights into the current epidemiological situation (3) and identify whether outbreak control measures are having a measurable effect (4, 5) . Such analysis can inform predictions about potential future growth (6) , help estimate risk to other countries (7) , and guide the design of alternative interventions (8) .","Despite the deficiencies in our understanding of disease pathogenesis, therapy for MS has advanced. Phase III clinical trials with interferon-8 and copolymer 1 have demonstrated modest but definite benefit. The mechanisms by which these drugs favorably influence the clinical course of MS remain to be elucidated. Recent studies of chemotherapeutic agents suggest that control of chronic progressive disease may be a real possibility. Future clinical trials will attempt to define the efficacy of and parameters for these therapies. Another question that remains unanswered is whether the use of multiple-drug therapy might be beneficial in the treatment of MS. For example, combined therapy with interferon-i3lb and copolymer 1 may produce more benefit than either drug alone. In chronic progressive disease, the use of Solu-Medrol in combination with another immunosuppressant such as azathioprine or methotrexate also should be explored.","These conflicting policies may cause confusion for hospital managers, nurses and other health workers. Conflicting guidelines have resulted in a large amount of online debate between infectious disease providers and infection prevention control experts about what approaches should be adopted. History is repeating itself with the same controversies around powered air purifying respirators during the The only similarity is that all health organisations and countries generally recommend the use of masks by suspected or infected cases of COVID-19 (i.e. source control) to prevent spread of infections. They simultaneously state that community use of masks has no benefit. Yet there are more randomised controlled clinical https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijnurstu.2020.103567 0020-7489/\u00a9 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

The community trials show a benefit of face masks with or without hand hygiene, conditional on compliance ( Simmerman et al., 2011 ; Aiello et al., 2012 ; Aiello et al., 2010 b; Suess et al., 2012 ; MacIntyre et al., 2009 ; Cowling et al., 2009 ). There are only two RCTs of clinical efficacy of source control ( Canini et al., 2010 ; MacIntyre et al., 2016 ) , and one small experimental RCT of 9 subjects ( Johnson et al., 2009 ). These suggest a benefit, but larger trials are needed.","\uf0b7 Inquire about symptoms of a respiratory infection, history of travel to areas experiencing transmission of COVID-19, or contact with patients with possible COVID-19 before patient triage or registration (for example, at the time of patient check-in). \uf0b7 Attempt to minimize the chance of exposure by trying to screen patients before arrival to a clinical area (for example, asking patients calling for appointments about travel history) and identifying them as early as possible upon arrival (such as by posting signs advising patients to put on a mask if they have respiratory symptoms). \uf0b7 If screening at triage is positive and the patient becomes a person under investigation (PUI), this should be communicated directly to the clinicians who will care for the patient, prevention and control services, and other health care facility staff according to a standard protocol. \uf0b7 Adhere to standard contact and airborne precautions, including eye protection. \uf0b7 Monitor stock and the supply chain to ensure adequate supplies of personal protective equipment. \uf0b7 Manage visitor access and movement within the facility. \uf0b7 Implement mechanisms and policies to promptly alert key facility staff, including infection control, health care epidemiology, facility leadership, occupational health, clinical laboratory, and frontline staff about known or suspected COVID-19 patients. \uf0b7 Identify specific staff to communicate and collaborate with state or local public health authorities. \uf0b7 Hand hygiene, hand hygiene, hand hygiene.","Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) will continue to be an emerging global threat. The WHO and other agencies have developed ambitious initiatives to combat AMR. However, a serious barrier to surveillance of AMR is that the worst affected regions of the world, including sub-Saharan Africa, have generated the least data on prevalence and trends of AMR, a key step in addressing the problem [8] . Effective resolution of AMR will need multistakeholder international cooperation, including the biotechnology industry and regulatory authorities, and effective international implementation by health authorities and health professionals of guidelines on the judicious use of any powerful new classes of treatment which emerge [9 , 10] . Developments in diagnostics are likely to include more advanced imaging, increasing availability of point of care testing (biochemical and genomic), and the further extension of genomics into clinical practice, potentially before and around the time of birth. There will be increasing opportunities for using real-world evidence to assist in regulation of medicines, in particular for rare and orphan diseases [11] . Expected further and new therapeutic approaches -many with ethical challenges -include biosimilars, more precision medicines with companion diagnostics [12] , regenerative medicine, gene editing, more advanced microsurgery and robotics, therapeutic radiology and new devices for managing diabetes mellitus, pain control, heart disease and many other conditions. Also in prospect is much more from digital health, including both empowering patients and further transfer of responsibility for health monitoring from health professionals to patients. However, another side to digital health is the power of social media to inform -and misinform -patients, health professionals and other stakeholders about health-related matters. This is one of several reasons for low adherence to long-term treatment, for example for control of high blood pressure [13] . Another possible impact of widespread access to and use of social media has been vaccine hesitancy: delay or refusal to accept immunization [14] . For example, population protection from the potentially serious infectious disease measles has decreased alarmingly both in the general public -and in some regions even among health professionals. To counter this, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control has been funded to work jointly with the European Medicines Agency to provide Europe-wide information to vaccine-hesitant populations and respond to their concerns, and to provide toolkits for healthcare workers and public health experts to support their effort s to improve the uptake of immunization programmes [15] .","Background Low adherence of patients to prescribed, selfadministered medical interventions is ubiquitous. Low adherence limits the benefits of current medical care. Efforts to assist patients to follow treatments might improve the efficiency of care and substantially enhance benefits. Our objective was to summarise the results of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of interventions to help patients follow prescriptions for medications.","In order to ensure that the registry generates the robust data needed to inform the care of IBD patients, however, we need to garner even broader participation. We write this letter to implore all providers taking care of patients with IBD to report cases of COVID-19 among their IBD patients on our website (www.covidibd.org). Reporting a case takes approximately five minutes, and will help us to better define the impact of COVID-19 among our patient population.","The Chinese government has developed and enacted a series of laws and regulations for the prevention and control of infectious diseases in humans, domestic animals, and wild animals, such as the Infectious Diseases Prevention Law of the People's Republic of China, Emergency Regulations on Public Health Emergencies, Major Animal Disease Emergency Ordinance, Animal Epidemic Prevention Law of the People's Republic of China, National Sudden Major Animal Disease Contingency Plans, Terrestrial Wild Animal Epidemic Sources and Disease Monitoring Standards. [80] [81] [82] These laws and regulations define the responsibilities of governments at all levels, and help them to report, control, treat, and take other emergency measures against infectious diseases in humans, domestic animals, and wild animals. 83 ","Two independent studies of infected populations in Wuhan, China found that approximately half the subjects infected with COVID-19 had an existing comorbidity [1, 2] .

The most common comorbidities reported in these studies were hypertension, diabetes, cerebrovascular disease, chronic obstructive lung disease, and coronary heart disease [1] [2] [3] . Other comorbidities such as carcinoma, chronic kidney disease, chronic liver disease, digestive system disease, and nervous system disease have also been reported in patients with COVID-19 [1, 2, 4] . A better understanding of the link between these conditions and COVID-19 infection is required to inform better treatment and prevention interventions.","i.e. these instruments can be reprocessed according to best practice and returned to use. Optimal reprocessing standards must be observed. Additionally, dentists are reminded that any instruments labelled by the manufacturer as 'single use' should not be re-used under any circumstances. \u25a0 There is no reason why any of the categories of patients defined in Box 3.7 or their relatives should be refused routine dental treatment. They can be treated in the same way as any member of the general public. \u25a0 When patients 'at risk' of CJD/vCJD undergo maxillofacial surgery that may disrupt certain cranial nerves, CNS, orbit or lymphoid tissues of the head and neck, special infection control precautions may need to be taken, as described in the TSE Infection Control Guidance. \u25a0 There are several groups of patients who are identified as being at an additional risk of CJD (i.e. a risk over and above the risk in the general UK population that is around 1 in a million for sporadic CJD and is currently unknown for vCJD). These patients are considered 'at risk' of CJD for public health purposes. \u25a0 There has been a considerable increase in the number of patients classified as 'at risk' of vCJD due to the notification of patients considered at risk due to receipt of UK blood products. This number may increase further if more blood donors develop vCJD. \u25a0 Patients identified as 'at risk' of CJD (including vCJD) for public health purposes are asked to take the following precautions to reduce any possible risk of spreading CJD: \u2022 not to donate blood, organs or tissues \u2022 to inform health care staff before they undergo medical, surgical or dental treatment \u2022 to inform their families in case they need emergency surgery in the future. \u25a0 The health care professionals who notify these patients of their 'at risk' status have been asked to arrange for the information to be recorded in patients' hospital medical records and/or primary care notes. \u25a0 The responsibility for informing Primary Dental Carers lies with the patients themselves. \u25a0 When treating a patient with CJD, or a patient who informs you that he/she has been identified as 'at risk' of CJD, you should ensure that satisfactory standards of decontamination are observed. Under these conditions, routine dentistry is understood to be low risk, and therefore no special infection control precautions are advised for the instruments used on symptomatic or 'at risk' patients. Primary Dental Carers should also ensure information about patients' CJD status is included in any referrals for head and neck surgery. \u25a0 Dental health care staff infected or potentially infected with prion disease should not practise invasive clinical procedures if there is a risk of motor and cognitive dysfunction.","Most respondents reported involvement in local clinical research initiatives (88 %) while only 21 % of respondents claimed to be part of specific research networks, predominantly focused upon clinical infectious diseases and critical care and the focus of investigation was mostly (84 %) upon adults.

Within a week, CDC developed a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments\u2013approved real-time RT-PCR test that can diagnose 2019-nCoV respiratory samples from clinical specimens. On January 24, CDC publicly posted the assay protocol for this test (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-nCoV/lab/index.html). On January 4, 2020, the Food and Drug Administration issued an Emergency Use Authorization to enable emergency use of CDC\u2019s 2019-nCoV Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel. To date, this test has been limited to use at CDC laboratories. This authorization allows the use of the test at any CDC-qualified lab across the country. CDC is working closely with FDA and public health partners, including the American Public Health Laboratories, to rapidly share these tests domestically and internationally through CDC\u2019s International Reagent Resource (https://www.internationalreagentresource.org/). In addition, CDC uploaded the genome of the virus from the first reported cases in the United States to GenBank, the National Institutes of Health genetic sequence database of publicly available DNA sequences (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/). CDC also is growing the virus in cell culture, which is necessary for further studies, including for additional genetic characterization.

Human infection with avian influenza viruses, the novel A influenza (H1N1), and imported infectious diseases such as the Zika virus disease and yellow fever disease are already knocking at our doors! Important lessons learned in China included the need for more honesty and transparency, improvement of surveillance, better laboratory facilities, and optimized case management. 27 Also, public health measures to control infectious diseases, reporting systems, and central guidance and coordination came under scrutiny. Another lesson was the need to inform the public about, and involve them in, control measures in an adequate and timely manner. There was a strong realization that the best defense against any threat of newly emerging infectious diseases is a robust public health system in its science, capacity, and practice, and through collaboration with clinical and veterinary medicine, academia, industry, and other public and private partners.","Several schemes can be used to classify or define types of epidemiologic studies (Table 13-1) . Studies can be classified as descriptive or analytic and as observational or experimental. A descriptive study is designed to describe only the existing distribution of case characteristics, without regard to causal or other hypotheses. 41 For example, the results of community-based surveillance for Campylobacter infection may include a summary of all cases reported in a given year by date of onset, county of residence, age, gender, and race. An analytic study is one designed to examine associations, particularly hypothesized causal relationships. For example, a case-control study could be designed to examine whether consumption of ready-to-eat meat and poultry products is a risk factor for cases of invasive listeriosis infections identified through surveillance activities. In addition to case-control studies, cohort studies, clinical trials, and cross-sectional surveys are common not seen when the typical clinical manifestations of the disease were present, and laboratory testing was not adequate to establish the diagnosis. In contrast, the diagnosis of measles can be confirmed by specific serologic testing, regardless of whether the physician sees the patient or has the training and experience to recognize the pathognomonic clinical features of the disease. Surveillance for invasive bacterial diseases such as those caused by N. meningitidis is facilitated by the need for medical treatment because of the relative severity of the disease and the laboratory-supported diagnosis. For diseases such as these, active case ascertainment can greatly enhance the effectiveness of surveillance activities. However, active surveillance requires the commitment of personnel and other resources that are limited for many reportable diseases. Nonetheless, it may be critical to evaluating the impact of vaccines for invasive diseases such as Haemophilus influenzae type b, which declined by 95% within 6 years after the introduction of the conjugate vaccine in 1989. Active surveillance for invasive H. influenzae disease has confirmed the effective control of H. influenzae type b with no evidence of increased disease caused by non-B serotypes in young children in the United States. 57 Typically, active surveillance may be conducted for a limited period when complete data are most critical. Examples include the characterization of emerging diseases such as AIDS or SARS and special surveillance projects aimed at assessing an intervention, such as evaluating whether the occurrence of intussusception was causally related to the use of rotavirus vaccine. 58 Most infectious disease surveillance conducted by public health departments in the United States is passive in that it relies on the physician or the laboratory to initiate the report. Passive surveillance systems are subject to selection bias because disease reports are likely to come from a nonrepresentative sample of practicing physicians who may report specific diseases because of personal interest. 44 In addition, some data (i.e., age and gender versus clinical and pathologic information) may be more readily reported because of ease of ascertainment. 44 Active surveillance is relatively more common in the hospital setting. For example, surveillance of nosocomial infections is an important hospital infection-prevention activity. 59 This highly specialized surveillance system has the operational advantage of a defined population, routine clinical observation of the patient population, and direct access to the laboratory. Hospital-based surveillance has been a primary epidemiologic tool in the study of drug-resistant organisms."],"title":["COVID-19: towards controlling of a pandemic","Challenges of infectious diseases

Starting in March 2014, a dramatic increase of cases has occurred in the Arabian Peninsula, many of which were acquired in health care settings. As of May 9, 2014, 536 laboratory-confirmed cases and 145 deaths have been reported globally. Methods Review of publicly available data about MERS-CoV health care\u2013associated transmission. Results We identified 11 events of possible or confirmed health care\u2013associated transmission with high morbidity and mortality, mainly among patients with comorbidities. Health care workers are also frequently affected; however, they tend to have milder symptoms and better prognosis. Gaps in infection control were noted in all events. Currently, health care\u2013associated outbreaks are playing a pivotal role in the evolution of the MERS-CoV epidemic in countries in the Arabian Peninsula. Conclusion There ...","The 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) pneumonia, believed to have originated in a wet market in Wuhan, Hubei province, China at the end of 2019, has gained intense attention nationwide and globally. To lower the risk of further disease transmission, the authority in Wuhan suspended public transport indefinitely from Jan 23, 2020; similar measures were adopted soon in many other cities in China. As of Jan 25, 2020, 30 Chinese provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions covering over 1\u00b73 billion people have initiated first-level responses to major public health emergencies. A range of measures has been urgently adopted,1,2 such as early identification and isolation of suspected and diagnosed cases, contact tracing and monitoring, collection of clinical data and biological samples from patients, dissemination of regional and national diagnostic criteria and expert treatment consensus, establishment of isolation units and hospitals, and prompt provision of medical supplies and exter...","Background: Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) was first identified in humans in 2012. A systematic literature review was conducted to synthesize current knowledge and identify critical knowledge gaps. Materials and Methods: We conducted a systematic review on MERS-CoV using PRISMA guidelines. We identified 407 relevant, peer-reviewed publications and selected 208 of these based on their contributions to four key areas: virology; clinical characteristics, outcomes, therapeutic and preventive options; epidemiology and transmission; and animal interface and the search for natural hosts of MERS-CoV. Results: Dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4/CD26) was identified as the human receptor for MERS-CoV, and a variety of molecular and serological assays developed. Dromedary camels remain the only documented zoonotic source of human infection, but MERS-like CoVs have been detected in bat species globally, as well as in dromedary camels throughout the Middle East and Africa. Howeve...","Summary In the USA, infectious diseases continue to exact a substantial toll on health and health-care resources. Endemic diseases such as chronic hepatitis, HIV, and other sexually transmitted infections affect millions of individuals and widen health disparities. Additional concerns include health-care-associated and foodborne infections\u2014both of which have been targets of broad prevention efforts, with success in some areas, yet major challenges remain. Although substantial progress in reduction of the burden of vaccine-preventable diseases has been made, continued cases and outbreaks of these diseases persist, driven by various contributing factors. Worldwide, emerging and reemerging infections continue to challenge prevention and control strategies while the growing problem of antimicrobial resistance needs urgent action. An important priority for control of infectious disease is to ensure that scientific and technological advances in molecular diagnostics and bioinformatics are we...","Abstract Health planning and policy seek to create a group of mutually interacting bodies to produce goods and services to meet the health needs of a population. Recent developments in the health status of the population are characterized by continuous improvement in life expectancy, chronic diseases which absorb 90% of total health care expenditure, differences in the causes of mortality (more than 70% mortality from cancer, heart and brain, and external causes). The new trends in health indicators define the current health policies and lead to the necessity of adapting the health system so as to meet the changing health needs of the population. Especially in the context of the changes in the epidemiological spectrum and the variability in the indices of morbidity and mortality, the focus is not only to further prolong life expectancy but also to improve life expectancy without chronic diseases and without disabilities and to reduce the avoidable mortality, the potential years of life...","Summary Objective Public health surveillance applications are central to the collection, analysis and dissemination of disease and health information. As these applications evolve and mature, it is evident that many of these applications must address similar requirements, such as policies, security and flexibility. It is important a software architecture is created to meet these requirements. Methods We outline the requirements for a public health surveillance application, and define a set of common components to address these requirements. These components are configured to produce services used in the development of public health applications. Results A layered software architecture, the ALPHA architecture, has been developed to support the development of public health applications. The architecture has been used to build eleven surveillance applications for the Public Health Agency of Canada in the areas of disease surveillance, survey, distributed data collection and inventory mana...","Background Similar to outbreaks of many other infectious diseases, success in controlling the novel 2019 coronavirus infection requires a timely and accurate monitoring of the epidemic, particularly during its early period with rather limited data while the need for information increases explosively. Methods In this study, we used a second derivative model to characterize the coronavirus epidemic in China with cumulatively diagnosed cases during the first 2 months. The analysis was further enhanced by an exponential model with a close-population assumption. This model was built with the data and used to assess the detection rate during the study period, considering the differences between the true infections, detectable and detected cases. Results Results from the second derivative modeling suggest the coronavirus epidemic as nonlinear and chaotic in nature. Although it emerged gradually, the epidemic was highly responsive to massive interventions initiated on January 21, 2020, as indi...","The novel corona virus disease -2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has caused a massive global public health havoc. Recent clinical trials carried out in China has found a promising therapeutic application of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine for COVID-19. This study meticulously evaluated the various dosages of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine utilized in clinical trials registered in Chinese and US clinical trial registries for the treatment of pneumonia caused by SARS-CoV-2.","AbstractThe rigidity and flexibility of two recently reported crystal structures (PDB entries 6Y2E and 6LU7) of a protease from the SARS-CoV-2 virus, the infectious agent of the COVID-19 respiratory disease, has been investigated using pebble-game rigidity analysis, elastic network model normal mode analysis, and all-atom geometric simulations. This computational investigation of the viral protease follows protocols that have been effective in studying other homodimeric enzymes. The protease is predicted to display flexible motions in vivo which directly affect the geometry of a known inhibitor binding site and which open new potential binding sites elsewhere in the structure. A database of generated PDB files representing natural flexible variations on the crystal structures has been produced and made available for download from an institutional data archive. This information may inform structure-based drug design and fragment screening efforts aimed at identifying specific antiviral ...","Objectives: To examine heterogeneity of outcomes in protocols of clinical trials of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) and to identify outcomes for prioritization in developing a core outcome set (COS) in this field. Design: This study is a review. Data sources: Databases of ICMJE-accepted clinical trial registry platform were searched on February 14, 2020. Eligibility Criteria: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and non-RCTs of COVID-19 were considered.Conditions of patients include common type, severe type or critical type. Interventions include traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) and Western medicine. We excluded trials that for discharged patients, psychological intervention and complications of COVID-19. Data extraction and synthesis: The general information and outcomes, outcome measurement instruments and measurement times were extracted. The results were analysed by descriptive analysis. Results: 19 registry platforms were searched. A total of 97 protocols were included from 1...","Abstract Purpose COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) is a public health emergency of international concern. As of this time, there is no known effective pharmaceutical treatment, although it is much needed for patient contracting the severe form of the disease. The aim of this systematic review was to summarize the evidence regarding chloroquine for the treatment of COVID-19. Methods PubMed, EMBASE, and three trial Registries were searched for studies on the use of chloroquine in patients with COVID-19. Results We included six articles (one narrative letter, one in-vitro study, one editorial, expert consensus paper, two national guideline documents) and 23 ongoing clinical trials in China. Chloroquine seems to be effective in limiting the replication of SARS-CoV-2 (virus causing COVID-19) in vitro. Conclusions There is rationale, pre-clinical evidence of effectiveness and evidence of safety from long-time clinical use for other indications to justify clinical research on chloroquine in...","Surveillance is essential for communicable disease prevention and control. Traditional notification of demographic and clinical information, about individuals with selected (notifiable) infectious diseases, allows appropriate public health action and is protected by public health and privacy legislation, but is slow and insensitive. Big data\u2013based electronic surveillance, by commercial bodies and government agencies (for profit or population control), which draws on a plethora of internet- and mobile device\u2013based sources, has been widely accepted, if not universally welcomed. Similar anonymous digital sources also contain syndromic information, which can be analysed, using customised algorithms, to rapidly predict infectious disease outbreaks, but the data are nonspecific and predictions sometimes misleading. However, public health authorities could use these online sources, in combination with de-identified personal health data, to provide more accurate and earlier warning of infectio...","Background: COVID-19 outbreak is spreading globally. Although the risk of infection in the US is currently low, it is important to understand the public perception of risk and trust in sources of information to better inform public health messaging. In this study, we surveyed the adult US population to understand their risk perceptions about the COVID-19 outbreak. Methods and Findings: We used an online platform to survey 718 adults in the US in early February 2020 using a questionnaire that we developed. Our sample was fairly similar to the general adult US population in terms of age, gender, race, ethnicity and education. We found that 69% of the respondents wanted the scientific/public health leadership (either the CDC Director or NIH Director) to lead the US response to COVID-19 outbreak as compared to 14% who wanted the political leadership (either the president or the Congress) to lead the response. Risk perception was low (median score of 5 out of 10) with the respondents trusti...","The rapid emergence of clinical trials on COVID-19 stimulated a wave of discussion in scientific community. We reviewed the characteristics of interventional trials from Chinese Clinical Trial Registration (ChiCTR) and ClinicalTrials.gov. A total of 171 COVID-19-related interventional trials were identified on Feb 22nd, 2020. These trials are classified into 4 categories based on treatment modalities, including chemical drugs, biological therapies, traditional Chinese medicine treatments and other therapies. Our analysis focused on the issues of stage, design, randomization, blinding, primary endpoints definition and sample size of these trials. We found some studies with potential defects including unreasonable design, inappropriate primary endpoint definition, insufficient sample size and ethical issue. Clinical trials on COVID-19 should be designed based on scientific rules, ethics and benefits for patients.","Background: On 12 March, the World Health Organization Director-General declared that \"the threat of a global pandemic has become a reality\", and the disease caused by the novel coronavirus, known as COVID-19, has become a global concern. Chinese efforts in curbing the virus have widely been recognized. Even the WHO has lauded the efforts of the Chinese government and advised the world to learn from China in fighting the disease. Since the outbreak of COVID-19, to curb the spread of the epidemic, the Chinese government has implemented unprecedented prevention interventions at the nationwide level. Currently, the outbreak in Wuhan is changing in a positive direction and has been effectively controlled. However, it is not clear what these measures were and how these measures changed to curb the outbreak of COVID-19 quickly. This study explored the characteristics and identified that China's control strategies have changed the epidemiological curve of rapidly rising new confirmed cases of...","Cases of a novel coronavirus were first reported in Wuhan, Hubei province, China, in December 2019 and have since spread across the world. Epidemiological studies have indicated human-to-human transmission in China and elsewhere. To aid the analysis and tracking of the COVID-19 epidemic we collected and curated individual-level data from national, provincial, and municipal health reports, as well as additional information from online reports. All data are geo-coded and, where available, include symptoms, key dates (date of onset, admission, and confirmation), and travel history. The generation of detailed, real-time, and robust data for emerging disease outbreaks is important and can help to generate robust evidence that will support and inform public health decision making.","Purpose: The COVID-19 death-rate in Italy continues to climb, surpassing that in every other country. We implement one of the first nationally representative surveys about this unprecedented public health crisis and use it to evaluate the Italian government's public health efforts and citizen responses. Findings: (1) Public health messaging is being heard. At this point, the Italian people understand how to keep themselves and others safe from the SARS-Cov-2 virus. This is true for all population groups we studied, with the partial exception of slightly lower compliance among young adults. Remarkably, even those who do not trust the government, and those who think the government has been untruthful about the crisis mostly believe the public health message and claim to be acting in accordance. (2) The quarantine is beginning to have serious negative effects on the population's mental health. Policy Recommendations: Public health messaging is being heard and understood. The focus now sho...","Three leading infectious disease experts in China were invited to share their bedside observations in the management of COVID-19 patients. Professor Taisheng Li was sent to Wuhan to provide frontline medical care. He depicts the clinical course of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Furthermore, he observes the significant abnormality of coagulation function and proposes that the early intravenous immunoglobulin and low molecular weight heparin anticoagulation therapy are very important. Professor Hongzhou Lu, a leader in China to try various anti-viral drugs, expresses concern on the quality of the ongoing clinical trials as most trials are small in scale and repetitive in nature, and emphasizes the importance of the quick publication of clinical trial results. Regarding the traditional Chinese medicine, Professor Lu suggests to develop a creative evaluation system because of the complicated chemical compositions. Professor Wenhong Zhang is responsible for Shanghai's overall clinical management of ...","With relatively short latency and rapid propagation, viral diseases could be transmitted through the air to medical personnel or the public during the incubation period. To reduce the possibilities of spread, this research creates an infection probability model based on the settling velocity and concentration distribution of infectious droplets. Then, radio frequency identification (RFID) technology is employed to track the travel history (time, date and place) of the infected patients. A tree structure algorithm and an infection probability model are applied to trace the transmission routes, discover the correlations between carriers and suspected cases, and finally calculate the infection probability on the basis of time interval. In case of an epidemic outbreak or once an infected case is confirmed, the disease tracking and control system could be initiated by accessing RFID logs to plot the carriers\u2019 time of onset and to trace possible routes of transmission via tree diagrams. The ...","Summary This is an informal review of some of the trends in the infection prevention and control literature since the last Healthcare Infection Society (HIS) conference in late 2012. Google Trends was used to investigate how the volume of interest in various infection control topics had changed over time. Ebola trumped all the others in Google searches, reflecting a surge of publications in the literature. Aside from Ebola, other trends in the infection prevention and control literature covered in this article include Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) coronavirus, universal versus targeted interventions, faecal microbiota transplantation, whole genome sequencing, carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae, and some aspects of environmental science. The review ends with an attempt to predict some of the trends in the infection prevention and control literature between now and the next HIS conference in 2016.","ABSTRACT Acute respiratory tract infections (ARTIs) are a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in children worldwide, but the aetiology of many ARTIs is still unknown. In 2001, researchers in The Netherlands reported the discovery of a previously unidentified pathogen called human metapneumovirus (hMPV). Since its initial description, hMPV has been associated with ARTI in Europe (Italy, France, Spain, the UK, Germany, Denmark, Finland and Norway), America (the USA, Canada, Argentina and Brazil), Asia (India, Japan, China and Singapore), Australia and South Africa in individuals of all ages. The incidence of infection varies from 1.5% to 25%, indicating that hMPV is a ubiquitous virus with a worldwide distribution. hMPV seems to play an important role as a cause of paediatric upper and lower respiratory tract infection, with similar, but not identical, epidemiological and clinical features to those of respiratory syncytial virus and influenza virus. Moreover, the socio-economic impa...","First, although COVID-19 is spread by the airborne route, air disinfection of cities and communities is not known to be effective for disease control and needs to be stopped. The widespread practice of spraying disinfectant and alcohol in the sky, on roads, vehicles, and personnel has no value; moreover, large quantities of alcohol and disinfectant are potentially harmful to humans and should be avoided.3 , 4 Second, in the use of personal protective equipment, we should try to distinguish different risk factors, adopt different epidemic prevention measures, and reduce the waste of personal protective equipment, as these resources are already in short supply. Although surgical masks are in widespread use by the general population, there is no evidence that these masks prevent the acquisition of COVID-19, although they might slightly reduce the spread from an infected patient. High-filtration masks such as N95 masks and protective clothing (goggles and gowns) should be used in hospitals...","Abstract Objective MERS-CoV infection is uncommonly identified among patients visiting healthcare facilities &amp; we were vigilant in screening all patients entering our hospital to prevent cross infection among patients, visitors &amp; healthcare providers and aiming to prevent potential outbreaks with MERS-CoV infection. In spite of our efforts on practicing Failure Mode Effect Analysis for MERS-CoV infection management we ended up having an outbreak with MERS-CoV. Based on our experience, we actively implemented policies, procedures &amp; practices on early identification &amp; appropriate isolation practices along with supplemental infection prevention &amp; control measures for preventing future outbreaks at our healthcare facility. Methods Retrospectively we analyzed our failure in preventing the outbreak of MERS-CoV infection among our hospitalized patients by identifying the outbreak &amp; actively intervening as a team to control the outbreak with the support of Hospital Higher management, Administr...","Summary Background Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) is a new human disease caused by a novel coronavirus (CoV). Clinical data on MERS-CoV infections are scarce. We report epidemiological, demographic, clinical, and laboratory characteristics of 47 cases of MERS-CoV infections, identify knowledge gaps, and define research priorities. Methods We abstracted and analysed epidemiological, demographic, clinical, and laboratory data from confirmed cases of sporadic, household, community, and health-care-associated MERS-CoV infections reported from Saudi Arabia between Sept 1, 2012, and June 15, 2013. Cases were confirmed as having MERS-CoV by real-time RT-PCR. Findings 47 individuals (46 adults, one child) with laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV disease were identified; 36 (77%) were male (male:female ratio 3\u00b73:1). 28 patients died, a 60% case-fatality rate. The case-fatality rate rose with increasing age. Only two of the 47 cases were previously healthy; most patients (45 [96%]) had underl...","We integrate the human movement and healthcare resource data to identify cities with high vulnerability towards the 2019-nCoV epidemic with respect to available health resources. The results inform public health responses in multiple ways.","Abstract During the first part of 2003, the world experienced the first epidemic of the 21st century with the emergence of a new and readily transmissible disease. The disease, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), spread quickly and caused numerous deaths, as well as public panic. This article provides a brief review of the initial history of the epidemiology, as well as of the clinical definition, occurrence in the pediatric population, etiology, prevention, drug studies, and considerations for the future.","Abstract Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is caused by SARS-COV2 and represents the causative agent of a potentially fatal disease that is of great global public health concern. Based on the large number of infected people that were exposed to the wet animal market in Wuhan City, China, it is suggested that this is likely the zoonotic origin of COVID-19. Person-to-person transmission of COVID-19 infection led to the isolation of patients that were subsequently administered a variety of treatments. Extensive measures to reduce person-to-person transmission of COVID-19 have been implemented to control the current outbreak. Special attention and efforts to protect or reduce transmission should be applied in susceptible populations including children, health care providers, and elderly people. In this review, we highlights the symptoms, epidemiology, transmission, pathogenesis, phylogenetic analysis and future directions to control the spread of this fatal disease.","Background/introduction COVID\u221219, a novel coronavirus outbreak starting in China, is now a rapidly developing public health emergency of international concern. The clinical spectrum of COVID\u221219 disease is varied, and identifying factors associated with severe disease has been described as an urgent research priority. It has been noted that elderly patients with pre-existing comorbidities are more vulnerable to more severe disease. However, the specific symptoms and comorbidities that most strongly predict disease severity are unclear. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to identify the symptoms and comorbidities predictive of COVID\u221219 severity. Method This study was prospectively registered on PROSPERO. A literature search was performed in three databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE and Global Health) for studies indexed up to 5th March 2020. Two reviewers independently screened the literature and both also completed data extraction. Quality appraisal of studies was performed using...","Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is characterized by substantial acute pulmonary inflammation with a high mortality rate. Despite the identification of SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) as the etiologic agent of SARS, a thorough understanding of the underlying disease pathogenesis has been hampered by the lack of a suitable animal model that recapitulates the human disease. Intranasal (i.n.) infection of A/J mice with the CoV mouse hepatitis virus strain 1 (MHV-1) induces an acute respiratory disease with a high lethality rate that shares several pathological similarities with SARS-CoV infection in humans. In this study, we examined virus replication and the character of pulmonary inflammation induced by MHV-1 infection in susceptible (A/J, C3H/HeJ, and BALB/c) and resistant (C57BL/6) strains of mice. Virus replication and distribution did not correlate with the relative susceptibilities of A/J, BALB/c, C3H/HeJ, and C57BL/6 mice. In order to further define the role of the host geneti...","The outbreak of novel coronavirus (COVID-19) has the potential for global spread, infecting large numbers in all countries. In this case, estimating the country-specific basic reproductive ratio is a vital first step in public-health planning. The basic reproductive ratio (R0) is determined by both the nature of pathogen and the network of contacts through which the disease can spread - with this network determined by socio-demographics including age-structure and household composition. Here we focus on the age-structured transmission within the population, using data from China to inform age-dependent susceptibility and synthetic age-mixing matrices to inform the contact network. This allows us to determine the country-specific basic reproductive ratio as a multiplicative scaling of the value from China. We predict that R0 will be highest across Eastern Europe and Japan, and lowest across Africa, Central America and South-Western Asia. This pattern is largely driven by the ratio of ch...","Abstract Objective To provide a general description of the roles and contributions of three pharmacists from the Regulatory Affairs program (RA) at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) who are involved in emergency preparedness and response activities, including the 2009 pandemic influenza A (H1N1) public health emergency. Setting Atlanta, GA. Practice description RA consists of a staff of nine members, three of whom are pharmacists. The mission of RA is to support CDC's preparedness and emergency response activities and to ensure regulatory compliance for critical medical countermeasures against potential threats from natural, chemical, biological, radiological, or nuclear events. Conclusion RA was well involved in the response to the H1N1 outbreak through numerous activities, such as submitting multiple Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) requests to the Food and Drug Administration, including those for medical countermeasures to be deployed from the Strategic National ...","Summary Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a respiratory tract infection caused by a newly emergent coronavirus, that was first recognized in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. Currently, the World Health Organization (WHO) has defined the infection as a global pandemic and there is a health and social emergency for the management of this new infection. While most people with COVID-19 develop only mild or uncomplicated illness, approximately 14% develop severe disease that requires hospitalization and oxygen support, and 5% require admission to an intensive care unit (1). In severe cases, COVID-19 can be complicated by the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), sepsis and septic shock, and multiorgan failure. This consensus document has been prepared on evidence-informed guidelines developed by a multidisciplinary panel of health care providers from four spanish scientific societies (Spanish Society of Intensive Care Medicine [SEMICYUC], Spanish Society of Pulmonologists [SEPAR],...","Abstract The global spread of COVID-19 is placing unprecedented demands on healthcare services. In this time of crisis, innovative and adaptive methods of practising will be required across all health professions. In order to maximise the use of current available resources, it is vital that existing services are comprehensively reviewed and full use is made of any unrealised potential among healthcare providers. Community pharmacy is one of a number of health professions that has a key role to play in responding to the current pandemic. As the scope of community pharmacy practice varies considerably across countries, it is important to examine ways in which the profession can assist with the public health response to COVID-19 and maintaining the continuity of healthcare services. This article seeks to highlight roles and activities that community pharmacists can undertake to help in relieving pressure on other areas of the health service, such as general practice. This information coul...","Since the emergence of the first cases in Wuhan, China, the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection has been quickly spreading out to other provinces and neighboring countries. Estimation of the basic reproduction number by means of mathematical modeling can be helpful for determining the potential and severity of an outbreak and providing critical information for identifying the type of disease interventions and intensity. A deterministic compartmental model was devised based on the clinical progression of the disease, epidemiological status of the individuals, and intervention measures. The estimations based on likelihood and model analysis show that the control reproduction number may be as high as 6.47 (95% CI 5.71\u20137.23). Sensitivity analyses show that interventions, such as intensive contact tracing followed by quarantine and isolation, can effectively reduce the control reproduction number and transmission risk, with the effect of travel restriction adopted by Wuhan on 2019-nCoV ...","ABSTRACT THE CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL and Prevention has published updated guidelines for isolation precautions that outline how health care workers can prevent the transmission of infectious agents to their patients and to themselves. THE GUIDELINES RE-EMPHASIZE standard precautions, which guide clinicians in the use of appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE), depending on the expected type of exposure. Respiratory hygiene/cough etiquette is incorporated into infection control practices as a new component of standard precautions. THE ARTICLE PROVIDES information on the new guidelines as well as information on newly emerging patho gens and methods to prevent disease transmission in health care settings.","Background: Although a number of antiviral agents have been evaluated for coronaviruses there are no approved drugs available. To provide an overview of the landscape of therapeutic research for COVID-19, we conducted a review of registered clinical trials. Methods: A review of currently registered clinical trials was performed on registries, including the Chinese (chictr.org.cn) and US (clinicaltrials.gov) databases to identify relevant studies up to March, 7th 2020. The search was conducted using the search terms \u201c2019-nCoV\u201d, \u201cCOVID-19\u201d, \u201cSARS-CoV-2\u201d, \u201cHcov-19\u201d, \u201cnew coronavirus\u201d, \u201cnovel coronavirus\u201d. We included interventional clinical trials focusing on patients with COVID-19 and assessing antiviral drugs or agents. Findings: Out of the 353 studies identified, 115 clinical trials were selected for data extraction. Phase IV trials were the most commonly reported study type (n=27, 23%). However, 62 trials (54%) did not describe the phase of the study. Eighty percent (n=92) of the tri...","The novel coronavirus infection (COVID-19 or Coronavirus disease 2019) that emerged from Wuhan, Hubei province of China has spread to many countries worldwide. Efforts have been made to develop vaccines against human coronavirus (CoV) infections such as MERS and SARS in the past decades. However, to date, no licensed antiviral treatment or vaccine exists for MERS and SARS. Most of the efforts for developing CoV vaccines and drugs target the spike glycoprotein or S protein, the major inducer of neutralizing antibodies. Although a few candidates have shown efficacy in in vitro studies, not many have progressed to randomized animal or human trials, hence may have limited use to counter COVID-19 infection. This article highlights ongoing advances in designing vaccines and therapeutics to counter COVID-19 while also focusing on such experiences and advances as made with earlier SARS- and MERS-CoVs, which together could enable efforts to halt this emerging virus infection.","Currently, a novel coronavirus 2019-nCoV causes an outbreak of viral pneumonia in Wuhan, China. Little is known about its epidemiological characteristics. Using the travel history and symptom onset of 88 confirmed cases that were detected outside Wuhan, we estimate the mean incubation period to be 6.4 (5.6 - 7.7, 95% CI) days, ranging from 2.1 to 11.1 days (2.5th to 97.5th percentile). These values help to inform case definitions for 2019-nCoV and appropriate durations for quarantine.","BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has been identified as the cause of an outbreak of respiratory illness in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China beginning in December 2019. As of 31 January 2020, this epidemic had spread to 19 countries with 11 791 confirmed cases, including 213 deaths. The World Health Organization has declared it a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. METHODS: A scoping review was conducted following the methodological framework suggested by Arksey and O\u2019Malley. In this scoping review, 65 research articles published before 31 January 2020 were analyzed and discussed to better understand the epidemiology, causes, clinical diagnosis, prevention and control of this virus. The research domains, dates of publication, journal language, authors\u2019 affiliations, and methodological characteristics were included in the analysis. All the findings and statements in this review regarding the outbreak are based on published information as listed in the references. ...","This article reviews the current epidemiology and clinical presentation of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection and describes the preparedness plan of several countries. The MERS-CoV was first reported in 2012 and has since infected more than 1600 patients in 26 countries, mostly in Saudi Arabia and the Middle East. The epidemiology of the infection is compatible with multiple introductions of the virus into humans from an animal reservoir, probably dromedary camels. The clinical presentation ranges from no symptoms to severe pneumonitis and respiratory failure. Most confirmed cases so far were part of MERS-CoV clusters in hospital settings, affecting mainly middle-aged men and patients with a chronic disease or immuno-suppressed status. There is no vaccine or anti-viral medication available. Viral epidemics can occur anywhere in today\u2019s \u201cglobal village\u201d. MERS-CoV is a relatively new virus, and this work is intended to add to the still-sparse data on its ep...","BACKGROUND: The continuing circulation of MERS in the Middle East makes the international dissemination of the disease a permanent threat. To inform risk assessment, we investigated the spatiotemporal pattern of MERS global dissemination and looked for factors explaining the heterogeneity observed in transmission events following importation. METHODS: We reviewed imported MERS cases worldwide up to July 2015. We modelled importations in time based on air travel combined with incidence in Middle East. We used the detailed history of MERS case management after importation (time to hospitalization and isolation, number of hospitals visited,\u2026) in logistic regression to identify risk factors for secondary transmission. We assessed changes in time to hospitalization and isolation in relation to collective and public health attention to the epidemic, measured by three indicators (Google Trends, ProMED-mail, Disease Outbreak News). RESULTS: Modelled importation events were found to reproduce b...","Early recognition and rapid initiation of infection control precautions are currently the most important strategies for controlling severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). No rapid diagnostic tests currently exist that can rule out SARS among patients with febrile respiratory illnesses. Clinical features alone cannot with certainty distinguish SARS from other respiratory illnesses rapidly enough to inform early management decisions. A balanced approach to screening that allows early recognition of SARS without unnecessary isolation of patients with other respiratory illnesses will require clinicians not only to look for suggestive clinical features but also to routinely seek epidemiologic clues suggestive of SARS coronavirus exposure. Key epidemiologic risk factors include 1) exposure to settings where SARS activity is suspected or documented, or 2) in the absence of such exposure, epidemiologic linkage to other persons with pneumonia (i.e., pneumonia clusters), or 3) exposure to hea...","A novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is causing an outbreak of viral pneumonia that started in Wuhan, China. Using the travel history and symptom onset of 88 confirmed cases that were detected outside Wuhan in the early outbreak phase, we estimate the mean incubation period to be 6.4 days (95% credible interval: 5.6\u20137.7), ranging from 2.1 to 11.1 days (2.5th to 97.5th percentile). These values should help inform 2019-nCoV case definitions and appropriate quarantine durations.","Abstract Recently, a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), officially known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), emerged in China. Despite drastic containment measures, the spread of this virus is ongoing. SARS-CoV-2 is the aetiological agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) characterised by pulmonary infection in humans. The efforts of international health authorities have since focused on rapid diagnosis and isolation of patients as well as the search for therapies able to counter the most severe effects of the disease. In the absence of a known efficient therapy and because of the situation of a public-health emergency, it made sense to investigate the possible effect of chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine against SARS-CoV-2 since this molecule was previously described as a potent inhibitor of most coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-1. Preliminary trials of chloroquine repurposing in the treatment of COVID-19 in China have been encouraging, leading to several ne...","Severe acute respiratory syndrome Covid-19 (SARS-CoV-2) has been declared a worldwide emergency and a pandemic disease by the World Health Organisation (WHO). It started in China in December 2019, and it is currently rapidly spreading throughout Italy, which is now the most affected country after China. There is great attention for the diffusion and evolution of the CoVid-19 infection which started from the north (particularly in the Lombardia region) and it is now rapidly affecting other Italian regions. We investigate on the impact of patients hospitalisation in Intensive Care Units (ICUs) at a regional and subregional granularity. We propose a model derived from well-known models in epidemic to estimate the needed number of places in intensive care units. The model will help decision-makers to plan resources in the short and medium-term in order to guarantee appropriate treatments to all patients needing it. We analyse Italian data at regional level up to March 15th aiming to: (i) s...","The ongoing COVID-19 outbreak has expanded rapidly throughout China. Major behavioral, clinical, and state interventions are underway currently to mitigate the epidemic and prevent the persistence of the virus in human populations in China and worldwide. It remains unclear how these unprecedented interventions, including travel restrictions, have affected COVID-19 spread in China. We use real-time mobility data from Wuhan and detailed case data including travel history to elucidate the role of case importation on transmission in cities across China and ascertain the impact of control measures. Early on, the spatial distribution of COVID-19 cases in China was well explained by human mobility data. Following the implementation of control measures, this correlation dropped and growth rates became negative in most locations, although shifts in the demographics of reported cases are still indicative of local chains of transmission outside Wuhan. This study shows that the drastic control mea...","Being aware and implementing the latest and best scientific evidence in infection control and health care epidemiology is critical to enhancing patient outcomes. In this review, the latest published scientific data in health care epidemiology and patient safety were reviewed for the period May 2003-May 2004. Medline reviews and reviews of infection control and infectious diseases journals were used for this period. The latest guidelines and publications on antimicrobial resistance, nursing or infection control professional staffing, West Nile virus, and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) are included. Awareness of these and other important infection control publications is essential if the latest measures are to be implemented to prevent and control health care-associated infections.","Social mixing patterns are crucial in driving transmission of infectious diseases and informing public health interventions to contain their spread. Age-specific social mixing is often inferred from surveys of self-recorded contacts which by design often have a very limited number of participants. In addition, such surveys are rare, so public health interventions are often evaluated by considering only one such study. Here we report detailed population contact patterns for United Kingdom based self-reported contact data from over 36,000 volunteers that participated in the massive citizen science project BBC Pandemic. The amount of data collected allows us generate fine-scale age-specific population contact matrices by context (home, work, school, other) and type (conversational or physical) of contact that took place. These matrices are highly relevant for informing prevention and control of new outbreaks, and evaluating strategies that reduce the amount of mixing in the population (su...","Summary The causative agent of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), which affected over 8000 individuals worldwide and was responsible for over 700 deaths in the 2002\u20132003 outbreak, is a coronavirus that was unknown before the outbreak. Although many different treatments were used during the outbreak, none were implemented in a controlled fashion. Thus, the optimal treatment for SARS is unknown. Since the outbreak, much work has been done testing new agents against SARS using in-vitro methods and animal models. In addition, global research efforts have focused on the development of vaccines against SARS. Efforts should be made to evaluate the most promising treatments and vaccines in controlled clinical trials, should another SARS outbreak occur.","Disease outbreaks of international public health importance continue to occur regularly; detecting and tracking significant new public health threats in countries that cannot or might not report such events to the global health community is a challenge. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s (CDC) Global Disease Detection (GDD) Operations Center, established in early 2007, monitors infectious and non-infectious public health events to identify new or unexplained global public health threats and better position CDC to respond, if public health assistance is requested or required. At any one time, the GDD Operations Center actively monitors approximately 30\u201340 such public health threats; here we provide our perspective on five of the top global infectious disease threats that we were watching in 2012: (1) avian influenza A (H5N1), (2) cholera, (3) wild poliovirus, (4) enterovirus-71, and (5) extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis."],"title":["Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus: Implications for health care facilities","Timely mental health care for the 2019 novel coronavirus outbreak is urgently needed","What Have We Learned About Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus Emergence in Humans?
