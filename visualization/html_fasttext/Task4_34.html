We have previously reported that antibodies elicited by a SARS-CoV vaccine candidate based on recombinant, full-length SARS-CoV Spike-protein trimers, trigger infection of immune cell lines. These observations prompted us to investigate the molecular mechanisms and responses to antibody-mediated infection in human macrophages. METHODS: We have used primary human immune cells to evaluate their susceptibility to infection by SARS-CoV in the presence of anti-Spike antibodies. Fluorescence microscopy and real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) were utilized to assess occurrence and consequences of infection. To gain insight into the underlying molecular mechanism, we performed mutational analysis with a series of truncated and chime...","Abstract Background In 2003, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) resulted in hundreds of infections and deaths globally. We aim to assess immunogenicity and protective efficacy of purified inactivated Vero-cell SARS vaccine in monkeys. Methods The cultures of SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) BJ-01 strain infected Vero cells were inactivated with \u03b2-propiolactone. Sequential procedures, including ultrafiltration, gel filtration and ion exchange chromatography, were performed to obtain purified inactivated SARS vaccine. The purified SARS vaccine was analyzed with electron microscope, HPLC and Western blotting. We immunized three groups of cynomolgus macaques fascicularis with adjuvant-containing purified vaccine, purified vaccine and unpurified vaccine, respectively, and a fourth group served as a control. Antibody titers were measured by plaque reduction neutralization test. The vaccinated monkeys were challenged with SARS-CoV BJ-01 strain to observe protective efficacy. Additionally, th...","Abstract One of the most perplexing questions regarding the current COVID-19 coronavirus epidemic is the discrepancy between the severity of cases observed in the Hubei province of China and those occurring elsewhere in the world. One possible answer is antibody dependent enhancement (ADE) of SARS-CoV-2 due to prior exposure to other coronaviruses. ADE modulates the immune response and can elicit sustained inflammation, lymphopenia, and/or cytokine storm, one or all of which have been documented in severe cases and deaths. ADE also requires prior exposure to similar antigenic epitopes, presumably circulating in local viruses, making it a possible explanation for the observed geographic limitation of severe cases and deaths.","Viral infections are common causes of respiratory tract disease in the outpatient setting but much less common in the intensive care unit. However, a finite number of viral agents cause respiratory tract disease in the intensive care unit. Some viruses, such as influenza, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), cytomegalovirus (CMV), and varicella-zoster virus (VZV), are relatively common. Others, such as adenovirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-coronavirus, Hantavirus, and the viral hemorrhagic fevers (VHFs), are rare but have an immense public health impact. Recognizing these viral etiologies becomes paramount in treatment, infection control, and public health measures. Therefore, a basic understanding of the pathogenesis of viral entry, replication, and host response is important for clinical diagnosis and initiating therapeutic options. This review discusses the basic pathophysiology leading to clinical presentations in a few common and rare, but important, viruses found in ...","Respiratory virus infections in hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) recipients are a major cause of morbidity and mortality. While respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), human metapneumonvirus, parainfluenzaviruses, and influenza viruses are well known for their potential to cause fatal pneumonia, information is emerging only recently on the significance of the newly discovered viruses such as human coronaviruses NL63 and HKU1, and human bocavirus. Lymphopenia seems to be the most recent risk factors for progression to lower respiratory tract disease. Airflow obstruction is another complication of respiratory virus infections after HCT, and data to date indicate this complication may occur following parainfluenza virus and RSV infection. Infection control procedures are key for prevention. Unfortunately, there are no randomized treatment studies, which make the interpretation of the literature on interventions difficult. This article reviews the spectrum of pathogens, epidemiology, risk fa...","AbstractThe World Health Organization has recently declared the ongoing outbreak of COVID-19, which is caused by a novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, as pandemic. There is currently a lack of knowledge in the antibody response elicited from SARS-CoV-2 infection. One major immunological question is concerning the antigenic differences between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV. We address this question by using plasma from patients infected by SARS-CoV-2 or SARS-CoV, and plasma obtained from infected or immunized mice. Our results show that while cross-reactivity in antibody binding to the spike protein is common, cross-neutralization of the live viruses is rare, indicating the presence of non-neutralizing antibody response to conserved epitopes in the spike. Whether these non-neutralizing antibody responses will lead to antibody-dependent disease enhancement needs to be addressed in the future. Overall, this study not only addresses a fundamental question regarding the antigenicity differences between...","Abstract We summarize findings of SARS-CoV infections in several animal models each of which support viral replication in lungs accompanied by histopathological changes and/or clinical signs of illness to varying degrees. New findings are reported on SARS-CoV replication and associated pathology in two additional strains (C57BL/6 and 129S6) of aged mice. We also provide new comparative data on viral replication and associated pathology following infection of golden Syrian hamsters with various SARS-CoV strains and report the levels of neutralizing antibody titers following these infections and the cross-protective efficacy of infection with these strains in protecting against heterologous challenge. Finally, we summarize findings of a variety of vaccine approaches and discuss the available in vitro and in vivo data addressing the potential for disease enhancement following re-infection in animals previously vaccinated against or infected with SARS-CoV.","Abstract Outside the Hubei province, China, the mild form of infection and the progressive recover of the COVID-19 patients suggest the intervention of \u201cunconventional\u201d biological mechanisms worthy of attention. Based on the high-homology between the Spike protein epitopes of taxonomically-related coronaviruses, we hypothesized that past contact with infected dogs shield humans against the circulating SARS-CoV-2. Elseways, the recurrent virus exposure over a short time-lapse might result in the Antibody Dependent Enhancement, triggering the violent immune reaction responsible for the severe clinical outcomes observed in the Hubei province. Nevertheless, further experimental studies are desired for a confidential evaluation of the postulated hypotheses.","","Tylophorine-based compounds exert broad spectral, potent inhibition of coronaviruses. NF-\u03baB activation is a common pro-inflammatory response of host cells to viral infection. The aims of this study were to (i) find an effective combination treatment for coronaviral infections through targeting of the virus per se and cellular NF-\u03baB activity; and (ii) to study the underling mechanisms. We found that tylophorine-based compounds target the TGEV viral RNA and effectively inhibit TGEV replication. NF-\u03baB inhibition also leads to anti-TGEV replication. NF-\u03baB activation induced by TGEV infection was found to be associated with two convergent pathways, IKK-2_I\u03baB\u03b1/p65 and JAK2 mediated p65 phosphorylation, in swine testicular cells. JAK2 inhibition either by CYT387 (a JAK family inhibitor) or by silencing JAK2-expression revealed a dominant JAK2 mediated p65 phosphorylation pathway for NF-\u03baB activation and resulted in NF-\u03baB inhibition, which overrode the I\u03baB\u03b1 regulation via the IKK-2. Finally, t...","BACKGROUND: Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a febrile respiratory illness. The disease has been etiologically linked to a novel coronavirus that has been named the SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV), whose genome was recently sequenced. Since it is a member of the Coronaviridae, its spike protein (S2) is believed to play a central role in viral entry by facilitating fusion between the viral and host cell membranes. The protein responsible for viral-induced membrane fusion of HIV-1 (gp41) differs in length, and has no sequence homology with S2. RESULTS: Sequence analysis reveals that the two viral proteins share the sequence motifs that construct their active conformation. These include (1) an N-terminal leucine/isoleucine zipper-like sequence, and (2) a C-terminal heptad repeat located upstream of (3) an aromatic residue-rich region juxtaposed to the (4) transmembrane segment. CONCLUSIONS: This study points to a similar mode of action for the two viral proteins, suggest...","Abstract This chapter reviews the main viral pathogens of the respiratory tract, the immune responses they induce, currently available vaccines, and vaccines that are in development to control them. The main viruses responsible for acute respiratory infection in people include respiratory syncytial, influenza, human parainfluenza, human metapneumo-, human rhino-, corona-, and adenoviruses. Licensed vaccines are available only for influenza virus, with vaccines against the other pathogens either in clinical trials or in preclinical stages of development. The majority of studies evaluating respiratory virus vaccines measure serum antibody responses, because, although both cellular and humoral responses contribute to the clearance of a primary infection, neutralizing antibodies are known to protect against secondary infection. Humoral responses can be readily detected after vaccination with inactivated or subunit vaccines; however, fewer individuals seroconvert after vaccination with live...","Summary Pneumomediastinum is an uncommon complication after an asthma attack. The essential clinical sign is the presence of subcutaneous emphysema. In the great majority of cases, the treatment of pneumomediastinum corresponds to that of asthma, with resorption over several days. The situation is very different when the development of pneumomediastinum and subcutaneous emphysema is secondary to an aspiration syndrome.","School closures have been enacted as a measure of mitigation during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic due to their ability to reduce transmission. It has been shown that school closures could cause absenteeism amongst healthcare workers with dependent children, but there is a need for detailed high-resolution analysis of the relationship between school closures and healthcare worker absenteeism to inform local community preparedness. We provide national- and county-level simulations of school closures and absenteeism across the United States. At the national level, we estimate the projected absenteeism rate to range from 7.5% to 8.6%, and the effectiveness of school closures to range from 172 to 218 fewer hospital beds used per 100,000 people at peak demand. At the county-level, we find substantial variations of projected absenteeism and school closure effects, ranging from 2.0% to 18.6% absenteeism and 88 to 280 fewer hospital beds used per 100,000 people at peak demand. We also find sign...","After the outbreak of the middle east respiratory syndrome (MERS) worldwide in 2012. Currently, a novel human coronavirus has caused a major disease outbreak, and named corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The emergency of MRES-COV and COVID-19 has caused global panic and threatened health security. Unfortunately, the similarities and differences between the two coronavirus diseases remain to be unknown. The aim of this study, therefore, is to perform a systematic review to compare epidemiological, clinical and laboratory features of COVID-19 and MERS-COV population. We searched PubMed, EMBASE and Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials database to identify potential studies reported COVID-19 or MERS-COV. Epidemiological, clinical and laboratory outcomes, the admission rate of intensive cure unit (ICU), discharge rate and fatality rate were evaluated using GraphPad Prism software. Thirty-two studies involving 3770 patients (COVID-19 = 1062, MERS-COV = 2708) were included in this study....","ABSTRACT BACKGROUND The epidemiological and clinical characteristics of heart transplant (HTx) recipients during the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic remains unclear. We studied the characteristics of HTx recipients during Dec 20, 2019 and Feb 25, 2020 in an effort to understand their risk and outcomes. METHODS All accessible HTx recipients were included in this single-center, retrospective study. We collected information on the recipients using a web-based questionnaire as well as the hospital database. RESULTS We followed 87 HTx recipients (72.4% were men and average age was 51 years). 79 recipients resided in Hubei, and 57 recipients had a Wuhan related history of travel or contact. The majority took precautionary measures while in contact with suspicious crowds. 96.6% of the families and communities undertook prevention and quarantine procedures. 4 upper airway infection were reported, and 3 of them tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 (the 4th recovered and was not tested). All cases were mild and s...","SARS-CoV-2, a member of the coronavirus family, is responsible for the current COVID-19 pandemic. Based on our analysis of hepatitis C virus and coronavirus replication, and the molecular structures and activities of viral inhibitors, we previously demonstrated that three nucleotide analogues inhibit the SARS-CoV RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). Here, using polymerase extension experiments, we have demonstrated that the active triphosphate form of Sofosbuvir (a key component of the FDA approved hepatitis C drug EPCLUSA), is incorporated by SARS-CoV-2 RdRp, and blocks further incorporation. Using the same molecular insight, we selected the active triphosphate forms of three other anti-viral agents, Alovudine, AZT (an FDA approved HIV/AIDS drug) and Tenofovir alafenamide (TAF, an FDA approved drug for HIV and hepatitis B) for evaluation as inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 RdRp. We demonstrated the ability of these three viral polymerase inhibitors, 3\u2032-fluoro-3\u2032-deoxythymidine triphosphate, 3...","Abstract Background: Acute otitis media (AOM) is the most common complication of a viral upper respiratory infection (URI) in children. The virus-induced host inflammatory response in the nasopharynx plays a key role in the pathogenesis of AOM. Suppression of this inflammatory process might prevent the development of AOM as a complication. Objective: We sought to assess the effect of intranasally administered fluticasone propionate on prevention of AOM during a viral respiratory infection. Methods: A total of 210 children (mean age, 2.1 years; range, 0.7-3.9 years) with normal middle ear status and URI of 48 hours\u2019 duration or less were randomly allocated to receive either fluticasone (100 \u03bcg twice daily) or placebo for 7 days. The specific viral cause of the infection was determined from nasopharyngeal aspirates obtained at the first visit. The children were re-examined at the end of the 7-day medication period. Results: In the fluticasone group AOM developed in 40 (38.1%) of 105 chil...","Abstract Background: Acute community-acquired sinusitis is considered a bacterial complication of the common cold. Radiologic abnormalities in sinuses occur, however, in most patients with upper respiratory virus infections. Objective: Assessment of the occurrence, clinical profile, laboratory findings, and outcome of radiologically confirmed sinusitis was carried out as part of a common cold study in young adults. Methods: Clinical examinations and radiography of the paranasal sinuses were carried out on days 1, 7, and 21 in 197 patients with the common cold. The symptoms were recorded on diary cards on days 1 to 20. Ten viruses and 5 bacteria were studied as etiologic agents of common cold as reported earlier. Serum C reactive protein concentrations, erythrocyte sedimentation rates, and total white blood cell counts with differentials were determined in 40 randomized subjects on day 7. The effect of 6 days of intranasal fluticasone propionate treatment of the common cold in the preve...","Abstract Recently, a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), officially known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), emerged in China. Despite drastic containment measures, the spread of this virus is ongoing. SARS-CoV-2 is the aetiological agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) characterised by pulmonary infection in humans. The efforts of international health authorities have since focused on rapid diagnosis and isolation of patients as well as the search for therapies able to counter the most severe effects of the disease. In the absence of a known efficient therapy and because of the situation of a public-health emergency, it made sense to investigate the possible effect of chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine against SARS-CoV-2 since this molecule was previously described as a potent inhibitor of most coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-1. Preliminary trials of chloroquine repurposing in the treatment of COVID-19 in China have been encouraging, leading to several ne...","The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) is the etiological agent for the infectious disease, SARS, which first emerged 10 years ago. SARS-CoV is a zoonotic virus that has crossed the species barriers to infect humans. Bats, which harbour a diverse pool of SARS-like CoVs (SL-CoVs), are believed to be the natural reservoir. The SARS-CoV surface Spike (S) protein is a major antigenic determinant in eliciting neutralizing antibody production during SARS-CoV infection. In our previous work, we showed that a panel of murine monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that target the S2 subunit of the S protein are capable of neutralizing SARS-CoV infection in vitro (Lip KM et al, J Virol. 2006 Jan; 80(2): 941\u201350). In this study, we report our findings on the characterization of one of these mAbs, known as 1A9, which binds to the S protein at a novel epitope within the S2 subunit at amino acids 1111\u20131130. MAb 1A9 is a broadly neutralizing mAb that prevents viral entry mediated by the S ...","Widespread, non-stop, and often sensational coverage of the coronavirus (COVID-19) has caught many governments flat-footed in efforts to protect the health and safety of their citizens. In response to the current global health event, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic. Mass gatherings present a historic challenge in protecting the health and safety of attendees. The majority of the prominent mass gatherings are religious in nature. Global sporting events, such as the Olympics and the World Cup, pose unique health risks to attendees and host nations. Deferment or cancellation of such mass gatherings may exert an extraordinary economic loss to the host nation. Universal adoption of best practices for infection control is the surest way for governments to prepare for mass gatherings. In these uncertain times, it is up to intergovernmental organizations to be the voice of reason.","The rapid emergence of clinical trials on COVID-19 stimulated a wave of discussion in scientific community. We reviewed the characteristics of interventional trials from Chinese Clinical Trial Registration (ChiCTR) and ClinicalTrials.gov. A total of 171 COVID-19-related interventional trials were identified on Feb 22nd, 2020. These trials are classified into 4 categories based on treatment modalities, including chemical drugs, biological therapies, traditional Chinese medicine treatments and other therapies. Our analysis focused on the issues of stage, design, randomization, blinding, primary endpoints definition and sample size of these trials. We found some studies with potential defects including unreasonable design, inappropriate primary endpoint definition, insufficient sample size and ethical issue. Clinical trials on COVID-19 should be designed based on scientific rules, ethics and benefits for patients.","AbstractGenome-wide analysis of the mode of action of GSK983, a potent antiviral agent, led to the identification of dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH) as its target, along with the discovery that knockdown of genes in pyrimidine salvage pathways sensitized cells to GSK983. Because GSK983 is an ineffective antiviral in the presence of physiological uridine concentrations, we explored combining GSK983 with pyrimidine salvage inhibitors. We synthesized and evaluated analogs of cyclopentenyl uracil (CPU), an inhibitor of uridine salvage. We found that CPU was efficiently converted into its triphosphates in cells. When combined with GSK983, it led to large drops in cellular UTP and CTP pools. Consequently, CPU-GSK983 suppressed dengue virus replication in the presence of physiological concentrations of uridine. In addition, the CPU-GSK983 combination markedly enhanced the effect of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) inhibition on viral genome infection. Our findings highlight a new host...","There is interest in the use of chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine (CQ/HCQ) and azithromycin (AZT) in COVID-19 therapy. Employing cystic fibrosis respiratory epithelial cells, here we show that drugs AZT and ciprofloxacin (CPX) act as acidotropic lipophilic weak bases and confer in vitro effects on intracellular organelles similar to the effects of CQ. These seemingly disparate FDA-approved antimicrobials display a common property of modulating pH of endosomes and trans-Golgi network. We believe this may in part help understand the potentially beneficial effects of CQ/HCQ and AZT in COVID-19, and that the present considerations of HCQ and AZT for clinical trials should be extended to CPX.","While the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is hardly hitting the world, it is of extreme importance that significant in vitro observations guide the quick set up of clinical trials. In this study, we evidence that the anti-SARS-CoV2 activity of a clinically achievable hydroxychloroquine concentration is maximized only when administered before and after the infection of Vero E6 cells. This strongly suggests that only a combined prophylactic and therapeutic use of hydroxychloroquine may be effective in limiting viral replication in patients.","The novel corona virus disease -2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has caused a massive global public health havoc. Recent clinical trials carried out in China has found a promising therapeutic application of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine for COVID-19. This study meticulously evaluated the various dosages of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine utilized in clinical trials registered in Chinese and US clinical trial registries for the treatment of pneumonia caused by SARS-CoV-2.","Publisher Summary Proteolytic processing of the coronavirus replicase polyproteins is essential for ongoing viral ribonucleic acid (RNA) synthesis. Therefore, the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-coronaviruses (SARS-CoV) proteases are attractive targets for the development of antiviral drugs to reduce viral replication and pathogenicity. The structure and activity of the coronavirus 3C-like protease (3CLpro) has already been elucidated, and the design of inhibitors to 3CLpro as therapeutics has been proposed. The chapter discusses SARS-CoV 3CLpro inhibitors that include covalent inhibitors, noncovalent inhibitors, and inhibitors from screening. SARS-CoV papain-like protease (PLpro) is considered an equally viable target to 3CLpro for drug design because both are essential for viral replication. However, PLpro has likely not been pursued because of the paucity of structural information. Several compounds have been identified that have shown inhibitory activity against SARS-CoV. ...","Background We aim to investigate the profile of acute antibody response in COVID-19 patients, and provide proposals for the usage of antibody test in clinical practice. Methods A multi-center cross-section study (285 patients) and a single-center follow-up study (63 patients) were performed to investigate the feature of acute antibody response to SARS-CoV-2. A cohort of 52 COVID-19 suspects and 64 close contacts were enrolled to evaluate the potentiality of the antibody test. Results The positive rate for IgG reached 100% around 20 days after symptoms onset. The median day of serocon-version for both lgG and IgM was 13 days after symptoms onset. Seroconversion of IgM occurred at the same time, or earlier, or later than that of IgG. IgG levels in 100% patients (19/19) entered a platform within 6 days after seroconversion. The criteria of IgG seroconversion and \u2265 4-fold increase in the IgG titers in sequential samples together diagnosed 82.9% (34/41) of the patients. Antibody test aided ...","Following the outbreak of novel Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) or COVID-19 in Wuhan, China late 2019, different countries have put in place interventions such as travel ban, proper hygiene, and social distancing to slow the spread of this novel virus. We evaluated the effects of travel bans in the Australia context and projected the epidemic until May 2020. Our modelling results closely align with observed cases in Australia indicating the need for maintaining or improving on the control measures to slow down the virus.","Introduction: Despite the improved outcomes in solid organ transplantation with regard to prevention of rejection and increased patient and graft survival, infection remains a common cause of morbidity and mortality. Respiratory viruses are a frequent and potentially serious cause of infection after solid organ transplantation. Furthermore, clinical manifestations of respiratory virus infection (RVI) may be more severe and unusual in solid organ transplant recipients (SOTRs) compared with the non-immunocompromised population. Areas covered: This article reviews the non-influenza RVIs that are commonly encountered in SOTRs. Epidemiologic and clinical characteristics are highlighted and available treatment options are discussed. Expert opinion: New diagnostic tools, particularly rapid molecular assays, have expanded the ability to identify specific RVI pathogens in SOTRs. This is not only useful from a treatment standpoint but also to guide infection control practices. More data are need...","Public health measures have successfully identified and contained outbreaks of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus (SARS-CoV)(1,2,3,4,5), but concerns remain over the possibility of future recurrences. Finding a vaccine for this virus therefore remains a high priority. Here, we show that a DNA vaccine encoding the spike (S) glycoprotein of the SARS-CoV induces T cell and neutralizing antibody responses, as well as protective immunity, in a mouse model. Alternative forms of S were analysed by DNA immunization. These expression vectors induced robust immune responses mediated by CD4 and CD8 cells, as well as significant antibody titres, measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Moreover, antibody responses in mice vaccinated with an expression vector encoding a form of S that includes its transmembrane domain elicited neutralizing antibodies. Viral replication was reduced by more than six orders of magnitude in the lungs of mice vaccinated with these S plasmid D...","Abstract This paper describes a proposed Strategic Vaccine Facility (SVF) to provide a capability to the UK to deal with new and emerging disease threats. It would underpin the vaccine manufacturing industry by developing expertise and technology to enable rapid manufacture of small batches of vaccines for emergency use against agents, such as bioterrorist agents and emerging diseases. It would have a rare ability to work with dangerous pathogens under containment, allowing the production of inactivated and live vaccines, which would be difficult in a conventional plant. The facility's output will include vaccine candidates and manufacturing protocols for transfer to industry, small vaccine batches for emergency use or clinical trials, and vaccine reference standards. It would also be available for manufacturing small batches of experimental and public health vaccines for the UK and the developing world, allowing clinical trials to be undertaken against key diseases.","","SummaryCoronaviruses such as the newly discovered virus from Wuhan, China, 2019-nCoV, and the viruses that cause SARS and MERS, have resulted in regional and global public health emergencies. Based on our molecular insight that the hepatitis C virus and the coronavirus use a similar viral genome replication mechanism, we reasoned that the FDA-approved drug EPCLUSA (Sofosbuvir/Velpatasvir) for the treatment of hepatitis C will also inhibit the above coronaviruses, including 2019-nCoV. To develop broad spectrum anti-viral agents, we further describe a novel strategy to design and synthesize viral polymerase inhibitors, by combining the ProTide Prodrug approach used in the development of Sofosbuvir with the use of 3\u2019-blocking groups that we have previously built into nucleotide analogues that function as polymerase terminators.","SUMMARYA new coronavirus (CoV) identified as COVID-19 virus is the etiological agent responsible for the 2019-2020 viral pneumonia outbreak that commenced in Wuhan1-4. Currently there is no targeted therapeutics and effective treatment options remain very limited. In order to rapidly discover lead compounds for clinical use, we initiated a program of combined structure-assisted drug design, virtual drug screening and high-throughput screening to identify new drug leads that target the COVID-19 virus main protease (Mpro). Mpro is a key CoV enzyme, which plays a pivotal role in mediating viral replication and transcription, making it an attractive drug target for this virus5,6. Here, we identified a mechanism-based inhibitor, N3, by computer-aided drug design and subsequently determined the crystal structure of COVID-19 virus Mpro in complex with this compound. Next, through a combination of structure-based virtual and high-throughput screening, we assayed over 10,000 compounds including...","The human coronavirus HCoV-19 infection can cause acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), hypercoagulability, hypertension, extrapulmonary multiorgan dysfunction. Effective antiviral and anti-coagulation agents with safe clinical profiles are urgently needed to improve the overall prognosis. We screened an FDA approved drug library and found that an anticoagulant agent dipyridamole (DIP) suppressed HCoV-19 replication at an EC50 of 100 nM in vitro. It also elicited potent type I interferon responses and ameliorated lung pathology in a viral pneumonia model. In analysis of twelve HCoV-19 infected patients with prophylactic anti-coagulation therapy, we found that DIP supplementation was associated with significantly increased platelet and lymphocyte counts and decreased D-dimer levels in comparison to control patients. Two weeks after initiation of DIP treatment, 3 of the 6 severe cases (60%) and all 4 of the mild cases (100%) were discharged from the hospital. One critically ill pat...","An outbreak of the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19 respiratory disease, has infected over 290,000 people since the end of 2019, killed over 12,000, and caused worldwide social and economic disruption. There are currently no antiviral drugs with proven efficacy nor are there vaccines for its prevention. Unfortunately, the scientific community has little knowledge of the molecular details of SARS-CoV-2 infection. To illuminate this, we cloned, tagged and expressed 26 of the 29 viral proteins in human cells and identified the human proteins physically associated with each using affinity-purification mass spectrometry (AP-MS), which identified 332 high confidence SARS-CoV-2-human protein-protein interactions (PPIs). Among these, we identify 67 druggable human proteins or host factors targeted by 69 existing FDA-approved drugs, drugs in clinical trials and/or preclinical compounds, that we are currently evaluating for efficacy in live SARS-CoV-2 infection assay...","","Abstract Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a highly lethal emerging disease caused by coronavirus SARS-CoV. New lethal animal models for SARS were needed to facilitate antiviral research. We adapted and characterized a new strain of SARS-CoV (strain v2163) that was highly lethal in 5- to 6-week-old BALB/c mice. It had nine mutations affecting 10 amino acid residues. Strain v2163 increased IL-1\u03b1, IL-6, MIP-1\u03b1, MCP-1, and RANTES in mice, and high IL-6 expression correlated with mortality. The infection largely mimicked human disease, but lung pathology lacked hyaline membrane formation. In vitro efficacy against v2163 was shown with known inhibitors of SARS-CoV replication. In v2163-infected mice, Ampligen\u2122 was fully protective, stinging nettle lectin (UDA) was partially protective, ribavirin was disputable and possibly exacerbated disease, and EP128533 was inactive. Ribavirin, UDA, and Ampligen\u2122 decreased IL-6 expression. Strain v2163 provided a valuable model for anti-SARS re...","We investigate the effects of social distancing in controlling the impact of the Covid-19 epidemic using a simple SIR epidemic model. We show that an alternative or complementaryapproach based on targeted isolation of the vulnerable subpopulation may provide a moreefficient and robust strategy at a lower economic and social cost within a shorter timeframe.","Enveloped viruses have evolved membrane glycoproteins (GPs) that mediate entry into host cells. These proteins are important targets for antiviral therapies and vaccines. Several efforts to understand and combat infection by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) have therefore focused on the viral GP, known as spike (S). In a short period of time, important aspects of SARS-CoV S-protein function were unraveled. The identification of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a receptor for SARS-CoV provided an insight into viral tropism and pathogenesis, whereas mapping of functional domains in the S-protein enabled inhibitors to be generated. Vaccines designed on the basis of SARS-CoV S-protein were shown to be effective in animals and consequently are attractive candidates for vaccine trials in humans. Here, we discuss how SARS-CoV S facilitates viral entry into target cells and illustrate current approaches that are used to inhibit this process.","SARS-CoV-2 has caused tens of thousands of infections and more than one thousand deaths. There are currently no registered therapies for treating coronavirus infections. Because of time consuming process of new drug development, drug repositioning may be the only solution to the epidemic of sudden infectious diseases. We systematically analyzed all the proteins encoded by SARS-CoV-2 genes, compared them with proteins from other coronaviruses, predicted their structures, and built 19 structures that could be done by homology modeling. By performing target-based virtual ligand screening, a total of 21 targets (including two human targets) were screened against compound libraries including ZINC drug database and our own database of natural products. Structure and screening results of important targets such as 3-chymotrypsin-like protease (3CLpro), Spike, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), and papain like protease (PLpro) were discussed in detail. In addition, a database of 78 commonly u...","SummarySARS-CoV-2, a member of the coronavirus family, has caused a global public health emergency.1 Based on our analysis of hepatitis C virus and coronavirus replication, and the molecular structures and activities of viral inhibitors, we previously reasoned that the FDA-approved heptatitis C drug EPCLUSA (Sofosbuvir/Velpatasvir) should inhibit coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2.2 Here, using model polymerase extension experiments, we demonstrate that the activated triphosphate form of Sofosbuvir is incorporated by low-fidelity polymerases and SARS-CoV RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), and blocks further incorporation by these polymerases; the activated triphosphate form of Sofosbuvir is not incorporated by a host-like high-fidelity DNA polymerase. Using the same molecular insight, we selected two other anti-viral agents, Alovudine and AZT (an FDA approved HIV/AIDS drug) for evaluation as inhibitors of SARS-CoV RdRp. We demonstrate the ability of two HIV reverse transcriptase inh...","The discovery of a novel coronavirus (CoV) as the causative agent of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) has highlighted the need for a better understanding of CoV replication. The replication of SARS-CoV is highly dependent on host cell factors. However, relatively little is known about the cellular proteome changes that occur during SARS-CoV replication. Recently, we developed a cell line expressing a SARS-CoV subgenomic replicon and used it to screen inhibitors of SARS-CoV replication. To identify host proteins important for SARS-CoV RNA replication, the protein profiles of the SARS-CoV replicon cells and parental BHK21 cells were compared using a quantitative proteomic strategy termed \u201cstable-isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture-mass spectrometry\u201d (SILAC-MS). Our results revealed that, among the 1,081 host proteins quantified in both forward and reverse SILAC measurements, 74 had significantly altered levels of expression. Of these, significantly upregulated BCL2-as...","Publisher Summary This chapter focuses on non-HIV antiviral agents. The development of antiviral agents to treat non-HIV infections is largely focused on therapies for the treatment of chronic hepatitis infections B and C. Nucleoside analog continue to be the mainstay of Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) therapeutics. The first small molecule inhibitor of Hepatitis C Virus (HCV), the NS3 protease inhibitor BILN-2061, entered phase 2 clinical trials, producing a striking reduction in viral load in treated individuals. The development of the HCV replicon system and its application to screening for antiviral agents provided tangible benefit with the disclosure of mechanistically and structurally diverse HCV inhibitors. Adefovir dipivoxil has been approved in the United States and the European Union for the treatment of HBV, providing a second small molecule antiviral to add to lamivudine (3TC) and the injectable protein IFN\u03b1 as the only approved agents for treating HBV infection. The chapter also p...","Abstract Background: Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is an emerging infection caused by a novel coronavirus known as SARS-CoV, characterized by an over-exuberant immune response with lung lymphomononuclear cells infiltration and proliferation that may account for tissue damage more than the direct effect of viral replication. This study is aimed at investigating the capability of SARS-CoV to activate IFN-\u03b1 and -\u03b3 expression in lymphomonocytes (PBMC) from healthy donors, evaluating whether viral replication is necessary for this activation. Results: SARS-CoV virus is able to induce both IFN-\u03b1 and -\u03b3 mRNA accumulation and protein release in a dose-dependent manner, MOI 10 being the most effective. The time course curve indicated that IFN-\u03b1 mRNA induction peaked at 24 h.p.i,. whereas IFN-\u03b3 mRNA was still increasing at 48 h.p.i. Released IFN (both types) reached a plateau after 24\u201348 h.p.i. and remained rather stable over a 5-day period. A transient peak of negative strand viral R...","Exotic and emerging viral pathogens associated with high morbidity and mortality in humans are being identified annually with recent examples including Lujo virus in southern Africa, Severe Fever with Thrombocytopenia Syndrome virus in China and a SARS-like coronavirus in the Middle East. The sporadic nature of these infections hampers our understanding of these diseases and limits the opportunities to design appropriate medical countermeasures against them. Because of this, animal models are utilized to gain insight into the pathogenesis of disease with the overall goal of identifying potential targets for intervention and evaluating specific therapeutics and vaccines. For these reasons it is imperative that animal models of disease recapitulate the human condition as closely as possible in order to provide the best predictive data with respect to the potential efficacy in humans. In this article we review the current status of disease models for highly pathogenic and emerging viral p...","SARS-CoV-2 has infected over 140,000 people as of March 14, 2020. We use a mathematical model to investigate the effectiveness of social distancing interventions lasting six weeks in a middle-sized city in the US. We explore four social distancing strategies by reducing the contacts of adults over 60 years old, adults over 60 years old and children, all adults (25, 75 or 95% compliance), and everyone in the population. Our results suggest that social distancing interventions can avert cases by 20% and hospitalizations and deaths by 90% even with modest compliance within adults as long as the intervention is kept in place, but the epidemic is set to rebound once the intervention is lifted. Our models suggest that social distancing interventions will buy crucial time but need to occur in conjunction with testing and contact tracing of all suspected cases to mitigate transmission of SARS-CoV-2.","BACKGROUND: Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) consists of a positive-sense, single-stranded RNA genome and four structural proteins: the spike, envelope, membrane, and nucleocapsid protein. The assembly of the viral genome into virus particles involves viral structural proteins and is believed to be mediated through recognition of specific sequences and RNA structures of the viral genome. METHODS AND RESULTS: A culture system for the production of MERS coronavirus-like particles (MERS VLPs) was determined and established by electron microscopy and the detection of coexpressed viral structural proteins. Using the VLP system, a 258-nucleotide RNA fragment, which spans nucleotides 19,712 to 19,969 of the MERS-CoV genome (designated PS258(19712\u201319969)(ME)), was identified to function as a packaging signal. Assembly of the RNA packaging signal into MERS VLPs is dependent on the viral nucleocapsid protein.

Corticosteroids are associated with increased risk of superinfection, prolonged viral replication, and increased risk of death, and should not be used (Rodrigo et al., 2016) . For most other adjunctive therapies, the data is less clear. The areas where adjunctive therapies have some supporting data and may be worth further studies were then reviewed. The combination of oseltamivir and azithromycin had been shown to downregulate the proinflammatory cytokines, without impairing viral clearance in one small RCT . The triple combination of oseltamivir, clarithromycin, and naproxen was demonstrated to reduce adverse outcomes in another study (Hung et al., 2017) , but these findings, though intriguing, should be confirmed. Sirolimus has been used with apparent benefit in critically ill influenza patients in the context of an RCT (Wang et al., 2014) , confirmatory studies of this approach without concomitant corticosteroid therapy can be explored. The efficacy of other agents with potential immunomodulating effects, including N-acetylcysteine (NAC), statins, nitazoxanide (NTZ), IFNs, Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPAR) agonists, cyclooxygenase (COX 2) inhibitors, recombinant angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), diltiazem, and herbal medicine, all have some supporting preclinical or clinical data, but these need to be studied more intensely, preferably by RCTs .","Because mutant viruses in the S protein is prone to escape the targeted therapeutic with 55 different host-cell receptor binding patterns 4 , as well as antibody-dependent enhancement 56 (ADE) effects of S protein antibodies are found in MERS coronavirus 5 , there are several limitations 57 on targeting S protein for antiviral approaches.

In addition to the above study of naproxen\u2013clarithromycin added to oseltamivir [23], preliminary results from a RCT (n = 120) showed that the combination of celecoxib-oseltamivir compared to oseltamivir alone reduced mortality and cytokine levels, although not viral titers, in hospitalized influenza A(H3N2) patients without increased adverse effects [31].","This geographic discrepancy in pathogenesis may appear to defy explanation. Yet there may be a biological mechanism behind this epidemiological anomaly. Individuals suffering the most may have been primed by one or more prior coronavirus exposures, and due to antigenic epitope heterogeneity, are experiencing the effects of antibody dependent enhancement (ADE).","Some RNA viruses are known to induce antibody dependent enhancement such as the exacerbation of diseases in immunized populations exposed to dengue virus infections. ADE is therefore a significant obstacle in inactivated vaccine development. Our study of safety and efficacy focused on the occurrence of ADE in SARS-CoV. All immunized monkeys were challenged after their neutralizing antibodies decreased to low levels, mimicking the situation in immunized populations. The preliminary results showed that no obvious ADE phenomena was detected in immunized monkeys after being challenged with SARS-CoV GZ-01 strain. Also, the levels of neutralizing antibodies in all immunized monkeys increased sharply after SARS onset, indicating that immune memories were established in the vaccinated monkeys.","There are 2 unique safety considerations that have been raised in discussions of Zika virus vaccine development: antibody-dependent enhancement of infection (ADE) and GBS. ADE is an in vitro phenomenon initially documented for dengue virus123,148 that has been observed for all flaviviruses including Zika.129 While the presence of enhancing antibodies has been postulated as a risk for dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF), prospective clinical studies have not demonstrated a correlation between the presence of enhancing antibodies in pre-infection serum and more severe dengue virus infections.125,126 One caveat for a Zika vaccine is the finding that studies of a live-virus chimeric dengue vaccine, young children and dengue-seronegative adults were at greater risk for DHF starting 3 y post-vaccination.149 As discussed above, clinical correlation of cross-flavivirus reactivity is as yet unresolved. There is no epidemiologic data to suggest that the current Zika virus epidemic has increased the risk for DHF and as presented above, one study in pregnant females showed no evidence of differences in disease severity related to prior DENV seropositivity137 and other studies have shown that prior DENV serotype I infection may be associated with increased neutralizing antibody titers134 that could result in greater protection.","Most CoVs share a similar viral structure, similar infection pathway, and a similar structure of the S proteins [41] , suggesting that similar research strategies should also be applicable for the 2019-nCoV. For example, the study of MERS-CoV vaccines was accelerated by virtue of strategies that had been established for SARS-CoV [42] . It has been reported that the 2019-nCoV is also genetically close to SARS-CoV [43, 44] . Therefore, to predict whether vaccines developed for SARS-CoV will also be effective against 2019-nCoV infection, the full length S protein sequences from the 2019-nCoV, a SARS-CoV, and two genetically similar bat CoV strains were selected for alignment (Fig. 1) . The results indicated more than 50% homology of the viruses. However, the most variable residues are located in S1, a critical vaccine target, implying that neutralizing antibodies that were so effective against SARS-CoV infection may fail to recognize the 2019-nCoV, and that multiple amino acid differences at the receptor binding motif may modify virus tropism, a possible reason for cross-species transmission. However, several bottlenecks typically delay the approval of vaccines to prevent CoVs infection. First, a lack of proper animal models for evaluating vaccine efficacy. Second, there are limitations from the S protein itself, such as mutations in the neutralization antibody epitopes in S protein that can cause virus escape [45] , or non-neutralization antibody epitopes in vaccines that may elicit antibody-mediated disease enhancement (ADE) [46] . Third, DNA vaccines may recombine with other viruses. Fourth, pre-existing immunity may eliminate the vaccine by removing the general human virus vectors [47] . Finally, there is the problem of return on investment which may be slow and, hence, inhibit investments and slow down the clinical study.","With regard to the most severe cases of infection registered both outside and within the Hubei province, it is most likely that these individuals have been primed by one or more coronavirus exposure within a narrow time window, leading to the effects of Antibody-Dependent Enhancement (ADE) [4] . Such a hypothesis is in line with the previous observations dating back to the previous SARS outcome in 2003 when human coronaviruses, known to cause mild infections, were hypothesized of priming the high mortality scored in China. Here, anti-Spike protein antibodies were indicated as potentially involved in the enhancement mechanism [14e18]. In this view, it is plausible that Hubei province patients are featured by a more severe clinical picture, since more likely to be recurrently exposed to the coronavirus.","In this study, we also addressed the potential problem of antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE), which is a well-recognized phenomenon observed in infections with another coronavirus, feline infectious peritonitis virus. Both immunization and passive transfer of antibody was shown to mediate this phenomenon and mAbs have been used to map neutralizing and enhancing epitopes on the spike glycoprotein of feline infectious peritonitis virus [ 25, 51]. There is no direct evidence of ADE linked to SARS-CoV infection in humans to date, and infection of human macrophages with SARS-CoV was previously shown to be abortive [ 25]. However, it was recently shown, in a viral pseudotype assay expressing the full-length spike glycoproteins of SARS-CoV-like viruses, that these cannot be neutralized with either homologous or heterologous mouse immune sera, and that both the sera and human mAbs neutralizing SARS-CoV enhance infectivity of the pseudotype for the human adenocarcinoma cells used as indicator system [ 34]. Given that ADE in feline infectious peritonitis virus infection is mediated by increased macrophage uptake of virus in the presence of neutralizing antibody, we performed human macrophage infectivity assays in the presence of CR3014 and human convalescent serum. In this type of assay, ADE of Dengue and Ross River virus infection has previously been demonstrated [ 52]. The addition of varying concentrations of CR3014 or convalescent SARS serum to SARS CoV did not convert the abortive infection into a productive one, reducing the likelihood that ADE will be observed in vivo after passive immunization. ","Administration of rhACE2 has been shown to exert promising effects in a variety of disease models with pathologically elevated Ang II levels or a dysregulated RAS. These experimental findings have provided compelling evidence for initiating clinical trials with rhACE2. In this regard, GlaxoSmithKline is currently evaluating the effects of GSK2586881 (formerly APN01), a soluble form of rhACE2, in a multicenter phase II clinical trial for the treatment of acute lung injury. Previous phase I trials have established that administration of single and multiple doses of rhACE2 is well tolerated by healthy humans, with no serious adverse events or dose-limiting toxicities. 26 Furthermore, in a separate clinical study, the efficacy of rhACE2 is being assessed for the treatment of PAH (ClinicalTrials.gov; NCT01884051). Although clinical trials are currently under way, the use of protein therapy faces several challenges. Among these, the cost of manufacturing the recombinant protein, its stability, repetitive intravenous dosing, and patient compliance pose major obstacles in realizing the full therapeutic potential of ACE2 therapy.","One of the most perplexing questions regarding the current COVID-19 coronavirus epidemic is the discrepancy between the severity of cases observed in the Hubei province of China and those occurring elsewhere in the world. One possible answer is antibody dependent enhancement (ADE) of SARS-CoV-2 due to prior exposure to other coronaviruses. ADE modulates the immune response and can elicit sustained inflammation, lymphopenia, and/or cytokine storm, one or all of which have been documented in severe cases and deaths. ADE also requires prior exposure to similar antigenic epitopes, presumably circulating in local viruses, making it a possible explanation for the observed geographic limitation of severe cases and deaths.","Macrolide antibiotics, due to putative anti-inflammatory and possible antiviral effects, have been studied in patients with RVIs but with inconsistent results. In an open-label RCT of hospitalized patients with influenza (n = 107), early combination therapy with clarithromycin, naproxen, and oseltamivir was associated with reduced mortality and hospital length of stay compared to oseltamivir monotherapy [22]. On the other hand, in a multicenter observational study (n = 733), macrolides were not associated with improved survival in critically ill patients with influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 [23]. In patients with MERS (n = 349), macrolide therapy is not associated with a reduction in 90-day mortality or improvement in MERS-CoV RNA clearance [24]. A study of clarithromycin combined with the cyclooxygenase inhibitor flufenamic acid in hospitalized patients with influenza is underway (NCT03238612). In addition, macrolides are also examined in one of the domains of the REMAP-CAP trial (Randomized, Embedded, Multifactorial Adaptive Platform Trial for Community-Acquired Pneumonia, NCT02735707).","Safety evaluation tested the antibody dependent enhancement (ADE) of the inactivated SARS vaccine. Three groups of rhesus (male, 3-4 years old, Animal Center of Academy of Military Medical Sciences, Beijing, China) (three rhesus monkeys per group) were immunized with different doses of purified inactivated SARS vaccine (0.5, 1, 2 g/time/monkey) on days 0 and 7. Three monkeys in the control group were injected with Vero cell culture. Blood was sampled on days 0, 14, 21 and 30 for neutralizing antibody determination. All monkeys were challenged with SARS-CoV GZ-01 strain on day 30 at the dose of 7.0 TCID 50 /ml \u00d7 3 and were euthanized on day 14 after challenge. Internal organs from the monkey were sampled and the systematically pathological changes were observed.","About two-fifth of the world's population is now at risk for dengue infection and 50-100 million cases are estimated to occur worldwide every year [2, 3] . An estimated 500 000 people with severe dengue require hospitalization each year; a very large proportion of whom are children, resulting in a fatal outcome in about 2.5% of those affected. There is neither vaccine nor a specific antiviral treatment. Likewise, no antivirals are available for the treatment of life-threatening infections with other flaviviruses such as those caused by yellow fever virus [4] , Japanese encephalitis virus and West Nile virus. The organization of the genome of flaviviruses resembles -to some extent -that of the related HCV, of which the viral serine protease and the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase have been shown to be excellent targets for inhibition of viral replication (both in vitro and in the infected patients) [5] . So far, flavivirus NS3 protease inhibitors with a potency comparable to that of the HCV NS3 protease inhibitors have not yet been identified. Particular differences in the characteristics and structure of the different NS3 proteases may be the reason [6] . An exhaustive review on the flavivirus NS3 protease as a target for the design of inhibitors has recently been published [7] . Second, nucleoside as well as non-nucleoside polymerase inhibitors of HCV have been and currently are in clinical development. They exert pan-genotype antiviral activity and have a high barrier to resistance [8] . Nucleoside polymerase inhibitors (that target the enzyme as their 5 0 -phosphorylated metabolite) have also been shown to exert pan-serotype anti-dengue virus activity in vitro and in dengue mouse models [9, 10] . Balipiravir, a nucleoside HCV polymerase inhibitor, was evaluated for potential activity in dengue-infected patients. No protective activity was observed [11] . The lack of activity of balipiravir can very probably be ascribed to the very weak in vitro potency of this molecule against DENV and should not create any pessimism regarding the potential use of nucleoside analogs for the treatment of dengue. For HCV a large number of non-nucleoside polymerase inhibitors have been reported and at least 4 different allosteric pockets for inhibition of the enzyme activity have been identified on the enzyme [5] . At least one cavity has been found in the dengue polymerase that may potentially serve as a pocket into which inhibitors of the enzyme could be designed [12] . In addition, the flavivirus NS5 gene encodes, besides the viral polymerase, also a methyltransferase (MTase) which is responsible for methylating the viral cap. This MTase is critical for viral replication and therefore represents a valid target for antiviral therapeutics. Efforts are ongoing to develop selective inhibitors of this enzyme [13] . Fourth, the flavivirus NS4b is an essential membrane-associated viral protein (not a homologue of the HCV NS4b) that has been shown to be the target of small molecule dengue inhibitors [14] . Also, an inhibitor of yellow fever virus replication was reported that targets NS4b [15] . We recently identified a class of highly potent and panserotype dengue virus inhibitors that target NS4b (our unpublished data). The exact mechanism by which these molecules target NS4b and thereby inhibit viral replication remains to be elucidated. Despite the fact that the precise function of NS4b is not well understood, this protein appears, akin to NS5a of HCV, to be an excellent target for the design of potent inhibitors of viral replication. Finally, inhibition of host factors that are essential for virus replication might be considered. For instance, an inhibitor of dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH), an enzyme required for pyrimidine biosynthesis, was identified as an inhibitor of in vitro dengue virus replication but had no effect in dengue virusinfected mice [16] . Glycosylation inhibitors [N-nonyldeoxynojirimycin and celgosivir] have been shown to inhibit dengue virus replication (by misfolding of NS1). The activity of celgosivir has also been demonstrated in a dengue mouse model [17] and its activity is currently being explored in a clinical study (Celaden Drug Trial; URL: http://www.celaden.sg/). The design of appropriate clinical trials with dengue drugs might be challenging however. Recently, recommendations for the design of such trials have been published [3 ] .","Pseudotyped virions/VLPs encoding reporter systems such as GFP or luciferase can be used for quantification and evaluation of the effectiveness of mAbs and drugs in inhibiting the cellular entry of CoVs.64 Assays using pseudotyped virions/VLPs can be performed in BSL-2 facility since these do not use infectious virus. A safety concern for passive immunization with antibodies is a possible antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of virus replication. Antibodies with modified Fc fragments or without Fc fragment, e.g., human single-chain antibodies (scFv), Fab, or F(ab\u2032)2 are safe alternatives.","Most SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV vaccines developed thus far are based on the inactivated or live attenuated viruses, DNAs, proteins, nanoparticles, viral vectors, including viruslike particles (VLPs) (Zeng et al., 2004; Jiang et al., 2005; Liu et al., 2005; Du et al., 2009a Du et al., , 2016b Pimentel et al., 2009; Al-Amri et al., 2017) . Each vaccine type has different advantages and disadvantages. For instance, inactivated and liveattenuated virus-based vaccines are vaccine types developed using the most traditional approaches. Although they generally induce highly potent immune responses and/or protection, the possibility for incomplete inactivation of viruses or recovering virulence exists, resulting in significant safety concerns (Zhang et al., 2014) . Also, these traditional vaccines may induce the antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) effect, as in the case of SARS-CoV infection (Luo et al., 2018b) . Similarly, some viral-vectored vaccines can elicit specific antibody and cellular immune responses with neutralizing activity and protection, but they might also induce anti-vector immunity or present preexisting immunity, causing some harmful immune responses. Instead, DNA and nanoparticle vaccines maintain strong safety profile; however, the immunogenicity of these vaccines is usually lower than that of virus-or viral vector-based vaccines, often requiring optimization of sequences, components, or immunization routes, inclusion of appropriate adjuvants, or application of combinational immunization approaches (Zhang et al., 2014) .","The question of whether prior immunity against DENV can provide cross protection against Zika virus or enhance Zika virus infection is not yet resolved. For DENV, heterologous secondary infection, i.e., with a different serotype approximately 2 y post-infection, carries an increased risk for dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) whereas earlier exposures are protective.122 Studies by Halstead demonstrated that the severity of secondary infection correlated with presence of non-neutralizing antibodies in sera that increase in vitro cellular viral entry123 - a phenomenon termed antibody dependent enhancement (ADE) of infection. In one prospective study of Thai children, of serum collected in the 6 month period before secondary infection, sera from 4 (13%) of 32 children with asymptomatic secondary DENV infection demonstrated ADE vs. 6 of 9 (67%) with severe infection.124 In contrast, 2 subsequent prospective Thai studies of greater than 200 children with secondary DENV infection did not demonstrate any relationship between severe infection and ADE.125,126","Henderson et al. in a primate study from 1970 demonstrated cross protection for animals infected with one flavivirus and challenged with a second, different flavivirus127 whereas 2 later in vitro studies demonstrated antibody dependent enhancement (ADE) of infection between the DENV and Yellow Fever flaviviruses.128,129 In vitro ADE has also been demonstrated for Zika virus by the presence of flavivirus antibodies against DENV and/or West Nile virus (WNV).130-132 MAbs against the DENV fusion loop domain has lower affinity to Zika virus and induces ADE,133 whereas mAbs against the envelope E1 domain inhibit ADE.131 Others found that prior antibodies to the DENV serotype 1 envelope domain III were associated with higher Zika neutralizing titers.134 In contrast to sera collected from subjects with acute DENV infection131,133 sera collected later in the convalescent period did not demonstrate cross-reactivity between DENV and Zika virus.135 Conversely antibodies against the Zika virus envelope domains I and II were poorly neutralizing and enhanced dengue virus infection whereas domain III antibodies were specific and protective.132,133,136 Importantly, clinical correlates of cross-flavivirus ADE are so far lacking. A study of 131 PCR-positive pregnant women found no correlation (p = 0.667) between the presence of prior DENV antibodies and disease severity, and with no relationship between Zika viral load and adverse outcomes such as fetal loss.137 Thus, the clinical implication of prior flavivirus immunity remains unanswered.","It has been reported that the high levels of neutralizing antibodies have a protective 107 effect on SARS-CoV infection, but the low neutralizing antibody are more susceptible 108 to enhance the SARS-CoV infection and trigger antibody-dependent enhancement 109 (ADE) effect 6 . As shown in Table 1 , the titers of 1:16 (M2, M4) and 1:8 (M3) exhibited 110 the neutralizing effect at 21 dpi and 28 dpi.

However, some reports suggest that viral shedding may be prolonged by analgesics. 292, 293 While limited use for pain reduction is eminently reasonable, the widespread use of NSAIDs for general common cold symptoms is not justified, as evidence-of-benefit is marginal, and many thousands of individuals die each year from NSAID-attributable gastrointestinal hemorrhage and congestive heart failure.

Common side effects include headache, uncomfortable nasal dryness, and nosebleed.","Many attempts have been made to develop an FIP vaccine, most of which failed, with antibody-dependent enhancement of infection observed experimentally and resulting in more vaccinated than control cats developing FIP. At present there is only one vaccine, available in the USA and in some European countries. It is administered intranasally and contains a temperature-sensitive mutant of the type II FCoV strain DF2; type I coronaviruses are, however, more prevalent in the field. 2, 16 Results from experimental studies have been inconsistent, with preventable fractions between 0 and 75%. [66] [67] [68] [69] The results of field studies have been equally contradictory. [70] [71] [72] The not unexpected conclusion is that this vaccine might not be effective in seropositive cats that have already been exposed to FCoV. The antibody-dependent enhancement of infection that was a feature of some experimental vaccine trials has not been observed in field studies, suggesting that the vaccine can be considered safe.

Undertaking clinical trials of a SARS vaccine in a setting of vanishing perception of the potential risk of re-emergence of the disease is yet another difficulty. A final uncertainty is the possibility of immune enhancement, a phenomenon which was observed when studying vaccination of cats against the feline coronavirus, FIPV: animals vaccinated with a whole inactivated virus vaccine showed accelerated disease and death after exposure to wild type virus. The humoral response to FIPV does not seem to be protective but can in fact lead to drastically accelerated disease, presumably due to antibody-dependent enhancement of target cell infection via Fc receptor-mediated attachment of virus-antibody complexes. Control of infection and FIPV clearance are thought to primarily depend on cell-mediated immune responses [85] .","In addition to Ad5 vector based strategies, limitations associated with the high prevalence of this virus in the human population are met in parallel approaches employing the far less prevalent Ad26 and Ad35 or related viruses such as chimpanzee derived adenoviruses (ChAd3). Especially ChAd3 is among the most widely evaluated vectors for the development of a vaccine against Ebola. Two vaccines developed by the NIAID VRC, i.e., replication defective ChAd3 encoding for EBOV GP alone or in combination with SUDV GP, were tested in preclinical studies which demonstrated complete protection in NHPs for both vaccines 5 weeks after single injection, using 1010 viral particles. However, immune responses waned several months after prime vaccination which could be prevented by boosting with MVA encoding for GPs from EBOV and SUDV (60). Starting in September 2014, both vaccines were tested in phase I clinical trials (NCT02231866, NCT02240875, and NCT02267109) demonstrating an acceptable safety profile of ChAd3 vectors, the induction of GP specific antibody responses in almost all subjects as well as T cell responses in a subset of study participants (61\u201363) (Table 1). ChAd3 encoding for EBOV GP has been moved on to phase II clinical studies and is licensed by GSK (64). Published results of a phase I/II clinical trial (NCT02289027) report immunogenicity in almost all vaccine recipients and significantly increased antibody responses in the vaccine group compared to the placebo group at 6 months (65) (Table 1). Importantly, the PREVAIL study (NCT02344407), a phase II clinical trial that directly compared ChAd3 and rVSV-ZEBOV based vaccines, demonstrated that both vaccines elicited immune responses one month after vaccination that were largely maintained through 12 months (66). In addition, further trials are evaluating a prime-boost regimen of ChAd3 followed by MVA vaccines (64). Overall, ChAd3 based vaccine appears to be a safe and efficacious candidate for Ebola vaccine development.","Since tylophorine, IMD-0354, and CYT387 (a JAK family inhibitor) exhibited differential effects on the regulation of I\u03baB\u03b1 and p65 in TGEV infected ST cells, drug combination experiments were performed to investigate their combined effects on anti-TGEV replication using the IFA assays described in Materials and Methods. IMD-0354 was able to exert anti-TGEV activities with an EC50 (50% maximal effective concentration) of 1.8 \u00b1 0.1 \u00b5M. The combination index values for ED50 (50% maximal effective dose) of tylophorine and IMD-0354 were calculated using Calcusyn software and all were in the range of ~1.3 to ~1.7. Thus, tylophorine and IMD-0354 both inhibited TGEV activity, but in an antagonistic manner (Fig. 3A-a). In contrast, CYT387 was able to exert anti-TGEV activity with an EC50 of 30.4 \u00b1 1.2 \u00b5M; CYT387 and tylophorine worked additively in anti-TGEV activity with the combination index values at ~0.8\u20130.9 for ED50 (Fig. 3A-b). Lastly, CYT387 treatment was able to enhance the anti-TGEV activity of tylophorine or DBQ 33b in a dose dependent manner as determined by N protein expression (Fig. 3B), consistent with the additive effect of the combined treatment, CYT387 and tylophorine, for anti-TGEV activity (Fig. 3A-b). ","Another challenging consideration is the mixed infections seen in AIDS patients who not only may have varying HIV-1 clade infections (more than seven clades, and close to 1500 genetically distinct HIV-1 genotypes) but also are coinfected with other viruses such as HCV or KSHV. The complication of identifying biomarkers in these patients, or in some instances animal models, has never been properly addressed in the current literature, nor is there enough awareness between various compartments of patient bench to bedside practices. Therefore, a better flow of information using solid epidemiological data followed by better diagnostics for the viral etiology would allow a meaningful identification of the proteome biomarkers seen in these patients. These multiple biomarkers would serve as invaluable tools for multiple drug treatments and better control of mixed infections.","Tylophorine compounds exert potent anti-coronavirus activities11, 12, but the mechanism of action remains unknown. Previously, we reported that tylophorine-based compounds exert anti-cancer activity predominantly by targeting the RNP complex containing caprin-1 protein/c-Myc mRNA in carcinoma cells18. Accordingly, we investigated whether the observed anti-TGEV activity arises from the targeting of viral RNP. First, we demonstrated that biotinylated tylophorine, not Biotin-X-SSE (see Fig. 1A-a for chemical structures), interacted with purified TGEV viral RNAs in a pull-down experiment using streptavidin beads (see materials and methods) (Fig. 1A-b). This interaction of biotinylated tylophorine and TGEV viral RNA was enhanced by addition of recombinant TGEV N protein, but not RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP), in a dose dependent manner (Fig. 1A-c). Moreover, a cellular colocalization of TGEV viral nascent RNA, N protein and fluorescent tylophorine compound surrounding the nuclei in TGEV infected cells was also observed (Figs S1 and S2). Secondly, through RT-qPCR, we also demonstrated tylophorine based compounds (Fig. 1B) profoundly inhibited TGEV viral replication by diminishing viral RNA copies by up to ~4 orders of magnitude (Fig. 1C). Thirdly, using 5-ethynyl uridine (EU) labelled newly synthesized RNA, we clearly demonstrated that tylophorine compounds, either tylophorine or DBQ 33b, inhibited the nascent viral RNA synthesis and thus blocked the colocalization of viral nascent RNA with either N protein (Fig. 1D-a) or RdRP (Fig. 1D-b) around nuclei. ","Currently, there exist no vaccines or anti-viral treatments officially approved for the prevention or management of the disease. Anti-retroviral drugs belonging to the class of protease inhibitors, including Lopinavir and Ritonavir, usually utilized for the treatment of HIV/AIDS patients, seem to exert anti-viral effects against coronaviruses. GS-734 (Remdesivir), a nucleotide analogue pro-drug, originally developed against the Ebola and the Marburg viruses, has been recently suggested to be effective also against coronaviruses. Other potential pharmaceuticals include nucleoside analogues, neuraminidase inhibitors, and RNA synthesis inhibitors. Also, Umifenovir (Abidol), used for treating severe influenza cases, anti-inflammatory drugs and EK1 peptide have been proposed as possible drugs against coronaviruses (Lu, 2020).","As antibody can enhance rather than protect against the coronavirus disease feline infectious peritonitis, antibody-dependent enhancement has been a concern for SARS-Co vaccine development. However, no evidence of vaccine-enhanced disease has been observed to date, with two possible exceptions. There is a report that a modified vaccinia Ankara virus S protein vaccine has led to hepatitis in vaccinated ferrets but this has not been independently confirmed. There is also a report that S protein antibody elicited by a subunit vaccine enhances entry of pseudo-particles carrying S spike into lymphoblastoic cell lines which lack ACE-2 and are not normally permissive to infection. However, in the challenge experiments in hamsters, the vaccine did not induce protection and there is no evidence of disease enhancement.","We have previously demonstrated that mouse anti-Spike serum could trigger infection of Raji cells [16]. In the context of ADE, antibodies against viral proteins are considered as the major players of enhancement [18,19]; see for review [20,21]. To eliminate the possibility of the participation of other soluble factors during ADE of SARS, in this section we investigated the capability of anti-Spike antibodies alone in enhancing infection of immune cells. We purified IgG by protein G-sepharose chromatography from mouse anti-Spike and control serum, and used 2-fold serial dilutions from 10 to 0.125 \u03bcg/mL of the purified portion to form immune complex with SARS-CoVpp and then infected Raji cells. Our results show that purified IgG from mouse anti-Spike serum triggered infection in Raji cells, which was more pronounced with increasing immunoglobulin concentrations (Figure 4). The flow-through (FT) from the same serum, which was diluted by the appropriate factor to be comparable to the final IgG concentration used, elicited no detectable infection at all concentrations (data not shown). Significant differences between ADE of infection with purified mouse anti-Spike IgG and flow-through were observed at concentrations 10 and 2.5 \u03bcg/mL, and marginal difference was observed at 0.625 \u03bcg/mL. As expected, neither purified IgG (Figure 4) nor flow-through from mouse control serum triggered significant ADE of infection at all concentrations.","For example, the average of peaks for IL-6 was 1081.7 pg/mL, which was more than 100 times higher than the upper limit of normal value (reference range: &lt; 7 pg/mL). Inflammatory storm may originate from the following aspects. First, SARS-Cov-2 infects patients by binding human ACE2, 29, 30 which is widely expressed in multiple organs throughout the body. 31 SARS-CoV-2 might lead to multi-system inflammation through ACE/Ang II/AT1R pathway and ACE2/Ang (1-7)/Mas receptor pathway. 32, 33 Second, it was reported that antibody dependent enhancement (ADE) of SARS-CoV-2 due to prior exposure to other coronaviruses might also be involved in COVID-19. ADE can elicit sustained inflammation, lymphopenia, and/or cytokine storm, which makes it a possible explanation for the geographic limitation of severe cases. 34 Third, combined infections may lead to a more severe systemic inflammatory response. Indeed, in our study, some patients combined with infection in other organs (e.g. urinary tract, blood) and other pathogen (e.g. influenza virus, fungus). Fourth, shock, hypoxemia and coagulation pathway abnormalities in critical patients could aggravate systemic inflammatory response, which become a vicious cycle, threatening life. 35, 36 In our study, CRRT was associated with prolonged survival in COVID-19 patients with invasive mechanical ventilation. CRRT is a widely used blood purification therapy, which achieves a high solute clearance rate through diffusion, convection, ultrafiltration, and adsorption. The primary goal of CRRT is to compensate for the loss of renal function and associated sequelae, including uremic toxins, electrolyte disturbances, metabolic acidosis, and volume overload 37 . Besides these, CRRT can also remove cytokines from the bloodstream. Emerging evidence has shown that CRRT was associated with significantly lower mortality in patients with severe sepsis. 18, 19, 38 In addition, in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome, CRRT could remove All rights reserved.

Several enterovirus inhibitors were found to select for drug-resistance mutations in 3A, for example, enviroxime, TTP-8307 and T-00127-HEV1 [28] [29] [30] . Enviroxime was evaluated in clinical trials, but caused gastro-intestinal side effects and failed to protect from natural rhinovirus infection [31] . The molecule was recently shown to block enterovirus replication through direct inhibition of the host enzyme phosphatidylinositol-4 kinase IIIb (PI4KIIIb) that is recruited by 3A to the replication complex [28 ] . The resistance mutations in 3A render the virus independent of PI4KIIIb for replication. Whereas the viral polymerase has proven to be an excellent target for inhibition of viral replication of a number of viruses (including for HIV and HCV), selective inhibitors of the enterovirus polymerase were so far not reported. We recently discovered a class of non-nucleosides with broad-spectrum anti-entero/anti-rhinovirus activity that target the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase by competing with the template primer (van der Linden et al., submitted for publication).","The etiology of kidney disease involvement in COVID-19 patients is likely to be multifactorial. First, the novel coronavirus may exert direct cytopathic effects on kidney tissue. This is supported by the detection of PCR fragments of coronavirus in blood and urine in 2003 SARS 18 and COVID-19 patients. 4 Recently, it has been shown that the novel coronavirus uses angiotensin converting enzyme 2(ACE2) as a cell entry receptor, which is identical to that of the SARS-CoV as reported in 2003. 19 Recent human tissue RNA-seq data demonstrated thatACE2 expression in urinary organs (kidney) was nearly 100-fold higher than in respiratory organs (lung). 20 Therefore, the kidney disease may be caused by coronavirus entering kidney cells through an ACE2 dependent pathway. Second, deposition of immune complexes of viral antigen or virus-induced specific immunological effector mechanisms (specific T lymphocyte or antibody) may damage the kidney. However, kidney microscopy specimens from SARS patients were reported to show a normal glomerular aspect and absence of electron-dense deposits. 5 This is not in support of an active immune-mediated glomerulonephritis. Clearly, potential pathological kidney changes in COVID-19 patients require further study. Third, virus-induced cytokines or mediators might exert indirect effects on renal tissue, such as hypoxia, shock, and rhabdomyolysis. In fact, some of the 2009 H1N1 patients had mild to moderate elevations of serum creatine kinase. 21 In keeping with this observation, 138 patients with COVID-19 disease, who were admitted in ICU, showed a tendency towards increased creatine kinase levels, 13 and the patients with kidney involvement in our study tended to have increased creatine kinase levels as well.","In general, studies aiming at better understanding antibody-dependent enhancement of viral infections are focusing on either identifying the (immune) receptor(s) and/or serum component(s) allowing penetration of the pathogen into the target cell, also known as extrinsic ADE, or the outcome response(s) of the target cell downstream to ADE of infection \u2013 or intrinsic ADE [20,21,28]. Our previous results demonstrated that only Fc\u03b3RIIA and, to a lesser extent, Fc\u03b3RIIB1 triggered infection by SARS-CoVpp in presence of anti-Spike serum [16]. Although it would have been desirable to perform Fc\u03b3R blocking experiments also in macrophages, co-expression of all Fc\u03b3Rs in these cells [29,30] would cause blocking antibodies to bind not only to the targeted Fc\u03b3R via their Fab portions, but also to other Fc\u03b3R via their Fc portion making both Fc\u03b3Rs unavailable for interaction with opsonized pseudoparticles and, consequently, would prevent unambiguous interpretation of the results. We therefore investigated the molecular/signaling requirement underlying Fc\u03b3RII-mediated infection by SARS-CoV and assessed the relative contribution of the extracellular versus the transmembrane and intracellular domains of the Fc\u03b3 receptor II family members in mediating ADE of infection. The extracellular IgG-binding domains of human Fc\u03b3RIIA and Fc\u03b3RIIB are closely related, with 78% of homology at the amino acid level. Nonetheless, these 2 receptors have distinct abilities and affinities for the binding of immunoglobulins [31]. Moreover, Fc\u03b3RIIA carries an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM) whereas Fc\u03b3RIIB carries an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif (ITIM), which confer IgG receptors different effector properties [29,30,32]. Altogether, our results demonstrate that binding of SARS-CoVpp to cells via the extracellular domain of Fc\u03b3Rs is not sufficient to trigger ADE of infection as entry requires an intact intracellular domain. Indeed, in spite of roughly similar expression level at the cell surface compared to wild type Fc\u03b3RII, all mutated Fc\u03b3RII receptors having truncation of their intracellular domain (Fc\u03b3RII\u0394IC) became unable to trigger ADE of infection while retaining significant level of ligand-bind ability. The results obtained with chimeric constructions where the whole intracellular domain of Fc\u03b3RIIA and Fc\u03b3RIIB were swapped lend further support to this interpretation. Of note, the transmembrane and intracellular domains appeared to impart susceptibility to infection of their parental Fc\u03b3RII. Thus, wild-type Fc\u03b3RIIA elicited greater ADE than Fc\u03b3RIIB and grafting the cytoplasmic portion of Fc\u03b3RIIB reduced susceptibility to ADE of the chimeras with an extracellular Fc\u03b3RIIA domain to levels comparable to those observed for the Fc\u03b3RIIA truncated mutants.","We suggest maintaining the enhancement in both populational level public health control as well as the individual level self-protection actions in combating the COVID-19 outbreak. With detailed information on public intervention, the analytical framework in this study can be extended to a complex context and used for evaluating the effects of certain control measures. is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.","The recommended approach to colds is to use individual remedies to treat specific symptoms. Nasal sprays containing decongestants should be used for no more than 3 days, to avoid a rebound vasomotor rhinitis. Cough syrups containing expectorants are of unproven value in common colds. Symptoms of sneezing and rhinorrhea can be alleviated with nonselective antihistamines such as brompheniramine, chlorpheniramine, or clemastine fumarate, 1 but treatment with selective H 1 inhibitors is not effective. Studies of pseudoephedrine have demonstrated measurable improvements in nasal air flow consistent with a decongestant effect. 2 Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as naproxen moderate the systemic symptoms of rhinovirus infection. However, the use of the decongestant phenylpropanolamine has been shown to be associated with an increased risk of hemorrhagic stroke. 3 Topical application of ipratropium, a quaternary anticholinergic agent that is minimally absorbed across biologic membranes, reduces rhinorrhea significantly in naturally occurring colds. This agent probably exerts its major effect on the parasympathetic regulation of mucous and seromucous glands. Importantly, most over-the-counter cough and cold remedies have not been studied in pediatric populations, where they may be associated with significant side effects. 4 ","Previously, older age has been reported as an important independent predictor of mortality in SARS and MERS. 14, 15 The current study confirmed that increased age was associated with death in patients with COVID-19. Previous studies in macaques inoculated with SARS-CoV found that older macaques had stronger host innate responses to virus infection than younger adults, with an increase in differential expression of genes associated with inflammation, whereas expression of type I interferon beta was reduced. 16 The age-dependent defects in T-cell and B-cell function and the excess production of type 2 cytokines could lead to a deficiency in control of viral replication and more prolonged proinflammatory responses, potentially leading to poor outcome. 17 SOFA score is a good diagnostic marker for sepsis and septic shock, and reflects the state and degree of multi-organ dysfunction. 18, 19 Although bacterial infections are usually regarded as a leading cause of sepsis, viral infection can also cause sepsis syndrome. Previously, we determined that sepsis occurred in nearly 40% of adults with community-acquired pneumonia due to viral infection. 20 In the current study, we found that more than half of patients developed sepsis. Additionally, we found that more than 70% of patients had white blood cell count below 10\u00b70 \u00d7 10\u2079 per L or procalcitonin below 0\u00b725 ng/mL, and no bacterial pathogens were detected in these patients on admission. Sepsis was a common complication, which might be directly caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection, but further research is needed to investigate the pathogenesis of sepsis in COVID-19 illness.","Another rare risk worth mentioning during CP therapy is antibody-dependent infection enhancement, occurring at sub-neutralizing concentrations, which could suppress innate antiviral systems and thus could allow logarithmic intracellular growth of the virus (28). The special immune enhancement was reportedly more common in Dengue fever, but also could be found in SARS-","TGEV infected swine testicular (ST) cells constitute a surrogate system for the search and study of potential anti-coronavirus agents11, 12, 17. Herein, we report: (1) tylophorine-based compounds exert potent anti-TGEV replication by directly targeting the viral RNA/ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex for viral replication/synthesis; (2) NF-\u03baB inhibition also leads to anti-TGEV replication; (3) A combination treatment consisting of both a tylophorine compound and an NF-\u03baB inhibitor acts additively or synergically to more effectively and comprehensively inhibit TGEV replication than either (1) or (2) alone.","The possibility that immune response to pathogens may have also deleterious effects on the host homeostasis has been the focus of several studies. For example, the hyper-induction of cytokines following avian influenza infection has been implicated in the severity of the disease [23] and infection of cells by ADE has been known to occur for several viral diseases [20,21]. Here we demonstrate that anti-Spike antibody potentiates infection of human primary immune cells by SARS-CoVpp and replication-competent SARS-coronavirus.","amyloidosis Deposition of amyloid. A common complication of several diseases (leprosy, tuberculosis); often associated with perturbation of the immune system, although there may be immunosuppression or enhancement.

The main feature of COVID-19 is characterized by mild upper respiratory tract infection with fever, cough, and typical changes in radiographic studies; lower respiratory tract infection involving non-life threatening https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jri.2020.103122 Received 21 February 2020; Received in revised form 12 March 2020; Accepted 16 March 2020 pneumonia, and life-threatening pneumonia with acute respiratory distress syndrome (Heymann et al., 2020; Guan et al., 2020) . Genetic analysis of 103 SARS-CoV-2 genomes showed that there were two major types (designated L and S), which were well defined by two different single nucleotide polymorphisms. The S type was found to be ancestral version, however, the L type (\u223c70 %) is more aggressive and spreads more quickly than the S type (\u223c30 %) (Tang et al., 2020) . The amino acid sequences of SARS-CoV-2 share 68 % similarity with those of SARS-CoV, to which the response of viral infection by type I IFN is suppressed and therefore viruses rapidly replicate and induce excessive inflammatory response (Prompetchara et al., 2020) . Moreover, there was significant discrepancy of serious cases and deaths happened between the areas within Hubei Province and the rest of the world, which may be possibly explained by antibody dependent enhancement (ADE) of SARS-CoV-2 due to prior exposure to similar antigenic epitopes with other coronaviruses. ADE can cause sustained inflammation, lymphopenia, and cytokine storm, and one or all of which happened in the reported severe cases and deaths (Tetro, 2020) . Although SARS-CoV-2 has some similarities with other coronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2 is more contagious than other viruses among populations, which has caused more than 60,000 people infected worldwide within 2 months (Lu et al., 2020) . More importantly, there is no effective targeted treatment for the virus, and a persistent infection may involve stages of both silent and productive infection of the host cells (Boldogh et al., 1996) . Therefore, COVID-19 infection is a great challenge to the immune system.","The naproxen-induced model provides a useful system to study anti-ulcer drugs. Misoprostol, a prostaglandin analog, when administered in conjunction with naproxen, results in a significant reduction in number and size of gastric ulcers without modifying gastric acid secretion (Fitzpatrick et al., 1999) . This same protection is noted in humans (Dajani and Agrawal, 1995) . Famotidine, an H 2 -receptor antagonist that inhibits stomach acid production, does not reduce the prevalence or number of gastric ulcers in the hamster (Fitzpatrick et al., 1999) . Similarly, H 2 -receptor antagonists do not consistently reduce NSAID-induced gastric ulceration in humans (Dajani and Agrawal, 1995) . These results suggest that gastric acid secretion is not the primary mechanism of naproxen-induced ulceration in hamsters or humans and that the naproxen hamster model accurately models NSAID-induced antral ulceration in humans (Fitzpatrick et al., 1999) .","To create a chronic NSAID-induced gastropathy model in hamsters which more closely mimics the disease process in humans, naproxen can be administered twice daily by oral gavage (Fitzpatrick et al., 1999) . Gastric ulceration occurs almost exclusively in the antrum and increases in size as a function of dose and time for the first 3 days of naproxen treatment. At a dose of 80 mg/kg given twice a day, naproxen can be used for chronic anti-ulcer drug studies with a low (\ue02c5%) mortality rate (Fitzpatrick et al., 1999) . Gastric ulcer area decreases in naproxen-treated hamsters by the fourth day of administration, suggesting adaptation of the gastric mucosa. The process of adaptation involves stimulation of gastric mucosal healing and the creation of a gastric mucosa that is more resistant to future injurious agents (Levi and Shaw-Smith, 1994) .","Drug use \u25a0 Systemic corticosteroids may raise the blood pressure and antihypertensive treatment may have to be adjusted accordingly \u25a0 Some non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (indometacin, ibuprofen and naproxen) can reduce the efficacy of antihypertensive agents \u25a0 Patients administered aspirin to prevent thrombosis may have a bleeding tendency. ","The guidance to COVID-19 control might be based on existing measures for MERS and SARS, with some further precautions due to the unknown nature of this new CoV.14,73 The main treatments such as mechanical ventilation, ICU admission, and symptomatic and supportive care are recommended for severe cases. Furthermore, RNA synthesis inhibitors (like 3TC, TDF), remdesivir, neuraminidase inhibitors, peptide (EK1), anti-inflammatory drugs, abidol, Chinese traditional medicine, such as Lianhuaqingwen and ShuFengJieDu Capsules, could be the promising COVID-19 treatments.2 However, further clinical trials are required for confirming safety and efficacy for COVID-19. A major limiting factor in the quest for identifying an ideal vaccine or therapeutic agent is time. It may take months to even several years for researchers to develop, produce, standardize, evaluate, approve, and commercialize therapeutic agents for COVID-19. Hence, current efforts should be directed toward identifying and evaluating drugs and immunotherapeutics that have proven efficacy against viruses similar to COVID-19.","We recently published a case series of typically commensal Neisseria spp. disease among eculizumab recipients. 1 Eculizumab is a terminal complement inhibitor indicated for treatment of paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome, and certain patients with generalized myasthenia gravis or neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder. 2 Due to complement inhibition, many different Neisseria spp. can cause invasive disease in eculizumab recipients 1 , 3 , 4 and eculizumab recipients are at an estimated 20 0 0-fold increased risk of meningococcal disease (caused by Neisseria meningitidis ). All eculizumab recipients should receive meningococcal vaccinations prior to therapy; however, eculizumab recipients may develop meningococcal disease or other Neisseria infections despite vaccine receipt. [4] [5] [6] For patients who cannot receive meningococcal vaccinations \u22652 weeks before starting eculizumab, U.S. eculizumab labeling recommends 2 weeks of antibiotic prophylaxis. 2 In July 2017, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) advised that prescribers could consider antibiotic prophylaxis in eculizumab recipients for the duration of eculizumab therapy. 4 There are no published studies evaluating the efficacy or safety of antibiotic prophylaxis in eculizumab recipients. Here, we report on potential risks and benefits of antibiotic prophylaxis for the prevention of meningococcal disease in a case series of vaccinated eculizumab recipients who developed meningococcal disease.","We recently published a case series of typically commensal Neisseria spp. disease among eculizumab recipients. 1 Eculizumab is a terminal complement inhibitor indicated for treatment of paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome, and certain patients with generalized myasthenia gravis or neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder. 2 Due to complement inhibition, many different Neisseria spp. can cause invasive disease in eculizumab recipients 1 , 3 , 4 and eculizumab recipients are at an estimated 20 0 0-fold increased risk of meningococcal disease (caused by Neisseria meningitidis ).
