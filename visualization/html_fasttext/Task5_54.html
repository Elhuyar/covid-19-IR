Study design All pregnant women (12) who presented with SARS in Hong Kong between February 1 and July 31, 2003, were included. The pregnancy and perinatal outcomes were collected. Evidence of perinatal transmission of virus was assessed with the SARS-associated coronavirus reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction on cord blood, placenta tissue, and subsequent follow-up of the neonate on serology. Results Three deaths occurred among the 12 patients, giving a case fatality rate of 25%. Four of the 7 patients (57%) who presented in the first trimester had spontaneous miscarriage. Four of the 5 patients who presented after 24 weeks were delivered preterm. Two mothers recovered without delivery, but their ongoing pregnancies were complicated by intrauterine growth restriction. No newborn infant had clinical SARS and all investi...","The 2019-nCov will not be the last epidemic to challenge public health experts. The growth of AI-driven techniques to identify epidemiologic risks early will be key to our improvement of prediction, prevention, and detection of future global health risks. The devastating situation in Wuhan, China and future epidemics will also find value in ongoing research in 2019-nCov case detection, spread prediction, treatment effectiveness, and containment. The wide variety, velocity, and veracity of data now available in crises yield data sets that many researchers will now need to incorporate into evermore complex models. This requires expansion of talent within AI for healthcare applications. AI is no longer a niche research area nor is it a tool for the most advanced healthcare systems only, its global impact on healthcare is real and its potential to save lives in this epidemic as well as future epidemics should not be underestimated. It is critical to the global health of all humankind for t...","In the wake of COVID-19 disease, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, we designed and developed a predictive model based on Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning algorithms to determine the health risk and predict the mortality risk of patients with COVID-19. In this study, we used documented data of 117,000 patients world-wide with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19. This study proposes an AI model to help hospitals and medical facilities decide who needs to get attention first, who has higher priority to be hospitalized, triage patients when the system is overwhelmed by overcrowding, and eliminate delays in providing the necessary care. The results demonstrate 93% overall accuracy in predicting the mortality rate. We used several machine learning algorithms including Support Vector Machine (SVM), Artificial Neural Networks, Random Forest, Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, and K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) to predict the mortality rate in patients with COVID-19. In this study, the most...","The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak, which was identified in late 2019, requires special attention because of its future epidemics and possible global threats. Beside clinical procedures and treatments, since Artificial Intelligence (AI) promises a new paradigm for healthcare, several different AI tools that are built upon Machine Learning (ML) algorithms are employed for analyzing data and decision-making processes. This means that AI-driven tools help identify COVID-19 outbreaks as well as forecast their nature of spread across the globe. However, unlike other healthcare issues, for COVID-19, to detect COVID-19, AI-driven tools are expected to have active learning-based cross-population train/test models that employs multitudinal and multimodal data, which is the primary purpose of the paper.","Background With evidence of sustained transmission in more than 190 countries, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been declared a global pandemic. As such, data are urgently needed about risk factors associated with clinical outcomes. Methods A retrospective chart review of 323 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in Wuhan was conducted. Patients were classified into three disease severity groups (non-severe, severe, and critical), based on their initial clinical presentation. Clinical outcomes were designated as favorable and unfavorable, based on disease progression and response to treatments. Logistic regression models were performed to identify factors associated with clinical outcomes, and logrank test was conducted for the association with clinical progression. Results Current standard treatments did not show significant improvement on patient outcomes in the study. By univariate logistic regression model, 27 risk factors were significantly associated with clinical outcomes. ...","In the setting of emerging infections, such as COVID-19, this commentary argues that all members of the health care team need training on how to integrate key epidemiologic information, such as travel history, into their risk assessments in the same way they are trained to ask about tobacco exposure to assess cancer and heart disease risk.","","","Summary The causative agent of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), which affected over 8000 individuals worldwide and was responsible for over 700 deaths in the 2002\u20132003 outbreak, is a coronavirus that was unknown before the outbreak. Although many different treatments were used during the outbreak, none were implemented in a controlled fashion. Thus, the optimal treatment for SARS is unknown. Since the outbreak, much work has been done testing new agents against SARS using in-vitro methods and animal models. In addition, global research efforts have focused on the development of vaccines against SARS. Efforts should be made to evaluate the most promising treatments and vaccines in controlled clinical trials, should another SARS outbreak occur.","Fifteen years ago, United Nations world leaders defined millenium development goal 4 (MDG 4): to reduce under-5-year mortality rates by two-thirds by the year 2015. Unfortunately, only 27 of 138 developing countries are expected to achieve MDG 4. The majority of childhood deaths in these settings result from reversible causes, and developing effective pediatric emergency and critical care services could substantially reduce this mortality. The Ebola outbreak highlighted the fragility of health care systems in resource-limited settings and emphasized the urgent need for a paradigm shift in the global approach to healthcare delivery related to critical illness. This review provides an overview of pediatric critical care in resource-limited settings and outlines strategies to address challenges specific to these areas. Implementation of these tools has the potential to move us toward delivery of an adequate standard of critical care for all children globally, and ultimately decrease globa...","The sudden outbreak of novel coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) increased the diagnostic burden of radiologists. In the time of an epidemic crisis, we hoped artificial intelligence (AI) to help reduce physician workload in regions with the outbreak, and improve the diagnosis accuracy for physicians before they could acquire enough experience with the new disease. Here, we present our experience in building and deploying an AI system that automatically analyzes CT images to detect COVID-19 pneumonia features. Different from conventional medical AI, we were dealing with an epidemic crisis. Working in an interdisciplinary team of over 30 people with medical and / or AI background, geographically distributed in Beijing and Wuhan, we were able to overcome a series of challenges in this particular situation and deploy the system in four weeks. Using 1,136 training cases (723 positives for COVID-19) from five hospitals, we were able to achieve a sensitivity of 0.974 and specificity of 0.922 on the t...","Social distancing is an effective way to contain the spread of a contagious disease, particularly when pharmacological interventions are not available. Conventional wisdom suggests that social distancing measures should be introduced as soon as possible after the beginning of an outbreak. Using a simple epidemiological model we show, however, that there is in fact an optimal time to initiate a temporal social distancing intervention if the goal is to reduce the final epidemic size or flatten the epidemic curve. The optimal timing depends strongly on the effective reproduction number (R0) of the disease, such that as the R0 increases, the optimal time decreases non-linearly. Additionally, if pharmacological interventions (e.g., a vaccine) become available at some point during the epidemic, the sooner these interventions become available the sooner social distancing should be initiated to maximize its effectiveness. Although based on a simple model, we hope that these insights inspire fu...","Abstract The aim is to diagnose COVID-19 earlier and to improve its treatment by applying medical technology, the \u201cCOVID-19 Intelligent Diagnosis and Treatment Assistant Program (nCapp)\u201d based on the Internet of Things. Terminal eight functions can be implemented in real-time online communication with the \u201ccloud\u201d through the page selection key. According to existing data, questionnaires, and check results, the diagnosis is automatically generated as confirmed, suspected, or suspicious of 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection. It classifies patients into mild, moderate, severe or critical pneumonia. nCapp can also establish an online COVID-19 real-time update database, and it updates the model of diagnosis in real time based on the latest real-world case data to improve diagnostic accuracy. Additionally, nCapp can guide treatment. Front-line physicians, experts, and managers are linked to perform consultation and prevention. nCapp also contributes to the long-term follow-up of pa...","Objective:To analyse the clinical features of COVID\u221219 parturients, and to compare anaesthetic regimen and clinical outcomes in parturients with or without COVID\u221219 undergoing cesarean delivery.Methods: Data were extracted from the electronic medical record of 3 medical institutions in Hubei Province, China, from June 1, 2019 to March 20, 2020 according to inclusion and exclusion criteria. After propensity score matching with demographics, the clinical and laboratory characteristics of parturients with or without COVID\u221219 were analysed. The anaesthetic regimen and clinical outcomes of themselves and their infants were compared in these two groups of parturients. Results: A total of 1,588 patients without SARS\u2212CoV\u22122 infection undergoing cesarean delivery were retrospectively included. After achieving a balanced cohort through propensity score matching, 89 patients (COVID\u221219 group), who were diagnosed with COVID\u221219 by SARS\u2212CoV\u22122 nucleic acid test and CT scan matched with 173 patients wit...","","","Abstract An enhanced polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay to detect the coronavirus associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV) was developed in which a target gene pre-amplification step preceded TaqMan real-time fluorescent PCR. Clinical samples were collected from 120 patients diagnosed as suspected or probable SARS cases and analyzed by conventional PCR followed by agarose gel electrophoresis, conventional TaqMan real-time PCR, and our enhanced TaqMan real-time PCR assays. An amplicon of the size expected from SARS-CoV was obtained from 28/120 samples using the enhanced real-time PCR method. Conventional PCR and real-time PCR alone identified fewer SARS-CoV positive cases. Results were confirmed by viral culture in 3/28 cases. The limit of detection of the enhanced real-time PCR method was 102-fold higher than the standard real-time PCR assay and 107-fold higher than conventional PCR methods. The increased sensitivity of the assay may help control the spread of th...","Approximately 20% of patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) develop respiratory failure that requires admission to an intensive care unit (ICU). Old age, comorbidity, and elevated lactate dehydrogenase on hospital admission are associated with increased risk for ICU admission. ICU admission usually is late and occurs 8 to 10 days after symptom onset. Acute respiratory distress syndrome occurs in almost all admitted patients and most require mechanical ventilation. ICU admission is associated with significant morbidity, particularly an apparent increase in the incidence of barotrauma and nosocomial sepsis. Long-term mortality for patients admitted to the ICU ranges from 30% to 50%. Many procedures in ICUs pose a high risk for transmission of SARS coronavirus to health care workers. Contact and airborne infection isolation precautions, in addition to standard precautions, should be applied when caring for patients with SARS. Ensuring staff safety is important to maintain ...","","","Public health professionals are considering how molecular medicine applications can impact on preventive medicine and health provision enabling interventions to start earlier. There is the potential for molecular medicine to improve the workplace although inappropriate use will lead to discrimination. The public health issue of communicable diseases is being addressed through molecular medicine in more effective and early detection and a better understanding of pathogenesis. A threat from emerging and re-emerging infections requires multiple approaches but early and definitive detection will need nucleic acid based approaches. The non-communicable diseases are now a global world problem, particularly obesity. While molecular medicine is still to make a significant impact on this disorder some interesting findings are emerging about the role of genes in obesity. Ultimately, global health issues must include more efficient and environmentally sustainable strategies. Molecular technologie...","Abstract Background Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) is a major infectious disease which has affected the Middle Eastern countries, especially the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) since 2012. The high mortality rate associated with this disease has been a major cause of concern. This paper aims at identifying the major factors influencing MERS recovery in KSA. Methods The data used for analysis was collected from the Ministry of Health website, KSA. The important factors impelling the recovery are found using machine learning. Machine learning models such as support vector machine, conditional inference tree, na\u00efve Bayes and J48 are modelled to identify the important factors. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis is also carried out to identify the significant factors statistically. Result The main factors influencing MERS recovery rate are identified as age, pre-existing diseases, severity of disease and whether the patient is a healthcare worker or not. In spit...","Abstract The pandemic of new coronavirus disease COVID-19 is threatening our health, economy and life style. Collaborations across countries and sectors as a One Health World could be a milestone. We propose a general protocol, for setting timely active random surveillance of COVID-19, at the human community level, with systematic repeated detection efforts. Strengths and limitations are discussed. If considered applicable by public health, the protocol could evaluate the status of COVID-19 epidemics consistently and objectively.","Background The ongoing epidemics of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have caused serious concerns about its potential adverse effects on pregnancy. There are limited data on maternal and neonatal outcomes of pregnant women with COVID-19 pneumonia. Methods We conducted a case-control study to compare clinical characteristics, maternal and neonatal outcomes of pregnant women with and without COVID-19 pneumonia. Results During January 24 to February 29, 2020, there were sixteen pregnant women with confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia and eighteen suspected cases who were admitted to labor in the third trimester. Two had vaginal delivery and the rest took cesarean section. Few patients presented respiratory symptoms (fever and cough) on admission, but most had typical chest CT images of COVID-19 pneumonia. Compared to the controls, COVID-19 pneumonia patients had lower counts of white blood cells (WBC), neutrophils, C-reactive protein (CRP), and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) on admission. Incr...","The number of confirmed COVID-19 cases admitted in hospitals is continuously increasing in the Philippines. Frontline health care workers are faced with imminent risks of getting infected. In this study, we formulate a theoretical model to calculate the risk of being infected in health care facilities considering the following factors: the average number of encounters with a suspected COVID-19 patient per hour; interaction time for each encounter; work shift duration or exposure time; crowd density, which may depend on the amount of space available in a given location; and availability and effectiveness of protective gears and facilities provided for the frontline health care workers. Based on the simulation results, we recommend the following: (i) decrease the rate of patient encounter per frontline health care worker, e.g., maximum of three encounters per hour in a 12-hour work shift duration; (ii) decrease the interaction time between the frontline health care worker and the patient...","The Syrian hamster (Mesocricetus auratus) possesses a variety of unique features which make them desirable research models. Despite these features, experimental use of the hamster has declined over the past 20\u201330 years. The current chapter will focus on research and literature describing the experimental use of the hamster with a particular emphasis on research done since the previous edition of this text (1987\u2013present).","These first UK cases of COVID-19 raise important points about the management of cases of HCID in England. The decision to test for SARS-CoV-2 is based on a clinical and epidemiological case definition, and testing is only approved if this is met. When tested, neither of these people clearly met the current case definition, and had criteria been strictly applied, testing might not have been done. A decision to test was made because of high clinical suspicion and in response to latest available information about the distribution of infection. It is important that testing is appropriately targeted, and this is best done by applying clear case definitions. However, with any newly emerging infection, case definitions must evolve rapidly as information accrues. There should also be room for flexibility on the basis of discussion with clinical and public health experts","The independent risk factors to predict mortality of critical severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) were investigated. One hundred and two patients diagnosed with critical SARS were admitted to hospitals of Shanxi Province, from March 7, 2003 to June 4, 2003. The patients were prospectively studied after admission to access their short term outcomes and the risk factors associated with adverse outcomes, defined as death. All the demographic and clinical characteristics were studied and univariate and multivariate Logistic regression were employed to access the risk factors. The results showed that of the 102 cases, 23 patients died, with a crude mortality rate of 22.5%. Multivariate Logistic regression revealed that age above 50 [odds ratio (OR) 1. 10, 95% confidence internal (CI) 1.03 to 1.16,P=0.004], lymphopenia at early stage (OR 14.62, 95% CI 1.78 to 11.97,P=0.01) were independently associated with mortality. On the other side, psychotherapy (OR 0.01, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.06,P&lt;0.00...","Abstract Background: A novel coronavirus was recently identified as the aetiological agent of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). Molecular assays currently available for detection of SARS-coronavirus (SARS-Cov) have low sensitivity during the early stage of the illness. Objective: To develop and evaluate a sensitive diagnostic test for SARS by optimizing the viral RNA extraction methods and by applying real-time quantitative RT-PCR technology. Study design: 50 nasopharyngeal aspirate (NPA) samples collected from days 1\u20133 of disease onset from SARS patients in whom SARS CoV infections was subsequently serologically confirmed and 30 negative control samples were studied. Samples were tested by: (1) our first generation conventional RT-PCR assay with a routine RNA extraction method (Lancet 361 (2003) 1319), (2) our first generation conventional RT-PCR assay with a modified RNA extraction method, (3) a real-time quantitative RT-PCR assay with a modified RNA extraction method. Result...","Introduction: Madrid Covid-19 disease outbreak started on 28 February 2020 and since then it became the main Covid-19 disease cluster in Spain. On 26 March 2020, a total of 17166 cases were already reported, with 2090 deaths. Globally a R0 index of 2-3 has been reported. We aimed to build an experimental mathematical model that help to analyze the early characteristics of Madrid Covid-19 disese outbreak and to explore the actual R0 index on Madrid Covid-19 outbreak. Material and Methods: A simulated mathematical model was built, based on a SIR epidemiological model and the reported characteristics of Wuhan Covid-19 disease outbreak. Monte Carlo simulations were further done to estimate the R0 value over time in the Madrid Covid-19 disease outbreak. Results: Mean estimated R0 value along the early period is of 2.22 (+/- 1.21 SD). A significant increase of 0.093 (+/- 0.037, p=0.025) in R0 value each day of outbreak is found. Conclussions: Our proposed Mathematical Simulation model may be...","INTRODUCTION: There is little research on emergency care delivery in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). To facilitate future research, we aimed to assess the set of key metrics currently used by researchers in these settings and to propose a set of standard metrics to facilitate future research. METHODS: Systematic literature review of 43,109 published reports on general emergency care from 139 LMICs. Studies describing care for subsets of emergency conditions, subsets of populations, and data aggregated across multiple facilities were excluded. All facility- and patient-level statistics reported in these studies were recorded and the most commonly used metrics were identified. RESULTS: We identified 195 studies on emergency care delivery in LMICs. There was little uniformity in either patient- or facility-level metrics reported. Patient demographics were inconsistently reported: only 33% noted average age and 63% the gender breakdown. The upper age boundary used for paediatric ...","Early detection of COVID-19 based on chest CT will enable timely treatment of patients and help control the spread of the disease. With rapid spreading of COVID-19 in many countries, however, CT volumes of suspicious patients are increasing at a speed much faster than the availability of human experts. Here, we propose an artificial intelligence (AI) system for fast COVID-19 diagnosis with an accuracy comparable to experienced radiologists. A large dataset was constructed by collecting 970 CT volumes of 496 patients with confirmed COVID-19 and 260 negative cases from three hospitals in Wuhan, China, and 1,125 negative cases from two publicly available chest CT datasets. Trained using only 312 cases, our diagnosis system, which is based on deep convolutional neural network, is able to achieve an accuracy of 94.98%, an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 97.91%, a sensitivity of 94.06%, and a specificity of 95.47% on an independent external verification datase...","Background Traditional infection control policies have focused on engineering controls, specific protocols, and personal protective equipment (PPE). In light of the variable success in protecting health care workers (HCWs) from Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2003, organizational and individual factors related to self-protective behavior in health care settings may also play an important role. Methods A critical review of the literature was conducted, directed at understanding what organizational and individual factors are important in protecting HCWs from infectious diseases at work. Results Organizational factors, such as a positive safety climate, have been associated with increased HCW adherence to universal precautions. There is some evidence that appropriate training of HCWs could be effective in changing HCW behavior if appropriate follow-up is applied. Very little research into these factors has been conducted with regard to preventing exposures to respiratory tract...","Summary A systematic survey was carried on stools from 130 children suffering of acute gastroenteritis. Electron microscopy, enzymo-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and counter electrophoresis were employed. This survey allowed to the detection by electron microscopy of Rotavirus (40 cases), Coronaviruses (3 cases), Astroviruses (2 cases), Adenoviruses (2 cases) and Small Round Viruses (1 case). Serological tests (complement fixation, ELISA and counter electrophoresis) done with 86 sera showed a good correlation with results obtained with electron microscopy.","The SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) novel coronavirus represents a significant health risk, particularly in older patients. Cancer is one of the leading causes of death in most rich countries, and delivering chemotherapy may be associated with increased risk in the presence of a pandemic infection. Estimating this risk is crucial in making decisions about balancing risks and benefits from administering chemotherapy. However, there are no specific data about chemotherapy risks per se. Here we develop a simple model to estimate the potential harms in patients undergoing chemotherapy during a COVID outbreak. We use age-related case fatality rates as a basis for estimating risk, and use previous data from risk of death during influenza outbreaks to estimate the additional risk associated with chemotherapy. We use data from randomised trials to estimate benefit across a range of curative and palliative settings, and address the balance of benefit against the risk of harm. We then use those data to es...","Doubling Time (DT) is typically calculated for growth curves that show exponential growth, such as the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases day by day. DT represents the time it takes before the number of COVID-19 cases, in a certain country or area, doubles. Throughout the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak, DT values are continually changing. These changes are influenced by the measures that are recommended by the health authorities and implemented by governments. After the governmental shutdowns of Nordic Countries that were announced around the 12th of March 2020, I followed the development of the DT in the region. Governments put in place measure never before experienced during peace time; home working, closed schools and kindergartens, travel bans and social distancing. But does it work? The initial set of results following the shutdown are encouraging, demonstrating a trend towards slower growth; however, this could be reversed if the measures that are in place now are abandoned too early...","Background: In December 2019, an outbreak of novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) emerged in Wuhan, China and has swiftly spread to other parts of China and a number of oversea countries. Our aim is to evaluate the effectiveness of the evolution of interventions and self-protection measures, estimate the risk of partial lifting control measures and predict the epidemic trend of the virus in mainland China excluding Hubei province based on the published data and a novel mathematical model. Methods: A novel COVID-19 transmission dynamic model incorporating the intervention measures implemented in China is proposed. We parameterize the model by using the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method and estimate the control reproduction number Rc, as well as the effective daily reproduction ratio Re(t), of the disease transmission in mainland China excluding Hubei province. Results: The estimation outcomes indicate that the control reproduction number is 3.36 (95% CI 3.20-3.64) and Re(t) has dro...","Purpose: The COVID-19 death-rate in Italy continues to climb, surpassing that in every other country. We implement one of the first nationally representative surveys about this unprecedented public health crisis and use it to evaluate the Italian government's public health efforts and citizen responses. Findings: (1) Public health messaging is being heard. At this point, the Italian people understand how to keep themselves and others safe from the SARS-Cov-2 virus. This is true for all population groups we studied, with the partial exception of slightly lower compliance among young adults. Remarkably, even those who do not trust the government, and those who think the government has been untruthful about the crisis mostly believe the public health message and claim to be acting in accordance. (2) The quarantine is beginning to have serious negative effects on the population's mental health. Policy Recommendations: Public health messaging is being heard and understood. The focus now sho...","Background: On 12 March, the World Health Organization Director-General declared that \"the threat of a global pandemic has become a reality\", and the disease caused by the novel coronavirus, known as COVID-19, has become a global concern. Chinese efforts in curbing the virus have widely been recognized. Even the WHO has lauded the efforts of the Chinese government and advised the world to learn from China in fighting the disease. Since the outbreak of COVID-19, to curb the spread of the epidemic, the Chinese government has implemented unprecedented prevention interventions at the nationwide level. Currently, the outbreak in Wuhan is changing in a positive direction and has been effectively controlled. However, it is not clear what these measures were and how these measures changed to curb the outbreak of COVID-19 quickly. This study explored the characteristics and identified that China's control strategies have changed the epidemiological curve of rapidly rising new confirmed cases of...","AbstractThe focused drug repurposing of known approved drugs (such as lopinavir/ritonavir) has been reported failed for curing SARS-CoV-2 infected patients. It is urgent to generate new chemical entities against this virus. As a key enzyme in the life-cycle of coronavirus, the 3C-like main protease (3CLpro or Mpro) is the most attractive for antiviral drug design. Based on a recently solved structure (PDB ID: 6LU7), we developed a novel advanced deep Q-learning network with the fragment-based drug design (ADQN-FBDD) for generating potential lead compounds targeting SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro. We obtained a series of derivatives from those lead compounds by our structure-based optimization policy (SBOP). All the 47 lead compounds directly from our AI-model and related derivatives based on SBOP are accessible in our molecular library at https://github.com/tbwxmu/2019-nCov. These compounds can be used as potential candidates for researchers in their development of drugs against SARS-CoV-2.","Abstract Background: The protocols of WHO network laboratories facilitated development of rapid diagnosis for SARS coronavirus (CoV) using reverse transcription (RT)-PCR assays. However, several reports have shown that conventional and real-time PCR assays were very specific for SARS CoV but lack sensitivity depending on the assay, specimen, and time course of disease. Objective: To evaluate an automatic nucleic acid extraction system and two standardized real-time PCR assays for rapid diagnosis of SARS CoV during outbreak and post-epidemic periods in Hong Kong. Study design: Specimens from clinically suspected SARS patients collected during outbreak and post-epidemic periods were tested by an automatic nucleic acid extraction system followed by our first generation conventional RT-PCR and two standardized real-time PCR assays (Artus GmbH, Germany and Roche Diagnostics, Germany). Paired serum samples were assayed for increasing titer against SARS CoV. Results: In the SARS epidemic, Art...","As an atypical pneumonia began to appear in December 2019, Zhou et al . worked with remarkable speed to identify the associated virus, determine its relationship to animal viruses, and evaluate factors conferring infection susceptibility and resistance. These foundational results are being advanced to control the current worldwide human coronavirus epidemic.","The purpose of this article is to reach all those who find it difficult to become well informed about the repercussions of a lockdown strategy to tackle the COVID-19 pandemic and to spark discussion and thought. Here we use simple stochastic simulations to evaluate different approaches taken to tackle the crisis, along with the efficiency they will hold and the number of casualties they may incur. It is clear that the less strict the social distancing the more time it will take for life to return to normal, and the more lives will be at risk. This is shown through simulations formed by an open sourced code, which allows evaluation of the outcomes from different intervention scenarios or conditions.","We develop a health informatics toolbox that enables public health workers to timely analyze and evaluate the time-course dynamics of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) infection using the public available data from the China CDC. This toolbox is built upon a hierarchical epidemiological model in which two observed time series of daily proportions of infected and removed cases are emitted from the underlying infection dynamics governed by a Markov SIR infectious disease process. We extend the SIR model to incorporate various types of time-varying quarantine protocols, including government-level macro isolation policies and community-level micro inspection measures. We develop a calibration procedure for under-reported infected cases. This toolbox provides forecast, in both online and offline forms, of turning points of interest, including the time when daily infected proportion becomes smaller than the previous ones and the time when daily infected proportions becomes smaller than that o...","Early analysis of outbreaks of novel pathogens to evaluate their likely public health impact depends on fitting predictive models to data gathered and updated in real-time. Both transmission rates and the critical threshold (i.e. the pathogen's 'reproductive number') are inferred by finding the values that provide the best model fit to reported case incidence. These models and inferred results are then the basic tools used for public health planning: how many people expected to be infected, at what scales of time and space, and whether potential intervention strategies impact disease transmission and spread. An underlying assumption, however, is that the ability to observe new cases is either constant, or at least constant relative to diagnostic test availability. We present a demonstration, discussion, and mathematical analysis of how this assumption of predictable observability in disease incidence can drastically impact model accuracy. We also demonstrate how to tailor estimations o...","Background Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is a novel coronavirus that causes a severe respiratory disease with high case fatality rate. Starting in March 2014, a dramatic increase of cases has occurred in the Arabian Peninsula, many of which were acquired in health care settings. As of May 9, 2014, 536 laboratory-confirmed cases and 145 deaths have been reported globally. Methods Review of publicly available data about MERS-CoV health care\u2013associated transmission. Results We identified 11 events of possible or confirmed health care\u2013associated transmission with high morbidity and mortality, mainly among patients with comorbidities. Health care workers are also frequently affected; however, they tend to have milder symptoms and better prognosis. Gaps in infection control were noted in all events. Currently, health care\u2013associated outbreaks are playing a pivotal role in the evolution of the MERS-CoV epidemic in countries in the Arabian Peninsula. Conclusion There ...","Being aware and implementing the latest and best scientific evidence in infection control and health care epidemiology is critical to enhancing patient outcomes. In this review, the latest published scientific data in health care epidemiology and patient safety were reviewed for the period May 2003-May 2004. Medline reviews and reviews of infection control and infectious diseases journals were used for this period. The latest guidelines and publications on antimicrobial resistance, nursing or infection control professional staffing, West Nile virus, and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) are included. Awareness of these and other important infection control publications is essential if the latest measures are to be implemented to prevent and control health care-associated infections.","Virus like particles (VLPs) produced by the expression of viral structural proteins can serve as versatile nanovectors or potential vaccine candidates. In this study we describe for the first time the generation of HCoV-NL63 VLPs using baculovirus system. Major structural proteins of HCoV-NL63 have been expressed in tagged or native form, and their assembly to form VLPs was evaluated. Additionally, a novel procedure for chromatography purification of HCoV-NL63 VLPs was developed. Interestingly, we show that these nanoparticles may deliver cargo and selectively transduce cells expressing the ACE2 protein such as ciliated cells of the respiratory tract. Production of a specific delivery vector is a major challenge for research concerning targeting molecules. The obtained results show that HCoV-NL63 VLPs may be efficiently produced, purified, modified and serve as a delivery platform. This study constitutes an important basis for further development of a promising viral vector displaying ..."],"title":["Management Guidelines for Obstetric Patients and Neonates Born to Mothers With Suspected or Probable Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS)","No. 225-Management Guidelines for Obstetric Patients and Neonates Born to Mothers With Suspected or Probable Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS)","Pregnancy and perinatal outcomes of women with severe acute respiratory syndrome","The Role of Augmented Intelligence (AI) in Detecting and Preventing the Spread of Novel Coronavirus","Predicting Mortality Risk in Patients with COVID-19 Using Artificial Intelligence to Help Medical Decision-Making","AI-Driven Tools for Coronavirus Outbreak: Need of Active Learning and Cross-Population Train/Test Models on Multitudinal/Multimodal Data","Risk Factors Associated with Clinical Outcomes in 323 COVID-19 Patients in Wuhan, China","Managing Emerging Infectious Diseases: Should Travel Be the Fifth Vital Sign?","Should, and how can, exercise be done during a coronavirus outbreak?

In the last decade, substantial investments have been made in surveillance systems for early detection of natural infectious disease clusters and of intentional acts of bioterrorism. Previous studies demonstrate that surveillance is useful in detecting specified communicable diseases. Such systems include the sentinel provider system (USA) [12] , sentinel physician networks (European countries) [13] , influenza surveillance system (Japan) [14] , Australian sentinel practice research network (Australia) [15] , epidemiological surveillance networks (France) [16] , electronic point-of-sale (EPOS) pharmacy (England) [17] , infectious diseases surveillance system (Japan) [18] , ambulatory-care-based syndromic surveillance system (USA) [19] , real-time syndrome surveillance (Canada) [20] , and infectious disease prevention and control system (Germany) [21] . A categorization of computerized ENID surveillance systems by the timeliness of their response is shown in Fig. 1 . Most of these systems set the types of diseases under surveillance, and report the number of diseases covered, the geographical area covered, and the population covered. However, the time delay allowed is from 24 h to a week, except that [18, 20] , and the proposed EDICTS are on-line. There is generally one-way communication, i.e. from medical institutions to CDC, and only EDICTS is real-time and with automatic reporting, while [20] , for example, is done manually and by telephone. The implementation of an \"All-In-One\" Taiwanese NHI-IC card came into effect on 1st July 2003 in metropolitan and local community hospitals. The infrastructure was fully operational on a national scale and the first phase of implementation went into effect at the beginning of 2004. TBNHI constructed IDC to manage and maintain the NHICS database and a full-time bidirectional service network (the TBNHI intranet) for connecting all PoPs to IDC [22] . Moreover, the Taiwanese experience with SARS in 2003 proved that the health IC cards can play an important role in delivering solutions to healthcare providers and patients. The NHI-IC card carries a visually and electronically readable identifier to speed access to patient information. This leads to reductions in paper work, administrative costs and entry errors. The standard operations of using IC cards at the time of registration, at the doctor's side, and in the information infrastructure serve as a sound basis for better, faster delivery in the ENID reporting system. Moreover, the current practice of a surveillance system needs a real-time mechanism for quick spreading epidemic diseases. EDICTS is thus an appropriate mechanism that utilizes the NHICS infrastructure, in accordance with CDC policy, to deliver real-time response to ENID.","The second challenge for implementing real-time epidemic forecasting is the gap between technological or methodological innovation, which often occurs in academic settings in high-income countries, and implementation in field settings, frequently done by NGOs or governments in low-income and middleincome countries. Many funders have adopted a financing model intended to spur innovation through short-term pilot projects that place greater emphasis on the novelty of a technology or method than on the validation of its impact, but this approach exacerbates this separation. Pilot funding also fails to acknowledge the long timelines required to engage with health systems effectively and to measure health impact rigorously, instead promoting one-off bilateral collaborative projects that do not scale up and are not sustained after the lifetime of the project. Much more investment is needed in the validation, implementation, and scaling up of innovations in close intellectual partnership with stakeholders who are responsible for delivering them, 3 rather than continuing to fund the proliferation of solutions divorced from the problems themselves. In a recent editorial, Seye Abimbola noted that \"while the gulf between discovery and delivery exists in other fields, what makes global health peculiar is that discoveries and the decisions on whether or how to deliver them are typically made at a distance, removed from the realities of their targets or intended beneficiaries.\" 4 The third challenge is methodological: epidemic forecasting is inherently uncertain. There is sometimes an underlying assumption in the big data and artificial intelligence (AI) narrative that complex simulation models and mobile phone data or statistical covariates can bypass the need for the collection of basic epidemiological information. However, for emerging outbreaks-with COVID-19 highlighting this pointwe often lack accurate data about case counts and biological processes driving an epidemic, let alone the behavioural responses of people affected, making it challenging to swiftly adapt or interpret very complex models on the spatiotemporal scales relevant for decision making. Arguably, the most useful frameworks will tend to be simple, 5,6 both because of the need for flexible models that yield rapid answers given the large uncertainty surrounding epidemiological data during an emergency, and because simple models are more easily interpreted and communicated. 2 Clear communication of both the value and limitations of model outputs is a prerequisite to their useful deployment, but is often absent. Since policy makers generally do not have indepth modelling expertise, lack of clear communication risks two negative outcomes: believe models without scepticism and decisions will be misinformed, or dismiss modelling out of hand and fail to use the evidence we have to contain outbreaks as effectively as possible.","The Ebola outbreak highlighted the fragile state of health care systems in resource-limited settings. There is an urgent need for a paradigm shift in healthcare delivery and outcomes of critical illness in these settings. What Ebola patients need most stems from the foundation of critical care and public health: early recognition, supportive care, fluid resuscitation, and electrolyte management within an infrastructure organized to support hygiene, sanitation, isolation practices, safe handling, and transportation services (12). Unfortunately, patients in Western Africa died due to the inability of health care systems to provide this foundation (13). The current emphasis on disease specific as opposed to care delivery-based programs in resource-limited settings makes the provision of efficient and effective healthcare challenging, clearly shown by this Ebola outbreak. Improvement in the fundamentals of critical care medicine can and should be instrumental in helping make these urgently needed health care delivery shifts happen.","For city level health outcomes prior to January 24, 2020, we manually collected official daily statistics from the central and provincial (Hubei, Guangdong, and Zhejiang ) Chinese government websites. We did not collect city level health outcomes recorded prior to January 24, 2020 in provinces that had fewer than ten confirmed cases at that date. We made this decision since our analysis dropped observations with fewer than ten cumulative confirmed cases to prevent noisy data during the early transmission phase from disproportionately biasing the estimated results.","In the 17 outcome domains of protocols of western medicine clinical trials, 5 outcome domains (adverse events/effects, delivery of care, economic, metabolism and nutrition outcomes, mortality/survival) consisted of only one outcome. These outcomes are reported between 1 and 36 times, and the median outcome reporting time is 1. Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal outcomes included the largest number of outcomes, which includes 31 outcomes; chest imaging is reported more frequently than other outcomes. The number of outcomes in different outcome domains in protocols of western medicine clinical trials is shown in Figure 7 .","Stephanie colleagues did not find any evidence of the presence of SARSCoV2 viral particles in the products of conception or in neonates, in accordance with the findings of a previous study on SARSCoV1 done by Wong and colleagues. 9 Two neonatal cases of COVID19 infection have been confirmed so far, 10 with one case confirmed at 17 days after birth and having a close contact history with two confirmed cases (the baby's mother and maternity matron) and the other case confirmed at 36 h after birth and for whom the possibility of close contact history cannot be excluded. However, no reliable evidence is as yet available to support the possibility of vertical transmission of COVID19 infection from the mother to the baby. Previous studies have shown that SARS during pregnancy is associated with a high incidence of adverse maternal and neonatal complications, such as spontaneous miscarriage, preterm delivery, intrauterine growth restriction, application of endotracheal intu bation, admission to the intensive care unit, renal failure, and disseminated intravascular coagulopathy. 9, 11 However, pregnant women with COVID19 infection in the present study had fewer adverse maternal and neonatal complications and outcomes than would be anticipated for those with SARSCoV1 infection. Although a small number of cases was analysed and the findings should be interpreted with caution, the findings are mostly consistent with the clinical analysis done by Zhu and colleagues 12 of ten neonates born to mothers with COVID19 pneumonia. The clinical characteristics reported in pregnant women with confirmed COVID19 infection are similar to those reported for nonpregnant adults with confirmed COVID19 infection in the general population and are indicative of a relatively optimistic clinical course and outcomes for COVID19 infection compared with SARSCoV1 infection. 13, 14 Nonetheless, because of the small number of cases analysed and the short duration of the study period, more followup studies should be done to further evaluate the safety and health of pregnant women and newborn babies who develop COVID19 infection. As discussed in the study, pregnant women are susceptible to respiratory pathogens and to development of severe pneumonia, which possibly makes them more susceptible to COVID19 infection than the general population, especially if they have chronic diseases or maternal complications. Therefore, pregnant women and newborn babies should be considered key atrisk populations in strategies focusing on prevention and management of COVID19 infection. Based on evidence from the latest studies and expert recommendations, as well as previous experiences from the prevention and control of SARS, the National Health Commission of China launched a new notice on Feb 8, 2020, 15 which proposed strengthening health counselling, screening, and followups for pregnant women, reinforcing visit time and procedures in obstetric clinics and units with specialised infection control preparations and protective clothing, and emphasised that neonates of pregnant women with suspected or confirmed COVID19 infection should be isolated in a designated unit for at least 14 days after birth and should not be breastfed, to avoid close contact with the mother while she has suspected or confirmed COVID19 infection.","Fourth, operationalising the humanitarian-development nexus is crucial for the region. This new way of working leverages the comparative advantages of both humanitarian and development sectors. 26 The World Bank-funded Emergency Health and Nutrition Project in Yemen is an example of sustaining delivery of essential services while supporting local systems and structures. 27 Finally, other neglected health concerns in the EMR must be addressed. Within the context of expanding universal health coverage in fragile settings, WHO is expanding services at primary and secondary levels for NCDs (eg, Iraq and Yemen), mental health (eg, Somalia and Syria), and sexual and reproductive health (eg, Afghanistan and Sudan). Innovative tools such as the NCD kit and the Mental Health Gap Action Programme (mhGAP), which integrates mental health services in primary health care, are being introduced throughout the EMR. Specific projects with Health Cluster partners on gender-based violence and sexual and reproductive health are scaling up in Afghanistan, Iraq, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen. 28, 29 Conflicts across the EMR are devastating the lives of millions of people. Although health partners are documenting some impressive achievements, the right to health of the most vulnerable is far from being met and much more is required to address the needs of millions. All conflicts are political in nature, with no humanitarian or public health solutions. In these situations, the most impactful health interventions will always include a legitimate peace settlement and the restoration of basic rights.","To evaluate the clinical sensitivity of the assays, 18 specimens from the lower respiratory tract, including 14 known positive specimens, were obtained from five institutions. The RNA eluates of nine specimens that remained after initial clinical MERS-CoV rRT-PCR testing were used following storage of &lt;2 months at -70\u2103 at each institution. The other nine specimens were manually prepared in our laboratory without any pretreatment and were found to be inadequate for evaluating clinical sensitivity owing to the extremely high levels of PCR inhibition. Therefore, only the first nine specimens were used to evaluate clinical sensitivity, and the other nine specimens with high inhibition were used to evaluate the effects of PCR inhibition on positive results. In addition to determining the numbers of positives and negatives, the cycle threshold (Ct) values of the target genes and internal control were analyzed.","The global 2019-nCov pandemic currently underway has resulted in massive stresses on national health care systems, escalating deaths, and major disruptions in economic life in response to public health interventions designed to mitigate the pace of transmission. Modeling studies have shown a wide range of potential outcomes, depending on intensity of intervention. The trade-offs between the economic costs of preventive interventions and the health impacts of COVD19 have generated political controversy. As real-world data have begun to emerge, opportunities to illuminate these issues may be available.","While augmented intelligence (AI) in healthcare has been widely cited as an important approach to aid in the detection of disease and making clinical diagnosis, this recent outbreak emphasizes the need and opportunity to utilize AI to predict outbreaks. While the use of expert epidemiologists and public health officials cannot be replaced, AI can serve to compile rapidly evolving information to assist public health experts in complex decision-making. Aggregation of social media, news media, rapidly evolving health reports, and other disparate data is a daunting task which AI is poised to overcome. During prior outbreaks, such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in China in 2003, little real-time data was available [5]. Now there is an explosion of available data and the tools utilized presently must meet that and overcome the challenge of big data.","Collecting large amount of data is not trivial, and one has to wait for a long. Most of the reported AI-driven tools are limited to proof-of-concept models for coronavirus case. AI experts state the fact that limited data may skew results away from the severity of coronavirus outbreak. The Wall Street Journal [17] reported that coronavirus reveals limits of AI health tools: some diagnostic-app makers are holding off updating their tools, highlighting the shortage of data on the new coronavirus and the limitations of health services billed as AI when faced with novel, fast-spreading illnesses (Parmy Olson, February 29, 2020). In a nutshell, social medias, newspapers, and health reports, we note that conventional AI-driven tools for real-world cases (with less data) may not provide optimal performance.","The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.11.20033639 doi: medRxiv preprint interventions and delay of interventions. The proposed methods combine the real data and some assumptions. This allowed us to evaluate the consequences of intervention, while keeping the analysis as close to the real data as possible.","The agenda for critical care research in resource-limited settings should include more evidence on epidemiology and outcomes. A more accurate estimate of the potential lives saved through pediatric critical care interventions would justify its role in healthcare systems globally (19). Data on critical care capacity, and access to both critical care resources and health care professionals, are essential for health system planning, but generally lacking. Efforts should be made to adjust critical care guidelines from high-income countries to resource-limited settings. Cost-effectiveness analyses of current and proposed critical care practices need to be emphasized (73). Efficacy must be measured and validated for critical care interventions, with limited resources targeted to those practices that save lives, time, and resources. Currently, available critical care mortality prediction tools and triage scoring systems require revalidation in region-specific contexts (131, 132) and low-cost critical care technology is much needed to support critical care in resource-limited settings.","Based on currently observed disease patterns, cardiovascular (CV) specialists will be actively engaged in the care of patients with COVID-19. The infection may directly impact cardiovascular disease (CVD). Preexisting cardiovascular disease (CVD) may predispose to COVID-19 infection. Those with CVD who are infected by the virus have an elevated risk of adverse outcomes; and infection, itself, is associated with cardiovascular complications (4) (5) (6) . Moreover, COVID-19 infection may also have numerous indirect effects relevant to CV health. The large numbers of infected people requiring care may impact optimal treatment delivery to patients with acute CV conditions. Therapeutics for COVID-19 have the potential for adverse CV effects and clinicians delivering CV care are at risk of developing the illness or become vectors for the infection. The objective of this review is to characterize the CV impact of COVID-19, its potential consequences in patients with established CVD, as well as considerations for individual patients (with and without COVID- 19) , health care workers, and health systems, as understanding and addressing these issues will be crucial to optimize outcomes during the current critical period and beyond.","Amplicons were purified by gel extraction with the QIAquick Gel Extraction kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. After elution, nucleic acid quantification of the recovered DNA was done using Thermo Scientific Nanodrop spectrofotometer and submitted for direct sequencing to BMR Genomics, Padua, Italy. The obtained chromatograms were manually checked for unclear base calls and edited using Geneious R7.1.7 software (Geneious, Auckland, New Zealand).","We argue for a focus on basic pediatric critical care principals with locally appropriate adaptations in collaboration with ministries of health and community members. A concentration on international partnerships, educational initiatives, and research strategies will only help to enhance the specialty of pediatric critical care. Building capacity and evaluating efficacy of critical care interventions in resource-limited settings has the potential to greatly improve the overall outcome of critically ill children by supporting interventions at every level of patient care. The strategies outlined move us toward delivery of an adequate standard of critical care for all children globally and provide an opportunity to dramatically decrease the mortality of children in resource-limited settings.","See Appendix I for the details on the steps involved in data collection on all the respondents independent of whether or not they think they are infected. The AI algorithm described in Appendix II is to identify possible case identifications and send alerts to the nearest health clinic as well as to the respondent for an immediate health visit, we call this as an \"alert for health check recommendation for COVID-2019. In case the respondent is unable to commute to the health center, the health department can then send an alert to a mobile health unit so they can then do doorto-door assessments and even testing for the virus. This generates alert for mobile health check recommendation for 2019-nCoV (MHCRC). If a respondent does not have an immediate risk of having symptoms or signs related to the viral infection, then the AI-based health alert will be sent to the respondent to notify them that there is no current risk of COVID-2019. Figure 1 summarizes the outcomes of data collection and identification of possible cases. The data recorded in step 5 of the algorithm using signs and symptoms will be collected prior to both the groups who have received alerts HCRC or MHCRC (for possible identification and assessment) and NCRC (for non-identified respondents).","The trained AI system was evaluated on the external test cohort. We used the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves (in Figure 2 a) to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of the proposed AI system. The PR curves of evaluating the prediction accuracy were also illustrated in Figure 7 a.","Compared with traditional multi-stage methods, we demonstrate that our deep learning-based method can extract spatial and temporal information efficiently and improve the prediction performance significantly. The ability to identify patients with potentially severe and critical COVID-19 outcomes using an inexpensive, widely available, the point-of-care test has important practical implications for preventing mild patients from becoming severe, effectively improving cure rate, and reducing mortality. Our future work will focus on mining richer spatial information from the CT scan sequence and using AI technologies to screen the risk factors of potential severe/critical patients. author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.","In order to reduce the time to identification of a person under investigation (PUI) for the COVID-19 infection, and the rapid isolation of this individual, we propose to collect the basic travel history along with the more common manifestations using a phone-based online survey. Such collected data can be used to assist in the preliminary screening and early identification of possible COVID-19 infected individuals. Thousands of data points are able to be collected and processed through an artificial intelligence (AI) framework which can ultimately evaluate individuals that may be infected and stratify them into no-risk, minimal-risk, moderate-risk, and high-risk of being infected with the virus. The identification of the high-risk cases can then be quarantined earlier, thus decreasing the chance of spread. Table 1 is inserted here.","In 2002-2003 when China did not identify the SARS epidemic, some other international public health agencies had detected clues on SARS through surveillance using Internet-based data. This low cost and high effective surveillance model was later acknowledged by some Chinese public health professionals, and they attempted to apply the model in practice. In the commonly applied early model, surveillance staff manually searched through media reports on mainstream newspapers, radio and TV on a weekly (or monthly) basis, detected possible abnormal signals, and drafted media surveillance reports which were disseminated to public health professionals and agencies. The 2003 SARS epidemic revealed the overall weakness of Chinese public health system. After that event improvement of traditional surveillance systems were well done; however, few efforts were made to explore and develop infectious disease/emergency public health event-based surveillance by leveraging Internet-based information. The early surveillance using Internet-based data model featured manual searches that were not systematic and long cycles, and could not handle the huge amount of Internet-based information and frequent updating, and therefore tended to miss huge quantity of abnormal signals.","Whole blood is collected by means of venous pressure and gravity. Usually, the phlebotomy needle comes attached to a preconfigured bag system containing a premeasured amount of anticoagulant and preservative. A number of different anticoagulant/preservative preparations are available. The maximum liquid storage time for any RBC unit is currently 42 days. The number of bags in the collection set depends on intentions for further manufacture: whole blood, packed cells and plasma, or packed cells, plasma, and platelets. Multiple small bags can be attached if the blood is designated for pediatric transfusion. It is possible, through a sterile docking device, to add additional bags to a set. It is also possible to manually adjust the amount of anticoagulant in a collection bag for an underweight donor, but this requires significant time and expertise and is not done in most centers.","We limited the search to articles published between April 2012 (i.e., after the first MERS case was reported) and June 2016. Additional studies reporting associated outcomes that were not identified by the abovementioned search strategy were manually retrieved by tracking the references of included articles (i.e., ancestry and discordancy approach). We restricted ourselves to publications written in English.","The data used in this study comes from Chinese medical community website DXY reporting COVID-19 cases at the province level in China [5] . The data for countries and regions outside mainland China is collected from an interactive web-based dashboard to track COVID-19 in real time [6] . DXY updates case counts every 15 minutes in all provinces in China while other countries' case counts are manually updated in a web-based dashboard from centres for disease control and prevention (CDC) of Taiwan, Europe, the World Health Organization (WHO), the government of Canada, and the Australian government [6] .","Findings 1553 relevant citations and abstracts were screened, 252 full text articles were reviewed in detail, and 13 RCTs met all criteria. The studies were too disparate in clinical problems, adherence interventions, measures and reporting of adherence, and the clinical outcomes studied to warrant meta-analysis. Seven of 15 interventions were associated with improvements in adherence and six interventions led to improvements in treatment outcomes. For short-term treatments, one study showed an effect on adherence and outcome of counselling and w ritten information. The interventions that were effective for longterm care were complex , including various combinations of more convenient care, information, counselling, reminders, self-monitoring, reinforcement, family therapy, and other forms of additional supervision or attention. Even the most effective interventions did not lead to substantial improvements in adherence.","by mental health professionals in medical institutions, universities, and academic societies throughout all 31 provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions in mainland China, which provide free 24-h services on all days of the week. Online psychological self-help intervention systems, including online cognitive behavioural therapy for depression, anxiety, and insomnia (eg, on WeChat), have also been developed. In addition, several artificial intelligence (AI) programmes have been put in use as interventions for psychological crises during the epidemic. For example, individuals at risk of suicide can be recognised by the AI programme Tree Holes Rescue, 5 by monitoring and analysing messages posted on Weibo, and alerting designated volunteers to act accordingly.","Future modelling should evaluate social distancing interventions which might be more applicable in countries such as the UK, other European countries, Australia or the USA. Questions that need answering include which interventions are feasible in a given setting and how effective would these be? Our modelling has assumed that interventions are held until a vaccine or treatment option appears, which may not be feasible, with really strong measures possibly leading to compliance fatigue after being held for long periods of time. To address this, modelling may be used to evaluate repeated cycles of starting and stopping interventions, given that we have demonstrated that starting and stopping robust combined interventions can significantly flatten the epidemic curve.","To improve protein solubility prediction, we optimised the most recently published set of normalised B-factors using the PSI:Biology dataset (Smith et al. 2003) (Fig 2) . To avoid including homologous sequences in the test and training sets, we clustered the PSI:Biology targets using USEARCH v11.0.667, 32-bit (Edgar 2010) . His-tag sequences were removed from all sequences before clustering to avoid false cluster inclusions. We obtained 5,050 clusters using the parameters: -cluster_fast &lt;input_file&gt; -id 0.4 -msaout &lt;output_file&gt; -threads 4 . These clusters were divided into 10 subsets with approximately 1,200 sequences per subsets manually . The subsequent steps were done with His-tag sequences. We used Smith et al. 's normalised B-factors as the initial weights to maximise AUC using these 10 subsets with a 10-fold cross-validation. Since AUC is non-differentiable, we used the Nelder-Mead optimisation method (implemented in SciPy v1.2.0), which is a derivative-free, heuristic, simplex-based optimisation (Oliphant 2007; Millman and Aivazis 2011; Nelder and Mead 1965) . For each step in cross-validation, we used 1,000 bootstrap resamplings containing 1,000 soluble and 1,000 insoluble proteins. Optimisation was carried out for each sample, giving 1,000 sets of weights. The arithmetic mean of these weights was used to determine the training and test AUC for the cross-validation step (Fig 2A) .","Obstetrical care providers are at particularly increased risk for occupational exposure because of long periods of interaction with patients during labor, multiple team members involved in patient care, and the unpredictable occurrence of sudden obstetrical emergencies with their potential for unanticipated intubations in women undergoing labor and delivery. Given this risk, and without universal rapid viral testing, we must acknowledge that every admission and delivery present real risk for infection to our front-line healthcare workers. As such, ideal practice, if adequate supplies are able to be obtained, would involve universal PPE including N95 masks for all COVID-19 positive deliveries, whether vaginal or cesarean, as well as for those with unknown COVID-19 status until disease status can be determined through testing. Surgical masks should also be provided for all team members on the inpatient service and for all patients presenting to labor units, and worn at all times. 6 Until adequate PPE supplies exist, we can reasonably expect our obstetrical and anesthesiology providers to become ill and exit the workforce at an accelerated rate. As of last week, 2,629 Italian health care workers (8.3% of overall cases) had experienced a COVID-19 infection, 7 with infections attributed to inadequate equipment and asymptomatic exposures. Without appropriate protection and rapid testing, we should expect institutions to take measures to safeguard their workforce that previously would have been inconceivable in modern society. Recently, New York-Presbyterian Hospital made the difficult decision to announce a network-wide restriction prohibiting all visitors from attending deliveries, meaning that our patient's partners will be unable to directly participate in the deliveries of their own children. While this policy might seem Draconian, it should increase the protection of the mothers we care for, their infants, and the obstetric care team, by recognizing what series like this teach us: there is currently no easy way to clinically predict COVID-19 infection in asymptomatic people. Case 1. Chest X-ray of a recently delivered patient who experienced postpartum hemorrhage and instability, requiring intubation. Ventilation was complicated by severe bronchospasm and reactive lung disease, which prompted COVID-19 testing that was positive. This chest X-ray demonstrates left basilar atelectasis and illdefined hazy opacities in the right lower lung. The endotracheal tube placement was low and subsequently repositioned by the anesthesiology team.","Interventions should be based on a comprehensive assessment of risk factors leading to psychological issues, including poor mental health before a crisis, bereavement, injury to self or family members, lifethreatening circumstances, panic, separation from family and low household income. 11 Any major epidemic outbreak will have negative effects on individuals and society. Lessons learned from terrorist events at the Pentagon and anthrax attacks in the USA showed the importance of pre-establishing community coalitions to mobilise resources efficiently and effectively and to respond successfully to the disaster-related mental health needs of affected individuals. 12 Planning of psychological interventions in China is usually done passively; few preventive measures are implemented before the occurrence of serious psychological issues caused by acute emergency events.","Simulation training provides another opportunity to engage learners regardless of language and cultural barriers and has been found especially useful in introducing primary triage and culturally sensitive treatments (94, 95). With the improvement and advancement in technology, the interactive delivery of healthcare over distance using technology such as video conferencing or telemedicine can increase access, improve outcomes, and reduce costs (96). In work done by M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res (MSF) in Somalia, introduction of telemedicine resulted in a change in case-management in 64% of children for which it was used and detection of a previously undetected life-threatening condition in 25% (97). However, the reliable application of this technology in resource-limited settings can be challenging. The MSF system demonstrated a median response time of 13 h making its utility in critical, time-sensitive cases, somewhat limited (98).","Since December 2019, unexplained pneumonia has been successively identified in several patients with a history of exposure to the Huanan seafood market, in multiple hospitals in the city of Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. These patients have now been confirmed as acute respiratory infection (i.e., pneumonia) caused by a novel coronavirus. [1, 2] Clinical investigation of confirmed cases and cases under observation has shown that the number of patients with no history of exposure to the Huanan Seafood Market has been rapidly increasing. As of February 1, 2020, there were 14,380 confirmed cases of 2019 novel coronavirus disease in China. [3] A previous study found that highest temperature, dyspnea, respiratory rate, white blood cell count, neutrophil count, lymphocyte count, D-dimer, albumin, procalcitonin were risk factors for ICU care in patients with COVID-19. [4] Therefore, it is absolutely necessary to evaluate the possible factors affecting the progression of disease in COVID-19 patients. We investigated factors affecting the outcomes of COVID-19 patients to evaluate the prognosis and further improve the treatment of patients with COVID-19 associated pneumonia with the hope of reducing mortality.","The 2019-nCov will not be the last epidemic to challenge public health experts. The growth of AI-driven techniques to identify epidemiologic risks early will be key to our improvement of prediction, prevention, and detection of future global health risks. The devastating situation in Wuhan, China and future epidemics will also find value in ongoing research in 2019-nCov case detection, spread prediction, treatment effectiveness, and containment. The wide variety, velocity, and veracity of data now available in crises yield data sets that many researchers will now need to incorporate into evermore complex models. This requires expansion of talent within AI for healthcare applications. AI is no longer a niche research area nor is it a tool for the most advanced healthcare systems only, its global impact on healthcare is real and its potential to save lives in this epidemic as well as future epidemics should not be underestimated. It is critical to the global health of all humankind for the scientific community to embrace AI and leverage its power in securing our collective future.","There are other important applications of AI to the ongoing outbreak of 2019-nCoV. Though none have yet been officially announced, AI may assist in development of more accurate symptom checking in order to predict the likelihood of new infection with 2019-nCoV versus other, more benign causes of respiratory illness. AI may be applied to treatment records in order to more quickly home in on the most effective treatment regimens as different approaches are attempted and documented. And, early detection of geographical containment in certain regions that outpace modeled expectations may reveal more effective techniques for containment through near real-time detection of differences in practice.","Applications of AI and deep learning argued to be useful tools in assisting diagnosis and treatment decision making [10] [11] . There were studies which promoted disease detection through AI models [12] [13] [14] [15] . Use of mobile phones [16] [17] [18] [19] and web based portals [20] [21] have been tested successfully in health related data collection. However, one need to apply such techniques in a timely way for faster results. Apart from cost-effectiveness, the proposed modeling will be of great assistance in identifying and controlling when populations are closed due to virus spread. In addition to these, our proposed algorithm can be easily extended to identify individuals who might have any mild symptoms and signs.","The modeling of the RNA cap structure in the nsp10/nsp16 complex structure is derived from the analysis of the structure of the vaccinia virus methyltransferase VP39 crystallized in complex with a capped RNA and a S-Adenosylhomocysteine[47] (SAH) (pdb code: 1AV6). The two structures are manually aligned using COOT[58] based on the position of SAH binding sites, as well as SAH, and Sinefungin (SFG) molecules. The RNA binding site of VP39 is only partly overlapping that of nsp16 whilst the shape of the cavity is similar; thus local adjustments necessary to accommodate the RNA molecule in its binding groove were done manually using COOT. The side chain of tyrosine 30 of nsp16initially pointed to the putative RNA binding site, preventing any bona fide modeling. In order to fit the RNA molecule in the cavity, an alternative conformation was sought for this side chain. The second most common conformation for the tyrosine side chain was selected. Due to the biochemistry data and surface electrostatic analysis, it is not possible to describe with certainty the final position of the cap, thus the cap was removed and replaced by arrows symbolizing possible positions. No other modification was performed on the RNA, the Sinefungin molecule or the nsp16 structure.","In some countries, pharmacists have moved away from product-oriented services toward service-oriented and then patient-oriented services, increasingly emphasizing the patient's health outcomes (the economic, clinical, and humanistic outcomes model) (Drabinski, 2000; Kozma, Reeder, &amp; Schulz, 1993) . Outcomes refer to the consequences (results) of interventions that are made to achieve therapeutic goals. Outcomes can have economic, social/behavioral, or physiological characteristics. When community pharmacists are serving the public, in addition to health outcomes, at least four important parameters should be monitored: accessibility, availability, affordability, and acceptability. When patients benefit from the medications that they take, their health improves, which ultimately reduces costs (Wiedenmayer et al., 2006) .","From the editors: As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve, recommendations to healthcare providers will change based on availability of testing and personal protective equipment. For many patients, virtual visits can take the place of in-person visits, and we should do what we can to protect our older patients who are at greatest risk for adverse outcomes of infection. As tests become more widely available, there may be a role for testing prior to the visit for those who require a procedure that cannot be delayed. This must be done carefully so that we don't adversely affect testing capacity. We should all work with our hospitals and communities to help ensure that available supplies go where they are needed most. Dirk Elston, MD Jane Grant-Kels, MD patients. 1 While the authors make an important point, our specialty should be collectively addressing the urgent issues facing healthcare delivery in this rapidly changing environment.","With the support of the \u201cWar on Cancer\u201d declared by the National Cancer Institute in the 1970s, tumor virologists rapidly adopted sequencing as a primary method to analyze viral genomes, and larger DNA tumor viruses soon fell to sequencing efforts: papillomaviruses, the cause of warts and cervical and some other human cancer, with 8,000 base pairs, in 1982; and adenoviruses, which cause respiratory tract disease in humans and tumors in experimental animals, with 36,000 base pairs, in 1984. The following year, 1985, saw the completion of the 172,000 base pair sequence of the DNA of Epstein-Barr virus, a herpesvirus that infects virtually all humans and causes certain infected individuals to develop Hodgkin\u2019s disease, Burkitt\u2019s lymphoma, or nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Since the sequencing was done manually, this heroic feat required eight postdoctoral scientists working full time for several years. The poxviruses, a virus group that includes the dreaded smallpox virus and related viruses that can cause tumors in animals, weighed in at 191,636 base pairs in 1990.","Entropion usually is apparent within the first 2 weeks of age and manifests as ocular discharge, blepharospasm, corneal edema, and corneal ulceration due to irritation from inverted eyelids, usually the lower lid. Correction should be done immediately and may involve one of the following procedures: Mild cases may be resolved by manually everting the lid several times a day for a few days. Moderately severe cases may be resolved by an injection of penicillin into the palpebral conjunctiva. The resulting bleb should be sufficient to roll the eyelid out. Occasionally the procedure needs to be repeated in 5 to 7 days. Other, surgical-type methods include pinching a small amount of tissue into two wound clips placed parallel to the lower lid, crushing a fold of skin with hemostats parallel to the lower lid, and cutting a length of skin from below the lower lid and suturing it. With all of these latter methods, care must be taken to apprehend sufficient skin to allow proper eversion of the eyelid. Some evidence indicates that this is a heritable condition, so lambs with entropion should not be selected as replacements, particularly rams.","Translation of research evidence to programme and policy agenda has been a major constraint to ensure evidence-based practices. Genereux, Lafontaine and Eukelbosh [15] identified some key determinants that facilitate knowledge-to-action strategies for better community health risk preparedness. The team argued that blending traditional and modern approaches, fostering community engagement, cultivating relationships, investing in preparedness and recovery, putting knowledge into practice, and availability of human and financial resources are key successful factors for integrating expertise and research in disaster management practice. Yet, a lack of emergency preparedness often exacerbates the underlying community health risks in resource-deficit minority-based areas in times of crisis and emergencies. Ho, Chan, Lam et al. [16] showed indicators capturing perceived water security in the non-emergency/normal period might not be associated with Health-EDRM preparedness attitude and coping ability in a water-stressed rural context of PRC China. Chan, Lam, Lo et al. [17] showed food-labelling and perceptions of food-related health risk might be influenced by face-to-face health education interventions and should be considered as a core emergency preparedness and health risk reduction management strategy to strengthen bottom-up resilience in minority communities. Kamara, Akombi, Agho et al. [18] conducted a systematic review of resilience and well-being evidence in southern Africa and showed disaster risk reduction interventions that were based only on Western modelled or scientific warning systems might undervalue traditional warning insights and undermine intrinsic and community capacities. To strengthen resilience and well-being outcomes, efforts should be invested to ensure household, community/indigenous knowledge, and government-level capabilities are harnessed. Public health planning models might be instrumental in facilitating the planning for Health-EDRM-related risk reduction efforts in both emergency and non-emergency situations [19,20].","The dataset for Korea case has been collected from various sources [3, [6] [7] [8] for developing the statistical testing but all data have used the same original source from the Korean government [8] . The data have been collected as daily basis since February 21, 2020 until March 14th, 2020. Since, the data are scattered as daily reporting documents, the actual values are manually collected. Fortunately, it does not require heavy amount of this data because the purpose of data collection is for the AAEDM 8 demonstration. It is noted that the data collection from the government is confused because they change the way of delivering numbers. During the data collection period, they started counting the total number of infected people without adding the number of cured people. The total number of infected people had been counted including the number of cured in the past. The values in the dataset has been revised by adding the number of cured people after certain period of time.","The SARS-CoV genomes are about 30 kb in length. For such short genome sequences, currently, there is no reliable software for the identification of protein-coding genes. Therefore, most sequenced genomes were annotated manually or not annotated. Among the 11 completed sequences, six were not annotated yet and the remaining were annotated manually.","We have continued to develop and evaluate specimen extraction methods and conventional RT-PCR and quantitative real-time PCR assays for SARS detection Poon et al., 2003a,b) with the aim of closing the diagnostic gap in the first 5 days of illness. In this study, we evaluate an assay based on a modified RNA extraction protocol and quantitative real-time RT-PCR assay for early SARS diagnosis.","In the epidemiology of infectious diseases, many factors are evaluated to determine their relationship or association with a specific disease. Statistical associations, both positive and negative, may represent a true causal relationship, a confounding relationship with another factor, or a chance occurrence. If more than one factor is statistically associated with infection or disease status in univariate (singlevariable) analyses, the relationship between individual factors and infection or disease status can be evaluated by multivariate regression analysis. 35 These procedures allow the investigator to simultaneously control for a combination of factors in the analysis and to determine whether any of the risk factors are associated with infection or disease status independently of other factors. Another critical way of distinguishing causation from confounding or chance is by assessing the biologic plausibility of the association. An unexpected statistical association found in conjunction with an epidemiologic study may result in new understanding of how agent transmission or disease occurs. The temptation to stretch the plausibility of biology to provide meaning to statistical results is a constant danger. However, such results may be a useful guide to evaluate new hypotheses in future studies.","First, good hygiene and a robust immune system are key to coping with any virus, and COVID-19 is no exception. Thus healthy lifestyles are prominent in enhancing resilience. Also, telework, the use of AI and other new technologies for work which can be done remotely needs to be promoted. These measures are consistent with emergent means of collaborating and producing science. These include working from home, collaborating online, online meeting and teaching, social media engagements by scientists, and engagement of social science. This diffusion of cooperation can also help behavioural science understand societal responses, foster risk communication experts, science-policy advice.","Currently, the threat of pandemic influenza is increasing, with the emergence of a highly virulent avian influenza virus, influenza A/H5N1 (AI H5N1). As of December 14, 2007 , the World Health Organization (WHO) had reported 340 human cases of AI H5N1 in 13 countries, of which 208 (61%) have died [3] . There is concern that the acquisition of greater transmissibility by the virus may result in a replay of the Spanish flu, which killed 20 to 50 million people in 1918 [4] . In addition to the menace posed by emerging infectious diseases, a deliberate epidemic caused by a catastrophic bioterrorist attack remains a real and present danger [5] .","In conclusion, our experience showed that SARS during pregnancy is associated with high maternal morbidity and mortality. There were high incidences of spontaneous miscarriage, preterm delivery, and IUGR. There appeared to be a low risk of clinical SARS among infants of SARS patients, even when the delivery occurred during acute maternal infection. The adverse pregnancy outcomes might be due to the effects of SARS infection on pregnancy as well as to the medical treatment received for SARS.","is the (which was not peer-reviewed) The copyright holder for this preprint . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.01.20029645 doi: medRxiv preprint available data [12] . Rather than employing the SEIR, we develop a time-varying coefficient sparse vector autoregressive (VAR) model. Using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (lasso) [39, 40] and the local constant kernel smoothing estimator [41] , our model is capable of estimating the dynamic high-dimensional Granger causality coefficient matrices. This enables the detection and visualization of time-varying inter-province and self-transmission routes of the 2019-nCov on the daily basis. The resulting \"road-map\" can help policy-markers and public-health officers retrospectively evaluate both the effectiveness and unexpected outcomes of their interventions. Such an evaluation is critical to winning the current battle against 2019-nCoV in China, providing useful experience for other countries facing the emerging threat of this new coronavirus, and saving lives when a new epidemic occurs in the future."],"title":["Design and prototype of a mechanism for active on-line emerging/notifiable infectious diseases control, tracking and surveillance, based on
