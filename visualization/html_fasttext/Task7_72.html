The primer set was adapted by many researchers worldwide and has already contributed to the high-quality and prompt genome epidemiology of this rapidly spreading viral disease. We have also seen the great performance of their primer set and protocol; the primer set amplifies all desired 98 PCR amplicons with fairly small amplification bias from clinical samples with relatively high viral load. However, we also observed an acute drop of reads derived from some amplicons especially amplicon 18 and 76 in \"pool 2\" as a sample's viral load decreases. We suspected this low coverage issue was due to dimer formation between primers targeting those two amplicons. Indeed, replacement of just one of those primers, nCoV-2019_76_RIGHT, to a newly designed primer resulted in a drastic improvement of co...","Abstract The geographic spread and rapid increase in the cases of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) caused by a novel coronavirus (MERS-CoV) during the past two months have raised concern about its pandemic potential. Here we call for the rapid development of an effective and safe MERS vaccine to control the spread of MERS-CoV.","","Novel Corona virus (COVID-19 or 2019-nCoV) is an emerging global health concern that requires a rapid diagnostic test. Quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) is currently the standard for COVID-19 detection; however, Reverse Transcription Loop-Mediated Isothermal Amplification (RT-LAMP) may allow for faster and cheaper field based testing at point-of-risk. The objective of this study was to develop a rapid screening diagnostic test that could be completed in under 30 minutes. Simulated patient samples were generated by spiking serum, urine, saliva, oropharyngeal swabs, and nasopharyngeal swabs with a portion of the COVID-19 nucleic sequence. The samples were tested using RT-LAMP as well as by conventional qRT-PCR. Specificity of the RT-LAMP was evaluated by also testing against other related coronaviruses. RT-LAMP specifically detected COVID-19 in simulated patient samples. This test was performed in under 30 minutes. This approach could be used for monitoring of exposed indi...","The 2014\u201315 Ebola outbreak in West Africa highlighted the potential for large disease outbreaks caused by emerging pathogens and has generated considerable focus on preparedness for future epidemics. Here we discuss drivers, strategies and practical considerations for developing vaccines against outbreak pathogens. Chimpanzee adenoviral (ChAd) vectors have been developed as vaccine candidates for multiple infectious diseases and prostate cancer. ChAd vectors are safe and induce antigen-specific cellular and humoral immunity in all age groups, as well as circumventing the problem of pre-existing immunity encountered with human Ad vectors. For these reasons, such viral vectors provide an attractive platform for stockpiling vaccines for emergency deployment in response to a threatened outbreak of an emerging pathogen. Work is already underway to develop vaccines against a number of other outbreak pathogens and we will also review progress on these approaches here, particularly for Lassa f...","Abstract Recent publications have brought attention to the possible benefit of chloroquine, a broadly used antimalarial drug, in the treatment of patients infected by the novel emerged coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2). The scientific community should consider this information in light of previous experiments with chloroquine in the field of antiviral research.","The independent risk factors to predict mortality of critical severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) were investigated. One hundred and two patients diagnosed with critical SARS were admitted to hospitals of Shanxi Province, from March 7, 2003 to June 4, 2003. The patients were prospectively studied after admission to access their short term outcomes and the risk factors associated with adverse outcomes, defined as death. All the demographic and clinical characteristics were studied and univariate and multivariate Logistic regression were employed to access the risk factors. The results showed that of the 102 cases, 23 patients died, with a crude mortality rate of 22.5%. Multivariate Logistic regression revealed that age above 50 [odds ratio (OR) 1. 10, 95% confidence internal (CI) 1.03 to 1.16,P=0.004], lymphopenia at early stage (OR 14.62, 95% CI 1.78 to 11.97,P=0.01) were independently associated with mortality. On the other side, psychotherapy (OR 0.01, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.06,P&lt;0.00...","The coronavirus disease COVID-19, caused by emerging SARS-CoV-2, has posed serious threats to global public health, economic and social stabilities, calling for the prompt development of therapeutics and prophylactics. In this study, we firstly verified that SARS-CoV-2 uses human ACE2 as a cell receptor and its spike (S) protein mediates high membrane fusion activity. Comparing to that of SARS-CoV, the heptad repeat 1 (HR1) sequence in the S2 fusion protein of SARS-CoV-2 possesses markedly increased \u03b1-helicity and thermostability, as well as a higher binding affinity with its corresponding heptad repeat 2 (HR1) site. Then, we designed a HR2 sequence-based lipopeptide fusion inhibitor, termed IPB02, which showed highly poent activities in inibibiting the SARS-CoV-2 S protein-mediated cell-cell fusion and pseudovirus infection. IPB02 also inhibited the SARS-CoV pseudovirus efficiently. Moreover, the strcuture and activity relationship (SAR) of IPB02 were characterzized with a panel of tr...","The nucleocapsid (N) protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus (SARS-CoV) is a major virion structural protein. In this study, two epitopes (N1 and N2) of the N protein of SARS-CoV were predicted by bioinformatics analysis. After immunization with two peptides, the peptides-specific antibodies were isolated from the immunized rabbits. The further experiments demonstrated that N1 peptide-induced polyclonal antibodies had a high affinity to bind to E. coli expressed N protein of SARS-CoV. Furthermore, it was confirmed that N1 peptide-specific IgG antibodies were detectable in the sera of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) patients. The results indicated that an epitope of the N protein has been identified and N protein specific Abs were produced by peptide immunization, which will be useful for the study of SARS-CoV.","Abstract A novel coronavirus has been identified as an etiological agent of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). To rapidly identify anti-SARS drugs available for clinical use, we screened a set of compounds that included antiviral drugs already in wide use. Here we report that the HIV-1 protease inhibitor, nelfinavir, strongly inhibited replication of the SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV). Nelfinavir inhibited the cytopathic effect induced by SARS-CoV infection. Expression of viral antigens was much lower in infected cells treated with nelfinavir than in untreated infected cells. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis showed that nelfinavir could decrease the production of virions from Vero cells. Experiments with various timings of drug addition revealed that nelfinavir exerted its effect not at the entry step, but at the post-entry step of SARS-CoV infection. Our results suggest that nelfinavir should be examined clinically for the treatment of SARS and has potential as a good lead compound fo...","It has been reported that lactoferrin (LF) participates in the host immune response against Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) invasion by enhancing NK cell activity and stimulating neutrophil aggregation and adhesion. We further investigated the role of LF in the entry of SARS pseudovirus into HEK293E/ACE2-Myc cells. Our results reveal that LF inhibits SARS pseudovirus infection in a dose-dependent manner. Further analysis suggested that LF was able to block the binding of spike protein to host cells at 4\u00b0C, indicating that LF exerted its inhibitory function at the viral attachment stage. However, LF did not disrupt the interaction of spike protein with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the functional receptor of SARS-CoV. Previous studies have shown that LF colocalizes with the widely distributed cell-surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs). Our experiments have also confirmed this conclusion. Treatment of the cells with heparinase or exogenous hepar...","Social mixing patterns are crucial in driving transmission of infectious diseases and informing public health interventions to contain their spread. Age-specific social mixing is often inferred from surveys of self-recorded contacts which by design often have a very limited number of participants. In addition, such surveys are rare, so public health interventions are often evaluated by considering only one such study. Here we report detailed population contact patterns for United Kingdom based self-reported contact data from over 36,000 volunteers that participated in the massive citizen science project BBC Pandemic. The amount of data collected allows us generate fine-scale age-specific population contact matrices by context (home, work, school, other) and type (conversational or physical) of contact that took place. These matrices are highly relevant for informing prevention and control of new outbreaks, and evaluating strategies that reduce the amount of mixing in the population (su...","Public health professionals are considering how molecular medicine applications can impact on preventive medicine and health provision enabling interventions to start earlier. There is the potential for molecular medicine to improve the workplace although inappropriate use will lead to discrimination. The public health issue of communicable diseases is being addressed through molecular medicine in more effective and early detection and a better understanding of pathogenesis. A threat from emerging and re-emerging infections requires multiple approaches but early and definitive detection will need nucleic acid based approaches. The non-communicable diseases are now a global world problem, particularly obesity. While molecular medicine is still to make a significant impact on this disorder some interesting findings are emerging about the role of genes in obesity.

Molecular technologie...","Objectives: To report our experiences screening and managing patients with suspected or confirmed novel coronavirus (COVID-19) disease using a hospital-specific protocol. Design: Longitudinal cohort study. Setting: A 1,200 bed tertiary care teaching hospital in Chengdu, Sichuan, China. Participants: 802 adults presenting to hospital with concerns of having COVID-19, 1,246 inpatients and 2,531 hospital visitors. Interventions: Screening and management of patients using a hospital-specific protocol, which included fever triage, monitoring visitors and patients, emergency response, personnel training for healthcare team members, health education for patients and family, medical materials management, disinfection and wastes disposal protocols. Results: Between 23 January and 28 February 2020, 73 people were identified as having fever plus respiratory signs with/without a history of exposure and were tested for the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) by our hospital...","Abstract The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) was first diagnosed in Wuhan, China in December 2019 and has now spread throughout the world, being verified by the World Health Organization as a Pandemic on March 11th. This had led to the calling of a national emergency on March 13th in the United States. Many hospitals, healthcare networks, and specifically Departments of Surgery are asking the same questions of how to cope and plan for surge capacity, personnel attrition, novel infrastructure utilization, and resource exhaustion. Herein, we present a tiered plan for surgical department planning based on incident command levels. This includes Acute Care Surgeon deployment (given their critical care training and vertically integrated position in the hospital), recommended infrastructure and transfer utilization, triage principles, and faculty, resident and advanced care practitioner deployment.","The pandemic potential of the novel coronavirus (nCoV) that emerged in Wuhan, China, during December 2019 is strongly tied to the number and contagiousness of undocumented human infections. Here we present findings from a proactive longitudinal sampling study of acute viral respiratory infections that documents rates of asymptomatic infection and clinical care seeking for seasonal coronavirus. We find that the majority of infections are asymptomatic by most symptom definitions and that only 4% of individuals experiencing a seasonal coronavirus infection episode sought medical care for their symptoms. These numbers indicate that a very high percentage of seasonal coronavirus infections are undocumented and provide a reference for understanding the spread of the emergent nCoV.","We investigate the effects of social distancing in controlling the impact of the Covid-19 epidemic using a simple SIR epidemic model. We show that an alternative or complementaryapproach based on targeted isolation of the vulnerable subpopulation may provide a moreefficient and robust strategy at a lower economic and social cost within a shorter timeframe.","Bats are connected with the increasing numbers of emerging and re-emerging viruses that may break the species barrier and spread into the human population. Coronaviruses are one of the most common viruses discovered in bats, which were considered as the natural source of recent human-susceptible coronaviruses, i.e. SARS-COV and MERS-CoV. Our previous study reported the discovery of a bat-derived putative cross-family recombinant coronavirus with a reovirus gene p10, named as Ro-BatCoV GCCDC1. In this report, through a two-year follow-up of a special bat population in one specific cave of south China, we illustrate that Ro-BatCoV GCCDC1 persistently circulates among bats. Notably, through the longitudinal observation, we identified the dynamic evolution of Ro-BatCoV GCCDC1 in bats represented by continuously recombination events. Our study provides the first glimpse of the virus evolution in one longitudinally observed bat population cohort and underlines the surveillance and pre-warnin...","","AbstractWuhan Novel Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak has become a global outbreak which has raised the concern of scientific community to design and discover a definitive cure against this deadly virus which has caused deaths of numerous infected people upon infection and spreading. To date, no antiviral therapy or vaccine is available which can effectively combat the infection caused by this virus. This study was conducted to design possible epitope-based subunit vaccines against the SARS-CoV-2 virus using the approaches of reverse vaccinology and immunoinformatics. Upon continual computational experimentation three possible vaccine constructs were designed and one vaccine construct was selected as the best vaccine based on molecular docking study which is supposed to effectively act against SARS-CoV-2. Later, molecular dynamics simulation and in silico codon adaptation experiments were carried out in order to check biological stability and find effective mass production strate...","The apparent early success in China's large-scale intervention to control the COVID-19 epidemic has led to interest in whether other countries can replicate it as well as concerns about a resurgence of the epidemic if or when China relaxes the interventions. In this paper we look at the impact of a single short-term intervention on an epidemic. We see that if an intervention cannot be sustained long-term, it has the greatest impact if it is imposed once infection levels have become large enough that there is an appreciable number of infections present. For minimising the total number infected it should start close to the peak so that there is no rebound once the intervention is stopped, while to minimise the peak prevalence, it should start earlier, allowing two peaks of comparable size rather than one very large peak. In populations with distinct subgroups, synchronized interventions are less effective than targeting the interventions in each sub-population separately. We do not attem...","Abstract Metagenomics, i.e., the sequencing and analysis of genomic information extracted directly from clinical or environmental samples, has become a fundamental tool to explore the viral world. Against the background of an extensive viral diversity revealed by metagenomics across many environments, new sequence assembly approaches that reconstruct complete genome sequences from metagenomes have recently revealed surprisingly cosmopolitan viruses in specific ecological niches. Metagenomics is also applied to clinical samples as a non-targeted diagnostic and surveillance tool. By enabling the study of these uncultivated viruses, metagenomics provides invaluable insights into the virus-host interactions, epidemiology, ecology, and evolution of viruses across all ecosystems.","Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is an infectious disease caused by a novel coronavirus that cost nearly 800 lives. While there have been no recent outbreaks of the disease, the threat remains as SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) like strains still exist in animal reservoirs. Therefore, the development of a vaccine against SARS is in grave need. Here, we have designed and produced a prototypic SARS vaccine: a self-assembling polypeptide nanoparticle that repetitively displays a SARS B-cell epitope from the C-terminal heptad repeat of the virus\u2019 spike protein. Biophysical analyses with circular dichroism, transmission electron microscopy and dynamic light scattering confirmed the computational design showing \u03b1-helcial nanoparticles with sizes of about 25 nm. Immunization experiments with no adjuvants were performed with BALB/c mice. An investigation of the binding properties of the elicited antibodies showed that they were highly conformation specific for the coiled-coil epitope becau...","Abstract Background With its epicenter in Wuhan, China, the COVID-19 outbreak was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO). While many countries have implemented flight restrictions to China, an increasing number of cases with or without travel background to China are confirmed daily. These developments support concerns on possible unidentified and unreported international COVID-19 cases, which could lead to new local disease epicenters. Methods We have analyzed all available data on the development of international COVID-19 cases from January 20th, 2020 until February 18th, 2020. COVID-19 cases with and without travel history to China were divided into cohorts according to the Healthcare Access and Quality Index (HAQ-Index) of each country. Chi-square and Post-hoc testing were performed. Results While COVID-19 cases with travel history to China seem to peak for each HAQ-cohort, the number of non-travel related COVID-19 cases seem to continuously increase in the HAQ-c...","Early detection of COVID-19 based on chest CT will enable timely treatment of patients and help control the spread of the disease. With rapid spreading of COVID-19 in many countries, however, CT volumes of suspicious patients are increasing at a speed much faster than the availability of human experts. Here, we propose an artificial intelligence (AI) system for fast COVID-19 diagnosis with an accuracy comparable to experienced radiologists. A large dataset was constructed by collecting 970 CT volumes of 496 patients with confirmed COVID-19 and 260 negative cases from three hospitals in Wuhan, China, and 1,125 negative cases from two publicly available chest CT datasets. Trained using only 312 cases, our diagnosis system, which is based on deep convolutional neural network, is able to achieve an accuracy of 94.98%, an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 97.91%, a sensitivity of 94.06%, and a specificity of 95.47% on an independent external verification datase...","The Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) emerged in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in 2012 causing a critical challenge to public health. The epidemiology of MERS-CoV remain enigmatic as human-to-human transmission is not fully understood. One possible scenario that might play a role in the virus transmission is the cultural waterpipe smoking. Caf\u00e9s providing waterpipe smoking in cities within Saudi Arabia have been moved to areas outside city limits that frequently place them close to camels markets. We report results of a surveillance study wherein waterpipe hoses throughout several regions in Saudi Arabia were tested for the presence of MERS-CoV. A total of 2489 waterpipe samples were collected from cities where MERS-CoV cases were continuously recorded. MERS-CoV RNA wasn\u2019t detected in collected samples. Irrespective of the negative results of our survey, the public health risk of waterpipe smoking should not be underestimated. To avoid a possible transmission within country whe...","AbstractSARS-CoV-2 emerged in China at the end of 2019 and has rapidly become a pandemic with over 400,000 recorded COVID-19 cases and greater than 19,000 recorded deaths by March 24th, 2020 (www.WHO.org) (1). There are no FDA approved antivirals or vaccines for any coronavirus, including SARS-CoV-2 (2). Current treatments for COVID-19 are limited to supportive therapies and off-label use of FDA approved drugs (3). Rapid development and human testing of potential antivirals is greatly needed. A potentially quicker way to test compounds with antiviral activity is through drug re-purposing (2, 4). Numerous drugs are already approved for use in humans and subsequently there is a good understanding of their safety profiles and potential side effects, making them easier to test in COVID-19 patients. Here, we present data on 20 FDA approved drugs tested for antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 that we have previously found to inhibit SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (4). We find that 17 of these also ...","With respect to the asymptomatic transmission characteristics of the novel coronavirus that appeared in 2019 (COVID-19), a susceptible-asymptomatic-infected-recovered-death (SAIRD) model that considered human mobility was constructed in this study. The dissemination of COVID-19 was simulated using computational experiments to identify the mechanisms underlying the impact of city and residential lockdowns on controlling the spread of the epidemic. Results: The implementation of measures to lock down cities led to higher mortality rates in these cities, due to reduced mobility. Moreover, implementing city lockdown along with addition of hospital beds led to improved cure and reduced mortality rates. Stringent implementation and early lockdown of residential units effectively controlled the spread of the epidemic, and reduced the number of hospital bed requirements. Collectively, measures to lock down cities and residential units should be taken to prevent the spread of COVID-19. In addit...","Abstract Due to serotype variations among different avian infectious bronchitis viruses isolated in Tunisia since 2000, protection of chicks, especially broiler flocks, with Mass H120 vaccine often fails. Therefore, association of CR88 (793B type) with H120 vaccines was used for better response. Challenge experiments were then conducted to evaluate tracheal and renal cross-protection in chickens immunized via nasal and eye drops. Conferred protection was measured by clinical signs and macroscopic lesions observed, based on scores attributed according to their severities. The results showed a low protection conferred by H120 alone, as vaccination did not reduce tracheal and kidney lesions (70% scored as 3) after TN20/00 virus challenge, which also led to 10% mortality. Conversely, the challenge results indicated that the combination of the 2 strains (H120/CR88) allow high protection. Based on the results of the challenge experiments, a vaccination protocol coupling CR88 to H120 was appl...","Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is caused by a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV). In a longitudinal cross-sectional study, we determined the prevalence of virus in bodily excretions and time of seroconversion in discharged patients with SARS. Conjunctival, throat, stool, and urine specimens were collected weekly from 64 patients and tested for SARS-CoV RNA by real-time polymerase chain reaction; serum samples were collected weekly and tested for SARS-CoV antibody with indirect enzyme immunoassay and immunofluorescence assay. In total, 126 conjunctival, 124 throat swab, 116 stool, and 124 urine specimens were analyzed. Five patients had positive stool samples, collected in weeks 5\u20139. Two patients seroconverted in weeks 7 and 8; the others were seropositive at the first serum sample collection. In this study, 5 (7.8%) of 64 patients continued to shed viral RNA in stool samples only, for up to week 8 of illness. Most seroconversions occurred by week 6 of illness.","Abstract BACKGROUND: In December 2019, a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) infected pneumonia (COVID-19) occurred in Wuhan, China. Travel-associated cases have also been reported in other countries. The number of cases has increased rapidly but laboratory diagnosis is limited. METHODS: We collect two groups of cases diagnosed with COVID-19 for experiments. One group collected 63 samples for Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) IgG and IgM antibodies. The other group collected 91 plasma samples for colloidal gold-immunochromatographic assay (GICA). RESULTS: The sensitivity of the combined ELISA IgM and ELISA IgG detection was 55/63 ( 87.3%), The sensitivity of the combined GICA IgM and GICA IgG detection was 75/91 ( 82.4%), Both methods are negative for healthy controls, specificity of 100% .There is no significant difference between the sensitivity of between ELISA and GICA (IgM+ IgG). CONCLUSIONS: ELISA and GICA for specific IgM and IgG antibodies are conventional serological assays...","Abstract This article summarizes the likely benefits of melatonin in the attenuation of COVID-19 based on its putative pathogenesis. The recent outbreak of COVID-19 has become a pandemic with tens of thousands of infected patients. Based on clinical features, pathology, the pathogenesis of acute respiratory disorder induced by either highly homogenous coronaviruses or other pathogens, the evidence suggests that excessive inflammation, oxidation, and an exaggerated immune response very likely contribute to COVID-19 pathology. This leads to a cytokine storm and subsequent progression to acute lung injury (ALI)/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and often death. Melatonin, a well-known anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative molecule, is protective against ALI/ARDS caused by viral and other pathogens. Melatonin is effective in critical care patients by reducing vessel permeability, anxiety, sedation use, and improving sleeping quality, which might also be beneficial for better clinic...","Exotic wildlife can act as reservoirs of diseases that are endemic in the area or can be the source of new emerging diseases through interspecies transmission. The recent emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) highlights the importance of virus surveillance in wild animals. Here, we report the identification of a novel bat coronavirus through surveillance of coronaviruses in wildlife. Analyses of the RNA sequence from the ORF1b and S-gene regions indicated that the virus is a group 1 coronavirus. The virus was detected in fecal and respiratory samples from three bat species (Miniopterus spp.). In particular, 63% (12 of 19) of fecal samples from Miniopterus pusillus were positive for the virus. These findings suggest that this virus might be commonly circulating in M. pusillus in Hong Kong.","","Using a sensitive research-grade infrared camera, we find that common facial cosmetics and lotions mask skin temperature in assays of the human forehead. We test a family of 10 commonly-used cosmetic products and find that volatile liquids and creams lower thermal skin temperature by at least 2 C for up to 5-10 min and at least 1 C for up to 20 min, respectively. Powder and cream that contains brightening agent lower indefinitely the skin temperature sensed by infrared camera. With the qualification that these experiments were performed in a controlled laboratory setting rather than the mass crowd screening environment where infrared temperature sensing of humans sees widespread use, our tests suggest that for human subjects whose face was treated with certain cosmetics and lotions, infrared-based screening for elevated facial temperature (fever) can be unreliable.","","Abstract Purpose Syndromic surveillance is aimed at early detection of disease outbreaks. An important data source for syndromic surveillance is free-text chief complaints (CCs), which may be recorded in different languages. For automated syndromic surveillance, CCs must be classified into predefined syndromic categories to facilitate subsequent data aggregation and analysis. Despite the fact that syndromic surveillance is largely an international effort, existing CC classification systems do not provide adequate support for processing CCs recorded in non-English languages. This paper reports a multilingual CC classification effort, focusing on CCs recorded in Chinese. Methods We propose a novel Chinese CC classification system leveraging a Chinese-English translation module and an existing English CC classification approach. A set of 470 Chinese key phrases was extracted from about one million Chinese CC records using statistical methods. Based on the extracted key phrases, the system...","BACKGROUND: The first documented case of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) occurred in 2012, and outbreaks have continued ever since, mainly in Saudi Arabia. MERS-CoV is primarily diagnosed using a real-time RT-PCR assay, with at least two different genomic targets required for a positive diagnosis according to the case definition of The World Health Organization (WHO) as of 3 July 2013. Therefore, it is urgently necessary to develop as many specific genetic diagnostic methods as possible to allow stable diagnosis of MERS-CoV infections. METHODS: Reverse transcription-loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) is a genetic diagnostic method used widely for the detection of viral pathogens, which requires only a single temperature for amplification, and can be completed in less than 1 h. This study developed a novel RT-LAMP assay for detecting MERS-CoV using primer sets targeting a conserved nucleocapsid protein region. RESULTS: The RT-LAMP assay was capable ...","Advanced age often is associated with functional and immunologic decline and chronic cardiopulmonary diseases that predispose to pneumonia when viral infection occurs. Influenza virus remains the primary viral pathogen in the elderly, although the impact of the other respiratory viruses remains to be defined. The clinical syndromes associated with respiratory viruses frequently are indistinguishable from one another or bacterial pathogens; often, viral illness in older adults exacerbates underlying conditions, complicating diagnosis. Antiviral therapy is available for influenza A and B; specific viral diagnosis, particularly with the use of rapid antigen detection, may be useful for clinical management. Treatment for other viruses primarily is supportive.","A novel epidemic is challenging the global health care system. Starting from probably November to December 2019, another Coronavirus entered the arena of human pathogens, to be then defined 2019- nCoV [...].","","AbstractThe outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in China caused by SARS-CoV-2 virus continually lead to worldwide human infections and deaths. It is currently no specific viral protein targeted therapeutics yet. Viral nucleocapsid protein is a potential antiviral drug target, serving multiple critical functions during the viral life cycle. However, the structural information of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein is yet to be clear. Herein, we have determined the 2.7 \u00c5 crystal structure of the N-terminal RNA binding domain of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein. Although overall structure is similar with other reported coronavirus nucleocapsid protein N-terminal domain, the surface electrostatic potential characteristics between them are distinct. Further comparison with mild virus type HCoV-OC43 equivalent domain demonstrates a unique potential RNA binding pocket alongside the \u03b2-sheet core. Complemented by in vitro binding studies, our data provide several atomic resolution features of...","The potential infectiousness of asymptomatic COVID-19 cases together with a substantial fraction of asymptomatic infections among all infections, have been highlighted in clinical studies. We conducted statistical modeling analysis to derive the delay-adjusted asymptomatic proportion of the positive COVID-19 infections onboard the Princess Cruises ship along with the timeline of infections. We estimated the asymptomatic proportion at 17.9% (95% CrI: 15.5%-20.2%), with most of the infections occurring before the start of the 2-week quarantine.","","","The ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic demands rapid identification of immunogenic targets for the design of efficient vaccines and serological detection tools. In this report, using pools of overlapping linear peptides and functional assays, we present two immunodominant regions on the spike glycoprotein that were highly recognized by neutralizing antibodies in the sera of COVID-19 convalescent patients. One is highly specific to SARS-CoV-2, and the other is a potential pan-coronavirus target.","","Novel viruses might be responsible for numerous disease cases with unknown etiology. In this study, we screened 1800 nasopharyngeal samples from adult outpatients with respiratory disease symptoms and healthy individuals. We employed a reverse transcription (RT)-PCR assay and CODEHOP-based primers (CT12-mCODEHOP) previously developed to recognize known and unknown corona- and toroviruses. The CT12-mCODEHOP assay detected 42.0 % (29/69) of samples positive for human coronaviruses (HCoV), including HCoV-229 (1/16), HCoV-NL63 (9/17), and HCoV-OC43 (19/36), and additionally HCoV-HKU1 (3), which was not targeted by the diagnostic real-time PCR assays. No other coronaviruses were identified in the analyzed samples.","Abstract In this paper, we propose the daily computed weighted averaging basic reproduction number R 0 , k , \u03c9 n for Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) outbreak in South Korea, May to July 2015. We use an SIR model with piecewise constant parameters \u03b2 (contact rate) and \u03b3 (removed rate). We use the explicit Euler\u2019s method for the solution of the SIR model and a nonlinear least-square fitting procedure for finding the best parameters. In R 0 , k , \u03c9 n , the parameters n , k , and w denote days from a reference date, the number of days in averaging, and a weighting factor, respectively. We perform a series of numerical experiments and compare the results with the real-world data. In particular, using the predicted reproduction number based on the previous two consecutive reproduction numbers, we can predict the future behavior of the reproduction number.",""],"title":["A

The application of such a vast technical and operational set of interventions depends on countries' public health and laboratory infrastructures and resources.","Whilst surveillance is important for the detection of novel threats, in most of the modern settings it has equal value in quantifying the public health impact of an emerging problem over time, and at different levels of the healthcare system, so that resources may be moved around and focused on where they are most needed. One large problem, obvious during the 2009 pandemic, was the dearth of surveillance systems geared towards secondary care. Whilst many countries could track syndromic respiratory illness in primary care settings quite effectively (and some coupled this to virological surveillance), at the start of the pandemic, few had systems capable of doing much more than counting the number of hospital admissions due to respiratory illness. Ad hoc systems were devised in haste, but detailed clinical and epidemiological information on severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) was initially hard to locate. In the aftermath of the 2009 pandemic it has been recognised that SARI surveillance systems are critically important but mainly underdeveloped; and that their usefulness will extend over a broad range of acute respiratory pathogens, known and unknown. For example, a sudden upsurge in HCoV-EMC might well be detected by monitoring an unexplained increase in the requirement for intensive care for acute respiratory cases.","T Kuiken and R A M Fouchier participated in the joint planning and coordination of the study. T Kuiken wrote the report and supervised and interpreted the pathology, immunohistochemistry, and electron microscopy components of the experimental infections.

K St\u00f6hr participated as secretary of the WHO laboratory network on SARS diagnosis and played a substantial part in the initiation of the study. A D M E Osterhaus was the principal investigator and was responsible for the overall planning and coordination of the study.

Africa confirmed its first case in Egypt on Feb 14, 2020. China is Africa's leading commercial part ner; thus, there are large travel volumes through which severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 could reach the continent. Several measures have already been implemented to prevent and control possible case importations from China; 3,4 however, the ability to limit and control local transmission after importation depends on the application and execution of strict measures of detection, prevention, and control. These measures include heightened surveillance and rapid identification of suspected cases, followed by patient transfer and isolation, rapid diagnosis, tracing, and follow-up of potential contacts. 1 The application of such a vast technical and operational set of interventions depends on each country's public health and laboratory infrastructures and resources.","Experiments were performed independently with three different donors.

This team was responsible for organizing, managing, and executing radiotherapy specific policies and procedures during the outbreak. This team coordinated all aspects of infection control activities such as patient infection testing before admission, partitioning clinical and work areas into different protection zones, staff training and rotation assignments, radiotherapy workflow modification, classification of control and protection, management of personal protective equipment (PPE), disinfection and isolation management, medical waste disposal, and emergency response.","Under the guidance of the ad hoc emergency infection control team, all personnel actively remained on call, and rotated according to a predetermined emergency schedule during the outbreak. All personnel were required to take COVID-19 training and pass a screening test to return to work as part of the predetermined rotation.","As per Saudi CDC, other public health measures include obligatory reporting of HCFs by calling a specific number and through the Health Electronic Surveillance Network. This would activate a rapid response team tasked with completing epidemiological investigation in HCFs and community spontaneously, categorizing household and community contacts as per their symptoms, which, as with MERS-CoV, underplays the need for more liberal testing or isolating asymptomatic contacts [20] .","There is an urgent need for global protocols, agreed and signed by the governments, to respond to global pandemic. A global pandemic is not merely a health issue, but also demonstrates a profound influence on the global economy. The lack of science-based decisions, resort to ad-hoc travel bans, and other uninformed and uncoordinated responses, worsened this pandemic both as a health crisis and an economic crisis.","Let's consider something closely related to taxonomies and ontologies, but in practice not quite the same thing: categorization. We categorize things all the time. Sometimes we use preexisting taxonomies to categorize things, as in the previous examples, but often we just make up ad hoc categories (\"That was ..... It a 'boring' movie, or was a 'chick flick'\"). More interesting is when this happens and is codified in an application.","ADG and AW designed the study; AM and STW collected the leeches in the field; JA performed the leech nucleic acids extractions and the PCRs on leeches; NA and AD performed the capture experiments; NA and KT performed the bioinformatics and phylogenetic analyses; NA, AD, ADG and AW wrote the manuscript; NA, AD, JA, KT, MLK, TPG, AW and ADG reviewed the manuscript; all authors read and approved the final manuscript.","The percentage of Annexin V+ (apoptotic) cells was determined on Core 18-27 dextramer + cells 5 h later.

Currently, a fourth large-scale outbreak is occurring and spreading out from Wuhan, Hubei province, China, to neighboring provinces and other countries. There is a dearth of epidemiological data about the emerging coronavirus, which would be of crucial importance to design and implement timely, ad hoc effective public health interventions, such as contact tracing, quarantine and travel restrictions. In this study, we adopted a deterministic model to shed light on the transmission dynamics of the novel coronavirus and assess the impact of public health interventions on infection. We found that the basic reproduction number could be as high as 6.47 (95% CI 5.71\u20137.23), which seems consistent with the special period prior to the Spring Festival when contacts were higher than usual, and with the opinion that the virus has gone through at least three\u2013four generations. It is worth mentioning that our model made a very good prediction of the confirmed cases from 23 to 29 January 2020, as shown in Table 4. Particularly, the predicted confirmed cases should be 7723 as of 29 January 2020, which is very close to the real number of cases of 7711. Furthermore, according to our model, the outbreak, under the most restrictive measures, is expected to peak within two weeks (since 23 January 2020), with a significant low peak value. Our investigation has major practical implications for public health decision- and policy-makers. The rather high reproduction number suggests that the outbreak may be more serious than what has been reported so far, given the particular season of increasing social contacts, warranting effective, strict public health measures aimed to mitigate the burden generated by the spreading of the new virus.","Attendance is always an issue when creating an ad hoc information session, even when people are highly motivated to attend due to the seriousness of the epidemic. The sessions were made mandatory, on direction from the Dean of the College (HA). Those faculty members who were unable to attend were directed to self-educate on the issue and use the materials to do short sessions on the virus, how it spreads, how to prevent becoming infected and what to do if you become ill.","To determine the specificity of the entity, we made a choice between different texts in the local samples. We removed numbers, symbols, verbs, and garbled characters to obtain clean versions of the local samples. The coronavirus study-specific entities (CSSE) were then identified in only the clean texts containing CSHGs. Based on the clean selected samples, we next built a local dictionary of candidate CSSEs containing 49,293 words after deduplication. Before calculating the random distribution of each entity, we included the synonymous entities into a same entity number (including singular or plural words, active and passive forms, different tenses, suffixes that do not author/funder.

The results of these experiments are shown in Fig. 4 . The AD 1-830, AD 1-630, and AD 1-310 constructs cotransformed with the full-length N construct (BD-N) lacked reporter gene activation. In contrast, the AD-N 310-1260 and AD-N 630-1260 constructs when tested with full-length BD-N, revealed reporter gene activity. The AD-N 310-1260 and AD-N 630-1260 when tested with BD-N (full-length) showed reporter gene activity. However, the AD 1-830, AD 1-630, and AD 1-310, when cotransformed with their corresponding full-length N construct (BD-N), showed no reporter gene activation. However, the strength of interaction between 630-1260 and BD-N was found to be lower than that of full-length N-N or AD N 310-1260 and full length N interaction. Hence, we mapped the interaction domain for the N protein dimerization to reside in C terminal one-third amino acids. Upon investigation of the predicted secondary structure model for N, we found this region to be helixrich and contained the putative nuclear localization signal.","In this context, the proposed algorithm can be applied to enforce the gradual implementation of the pharmaceutical quality systems for MAHs most vulnerable to shortage risks. As shown in Fig. 3 , the obligations for MAHs are determined based on the shortage impact score. For products with a high shortage impact, the establishment of a shortage prevention plan seemed essential to ensure an appropriate and continued supply to fulfil patients' needs. For such products, manufacturer's resilience should be improved by more onerous provisions, such as the obligation for MAHs to qualify at least two suppliers of drug substance, the stockpiles' expansion and the implementation of the manufacturing technologies and risk assessment tools. In this context, the establishment of ad hoc agreements between European countries and MAH to conduct exceptional manufacturing activities in specific National sites can also be pursued. As an example, in Italy, National military manufacturing site has been involved in such activities to mitigate the impact of severe shortage, especially in the case of old and low-cost medicinal products (Di Giorgio et al., 2019) . On the other side, if the shortage impact of medicinal products on the public health is low, it is not reasonable to charge the MAHs with additional costs and, therefore, affect the economic sustainability for the implementation of quality assurance systems that may have a limited positive impact on the continuity of care.","Faculty, who had previous experience with telemedicine visits, supervised the fellow's telehealth 51 training. Fellows were instructed via university-provided web-based sessions, through both pre-52 recorded and live interactive sessions, on virtual visits. After these tutorials, fellows were directed to use 53 the virtual hospital desktop. The virtual desktop can be accessed remotely by their office or home 54 computer, in conjunction with a smartphone or tablet-based video-conferencing application to perform 55 visits. After web-based tutorial training was completed, the fellow's first virtual visit occurred in a 56 cleaned patient room while the patient was at home. These ad-hoc offices improved social distancing 57 for the fellows. After the review, the supervising attending allergist joined the patient and fellow in a 58 concluding group virtual visit. The first virtual visits allowed the supervising Allergist to help the fellow 59 navigate the EMR, trouble shoot, and fix any problem in person. Once the fellow was comfortable, we 60 allowed fellows to work from home. We also identified a need for future emergency planning, given the likelihood of the crisis worsening. 106","We use the same estimates for the rate parameters in our individual and population models to compute the different mortality ratios. Note that in general, both the individual mortality probability M 1 (t) and the population-based estimates M p (t) depend on the time of measurement t. By critically analyzing these estimates and another ad hoc \"delayed\" ratio CFR d , we illustrate and interpret the differences among these measures and discuss how changes or uncertainty in the data affect them. In section III, we summarize our results and identify a correction factor to transform population-level mortality estimates into individual mortality probabilities.","From these GST pull-down experiments with nsp12-RdRp, a clear pattern emerged: the RdRp-containing subunit is apparently able to built two interactomes: one with nsp3 domains and the other with products encoded by ORF1b, which had been missed in the yeast two-hybrid experiments. Notably, nsp12 is also able to dimerize, perhaps providing an explanation for the fact that many interactions involving nsp12 were missed using the yeast two hybrid system (see also below). The nsp12-nsp7 interaction could not be reproduced using the GST pull-down approach. The negative results for nsp1, AD, and nsp10 were consistent with the yeast two-hybrid data.","Our increasing understanding of novel emerging coronaviruses will be accompanied by increasing opportunities for the reasonable design of therapeutics. Importantly, understanding this basic information will not only aid our public health preparedness against SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, but also help prepare for novel coronaviruses that may emerge.","Eight-wk-old female SPF BALB/c mice with body weight of 17-18 g were purchased from Beijing Laboratory Animal Research Center (Beijing, People's Republic of China), and housed in microisolator cages ventilated under negative pressure with HEPA-filtered air. During the experiments, mice were given food and water ad lib.","Evaluations and planning has focused on mass casualty incidents isolated to specific communities. [13] [14] [15] There has been no published and distributed plan instituted for residents in such a population health scenario as presented by COVID-19. For example, residents' roles in the disaster response to the Boston Marathon bombing was unclear. There was no understanding if residents would be expected to provide surge staffing or if they would be stratified by experience. 13 Though most hospitals train nurses and attendings for mass-casualty events, fewer than half train residents. 14, 15 This is a gap in medical education that should be addressed as these incidences are unfortunately becoming more frequent. Most resident staffing during crises is managed ad hoc by chief residents or program directors. Communications should be in place, whether by group text, online meeting applications or other local mechanism, so that chief residents act as a liaison between institutional command, attending physicians and resident teams. It is likely that trainees could be asked to work beyond scheduled duty hours. Local graduate medical education leadership should be involved in preparations, and knowledge of ACGME program requirements is essential. It is possible residents will be asked to work beyond accepted duty hours, and these exceptions should be made known to the ACGME, but exemptions should be provided given the national emergency. Graduated autonomy and extension of attending physicians by senior residents as well as battlefield promotions of fellows and Chief Residents will be the most logical progression as the response to the crisis escalates and personnel are furloughed or quarantined.","Implementation of these principles into decisional algorithms should, we believe, be part of pandemic preparation everywhere. In settings where rationing of resources becomes a necessity and such preparation has not been made, medical staff or oversight organizations should implement ad hoc guidelines that incorporate key prognostic factors beyond age -most notably frailty, comorbidity, and functional status. 4, 5 In this manner, a sentence about function and comorbidities in an ethics document underscores the need to operationalize the meaning of prognosis at advanced age, 6 and acknowledges the critical role that function and comorbidity play in the aging individual. 7 Clinicians familiar with principles of geriatrics and gerontology could thus support the development of more contemporary recommendations by identifying valid, efficient ways of measuring comorbidities and function across different settings and specialties. We might suggest the use of simple tests and scales, such as the Clinical Frailty Scale, 8 or the assessment of mobility independence, 9 that might optimally capture the pre-illness health status of the individual, mirroring his/her physiological reserve, and, by incorporating such tools into electronic records for rapid assessment, provide support for better clinical decisionmaking than the all-too-simplistic criterion of chronological age.","In this work, we demonstrated that using reconstructed ancestral sequences on microarrays broadens the sequence space targeted by these tools and can therefore facilitate pathogen detection. The use of RAS improved the two major parameters of microarrray resequencing, call rate and sequence accuracy, which have a major influence on the subsequent processes of identification of novel sequences, such as Blast searches in sequence databases or confirmatory experiments based on targeted nucleic acid amplification. Therefore, the use of ancestral sequences should be regarded as an important strategy to improve the design of microarrays aimed at identification of pathogens of public health importance.","We used data of the community outbreak of patients with COVID-19 who showed any symptom in Japan for 14 January -28 February, 2020. From 2 March, all schools were closed down as social mitigation for COVID-19. Contact patterns among students or between students and adult were thereby altered considerably. Therefore, we do not use data for the period during which schools were closed ad hoc for estimation. We excluded some patients who had returned from abroad, such as from China, and those who were presumed to be infected persons from the Diamond Princess. They were Japan to fit the data of community outbreak before SC and VSC introduce on 27","Let us do so within the framework of co-operation -not confrontation -between the public and private sectors. Such co-operation is a necessary condition for competitiveness and is thus a key objective of the Business Council. In the wake of 11 September, co-operation between the public and private sectors reached an unprecedented degree of cohesion in the design and execution of strategies in response to a scenario that was very different from past crises.","ZG and BS made substantial contributions to the study concept and design. XL was in charge of the manuscript draft. LW took responsibility for obtaining ethical approval and collecting samples.","The same thing occurs with the classification of level of evidence. In some DIDs reference is made to the type of article supported, whereas in others a classification is made by the authors, in general not referring to the levels of Data represents n (%) of the total of each group. evidence previously published but those produced ad hoc. For example, Micromedex \u00ae classifies as theoretical/probable; Medinteract \u00ae classifies as well-documented/documented/ scarcely-documented, etc, and makes no reference even to the articles in which the relevant interaction is discussed. All of this, once again, indicates a high level of variability. It should be noted that all the included DIDs were specific to interactions, whereas many among the excluded DIDs belonged to databases contained a wider range of data. Perhaps in the latter there was less physical space available.","The peculiar experimental signature of aggregate-forming compounds can be used to distinguish them from specific, well-behaved inhibitors, 23, 24, 28 and several research groups have used these characteristics to triage their screening hits for potential promiscuity. 12, [28] [29] [30] [31] [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] [40] [41] [42] The appropriate experiments range in complexity and intensity from a rapid biochemical assay to a much more laborious microscopy study. Depending on the purposes of the research effort, these experiments can be tailored appropriately. For most early-stage discovery programs, the following experiments are performed to answer the question: Is this hit likely inhibiting the screening target as an aggregate? If the answer is yes, it is unlikely that the hit will be a favorable starting point for lead design and it should be dropped from further consideration immediately, as the pain of throwing out compounds early in the process pales in comparison to the agony of abandoning leads that have been through several nonproductive development cycles. If the answer to the above question is no, then one element of the hit's potential has been reassuringly established. The necessary experiments and examples of their recent application in drug discovery projects are described below; detailed recipes for performing these assays have been described elsewhere. 43 ","Ever since the first report of the discovery of an unknown novel coronavirus that had caused pneumonia in Wuhan, China, had filed to WHO by China, on December 31, 2019, the government had instituted drastic measures to contain the outbreak of the epidemic. To keep transparency, the China's National Health Commission reports confirmed, suspected, recovered and death case numbers daily, yet the epidemiological community is still calling for more information. Specifically, they want to have the critical ''Basic Reproduction Number\", R 0 . According to Jones [1] and van den Driessche and Watmough [2] , R 0 , is defined as the expected number of secondary cases produced by a single (typical) infection in a completely susceptible population:","Nathaniel Byers (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Fort Collins, CO, USA) presented a method for longitudinal mosquito saliva collection for determining arbovirus vector competence that increases biosafety and throughput. The recent emergence of Zika, chikungunya and yellow-fever viruses emphasizes the need for rapid, reliable, and safe methods for analyzing vector competence from various species of mosquitoes. Arboviruses transmit from the mosquito to the vertebrate host via mosquito saliva; hence, collecting mosquito saliva to assess viral titers is an essential activity. Current collection methods are laborious and typically require sacrificing the mosquito, limiting researchers to a single saliva collection time point per insect. Inspired by the hanging blood drop and the field-oriented honey-trap method, they are designing an approach that will allow collection of saliva from individual mosquitoes during routine sugar feeds. They have systematically optimized this assay: including methods of sucrose delivery, housing, timing, and detection of virus from samples. A 3D printed lid covered with organdy turned 12-well plates into suitable habitats for both Anopheles gambiae and Aedes aegypti, as they provided a compact living space for individual mosquitoes and improved safety over cartons. To detect chikungunya virus from experimentally infected mosquitoes, quantitative reverse-transcription real-time PCR, normalized to a standard curve, was performed on RNA purified from mosquito saliva samples. This collection technique is a promising method for assaying arbovirus transmission rates over time from experimentally infected mosquitoes as it facilitates rapid longitudinal collection of infected saliva from individual mosquitoes. Also, by eliminating the need for glass capillaries and reducing manipulation of mosquitoes, this technique improves biosafety, saves time and allows for increased numbers of mosquitoes per experiment.","CC carried out IFN induction experiments and drafted the manuscript. LB carried out IFN induction experiments. EL, CA, and GR performed molecular analysis and immunoassays. IA, FP, and MRC participated in the study design and helped to draft the manuscript. All authors read and approved the final manuscript.","All mice purchased from Jackson Laboratory were maintained in a pathogen-free facility. A 12-h light/dark cycle and ad libitum supply for food and water were provided. Age, sex, and weight-matched (4-12 months) wild type (wt), Plau -/-, and Sepine1 Tg mice were sacrificed for experiments as approved by the Institute of Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Texas Health Science Center at Tyler.","The experimental setup is presented in Table 1. Nine 3-week-old SPF White Leghorn chickens were individually tagged and 3 chickens per group were housed in separate negative pressure (150 pa) isolation units (IM 1500, Montair). Before the start of the experiment, an acclimatization period of two-weeks was respected. Drinking water and food were provided ad libitum. The experimental design was evaluated and approved by the Ethical and Animal Welfare Committee of the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine of Ghent University (EC 2014/160).","While providing a preliminary analysis using COVID-19 official reports and airline suspensions, this work also lays out a framework for rapid risk assessment for an emerging and ongoing outbreak. We believe that using near real-time multi-modal mobility datasets and detailed disease surveillance with qualitative and quantitative inputs on ongoing interventions and preparedness efforts will aid in swift and efficient global response to such outbreaks.","Viruses exist as quasispecies [32]. Infected humans and animals host a diverse population of viral nucleic acid sequences; the raw material for rapid evolution. RNA viruses, including retroviruses, have much higher mutation rates than DNA viruses [33,34], increasing the complexity of generating effective probes for nucleic acid amplification tests. This can result in assay \u2018drop out\u2019. This has been a problem with influenza A diagnostics targeting hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) segments. It is exemplified by the necessity for ad hoc test development for the 2009 H1N1 human influenza of swine origin, the \u2018swine influenza virus real-time detection panel\u2019, and its authorization for emergency use by the US FDA. This test was subsequently replaced by an improved version developed by the CDC, as more H1N1 specimens became available [203]. The problem of drop out continues to plague commercial and in-house assays [35]. Whiley and colleagues cite several examples of PCR or reverse-transcriptase (RT)-PCR-based virus diagnostic assays that are prone to false-negative results caused by sequence variation. This list includes commercial assays for HIV-1, human parvovirus B19, and in-house methods for rabies and cytomegalovirus [35]. This calls for astute primer design or the use of multiple gene targets within a single organism (e.g., combining PCRs for the por A and ctr A genes in Neisseria meningitidis[36] or for the HA and NA genes for influenza A detection) [37]. The challenge to the designer of an influenza diagnostic test is the same as the challenge faced by the designer of influenza vaccines, where the vaccine needs to be reformulated annually to account for antigenic drift and also when antigenic shift is detected.","In this section the necessary conditions (16)- (19) are studied, from a numerical point of view; they are solved by using the \u00a9 Matlab Optimization Toolbox and the function fmincon. It allows the finding of a constrained minimum of a function of several variables; this function uses sequential quadratic programming method [26] . It solves a quadratic programming subproblem [27] at each iteration in which a positive definite quasi-Newton approximation of the Hessian of the Lagrangian function was updated using the Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno method [28] . Eq. (3) were discretized by using the classical trapezoidal rule dividing the time duration interval into n \u2212 1 equally spaced subintervals; in the simulation we assumed n = 500 with ad hoc integration step in order to simulate a control period of one year.","RNA virus infection requires delivery of the viral genome into cells, transcription of viral mRNA and subsequent translation of viral proteins that aid in genome replication, viral assembly and budding. Targeting viral RNA sequences with ASOs or siRNAs is a conceptually appealing strategy for treating RNA virus infections for several reasons. First, preventing the synthesis of even one critical viral protein could potentially disrupt the viral life cycle. Secondly, the sequence specificity of ASO and siRNA compounds potentially allows viral genes to be targeted without affecting host genes, thus decreasing or eliminating unwanted side effects. In addition, targeting viral sequences does not require an understanding of gene function. The feasibility of using ASOs and siRNAs to disrupt RNA virus gene expression was first demonstrated using Rous sarcoma virus and respiratory syncytial virus, respectively (Stephenson and Zamecnik, 1978; Bitko and Barik, 2001) . Viral genome sequences are available, or can be easily acquired, allowing researchers rapidly to design and test novel nucleic acid-based, sequence-specific antiviral reagents. In support of this approach, there is an extensive and rapidly expanding record of using antisense and RNAi to target viruses for therapeutic benefit. Recent investigations of sequence-based reagents against highly pathogenic RNA viruses are discussed below.","In this paper the SIRC model of influenza is considered aiming at the control of the epidemic spreading; controlling an epidemic disease corresponds, for example, to an ad hoc introduction of vaccine or quarantine or medicine treatment strategy. All the possible strategies should face with the limitations of the resource. In this paper the controls both in the susceptible and in the infected classes are introduced, taking into account the constraints in the controls. A suitable cost index is proposed and existence result is assessed. The aim is to minimize the susceptible and infected subjects with as less resources as possible; the analytical expressions of the optimal controls are provided and their numerical implementation is discussed. Numerical results are presented comparing the effects of dif-ferent control strategies, showing interesting and encouraging results.","EDICTS is implemented in a simulated NHI-IC card execution environment. EDICTS prototype block diagram is shown in Fig. 6 . The characteristics of the EDICTS prototype are as follows:","The data of interventional trials from ChiCTR and ClinicalTrials.gov were retrieved updated on February 22, 2020. Two authors (Zhao and Shen) were independently responsible for collecting the relevant information, including clinical phase, study design, presence or absence of randomization, blinding, sample size, severity of disease and source of samples.","The agenda for critical care research in resource-limited settings should include more evidence on epidemiology and outcomes. A more accurate estimate of the potential lives saved through pediatric critical care interventions would justify its role in healthcare systems globally (19). Data on critical care capacity, and access to both critical care resources and health care professionals, are essential for health system planning, but generally lacking. Efforts should be made to adjust critical care guidelines from high-income countries to resource-limited settings. Cost-effectiveness analyses of current and proposed critical care practices need to be emphasized (73). Efficacy must be measured and validated for critical care interventions, with limited resources targeted to those practices that save lives, time, and resources. Currently, available critical care mortality prediction tools and triage scoring systems require revalidation in region-specific contexts (131, 132) and low-cost critical care technology is much needed to support critical care in resource-limited settings.","date_admission_hospital - Date when the reported case was recorded to have been hospitalized.
