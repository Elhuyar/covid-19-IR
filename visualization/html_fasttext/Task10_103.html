Poorest countries with limited resources should work on establishing national medicines information centers to cover the needs of the whole country. 2. Different institutions within the same country can work on establishing an information sharing system to facilitate information exchange and building up huge medicines information databases. 3. Collaboration among countries from the same region provides great opportunities to save resources and strengthening the capacities for attaining sustainable high-quality services. This can be achieved via sharing available experiences and resources and can be maximized by building collaborative regional MICs. 4. Institutions from developing countries with no or limited access to high-quality medicines information resources should seek assistance from supportive organizations such as the WHO, which can offer free access to the Hinari database. Other freely available resources should be also sought. 5. Medicines information education should be promoted among colleges of pharmacy at various levels including didactic courses during undergraduate studies, during APPE training of PharmD students and as postgraduate studies and training (i.e., residencies, fellowships, and masters programs). 6. Training for developing and strengthening the medicines information skills should be provided regularly to all practicing pharmacists as part of the continuing professional development (CPD) programs 7. Advanced training can be scheduled for pharmacists working on the provision of medicines information services as part of CPD activities to build their capacities and to raise their competencies. 8. Countries with limited experiences in the area of medicines information should work on to learn from countries having well-established systems of medicines information and try to copy successful innovations. 9. There is a need to monitor and evaluate various resources of medicines information available in the developing countries as well as evaluating the services provided by the medicines information centers. This is very useful for improvement and for the expansion and the sustainability of the services. Evaluations are done by conducting scientific research studies. Such researches should be published to allow others make use of the established evidence.","Since 2 February 2020, strict public health measures were taken to prevent population flow among distinct communities whereas since 9 February 2020, public health interventions including quarantine of each building in the urban area and each village in the rural area were implemented in order to block the transmission chain among the household.

The survey highlights a few important points in support of this conclusion. First, most respondents believed that the needed infrastructure was in place \u2013 such as data registries, laboratory capacity, ethics review processes, and monitoring units for RCTs. Second, respondents seemed to be aware of the required capacity for research in MERS-CoV. Third, although not the most common trial design in Saudi Arabia, most respondents were aware of RCTs and what they entail, and a majority of them believed that their patients would consider participating in RCTs. However, many barriers to conducting RCTs remain. First, there is low community awareness of research in general, which is needed for any RCT to take place. Second there may be lengthy processes required to obtain regulatory and ethics approval to initiate clinical trials.","The planning of ECMO services during an outbreak of an emerging infectious disease such as COVID-19 can be broadly categorised into ensuring appropriate organisation of personnel, equipment, facilities, and systems (figure 2). 16 As with any scarce resource in times of high demand, a mismatch in these factors can develop. During the 2009 influenza A(H1N1) pandemic, inadequate surge capacity highlighted the need for intensive-care reserves and improved health-care resource planning at all levels. 17, 18 In an effort to improve ECMO preparedness 19 for an outbreak of an emerging infectious disease, we highlight the ten key components of an ECMO action plan (panel) based on these four categories, with practical recommendations for health centres to ensure appropriate training, capacity, and planning, depending on local priorities and resources. The focus is on building sustainable systems that ensure quality care for patients and their families and staff safety and wellbeing. Details on the organisation of ECMO programmes have been reported elsewhere. 20, 21 WHO interim guidelines recommend offering extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) to eligible patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) related to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The number of patients with COVID-19 infection who might develop severe ARDS that is refractory to maximal medical management and require this level of support is currently unknown. Available evidence from similar patient populations suggests that carefully selected patients with severe ARDS who do not benefit from conventional treatment might be successfully supported with venovenous ECMO. The need for ECMO is relatively low and its use is mostly restricted to specialised centres globally. Providing complex therapies such as ECMO during outbreaks of emerging infectious diseases has unique challenges. Careful planning, judicious resource allocation, and training of personnel to provide complex therapeutic interventions while adhering to strict infection control measures are all crucial components of an ECMO action plan. ECMO can be initiated in specialist centres, or patients can receive ECMO during transportation from a centre that is not specialised for this procedure to an expert ECMO centre. Ensuring that systems enable safe and coordinated movement of critically ill patients, staff, and equipment is important to improve ECMO access. ECMO preparedness for the COVID-19 pandemic is important in view of the high transmission rate of the virus and respiratory-related mortality.","Our results have implications for prioritising capacity building action in WHO Regions and countries, especially in terms of capacities regarding prevention, detection, response, enabling functions, and operational readiness. The operational readiness index can be used to support WHO, governments, and other international agencies to prioritise their support and implementation of operational readiness capacities for the COVID-19 outbreak. ","Capacity-wise, the survey indicates that European specialised laboratories are prepared for the current situation, and suggests that a more sensitive case definition than currently in use [10,16] would not create an immediate bottleneck. However, it remains to be seen how realistic the estimates are, particularly in view of the coinciding seasonal epidemic peaks of other respiratory pathogens such as influenza viruses. This will depend on the epidemiological developments in the 2019-nCoV outbreak and on whether the current worldwide control strategy of containment with active case finding [5] will be sustained and the indicated laboratory capacity will suffice. If the outbreak turns into a pandemic, specialised laboratories\u2019 efforts would refocus to reference activities like confirmatory testing, laboratory surveillance including virus characterisation, provision of reference materials and advice, while general testing for 2019-nCoV would shift to first-line hospital laboratories that currently do not have this capacity. This would require a roll-out of tests from the specialised laboratories as was done during the 2009 influenza A(H1N1) pandemic.","Using safety-engineered devices (SEDs) is an important reform and step for the prevention of NSIs. In 2011, Taiwan has allowed laws for the usage and promotion of SEDs in the daily practice at hospital settings. It is necessary to investigate the effect of using SEDs in term of reducing the incidence of NSIs. Methods: The study was conducted at a medical center with 2300 beds. Since 2011, it has started to promote the usage of SEDs over the hospital phase by phase. Training and education program to prevent healthcare personnel from NSIs were also conducted. Closely monitoring on the incidence and analysis on the underlying mechanisms of NSIs were implented simutaneously. Interventions to improve the medical and practice understanding the factors result in NSIs were performed. Results: The overall incidence of NSIs decreased from 3.90% in 2011 to 2.82% in 2016. The decrease is especially obvious for interns and nurses. In addition, the rate of NSIs caused by conventional devices (including syringe, intravenous catheter, winged needle, insulin syringe, etc.) decreased from 57% in 2011 to 39% in 2016, which resulted from conventional syringe declined from 41.7% in 2011 to 26.9% in 2016. However, the occurrence of NSIs made by the incorrect operating of safety devices and safety devices being not activated had increased from 1.94% in 2011 to 8.97% in 2016. Conclusion: The use of SEDs can effectively prevent NSIs but must work correctly with standard operating procedures. Training and education on the usage of SEDs are necessary before promoting use of SEDs. Keeping and making a more safety workplace environment with sustained efforts should be ongoing to promote occupational health.","HTS is transforming our ability to track outbreaks and make epidemiological inferences. The Outbreak Genomics and Epidemiology session covered a wide range of topics along this theme, from the practicalities of integrating whole genome sequencing into existing infrastructure, to an example where inference from genome sequences conflicted with national health policies. Jonathan Green (Public Health England [PHE], Colindale, UK) described progress in establishing a centralized sequencing service at PHE to monitor and track outbreaks of infectious diseases. Although HTS technology is rapidly evolving, PHE believes that current technology is robust enough to make investment worthwhile, even though costs are very large and an overhaul of the existing infrastructure is required. The need for robotics, a specialized staff, bioinformatics support, expensive hardware as well as training services was underlined. Priority areas were identified, such as emergency response and a small number of pathogens of high public health importance. Using Streptococcus pneumoniae as a case study, J. Green asked whether HTS could replace the current serotyping system. Whilst there is a very high correlation between sequence and serotype, a small number of cases are hard to resolve, but this should hopefully change in the future by building a bank of reference serotypes. This early experience was judged very positive, but automation and validation of this novel approach are likely to take time and to bring up many new issues such as data sharing and the ethics of using HTS data in legal cases.","In summary, we have examined current and unfolding responses to COVID-19 and their implications for the Sendai Framework. Core to our argument are strategies for resilience building against biological hazards and pandemic. We reiterate our assertion that there is a lack of early and rapid actions from the DRR-related organisations, despite the SFDRR's call for building resilience including from biological hazards. The SFDRR's ultimate goal is a substantial reduction of risk and losses, coupled with laying the essential foundations for rapid and sustained recovery and sustainable development. We hope the evidence we have added shows the crisis of COVID-19 could be used to make 2020 a \"super year\" of great progress on these goals.","The report by Gilbert and colleagues 4 provides an important tool to map out the continental risk for the spread of COVID-19 in Africa, which should be used to inform a framework of action to prepare the continent for any potential importation and spread of COVID-19. First, collectively, Africa needs a unified continent-wide strategy for preparedness and response. The strategy must be comprehensive, and member states, donors, and partners should immediately commit to releasing financial resources to support country-customised implementation plans derived from the strategy. To help develop a common strategy that will allow for effective coordination, collaboration, and communication, the African Union Commission, Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC), and WHO, in partnership with African countries, have established the Africa Taskforce for Coronavirus Preparedness and Response (AFTCOR). The partnership has six work streams: laboratory diagnosis and subtyping; surveillance, including screening at points of entry and cross-border activities; infection prevention and control in healthcare facilities; clinical management of people with severe COVID-19; risk communication; and supply-chain management and stockpiles. Because mitigating the potential spread of COVID-19 in Africa will require rapid detection and containment, the laboratory work streams of AFTCOR, Africa CDC, and WHO are working closely to expeditiously scale up diagnostic testing capacity linked to enhanced surveillance and monitoring-eg, at the beginning of February, only two countries in Africa had the diagnostic capacity to test for COVID-19. However, as of Feb 25, 2020, more than 40 countries would have been capacitated to accurately diagnose COVID-19 infection, thanks to the coordination efforts of AFTCOR. 6 As testing becomes more available, it is possible that more cases might be detected. Second, any effective preparedness and response strategy for COVID-19 requires a committed political will; as such, the African Union Commission, Africa CDC, and WHO convened, on Feb 22, 2020, in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, an emergency meeting of all ministers of health of 55 member states to commit to acting fast and collectively to develop and implement a coordinated continent-wide strategy. AFTCOR taskforce was formed, and a continent-wide strategy was endorsed at the end of the emergency meeting, with a call for strong coordination of efforts. To prevent the occurrence of a social, health security, and economic tragedy, actions agreed at the emergency ministerial meeting will need to be acted on quickly, before any additional COVID-19 cases are introduced to the continent, and result in sustained human-tohuman transmission. The potential social, economic, and security devastation that COVID-19 could cause in Africa should be enough of an incentive for African governments to invest immediately in preparedness for the worst-case scenario. Third, commitment and release of financial resources from partners and donors before a crisis hits Africa will help anticipate demand and address supply chain management, mapping, and stockpiling of COVID-19 response needs, such as large quantities of personal protective equipment, gloves, surgical masks, coveralls, and hoods, and medical countermeasures like antiviral agents. Supplies of these items will be limited in Africa because of reduced manufacturing capacity.","An important indicator that leadership, and the drive to spearhead new approaches, are growing within the research community is the fact that attention is shifting from asking why it is necessary to build collaborative networks across different types of knowledge, to figuring out how this work can be initiated, maintained, and evaluated (Funtowicz, 1994; Gross Stein, 2001; Klein et al., 2001; Horlick-Jones, 2004). It is no longer enough for scientists to hone their own corners of research to perfection, and assume someone else (who?) will put it all together. Increased sophistication in efforts to incorporate systems-based concepts regarding ecology, health, and sustainability into professional curricula (Howard, 2004; Howard and Rapport, 2004) is a step in the right direction for a new generation of researchers. We must also find ways to cultivate leadership in the current generation of researchers because it is they who will be required to build the collegial and collaborative platforms from which to bridge disciplines and policy, and make useful contributions in the multistakeholder arena of EID investigation and control. Critical skills will be required to identify how, when, and where disciplinary, interdisciplinary, and transdisciplinary approaches will be required in building responses to disease emergence. This is not a small task or an \u201cacademic exercise,\u201d but a necessary step in building our capacity to better respond to the emerging infections of the 21st century.","Conclusion COVID-19 related prediction models for diagnosis and prognosis are quickly entering the academic literature through publications and preprint reports, aiming to support medical decision making in a time where this is needed urgently. Many models were poorly reported and all appraised as high risk of bias. We call for immediate sharing of the individual participant data from COVID-19 studies worldwide to support collaborative efforts in building more rigorously developed and validated COVID-19 related prediction models. The predictors identified in current studies should be considered for potential inclusion in new models. We also stress the need to adhere to methodological standards when developing and evaluating COVID-19 related predictions models, as unreliable predictions may cause more harm than benefit when used to guide clinical decisions about COVID-19 in the current pandemic.","Public health efforts to control and prevent infectious diseases are based on epidemiologic and laboratory surveillance systems that detect and monitor disease incidence, define pathogen characteristics, and track cases 'by person, place and time' [25]. Molecular epidemiology has long been a mainstay of public health surveillance; now, increasingly powerful molecular methods, including sequencing of whole pathogen genomes, help investigators to identify epidemiologically related cases, describe patterns of transmission, pinpoint sources of infection, and explain antimicrobial resistance [26-33]. Combining the methods of molecular pathogenomics with population genetics and epidemiology can provide new insights into the episodic behavior of epidemics of familiar pathogens, such as group A streptococcus [7]. Archived biological samples can also provide new insights into the emergence and evolution of infectious threats, from HIV [34] to influenza [35]. Building the capacity for human biological sample collection into existing surveillance networks has the potential to facilitate a more comprehensive, population-based evaluation of genomic and environmental determinants of health outcomes. For example, a meta-analysis of surveillance cohorts from Arizona, Colorado, California, and Illinois demonstrated that human homozygosity for CCR5delta32 (a non-functional variant of chemokine receptor CCR5) is consistently associated with symptomatic West Nile virus infection [36]. When disease surveillance is conducted independently in multiple jurisdictions, the capacity to share biological samples and epidemiologic and clinical data provides important infrastructure for research.","A majority 146/179 (82 %) of respondents said that they had access to registry data for patients receiving care at their sites, and more than 50 % of respondents reported that their institutions had a research administration infrastructure in place to aid with data-sharing agreements (52 %), research contract (49 %), ethics reviews (74 %), and administrative support for research projects (60 %). The average time for the ethical review process (from submission to approval to enroll patients) was approximately 1 to 3 months.","The spot map developed by John Snow 9 remains a rudimentary epidemiological tool in outbreak investigation. Our analysis for spot mapping clearly illustrates that the highest attack rate was sustained by residents living in a most densely populated area, within 30 km of the city centre, concurring with the post-epidemic sophisticated analysis of spatial diffusion process. 5 During the 89day epidemic, similar durations were experienced elsewhere in China; 10,11 although our database could not identify community-acquired from occupationally acquired risk, an early spot map would have identified clustering of cases, indicating a likely community exposure. The decline in contact history should have raised suspicion that the definition of 'contact' in the initial phase could have benefited from a re-definition throughout the epidemic. Contact history during an outbreak involving progressive transmission should list exposure to animals, environmental contact (i.e. a hospital or geographic contact by virtue of residential location), as potential contacts. Such redefining, along with spot maps for place of residency or occupation, would have still revealed the heavy case loads in the inner city areas. Although this is not always suggestive of a causative agent, it would be strongly supportive of the usefulness of geographical quarantining. Even though more contacts acquired SARS from spouses (15.4%), the proportion was greater with non-household contact (11.6%) 12 than household contact (8.8%), or friend (10.0%), suggesting that environmental exposure is a causal factor and supported by the clustering on our spot map and the high attack rate in those of working age. Daily commuting to work across densely populated cities assists the dissemination of airborne or droplet spread diseases even when infectivity may be low. 13 Excellent control measures were instigated during the early phase, including quarantining contacts and closing public social and education venues. 12 However, basic spot mapping could support a policy for rapid and severe restriction of population movement within 30 km circumference from the city centre.","The facility design needs to meet a number of varied requirements to satisfy the range of activities it could be called upon to house. These include: The necessary services to support GMP, such as purified water supplies and systems to monitor the environment and equipment. 4. The ability to accommodate different production methods, such as cell culture and egg culture for viruses, and fermentation processes for vaccines based on bacterial and expressed protein products. 5. An effluent treatment plant and suitable autoclaves for dealing with contaminated waste. 6. Equipment and space for downstream processes such as purification and fill and finish if these are to be completed in-house. 7. Access to quality control laboratories, media preparation laboratories, equipment preparation services, goods ordering and stores services and engineering support. 8. The ability to support more than one manufacturing process at once, so that a wide skill base can be sustained, and maintenance of the facility can be scheduled so as to allow operations to continue in other parts whilst it is undertaken.","LZ and MS conceived the study. LZ, CKF contributed to the collection and interpretation of data. LZ, MS and JW did the data cleaning and statistical analysis. LZ conducted model building with assistance from MS. LZ, MS, XM and SS drafted the manuscript. All authors contributed to critical revision of the manuscript for important intellectual content. WG JW YT ZZ RZ JL WL FL KY YW GZ nad CKF provided epidemiological, technical, or material support. LZ and MS had full access to all the data in the study and take responsibility for the integrity of the data and the accuracy of the data analysis. ","Fourth, national, regional, and international organisations need to cooperate and collaborate to optimise limited supplies, using a whole of government approach. Fifth, all member states will need to urgently develop and put in place proper quarantine and infection control protocols, including procedures for implementing social distancing (mass gathering and potential closure of public facilities). Lastly, the capacity-building training efforts that Africa CDC and WHO are conducting must be implemented and cascaded immediately down the health system pyramid in each country. Medical staff at major hospitals must be trained in the proper protocols of quarantining individuals who are at-risk of COVID-19 infection, as well as isolation and safe treatment of patients who test positive. As the Director General of WHO has stated several times, the window of opportunity to act is narrowing. Africa needs to be supported to act now, and needs to act fast.","We aimed to identify locations with underdetected cases by fitting a model to the cumulative international imported case counts of nCoV-2019 reported by high surveillance locations and Wuhan-to-location air travel volume. Our model can be adjusted to account for exportation of cases from locations other than Wuhan as the outbreak develops and more information on importations and self-sustained transmission becomes available. One key advantage of this model is that it does not rely on estimates of incidence or prevalence in the epicentre of the outbreak. Based on our model, locations whose case counts exceed the 95% prediction interval (PI) could be interpreted as having higher case-detection capacity and/or more connection with Wuhan than that captured by available daily air travel volume, such as land transportation. Locations below the 95% PI may have undetected cases based on the expected case count under high surveillance. We recommend that outbreak surveillance and control efforts for potential local transmission should be rapidly strengthened in those locations lying below the 95% PI lower bound, in particular Indonesia, to ensure detection of cases and appropriate control measures to reduce the risk of self-sustained transmission.","Against the backdrop of still-worsening COVID-19 impacts, this paper discusses resilience building for pandemics and related biological hazards. We examine ongoing efforts to respond to COVID-19 and these efforts' implications for the Sendai Framework. Our analysis reveals specific areas of rapid response to COVID-19. But we find lamentably few actions by DRRrelated organisations, in spite of the SFDRR's call for building resilience to biological hazards. Moreover, the current WHO-led coordinated response reveals little implementation of the WHO Thematic Platform for Health-EDRM adopted in 2019. Existing mechanisms and strategies for disaster resilience, such as those detailed in the SFDRR, offer concrete means to respond effectively to epidemics and even global pandemics such as COVID- 19 . We thus put forward general and DRR-specific recommendations for short and long-term resilience.","The agenda for critical care research in resource-limited settings should include more evidence on epidemiology and outcomes. A more accurate estimate of the potential lives saved through pediatric critical care interventions would justify its role in healthcare systems globally (19). Data on critical care capacity, and access to both critical care resources and health care professionals, are essential for health system planning, but generally lacking. Efforts should be made to adjust critical care guidelines from high-income countries to resource-limited settings. Cost-effectiveness analyses of current and proposed critical care practices need to be emphasized (73). Efficacy must be measured and validated for critical care interventions, with limited resources targeted to those practices that save lives, time, and resources. Currently, available critical care mortality prediction tools and triage scoring systems require revalidation in region-specific contexts (131, 132) and low-cost critical care technology is much needed to support critical care in resource-limited settings.","There have been a wide range in responses across states since the first case of COVID-19 was announced in Washington State on January 14, 2020. Upon this, the CDC began releasing recommendations to those at risk of being exposed to the virus. The initial recommendations included travel warnings and restricted travel to countries with confirmed cases and sustained COVID-19 spread. These travel restrictions grew to include inbound and outbound travel bans to a list of 26 countries, in both Europe and Asia. 108 Other policies have included social distancing, which has been widely recommended or enforced at various levels of government. This method involves avoiding crowds, staying home, limiting or avoiding visiting vulnerable populations (such as long-term care facilities) and standing at least six feet away from others in public spaces. Some regions have implemented school closures at both the K-12 and higher education level. Business closures have also been recommended or enforced, such that employees should work from home, unless their work is considered essential to the greater public (e.g. health care, grocery stores). To support employees working remotely or staying home when sick, a number of states have also mandated paid sick leave for those who are affected by . Free testing has also been implemented in certain states, so that anyone experiencing symptoms or has been exposed to the virus can now get tested for free. 111 We coded various policies that cancel events and large gatherings as follows: the cancellation of large events, specifically the election postponement in Louisiana, is categorized as \" event_cancel .\" The separate \" no_gathering \" policy variable represents policy measures that banned all events or mass gatherings of a certain size, i.e. no gatherings over a certain number of people (where this number has varied by region). The \" social_distance \" category includes measures that prevent visits to elderly care facilities, close public facilities such as libraries, and require workers to work remotely. The \" emergency_declaration \" encompasses the declarations of a state of emergency at the city, county, state, and federal level. This declaration allows the affected area to immediately marshal emergency funds and resources and activate emergency legislation, while also giving the public an indication of the gravity of the situation.","Methods: The team used Maternal Health booklet for reference to formulate Port-A-Cath Care booklet which contained the information of self-assessment, postoperative wound care, infusion notes, principle of care after discharge to home and infusion record after discussions and allowed patients to understand the use and management of port-a-cath. Results: Patients' condition at home and present condition at admission would be understood through self-assessment of brochure after their admission to hospital; therefore, nurses could provide patients with timely access to relevant information and nursing intervention. Since the implementation of the study at a regional hospital in February, 2017, we found that completion rate of port-a-cath care guidance reached 100%; in addition, patient satisfaction scores increased from 3.31 to 4.1, with a significant improvement in suitability of nursing procedure and timeliness of nursing care. Conclusion: Although we worry that giving more information regarding port-a-cath to the patients and family members will increase probability of disputes occurrence between patients and hospital staff if the staff members don't follow the standard of care, it is necessary to incorporate patients and family numbers into the gatekeeper mode to have a better understanding of clinical quality and thereby enhance education training of practice staff to improve patient safety. Background: Effective control of tuberculosis (TB) requires a close partnership between private and public healthcare providers. An integrated web-based information system is vital and crucial for engaging all relevant healthcare providers in prevention, diagnosis and treatment of TB. Methods: A \"MONITOR\" information system was established in 2016 by Taiwan Centers for Disease Control (TCDC) with single entryway and enhanced capacity and flexibility. Main purpose of the system is to promote more rapid response and provide decision support. Information such as TB epidemiology, case management, treatment, DOTS rate, contact tracing coverage, TB clusters, TB statistics and laboratory data are included in the system. Information without personal data can be viewed online with access permission. Daily laboratory data including AFB-smear, culture, identification, drug susceptibility testing and the interferon-gamma release assay (IGRA) are automatically entered from different interface of diverse information systems in clinical settings and public health sectors. The system provides timely warnings of drug-resistant cases, IGRA-positive cases and high-risk populations to management staff according to their responsibilities. In addition, daily scheduled analyses of laboratory quality indicators, turnaround time and visualized profiles are updated automatically.","Outside infectious disease outbreaks, ECMO for ARDS is an evidence-based, yet resource-intensive, infrequently used service that is typically available only at specialised centres. Although many new centres have been created and ECMO retrieval services are now increasingly available, access to ECMO is restricted, especially in resource-poor settings. Establishing huband-spoke models 20,21 of care, in which severely ill patients who are eligible for high-end intensive care support including ECMO are managed at the hub might enable improved stratification of critically ill patients. Well established ECMO retrieval programmes will be an important resource if patients deteriorate in regional centres. Building sustainable systems that can be used to rapidly transfer and group high numbers of critically ill patients would be important to provide high-quality ECMO care during outbreaks of emerging infectious diseases such as COVID-19.","This study was approved by the Committee of Ethics in Research of the Institute for Research &amp; Education (IDOR), Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, on September 23, 2014 (CAEE: 34179214.3.0000.5249). The consent term was waived since this was a retrospective data extraction from patients records. ","National government should also use guidance and information available with Codex Alimentarius Commission (CAC), Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), World Health Organization (WHO), and other relevant international intergovernmental organizations, including World Organization for Animal Health [formerly Office International des Epizooties (OIE)] and International Plant Protection Convention (IPPC). Accordingly appropriate programs for training, information, and capacity building should be designed. In order to perform successful risk analysis, country needs to have a well functioning food safety system, the support and participation of key stakeholders (government, industry, academia, consumers), and basic knowledge about the three main components of risk analysis.","The current state of much of the Wuhan pneumonia virus (COVID-19) research shows a regrettable lack of data sharing and considerable analytical obfuscation. This impedes global research cooperation, which is essential for tackling public health emergencies, and requires unimpeded access to data, analysis tools, and computational infrastructure. Here we show that community efforts in developing open analytical software tools over the past ten years, combined with national investments into scientific computational infrastructure, can overcome these deficiencies and provide an accessible platform for tackling global health emergencies in an open and transparent manner. Specifically, we use all COVID-19 genomic data available in the public domain so far to (1) underscore the importance of access to raw data and to (2) demonstrate that existing community efforts in curation and deployment of biomedical software can reliably support rapid, reproducible research during global health crises. All our analyses are fully documented at https://github.com/galaxyproject/SARS-CoV-2.","In conclusion, it is seen that psychological and behavioral responses to COVID-19 had been dramatic during the rising phase of the outbreak. Prevalence of moderate or severe anxiety were 4-5 times of its normal level in urban China. The majority engaged in all six recommended and avoidance behaviors. Wuhan, the epicentre and quarantined city, was significantly more responsive in the aforementioned domains than Shanghai. Tremendous government efforts in control and prevention of the disease were associated with sizable changes in face mask wearing. However, confusion about information reliability significantly fueled the public anxiety levels, and public awareness of hand hygiene was less optimal. Our results support efforts for timely dissemination of accurate and reliable information and to focus more on handwashing education. the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.","\u2022 Introduction of medical service capacity: In this modification, the maximal capacity of the medical service system is to be considered, which might be overloaded when facing a massive outbreak. This idea was first inspired by an Amateur Demonstration made by Ele laboratory (2020) on a site named \"bilibili\", and seems to be among the key features of the initial phase of the COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan. We may also allow such capacity to be time/configuration dependent to model the contribution of building the \"emergency hospitals\" in Wuhan.","We declare no competing interests. This study was approved by the ethics committee of the First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University. We thank all medical staff who are fighting against this public crisis. We also thank the hospital staff (see appendix pp 4-9 for a full list) for their efforts in collecting patient data. This study is supported by the China National Science Foundation In modern society, it is accepted that individuals have the right to die with dignity. Since 1976, in the USA, people who are incarcerated have a limited constitutional right to health care, consistent with the Eighth Amendment. At present, there are more than 2600 incarcerated men and women in the USA who have been sentenced to death, most of whom have less than a high school diploma or High School Equivalency Certificate (GED), and are disproportionately of minority racial or ethnic backgrounds (42% African-American representation on death row vs 13% African-American representation in the US census). 1 The combination of poor health status, social determinants of health, and paucity of adequate care provided in correctional facilities is driving a public health emergency, which is endangering the North American incarcerated population. We can expect the prevalence and burden of chronic illness to rise concomitantly with the growth of the ageing population in US prisons. 2 Data suggest that cancer is the leading cause of illness-related deaths in US state prisons. 2 In the absence of reform, the mass incarceration trends observed over the past three decades will substantially widen disparities, adversely affecting access to health care.","The radiology department has 65 diagnostic radiologists and 161 other staff members (trained technologists, nurses, engineers, and support staff). The equipment of the radiology department includes 12 MR scanners, 14 CT scanners, 15 systems, 32 sets of digital radiography (DR) systems (including 9 mobile bedside DR sets), and 130 imaging diagnostic workstations for PACS. Most of the equipment is distributed among four buildings at the hospital main campus. Four CT scanners, four MR scanners, and one DR are located on the first floor of the first inpatient building, and nine DR and eight digital subtraction angiography systems are located on the second floor. One CT and one MR scanner are located in the third inpatient building. One CT and one MR scanner are located in the sixth inpatient building. Two CT scanners, two MR scanners, and seven digital subtraction angiography are located in the technical building. The rest of the equipment is located in the seventh inpatient building in the branch campus.","If transdisciplinary approaches yield longer-lasting effects, make medical interventions more successful or less necessary, provide health-care access to more sectors of the community, and more effectively address economic and gender inequities than do standard biomedical interventions alone, these gains can help achieve a fundamental shift in devising and implementing disease-prevention strategies. The successes, and policy relevance, of these approaches will be key to their institutionalization (Lebel, 2004). Additionally, teams and communities of transdisciplinary researchers must communicate their successes and failures so that they are understood by a wide range of audiences and measured by appropriate indices, particularly because holistic systems-based research can take a long time to complete and tends not to make the same splash as large drug or vaccine trials. Substantial outreach and education efforts will be required to achieve these goals, which include communication with, and participation by, those whose health is being studied as well as by decision-makers at multiple levels, from emergency physicians and veterinarians to funding agencies and global policy makers.","banning all travel and all non-basic economic activities, together with the intensified use of diagnostic tests in suspected cases has proven to yield good results. 3 Also, there is an urgent need to establish a purchasing and supply channel for personal protective equipment, which is currently insufficient for health personnel who are highly exposed to and prone to contagion. The recent finding on the spreading capacity of SARS-CoV-2 by contamination of eyelashes and hair reinforces this need. 4 The proposed suppression policies will not mean the end of CoVID-19 in Spain in the initial 3-4 weeks; therefore, the development of strategies to sustain the gains is critical. A key lesson from the Asian experience is the need to create a robust surveillance system capable of collecting and reporting epidemiological data down to the individual or household level. 5 There are two pillars for the development of such a system: (1) the development and implementation of a universal mobile application for self-reporting of suspected COVID-19 symptoms as well as apps to support contact tracing efforts (eg, TraceTogether mobile app; Singapore); and (2) increased diagnostic capacity to test all individuals with symptoms for early isolation. The identification of an increase in the number of cases in an area would trigger quick remedial measures like the implementation of early and targeted suppression actions.","SARS is the first major new infectious disease of the 21st century and the Internet age, and took full advantage of the opportunities for rapid spread along international air routes. From geographic mapping to location-based alerting services, geoinformatics plays an important role in the study and control of global outbreaks like SARS. Carefully planned and designed maps are powerful decision support and spatio-temporal analysis tools. Web-based maps also allow for quick, frequent map updates based on the latest datasets, for interactivity to be incorporated into the maps (desktop GIS-like functionality, e.g., drill-down and zooming), and for wider and more rapid dissemination of information (compared to other publishing media). In this paper we have reviewed several geographic mapping efforts of SARS that we have found on the Internet. The maps described in this review employed a variety of techniques like choropleth rendering, graduated circles, graduated pie charts, buffering, thematic mapping, overlay analysis and animation to allow public health decision makers, travellers and local populations at risk to visually monitor and appreciate at a glance changes, trends and patterns buried in different online SARS datasets that were continuously varying with time during the 2003 outbreak. Some of the mapping services presented in this paper provided very detailed information down to individual street/building level (in Hong Kong). This kind of support is vital for improving global vigilance and awareness at all levels and for making well-informed decisions when designing and following up epidemic control strategies or issuing and updating travel advisories.","The FDA's CBER regulatory review staff consists of an internal multidisciplinary team of scientists, medical officers, and regulatory and public health professionals. To stay current on scientific advances and biotechnologies, the team is involved in a dynamic exchange of information with the outside scientific community through laboratory research and collaborations, participation in workshops and seminars, and engagement with national partners. The FDA also relies on the expertise of formal advisory committees, which include experts in the fields of vaccinology, microbiology, infectious diseases, immunology, biostatistics, epidemiology, and clinical trial design. In addition, CBER works closely with its counterparts in other U.S. government agencies within the Department of Health and Human Services and the U.S. Public Health Service (PHS), such as the National Vaccine Program Office, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the NIH, and the Health Resources and Services Administration. The CDC is responsible, among its other duties, for epidemiologic surveillance of disease and for support of immunization programs. Its Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices makes recommendations for vaccine use. The Director of the National Vaccine Program Office coordinates vaccine efforts throughout the PHS and other governmental agencies. The NIH is responsible for conducting and providing funds for a wide variety of biomedical research. The Health Resources and Services Administration is responsible for managing the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program. Other important collaborators inside the U.S. government involved in vaccine activities include the U.S. Department of Defense, and the Department of Veterans Affairs. Additionally, CBER works closely with its multilateral partners, notably the Pan American Health Organization and the World Health Organization (WHO), to provide assistance in regulatory capacity building. CBER has been very active in supporting the WHO's Developing Countries' Vaccine Regulators Network and the WHO's African Regional Office-led African Vaccine Regulatory Forum. As a WHO Collaborating Center, CBER contributes to a range of activities, including establishment of physical and written standards, implementation of WHO international standards, strengthening global regulatory systems, and serving as the National Regulatory Authority (NRA) of reference for WHO's vaccine prequalification program. CBER experts also contribute as members of several WHO Advisory Committees including the Global Advisory Committee on Vaccine Safety, the Polio Research Committee, the HIV Vaccine Advisory Committee, and the Expert Committee on Biological Standardization. CBER is an Essential Regulatory Laboratory in WHO's Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System. In addition, the FDA has confidentiality arrangements with many NRAs around the globe, allowing it to share information as part of its regulatory processes. These arrangements have strengthened interactions between the regulatory authorities and have contributed to improving the promotion and protection of public health globally.","This outbreak is occurring at a time when worldwide ECMO infrastructure and resources for education 9 and research 10 are considerably more evolved and organised than they were a decade ago. Most importantly, there is now substantially more evidence to support the efficacy and safety of ECMO in patients with ARDS than during previous outbreaks. [11] [12] [13] [14] Although during the 2009 influenza A(H1N1) pandemic few ECMO centres were included in the Extracorporeal Life Support Organization (ELSO) registry of active centres (figure 1), 15 many were urgently established during the outbreak. Notably, despite a steady increase in ELSO-registered centres, there are many centres that are still not registered, which makes it challenging to assess the actual global ECMO capacity and capability.","The Component Layer contains the building blocks that provide the framework for producing application functionality, but not the content. Therefore, a Component is not entirely usable on its own-it must be given a specific implementation. For instance, a Profiler Component provides an access control framework. The Component, itself, is not concerned with the specifics as to what it is controlling access. The same is true with the Business Rules Component. This Component only provides the framework, language and inference engine to enable rules-based logic. It does not provide any actual rules. It is through the use of these common components that the maintainability requirement is addressed; these components form the core of the underlying structure of each application.","From lessons learned in responding to other emerging diseases such as SARS and avian influenza, we believe that laboratory capacity for rapid diagnosis is pivotal to outbreak response. 6 After China released the whole genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2 on January 10, Taiwan CDC's national reference laboratory immediately set up the real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test for the virus. 7, 8 The laboratory protocol and reagents, including primers, probes, and positive control, were then distributed to designated laboratories. To expand laboratory capacity, Taiwan CDC started a capacity building program via the national laboratory diagnostic network after CECC was activated. By February 21, Taiwan had 27 laboratories that could perform up to 2250 molecular diagnostic tests for SARS-CoV-2 a day.","A DT screening center should be located in an area remote from a populated area. A large parking lot with enough space is preferred but it can be implemented even in a small parking area if it is operated by a reservation system. The entrance and exit should be strictly guided and movement also should be controlled at every DT step. The brief flow of the DT center is as follows: Entrance \u2013 Registration \u2013 Examination \u2013 Specimen collection \u2013 Instructions \u2013 Exit (Fig. 1). The entire service is provided to the testees without leaving their cars. All communication can be made by mobile phone except for the specimen collection. The use of an electronic payment system allows minimal contact between the testees and staff. Either an open tent or temporary building can be used for work booths. While an open tent type has the advantages of low cost and natural ventilation, it is vulnerable to the outdoor environment, including weather conditions. A temporary building type is more secure for healthcare workers (HCWs) and equipment within the facility against outdoor conditions. However, it requires higher initial cost. A temporary building type can be used as either a clean or contaminated zone, depending on the design of the process. Personal protective equipment (PPE) of inner and outer gloves, N95 respirator, eye\u2013shield/face shield/goggles, and hooded coverall/gown is required for the HCWs who may have direct contact with testees. Nitrile or latex gloves are preferred to vinyl or polyethylene gloves by virtue of their better durability. Composition of PPE can be adjusted depending on the level of contact with the testees and/or supply capacities.5 Continuous work over 4 hours wearing a N95 respirator should be avoided.56","The National Outbreak Control Taskforce (NOCT): There was an urgent need for information to support the decision-making process of the NOCT, which was formed by the SCH to respond to the outbreak. As there were only a small number of reported MERS-CoV cases, the main information sources used by the decision-makers were WHO, KSA, and HPA in the UK, and the media. This information served as a basis for the development of the risk assessment plan and the roadmap for a response. The roadmap was developed by WHO and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) providing technical support in response to Qatar\u2019s request. The roadmap emphasized: enhanced surveillance; case management, isolation, infection prevention and control; health education; and, risk communication. Despite these efforts, public fear was palpable due to the approaching Hajj season. Therefore, a significant part of the technical discussion that involved the Medical Committee for the Hajj focused on considering potential epidemic scenarios.","The first challenge is that incentives across the analytical pipeline are misaligned. 2 Academics are largely incentivised to write scientific articles and to fund their work through individually led grants. These activities are not conducive to the rapid response to a crisis (although many academics do respond), or to sustained engagement and training of corporate and government teams. Companies are incentivised by profit, and are rightly beholden to national regulatory frameworks and the public with respect to the data they collect. Ministries of health have complex relationships with both the companies that have access to personal data and with the public. They face many competing health priorities and complex political choices when it comes to open sharing of epidemiological data. Disease control programmes are often hampered by limited capacity and high turnover of personnel, and health workers on the ground during an epidemic have their hands full responding to the immediate crisis and might not be trained or incentivised to report epidemiological data accurately. Taken together, these incentive structures create multiple barriers to rapid data generation and the development of streamlined epidemic forecasting systems that use these new data types.","Once COVID-19 has begun to spread within a community, additional efforts to reduce the introduction of the virus into the building can include limiting visitors to the long-term care building. Staff could be screened upon entry for fever or respiratory symptoms. These measures would be in addition to active surveillance for an elevated temperature and even mild respiratory symptoms among residents. Early suspicion and detection of a case will help identify which resources can be deployed to further prevent or reduce the spread of the disease. Hand hygiene remains among the most fundamental measures to prevent disease transmission. Staff, residents, and visitors should all receive instruction on how to properly wash their hands with soap and water. Alcohol hand sanitizer should be available outside of every resident room, as well as in workspaces, dining areas, and other common areas throughout the building. Finally, environmental services should be engaged to perform at least daily cleaning with Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) registered hospital grade disinfectants. These will be paramount to containing the disease, particularly in high traffic areas (eg, dining halls, treatment areas, living spaces, etc.) where residents congregate, and frequently touched surfaces.","Didier Pittet works with WHO in the context of the WHO initiative 'Private Organizations for Patient Safety -Hand Hygiene'. The aim of this WHO initiative is to harness industry strengths to align and improve implementation of WHO recommendations for hand hygiene in health care indifferent parts of the world, including in least developed countries. In this instance, companies/industry with a focus on hand hygiene and infection control related advancement have the specific aim of improving access to affordable hand hygiene products as well as through education and research. All listed authors declare no financial support, grants, financial interests or consultancy that could lead to conflicts of interest.","Disease Surveillance and Notification Officers, who are employed by the State Ministry of Health and familiar with the communities in this study, performed specimen and data collection. Symptoms considered were derived in accordance with other ARI surveillance efforts: sore throat, fever, couch, running nose, vomiting, body ache, leg pain, nausea, chills, shortness of breath [10, 26]. Gender and age, type of residential area (rural/urban), education level, proximity of residence to livestock, proximity to an untarred road and number of people who sleep in same room, were all recorded. The general difference between the two settings was that those from the hospital had severe illnesses, while those from the community were generally \u201chealthy\u201d but exhibiting ARI symptoms (i.e. mild illness).","Permission to conduct the study and to obtain access for the purpose of gathering the data were obtained from by the Ethics Committee of Harbin Medical University(HRBYKD-A26). Written, informed consent was obtained from all the participants, or from their legal guardians, or caregivers prior to enrolment in the study.","The second building block is financing. Before the decree, central government adopted a series of financial measures to support the health system and protect businesses. It had allocated \u20ac2800 million to all regions for health services and created a new fund with \u20ac1000 million for priority health interventions. 4 However, these amounts need to be seen against the background of almost a decade of austerity from which the health system has yet to recover. 5 Third, in service delivery, the national Ministry of Health has developed a set of clinical protocols, published on its website. Additional advice is published by certain regions and updated, in some cases, on a daily basis. 6 Health facilities in the worst affected regions are struggling, with inadequate intensive care capacity and an insufficient number of ventilators in particular. Both Catalonia and Madrid 7 have cancelled non-emergency surgery and cleared beds where possible. COVID-19 telephone help lines have long delays or have simply collapsed in some regions. The new decree allows the regions to take over management of private health services while military installations will be used for public health purposes.","We used the open-access Clinical Characterization Protocol for Severe Emerging Infections of the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium, supported by WHO, 12 which has been updated in response to COVID-19. This study was approved by the French Ethics Committee, and written informed consent was obtained from each patient involved or their next of kin.","The first inpatient building, located next to the emergency department, was reconfigured to handle cases of COVID-19. Fever tents were set up by the emergency department in the emergency department parking lot to separate normal emergency patients from patients with symptoms or exposure history suspicious of COVID-19. We established separate means of access between fever tents and between the fever examination areas of the radiology department to avoid cross-contamination.","A further issue is production capacities of established methods, which are often insufficient to support global vaccination. Even if the potential threat is known and vaccine manufacturing technologies are established, like for pandemic influenza vaccine, production capacity to meet peak demands during a pandemic remains problematic. Thanks to efforts coordinated by the WHO, the potential production capacity for pandemic influenza vaccines in 2015 could in theory support the vaccination of 43% of the population with two doses of vaccine (16). However, the global distribution of vaccine production is far from equal between industrial nations and the developing world: according to a survey made in 2015, only 5% of influenza vaccine doses were distributed among Southeast Asia, Eastern Mediterranean, and Africa WHO regions, which comprise about half of the world's population (17). In addition, most currently licensed vaccines would take 5\u20133 months between identification of a pandemic influenza and vaccine distribution, which would give a pandemic virus ample time for global spread. Hence, technologies that enable fast production of large amounts of vaccine are direly needed in the face of pandemic threats.","A crucial aspect of being prepared for future epidemics is sustained ongo- ing research of emerging infectious diseases even at 'times of peace' when such viruses do not pose an active threat. Our results demonstrate that research on previous coronaviruses, such as SARS and MERS, was conducted by a relatively small number of researchers centered in a small number of countries, suggesting that such research could be better encouraged. We propose that regardless of the fate of COVID-19 in the near future, sustained research efforts should be encouraged to be better prepared for the next outbreak."],"title":["Chapter 22 Issues on Source, Access, Extent, and Quality of Information Available Among Pharmacists and Pharmacy Personnel to Practice Effectively","Phase adjusted estimation of the number of 2019 novel coronavirus cases in Wuhan, China","Feasibility of a randomized controlled trial to assess treatment of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection in Saudi Arabia: a survey of physicians","Planning and provision of ECMO services for severe ARDS during the COVID-19 pandemic and other outbreaks of emerging infectious diseases","Health security capacities in the context of COVID-19 outbreak: an analysis of International Health Regulations annual report data from 182 countries","Laboratory readiness and response for novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) in expert laboratories in 30 EU/EEA countries, January 2020","Poster Sessions","Microbial molecular markers and epidemiological surveillance in the era of high throughput sequencing: an update from the IMMEM-10 conference","Building resilience against biological hazards and pandemics: COVID-19 and its implications for the Sendai Framework","Looming threat of COVID-19 infection in Africa: act collectively, and fast","All Hands on Deck: Transdisciplinary Approaches to Emerging Infectious Disease","Systematic review and critical appraisal of prediction models for diagnosis and prognosis of COVID-19 infection","Human genomics and preparedness for infectious threats","Feasibility of a randomized controlled trial to assess treatment of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection in Saudi Arabia: a survey of physicians","Hindsight: A re-analysis of the severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak in Beijing","A Strategic Vaccine Facility for the UK","What is required to prevent a second major outbreak of the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 upon lifting the metropolitan-wide quarantine of Wuhan city, China","Looming threat of COVID-19 infection in Africa: act collectively, and fast","Using predicted imports of 2019-nCoV cases to determine locations that may not be identifying all imported cases","Building resilience against biological hazards and pandemics: COVID-19 and its implications for the Sendai Framework","A Review of Pediatric Critical Care in Resource-Limited Settings: A Look at Past, Present, and Future Directions","The Effect of Large-Scale Anti-Contagion Policies on the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Pandemic","Poster Sessions","Planning and provision of ECMO services for severe ARDS during the COVID-19 pandemic and other outbreaks of emerging infectious diseases","Viral detection profile in children with severe acute respiratory infection","Chapter 5 Role of risk analysis and risk communication in food safety management","No more business as usual: agile and effective responses to emerging pathogen threats require open data and open analytics","Psychological responses, behavioral changes and public perceptions during the early phase of the COVID-19 outbreak in China: a population based cross-sectional survey","Prediction of the COVID-19 outbreak based on a realistic stochastic model","Cancer patients in SARS-CoV-2 infection: a nationwide analysis in China","The Battle Against Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19): Emergency Management and Infection Control in a Radiology Department","All Hands on Deck: Transdisciplinary Approaches to Emerging Infectious Disease","Experts\u2019 request to the Spanish Government: move Spain towards complete lockdown","Descriptive review of geographic mapping of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) on the Internet","79 Regulation and Testing of Vaccines","Planning and provision of ECMO services for severe ARDS during the COVID-19 pandemic and other outbreaks of emerging infectious diseases","The ALPHA Project: An architecture for leveraging public health applications","Initial rapid and proactive response for the COVID-19 outbreak \u2014 Taiwan's experience","Drive-Through Screening Center for COVID-19: a Safe and Efficient Screening System against Massive Community Outbreak","How Do the First Days Count?

The aim was to find out what nursing staff and nursing students in the college knew about MERS- CoV. While most gaps in knowledge were addressed after an intense information seminar, other learning needs were identified and responded to. The Task Force developed mandatory information sessions for all nursing faculty, students and staff. All staff were informed by email, letters and posters.

Traditional notification of demographic and clinical information, about individuals with selected (notifiable) infectious diseases, allows appropriate public health action and is protected by public health and privacy legislation, but is slow and insensitive. Big data\u2013based electronic surveillance, by commercial bodies and government agencies (for profit or population control), which draws on a plethora of internet- and mobile device\u2013based sources, has been widely accepted, if not universally welcomed. Similar anonymous digital sources also contain syndromic information, which can be analysed, using customised algorithms, to rapidly predict infectious disease outbreaks, but the data are nonspecific and predictions sometimes misleading. However, public health authorities could use these online sources, in combination with de-identified personal health data, to provide more accurate and earlier warning of infectio...","Two months after the emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the possibility of established and widespread community transmission in the European Union and European Economic Area (EU/EEA) is becoming more likely. We provide scenarios for use in preparedness for a possible widespread epidemic. The EU/EEA is moving towards the \u2018limited sustained transmission\u2019 phase. We propose actions to prepare for potential mitigation phases and coordinate efforts to protect the health of citizens.","The current state of much of the Wuhan pneumonia virus (COVID-19) research shows a regrettable lack of data sharing and considerable analytical obfuscation. This impedes global research cooperation, which is essential for tackling public health emergencies, and requires unimpeded access to data, analysis tools, and computational infrastructure. Here we show that community efforts in developing open analytical software tools over the past ten years, combined with national investments into scientific computational infrastructure, can overcome these deficiencies and provide an accessible platform for tackling global health emergencies in an open and transparent manner. Specifically, we use all COVID-19 genomic data available in the public domain so far to (1) underscore the importance of access to raw data and to (2) demonstrate that existing community efforts in curation and deployment of biomedical software can reliably support rapid, reproducible research during global health crises. A...","Summary Background The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic has spread from China to 25 countries. Local cycles of transmission have already occurred in 12 countries after case importation. In Africa, Egypt has so far confirmed one case. The management and control of COVID-19 importations heavily rely on a country's health capacity. Here we evaluate the preparedness and vulnerability of African countries against their risk of importation of COVID-19. Methods We used data on the volume of air travel departing from airports in the infected provinces in China and directed to Africa to estimate the risk of importation per country. We determined the country's capacity to detect and respond to cases with two indicators: preparedness, using the WHO International Health Regulations Monitoring and Evaluation Framework; and vulnerability, using the Infectious Disease Vulnerability Index. Countries were clustered according to the Chinese regions contributing most to their risk. Find...","ABSTRACTThe outbreak of pneumonia originating in Wuhan, China, has generated 830 confirmed cases, including 26 deaths, as of 24 January 2020. The virus (2019-nCoV) has spread elsewhere in China and to other countries, including South Korea, Thailand, Japan and USA. Fortunately, there has not yet been evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission outside of China. Here we assess the risk of sustained transmission whenever the coronavirus arrives in other countries. Data describing the times from symptom onset to hospitalisation for 47 patients infected in the current outbreak are used to generate an estimate for the probability that an imported case is followed by sustained human-to-human transmission. Under the assumptions that the imported case is representative of the patients in China, and that the 2019-nCoV is similarly transmissible to the SARS coronavirus, the probability that an imported case is followed by sustained human-to-human transmission is 0.37. However, if the mean ...","Abstract The worldwide outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) raises concerns of widespread panic and anxiety in individuals subjected to the real or perceived threat of the virus. Compared to general populations, patients who are institutionalized in a closed unit are also very vulnerable to COVID-19 infection and complications. This crisis touched on difficult issues of not only psychiatric care and ethics, but also psychological impacts to psychiatric care givers. In this Viewpoint, we address both physical and biopsychosocial aspects of this infection, as well as the psychoneuroimmunity of preventive strategies of healthy lifestyle, regular exercise, balanced nutrition, quality sleep and a strong connection with people. Social distancing and wearing masks might help us from pathogen exposure, yet such these measures also prevent us from expressing compassion and friendliness. Therefore, all forms of psychological support should be routinely implemented not only to consider...","The outbreak of pneumonia originating in Wuhan, China, has generated 24,500 confirmed cases, including 492 deaths, as of 5 February 2020. The virus (2019-nCoV) has spread elsewhere in China and to 24 countries, including South Korea, Thailand, Japan and USA. Fortunately, there has only been limited human-to-human transmission outside of China. Here, we assess the risk of sustained transmission whenever the coronavirus arrives in other countries. Data describing the times from symptom onset to hospitalisation for 47 patients infected early in the current outbreak are used to generate an estimate for the probability that an imported case is followed by sustained human-to-human transmission. Under the assumptions that the imported case is representative of the patients in China, and that the 2019-nCoV is similarly transmissible to the SARS coronavirus, the probability that an imported case is followed by sustained human-to-human transmission is 0.41 (credible interval [0.27, 0.55]). Howev...","Viral infections, such as Ebola, severe acute respiratory syndrome/Middle East respiratory syndrome and West Nile virus have emerged as a serious health threat with no effective therapies. These infections have little commercial potential and are not a high priority for the pharmaceutical industry. However, the academic community has been active in this area for many years. The challenge is how to take this academic virology knowledge into a drug discovery and development domain. One approach is the use of consortia and public\u2013private partnerships \u2013 this article highlights ongoing efforts in the USA. Public funds, such as those from government sources, can support research efforts that do not to appear to have commercial value. The key to success is finding a way to combine the different cultural and operational values and reward systems into a productive collaboration to identify new antivirals.","Ten years have elapsed since the World Health Organization issued its first global alert for an unexplained illness named severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). The anniversary provides an opportunity to reflect on the international response to this new global microbial threat. While global surveillance and response capacity for public health threats have been strengthened, critical gaps remain. Of 194 World Health Organization member states that signed on to the International Health Regulations (2005), &lt;20% had achieved compliance with the core capacities required by the deadline in June 2012. Lessons learned from the global SARS outbreak highlight the need to avoid complacency, strengthen efforts to improve global capacity to address the next pandemic using all available 21st century tools, and support research to develop new treatment options, countermeasures, and insights while striving to address the global inequities that are the root cause of many of these challenges.","Recent outbreaks of infectious pathogens such as Zika, Ebola, and COVID-19 have underscored the need for the dependable availability of vaccines against emerging infectious diseases (EIDs). The cost and risk of R&amp;D programs and uniquely unpredictable demand for EID vaccines have discouraged vaccine developers, and government and nonprofit agencies have been unable to provide timely or sufficient incentives for their development and sustained supply. We analyze the economic returns of a portfolio of EID vaccine assets, and find that under realistic financing assumptions, the expected returns are significantly negative, implying that the private sector is unlikely to address this need without public-sector intervention. We have sized the financing deficit for this portfolio and propose several potential solutions, including price increases, enhanced public-private partnerships, and subscription models through which individuals would pay annual fees to obtain access to a portfolio of vacc...","Laboratory researchers and students may expose to hazardous and toxic chemicals. Implementation of the Occupational Health, Safety, and Environment Management System (OHSEMS) has become a critical aspect in higher education. This study presents an overview of the evaluation of the implementation of the OHSEMS in higher education laboratories. The implementation of the OHSEMS is to prevent occupational accidents in the laboratory. The study design is a semiquantitative descriptive study. The aim of the study is to evaluate the implementation of the OHSEMS in higher education institution laboratories by evaluating the percentages of OHSEMS compliance in higher education laboratories. Five aspects are evaluated: occupational health, safety, and environment (OHSE) policy and commitment, planning, implementation, evaluation, and management review. The result shows that the average compliance with the OHSE policy and commitment aspect is 59.4% and for the planning, implementation, evaluation...","The COVID-19 pandemic is overwhelming healthcare systems worldwide. A significant portion of COVID-19 patients develop pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), necessitating ventilator support. Some health systems do not have the capacity to accommodate this surge in ventilator demand, leading to shortages and inevitable mortality. Some clinicians have, of necessity, jerry-rigged ventilators to support multiple patients, but these devices lack protected air streams or individualized controls for each patient. Moreover, some have not been tested under conditions of ARDS. We have developed the Individualized System for Augmenting Ventilator Efficacy (iSAVE), a rapidly deployable platform to more safely use a single ventilator to simultaneously support multiple critically-ill patients. The iSAVE enables patient-specific volume and pressure control and incorporates safety features to mitigate cross-contamination between patients and flow changes due to patient interdepende...","The rapid emergence of clinical trials on COVID-19 stimulated a wave of discussion in scientific community. We reviewed the characteristics of interventional trials from Chinese Clinical Trial Registration (ChiCTR) and ClinicalTrials.gov. A total of 171 COVID-19-related interventional trials were identified on Feb 22nd, 2020. These trials are classified into 4 categories based on treatment modalities, including chemical drugs, biological therapies, traditional Chinese medicine treatments and other therapies. Our analysis focused on the issues of stage, design, randomization, blinding, primary endpoints definition and sample size of these trials. We found some studies with potential defects including unreasonable design, inappropriate primary endpoint definition, insufficient sample size and ethical issue. Clinical trials on COVID-19 should be designed based on scientific rules, ethics and benefits for patients.","Information about the open-access article 'Wuhan novel coronavirus 2019nCoV' in DOAJ.

In light of the outbreak of 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), we aimed to review existing health security capacities against public health risks and events. Methods We used 18 indicators from the IHR State Party Annual Reporting (SPAR) tool and associated data from national SPAR reports to develop five indices: (1) prevent, (2) detect, (3) respond, (4) enabling function, and (5) operational readiness. We used SPAR 2018 data for all of the indicators and categorised countries into five levels across the indices, in which level 1 indicated the lowest level of national capacity and level 5 the highest. We also analysed data at the regional level (using the six geographical WHO regions). Findings Of 182 countries, 52 (28%) had prevent capacities at leve...","Information about the open-access article 'Statistics-Based Predictions of Coronavirus Epidemic Spreading in Mainland China' in DOAJ.

Palliative care teams may consider expanding their communication training and skillsets to help families consider caring ways to communicate with their children and grandchildren about the coronavirus. Palliative care teams are wise to encourage families to ground their communication with children on key values: honesty and trust, self-compassion, safety, sensitivity, connection, preparedness, community-building, recognition of death as a part of the lifecycle, and legacy.","Abstract Introduction The COVID-19 pandemic is stressing healthcare systems throughout the world. Significant numbers of patients are being admitted to the hospital with severe illness, often in the setting of advanced age and underlying co-morbidities. Therefore, palliative care is an important part of the response to this pandemic. The Seattle area and UW Medicine have been on the forefront of the pandemic in the US. Methods UW Medicine developed a strategy to implement a palliative care response for a multi-hospital healthcare system that incorporates conventional capacity, contingency capacity, and crisis capacity. The strategy was developed by our palliative care programs with input from the healthcare system leadership. Results In this publication, we share our multi-faceted strategy to implement high-quality palliative care in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic that incorporates conventional, contingency, and crisis capacity and focuses on the areas of the hospital caring for ...","The sudden outbreak of novel coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) increased the diagnostic burden of radiologists. In the time of an epidemic crisis, we hoped artificial intelligence (AI) to help reduce physician workload in regions with the outbreak, and improve the diagnosis accuracy for physicians before they could acquire enough experience with the new disease. Here, we present our experience in building and deploying an AI system that automatically analyzes CT images to detect COVID-19 pneumonia features. Different from conventional medical AI, we were dealing with an epidemic crisis. Working in an interdisciplinary team of over 30 people with medical and / or AI background, geographically distributed in Beijing and Wuhan, we were able to overcome a series of challenges in this particular situation and deploy the system in four weeks. Using 1,136 training cases (723 positives for COVID-19) from five hospitals, we were able to achieve a sensitivity of 0.974 and specificity of 0.922 on the t...","ABSTRACTOn December 31, 2019, the World Health Organization was notified about a cluster of pneumonia of unknown aetiology in the city of Wuhan, China. Chinese authorities later identified a new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) as the causative agent of the outbreak. As of January 23, 2020, 655 cases have been confirmed in China and several other countries. Understanding the transmission characteristics and the potential for sustained human-to-human transmission of 2019-nCoV is critically important for coordinating current screening and containment strategies, and determining whether the outbreak constitutes a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC). We performed stochastic simulations of early outbreak trajectories that are consistent with the epidemiological findings to date. We found the basic reproduction number, R0, to be around 2.2 (90% high density interval 1.4\u20143.8), indicating the potential for sustained human-to-human transmission. Transmission characteristics appear t...","Background: SARS-CoV-2 is a novel human coronavirus, there is no specific antiviral drugs. It has been proved that host-cell-expressed CD147 could bind spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 and involve in host cell invasion. Antibody against CD147 could block the infection of SARS-CoV-2. We aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of meplazumab, a humanized anti-CD147 antibody, as add-on therapy in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. Methods: All patients received recommended strategy from Diagnosis and Treatment for 2019 Novel Coronavirus Diseases released by National Health Commission of China. Eligible patients were add-on administered 10 mg meplazumab intravenously at days 1, 2, and 5. Patients hospitalized in the same period were observed as concurrent control. The endpoints include virological clearance rate, case severity, chest radiographic, and laboratory test. This trial was approved by the Ethics Committee of Institution at the Tangdu hospital, and registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT...","Abstract We present here the proceedings of the 5th seminar on emerging infectious diseases, held in Paris on March 22nd, 2016, with seven priority proposals that can be outlined as follows: encourage research on the prediction, screening and early detection of new risks of infection; develop research and surveillance concerning transmission of pathogens between animals and humans, with their reinforcement in particular in intertropical areas (\u201chot-spots\u201d) via public support; pursue aid development and support in these areas of prevention and training for local health personnel, and foster risk awareness in the population; ensure adapted patient care in order to promote adherence to treatment and to epidemic propagation reduction measures; develop greater awareness and better education among politicians and healthcare providers, in order to ensure more adapted response to new types of crises; modify the logic of governance, drawing from all available modes of communication and incorpor...","Objective: To review and critically appraise published and preprint reports of models that aim to predict either (i) presence of existing COVID-19 infection, or (ii) future complications in individuals already diagnosed with COVID-19. Any models to identify subjects at risk for COVID-19 in the general population were also included. Design: Rapid systematic review and critical appraisal of prediction models for diagnosis or prognosis of COVID-19 infection. Data sources: PubMed, EMBASE via Ovid, Arxiv, medRxiv and bioRxiv until 13th March 2020. Study selection: Studies that developed or validated a multivariable COVID-19 related prediction model. Two authors independently screened titles and abstracts. Data extraction: Data from included studies were extracted independently by at least two authors based on the CHARMS checklist, and risk of bias was assessed using PROBAST. Data were extracted on various domains including the participants, predictors, outcomes, data analysis, and predictio...","","BACKGROUND: In response to global concerns about the largest Ebola virus disease (EVD), outbreak to-date in West Africa documented healthcare associated transmission and the risk of global spread, the International Society of Chemotherapy (ISC) Infection Control Working Group created an Ebola Infection Control Readiness Checklist to assess the preparedness of institutions around the globe. We report data from the electronic checklist that was disseminated to medical professionals from October to December 2014 and identify action needed towards better preparedness levels. FINDINGS: Data from 192 medical professionals (one third from Africa) representing 125 hospitals in 45 countries around the globe were obtained through a specifically developed electronic survey. The survey contained 76 specific questions in 7 major sections: Administrative/operational support; Communications; Education and audit; Human resources, Supplies, Infection Prevention and Control practices and Clinical manage...","Abstract Background With its epicenter in Wuhan, China, the COVID-19 outbreak was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO). While many countries have implemented flight restrictions to China, an increasing number of cases with or without travel background to China are confirmed daily. These developments support concerns on possible unidentified and unreported international COVID-19 cases, which could lead to new local disease epicenters. Methods We have analyzed all available data on the development of international COVID-19 cases from January 20th, 2020 until February 18th, 2020. COVID-19 cases with and without travel history to China were divided into cohorts according to the Healthcare Access and Quality Index (HAQ-Index) of each country. Chi-square and Post-hoc testing were performed. Results While COVID-19 cases with travel history to China seem to peak for each HAQ-cohort, the number of non-travel related COVID-19 cases seem to continuously increase in the HAQ-c...","Since the first identified individual of 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) infection on Jan 20, 2020 in South Korea, the number of confirmed cases rapidly increased. As of Feb 26, 2020, 1,261 cases of COVID-19 including 12 deaths were confirmed in South Korea. Using the incidence data of COVID-19, we estimate the reproduction number at 1.5 (95% CI: 1.4-1.6), which indicates sustained transmission and support the implementation of social distancing measures to rapidly control the outbreak.","Seasonal variation in COVID-19 incidence could impact the trajectory of the pandemic. Using global line-list data on COVID-19 cases reported until 29th February 2020 and global gridded temperature data, and after adjusting for surveillance capacity and time since first imported case, higher average temperature was strongly associated with lower COVID-19 incidence for temperatures of 1\u00b0C and higher. However, temperature explained a relatively modest amount of the total variation in COVID-19 incidence. These preliminary findings support stringent containment efforts in Europe and elsewhere.","COVID-19 is an acute respiratory disease that has been classified as a pandemic by the World Health Organization. Information regarding this particular disease is limited, however, it is known to have high mortality rates, particularly among individuals with preexisting medical conditions. Creating models to identify individuals who are at the greatest risk for severe complications due to COVID-19 will be useful to help for outreach campaigns in mitigating the diseases worst effects. While information specific to COVID-19 is limited, a model using complications due to other upper respiratory infections can be used as a proxy to help identify those individuals who are at the greatest risk. We present the results for three models predicting such complications, with each model having varying levels of predictive effectiveness at the expense of ease of implementation.","The rapid spread of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) presents China with a critical challenge. As normal capacity of the Chinese hospitals is exceeded, healthcare professionals struggling to manage this unprecedented crisis face the difficult question of how best to coordinate the medical resources used in highly separated locations. Responding rapidly to this crisis, the National Telemedicine Center of China (NTCC), located in Zhengzhou, Henan Province, has established the Emergency Telemedicine Consultation System (ETCS), a telemedicine-enabled outbreak alert and response network. ETCS is built upon a doctor-to-doctor (D2D) approach, in which health services can be accessed remotely through terminals across hospitals. The system architecture of ETCS comprises three major architectural layers: (1) telemedicine service platform layer, (2) telemedicine cloud layer, and (3) telemedicine service application layer. Our ETCS has demonstrated substantial benefits in terms of the effective...","In response to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak, the Chinese Government has ordered a nationwide school closure as an emergency measure to prevent spreading of the infection. Public activities are discouraged. The Ministry of Education estimates that more than 220 million children and adolescents are confined to their homes; this includes 180 million primary and secondary students and 47 million preschool children).1 Thanks to the strong administrative system in China, the emergency home schooling plan has been rigorously implemented.2 Massive efforts are being made by schools and teachers at all levels to create online courses and deliver them through TV broadcasts and the internet in record time. The new virtual semester has just started in many parts of the country, and various courses are offered online in a well organised manner. These actions are helping to alleviate many parents' concerns about their children's educational attainment by ensuring that school learn...","Background: We evaluated if interventions aimed at air travellers can delay establishment of a SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in a previously unaffected country. Methods: For countries with no sustained SARS-CoV-2 transmission and with no shared border with affected regions we simulated arriving infected air travellers. We assessed the effectiveness of syndromic screening at departure and/or arrival &amp; traveller sensitisation to the COVID-2019-like symptoms with the aim to trigger rapid self-isolation and reporting on symptom onset to enable contact tracing. We assumed that syndromic screening would reduce the number of infected arrivals and that traveller sensitisation reduce the average number of secondary cases. We report the minimal expected delay achievable in 50% (75% &amp; 97.5%) of simulations. In the simulations we account for uncertainty in the number of secondary cases in the absence of air traveller targeted interventions and the arrival times of infected cases and also present sensitivity...","","Abstract Progressive immune-associated injury is a hallmark of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). Viral evasion of innate immunity, hypercytokinemia and systemic immunopathology in the SARS coronavirus (SARS CoV) infected host have been suggested as possible mechanisms for the cause of severe pathology and morbidity in SARS patients. The molecular and cellular basis for how SARS CoV impacts the host immune system resulting in severe SARS, however, has not been elucidated. The variable clinical course of SARS may be the result of complex programs of host responses against the infectious agent. Therefore, the systematic analysis of innate and adaptive immune responses to SARS CoV is imperative in building as complete an immunological model as possible of host immunity and inflammatory responses during illness. Here we review recent advances in SARS immunopathogenesis research and present a summary of our findings regarding host responses in SARS patients. We contend that dysregula...","Abstract Background The novel coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19), which was first detected in Wuhan City, has now became a pandemic that affecting patients around the world. Particularly, the community patient population are at high risk of infection and are facing potential failure of proper medication use during the pandemic. Objective To discuss community pharmacists\u2019 role and the content of pharmaceutical care (PC) during the novel coronavirus pandemic to promote effective prevention and control and safe drug use of the community patient population. Method Collect and summarize the experience Chinese community pharmacies gained from providing pharmacy services during the COVID-19 outbreak, and taking the PC needs into consideration, analyze and discuss the methods and strategies that community pharmacies and pharmacists shall use to provide PC during the pandemic. Results Community pharmacy management teams shall support PC services by providing adequate supply of COVID-19 related me...","ABSTRACT Within weeks, COVID-19 has transformed our practice of palliative care and clinical medicine as we know it. Telemedicine has emerged as a critical technology to bring medical care to patients while attempting to reduce the transmission of COVID-19 among patients, families, and clinicians. It is also increasingly necessary to preserve scarce resources like personal protective equipment. In this article, we share just-in-time tips to support palliative care clinicians and program leaders in providing the best care possible by telemedicine. These quick, practical tips cover telemedicine set-up, patient considerations, and clinician considerations. Next steps include ensuring equitable access to affordable telemedicine technology for vulnerable populations through creative solutions and financing, and dedicated attention to telemedicine evaluation and quality improvement.","As of March 5, 2020, there has been sustained local transmission of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Hong Kong, Singapore, and Japan.1 Containment strategies seem to have prevented smaller transmission chains from amplifying into widespread community transmission. The health systems in these locations have generally been able to adapt,2 , 3 but their resilience could be affected if the COVID-19 epidemic continues for many more months and increasing numbers of people require services. We outline some of the core dimensions of these resilient health systems4 and their responses to the COVID-19 epidemic. First, after variable periods of adaptation, the three locations took actions to manage the outbreak of a new pathogen. Surveillance systems were readjusted to identify potential cases while public health staff identified their contacts. National laboratory networks developed diagnostic tests once the COVID-19 genetic sequences were published5 and laboratory testing capacity was inc...","Abstract 2020 has become the year of coping with COVID-19. This year was to be the \u201csuper year\u201d for sustainability, a year of strengthening global actions to accelerate the transformations required for achieving the 2030 agenda. We argue that 2020 can and must be a year of both. Thus we call for more utilisation of the health-emergency disaster risk management (Health-EDRM) framework to complement current responses to COVID-19 and the patent risk of similar phenomena in the future. To make our case, we examine current responses to COVID-19 and their implications for the SFDRR. We argue that current mechanisms and strategies for disaster resilience, as outlined in the SFDRR, can enhance responses to epidemics or global pandemics such as COVID-19. In this regard, we make several general and DRR-specific recommendations. These recommendations concern knowledge and science provision in understanding disaster and health-related emergency risks, the extension of disaster risk governance to m...","Viruses are evolving at an alarming rate, spreading and inconspicuously adapting to cutting-edge therapies. Therefore, the search for rapid, informative and reliable diagnostic methods is becoming urgent as ever. Conventional clinical tests (PCR, serology, etc.) are being continually optimized, yet provide very limited data. Could high throughput sequencing (HTS) become the future gold standard in molecular diagnostics of viral infections? Compared to conventional clinical tests, HTS is universal and more precise at profiling pathogens. Nevertheless, it has not yet been widely accepted as a diagnostic tool, owing primarily to its high cost and the complexity of sample preparation and data analysis. Those obstacles must be tackled to integrate HTS into daily clinical practice. For this, three objectives are to be achieved: (1) designing and assessing universal protocols for library preparation, (2) assembling purpose-specific pipelines, and (3) building computational infrastructure to s...","Coronaviruses (CoVs) have formerly been regarded as relatively harmless respiratory pathogens to humans. However, two outbreaks of severe respiratory tract infection, caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), as a result of zoonotic CoVs crossing the species barrier, caused high pathogenicity and mortality rates in human populations. This brought CoVs global attention and highlighted the importance of controlling infectious pathogens at international borders. In this review, we focus on our current understanding of the epidemiology, pathogenesis, prevention, and treatment of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, as well as provides details on the pivotal structure and function of the spike proteins (S proteins) on the surface of each of these viruses. For building up more suitable animal models, we compare the current animal models recapitulating pathogenesis and summarize the potential role of host receptor...","Overview Avian influenza is a disease of birds, caused by a type A influenza virus. The subtype H5N1 avian influenza occurs primarily in birds and infection varies from mild disease with little or no mortality to a highly fatal, rapidly spreading epidemic (highly pathogenic avian influenza). It is extremely rare for cats to be infected and there are only very few confirmed reports of the disease in cats in Europe. Infection Cats can be infected via the respiratory and oral routes (eg, by eating infected birds). The key precondition for infection is that the cat lives in an area where H5N1 virus infection has been confirmed in birds. Additionally, the cat should have had outdoor access to an environment where waterfowl is present, or contact with poultry or uncooked poultry meat, or close contact with an H5N1-infected, sick cat during the first week of infection. Clinical suspicion Clinical signs in cats may include fever, lethargy, dyspnoea, conjunctivitis and rapid death. Neurological...","To provide convenient access to epidemiological data on the coronavirus outbreak, we developed an R package, nCov2019 (https://github.com/GuangchuangYu/nCov2019). Besides detailed real-time statistics, it offers access to three data sources with detailed daily statistics from December 1, 2019, for 43 countries and more than 500 Chinese cities. We also developed a web app (http://www.bcloud.org/e/) with interactive plots and simple time-series forecasts. These analytics tools could be useful in informing the public and studying how this and similar viruses spread in populous countries.","BACKGROUND: Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a contagious viral illness first recognized in late 2002. It has now been documented in 26 countries worldwide, with significant outbreaks in China, Hong Kong, Singapore, and Toronto. Research into identifying the etiological agent, evaluating modes of disease transmission, and treatment options is currently ongoing. DISCUSSION: The disease can produce a severe bilateral pneumonia, with progressive hypoxemia. Up to 20% of patients require mechanical ventilatory support, with a fatal outcome occurring in about 5% of cases. CONCLUSIONS: We review the current knowledge about this disease, with particular emphasis on ICU management and infection control precautions to prevent disease transmission.

Viruses may evolve at high, uneven, and fluctuating rates among genome sites. The accumulated changes, through either mutation or recombination with other species, are first fixed in the genome of successful individuals that give rise to genetic lineages. The relationship between biological lineages related by common descent is called \u2018phylogeny\u2019. For inferring phylogeny, the differences between aligned sequences of genomes and proteins are quantified and depicted in the form of a tree, in which contemporary species and their intermediate and common ancestors occupy, respectively, the terminal nodes, internal nodes, and the root. The tree is characterized by a topology, length of branches, shape, and the root position. A complex mathematical apparatus has been developed for phylogeny inference that can evaluate inter-species differences, facilitate tree building and compar...","Abstract Management researchers and management practitioners increasingly appear to be talking past each other. A solution lies in understanding that interactive management education has an important role to play in bridging this divide, but for some reason this mode of academic exchange is often forgotten. Our paper broadens the stakeholder value perspective to explore how and why the interests of researchers and practitioners have diverged, before going on to present illustrative cases of programs attempting to bridge such differences. Current conditions suggest that the dissonance between different cycle-times of research and practice is not sustainable with the inevitable outcome of a shrinking commons. Generating new knowledge and propagating it rapidly through education and teaching-practice is an important way of disseminating higher-order research and findings. In a world where academic relevance is under threat, enabling academics to better cross such a divide is critical. Mar...","","Background: The 2019-nCoV outbreak in Wuhan, China has attracted world-wide attention. As of February 11, 2020, a total of 44730 cases of novel coronavirus-infected pneumonia associated with COVID-19 were confirmed by the National Health Commission of China. Methods: Three approaches, namely Poisson likelihood-based method (ML), exponential growth rate-based method (EGR) and stochastic Susceptible-Infected-Removed dynamic model-based method (SIR), were implemented to estimate the basic and controlled reproduction numbers. Results: A total of 71 chains of transmission together with dates of symptoms onset and 67 dates of infections were identified among 5405 confirmed cases outside Hubei as reported by February 2, 2020. Based on this information, we find the serial interval having an average of 4.41 days with a standard deviation of 3.17 days and the infectious period having an average of 10.91 days with a standard deviation of 3.95 days. Conclusions: The controlled reproduction number ...","In an era of global health threats caused by epidemics of infectious diseases and rising multidrug resistance, microbiology laboratories provide essential scientific evidence for risk assessment, prevention, and control. Microbiology has been at the core of European infectious disease surveillance networks for decades. Since 2010, these networks have been coordinated by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC). Activities delivered in these networks include harmonization of laboratory diagnostic, antimicrobial susceptibility and molecular typing methods, multicentre method validation, technical capacity mapping, training of laboratory staff, and continuing quality assessment of laboratory testing. Cooperation among the European laboratory networks in the past 7 years has proved successful in strengthening epidemic preparedness by enabling adaptive capabilities for rapid detection of emerging pathogens across Europe. In partnership with food safety authorities, inte...","Abstract Colombia confirmed its first case of the COVID-19 on March 6th, 2020. On March 16th, 2020, 54 cases have been confirmed (36 imported and 18 associated), therefore, Colombia is at highest alert, and it is now trying to avoid or minimize the last stage of \u201ccommunity transmission\u201d. We present a route proposal that shows how the community pharmacist may develop his responsibility to contribute to the early detection and appropriate referral of possible cases of the COVID-19. In the route have been considered three possible entrances depending on the needs of the users: anti-flu drugs, symptoms related to COVID-19 infection or the request for items for hygiene and prevention of transmission such as alcohol and face masks. Later, self-care education should be given, and the possible cases should be reported to the telephone lines designated by the mayor or the governor, continuing the healthcare process. Community pharmacies and pharmacy staff play a crucial role in minimizing the s..."],"title":["An educational programme for nursing college staff and students during a MERS- coronavirus outbreak in Saudi Arabia","Communicable Disease Surveillance Ethics in the Age of Big Data and New Technology","Potential scenarios for the progression of a COVID-19 epidemic in the European Union and the European Economic Area, March 2020","No more business as usual: agile and effective responses to emerging pathogen threats require open data and open analytics","Preparedness and vulnerability of African countries against importations of COVID-19: a modelling study","2019-20 Wuhan coronavirus outbreak: Intense surveillance is vital for preventing sustained transmission in new locations","Using psychoneuroimmunity against COVID-19","Novel Coronavirus Outbreak in Wuhan, China, 2020: Intense Surveillance Is Vital for Preventing Sustained Transmission in New Locations","Consortia\u2019s critical role in developing medical countermeasures for re-emerging viral infections: a USA perspective","Progress in Global Surveillance and Response Capacity 10 Years after Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome","Financing Vaccines for Global Health Security","Evaluation of the implementation of occupational health, safety, and environment management systems in higher education laboratories","Individualized System for Augmenting Ventilator Efficacy (iSAVE): A Rapidly deployable system to expand ventilator capacity","Appealing for Efficient, Well Organized Clinical Trials on COVID-19","Wuhan novel coronavirus 2019nCoV","Health security capacities in the context of COVID-19 outbreak: an analysis of International Health Regulations annual report data from 182 countries","Statistics-Based Predictions of Coronavirus Epidemic Spreading in Mainland China","Applying Palliative Care Principles to Communicate with Children about COVID-19","Creating a Palliative Care Inpatient Response Plan for COVID19 \u2013 The UW Medicine Experience","AI-assisted CT imaging analysis for COVID-19 screening: Building and deploying a medical AI system in four weeks","Pattern of early human-to-human transmission of Wuhan 2019-nCoV","Meplazumab treats COVID-19 pneumonia: an open-labelled, concurrent controlled add-on clinical trial","Need for integrative thinking to fight against emerging infectious diseases.
