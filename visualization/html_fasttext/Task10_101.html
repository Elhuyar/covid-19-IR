The focus of accreditation is to help organisations understand what they are doing well and what opportunities are available for improvement. The Canadian approach to accreditation is a rigorous peer review process comprised of a self-assessment against a set of standards, an on-site survey and follow-up action on recommendations that arise from the survey. The accreditation standards can be used effectively to guide the surgical teams in the transformation of the specialty. The 17 standards that are used to evaluate surgical teams relate to the activities that represent the continuum of clinical care as well as aspects related to learning. Within the subsections and standards are opportunities for surgeons and surgical teams to use the standards to effectively deliver services and to continuously improve patient car...","The rapid emergence of clinical trials on COVID-19 stimulated a wave of discussion in scientific community. We reviewed the characteristics of interventional trials from Chinese Clinical Trial Registration (ChiCTR) and ClinicalTrials.gov. A total of 171 COVID-19-related interventional trials were identified on Feb 22nd, 2020. These trials are classified into 4 categories based on treatment modalities, including chemical drugs, biological therapies, traditional Chinese medicine treatments and other therapies. Our analysis focused on the issues of stage, design, randomization, blinding, primary endpoints definition and sample size of these trials. We found some studies with potential defects including unreasonable design, inappropriate primary endpoint definition, insufficient sample size and ethical issue. Clinical trials on COVID-19 should be designed based on scientific rules, ethics and benefits for patients.","Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is now a global public health threat with many medical, ethical, social, economic, political, and legal implications. The nonspecific signs and symptoms of this disease, coupled with a relatively long incubation period and the initial absence of a reliable diagnostic test, limited the understanding of the magnitude of the outbreak. This paper outlines our experience with public health issues that have arisen during this outbreak of SARS in Hong Kong. We confirmed that case detection, reporting, clear and timely dissemination of information, and strict infection control measures are essential in handling such an infectious disease outbreak. The need for an outbreak response unit is crucial to combat any future outbreak.","Abstract Isotype-specific antibody responses to bovine herpesvirus 1 (BHV1) were measured in sera, nasal, ocular and genital secretions of calves that were reinfected with BHV1 and 6 weeks later treated with corticosteroids to reactivate putative latent virus. After reinfection and after reactivation, no BHV1-specific IgM antibody response was detected. The serum IgA response was only transiently detectable after reinfection and again appeared rapidly after reactivation in most calves. Most calves showed an increase in nasal and ocular IgA titres after reinfection and reactivation; some calves also had IgA antibodies in genital secretions. A salient finding was that after reinfection and reactivation more calves showed a serum IgA response than virus shedding or an increase in serum IgG1 or IgG2 titres. This suggests that the serum IgA response would be the most sensitive indicator to detect BHV1 reinfection and reactivation. No correlation was found between nasal IgA titre at the time...","Mobile phone apps implementing algorithmic contact tracing can speed up the process of tracing newly diagnosed individuals, spreading information instantaneously back through a past contact network to inform them that they are at risk of being infected, and thus allow them to take appropriate social distancing and testing measures. The aim of non-pharmaceutical infection prevention is to move a population towards herd protection, a state where a population maintains R\u200b0&lt;\u200b1, thus making it impossible for a pathogen to cause an epidemic. Here, we address epidemiological issues that affect the feasibility of an algorithmic approach to instantaneous contact tracing; ethical and implementation issues are addressed separately. First we quantify the parameters of COVID-19 in a framework that is consistent with the renewal equation formulation of epidemic spread. Second, we use an analytical solution to application of first-degree contact tracing in the renewal equation model to explore combin...","Type I interferon (IFN) is one of the first lines of cellular defense against viral pathogens. As a result of IFN signaling, a wide array of IFN-stimulated gene (ISG) products is upregulated to target different stages of the viral life cycle. We review recent findings implicating a subset of ISGs in translational regulation of viral and host mRNAs. Translation inhibition is mediated either by binding to viral RNA or by disrupting physiological interactions or levels of the translation complex components. In addition, many of these ISGs localize to translationally silent cytoplasmic granules, such as stress granules and processing bodies, and intersect with the microRNA (miRNA)-mediated silencing pathway to regulate translation of cellular mRNAs.","Abstract Epidemic outbreaks are a special case of supply chain (SC) risks which is distinctively characterized by a long-term disruption existence, disruption propagations (i.e., the ripple effect), and high uncertainty. We present the results of a simulation study that opens some new research tensions on the impact of COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) on the global SCs. First, we articulate the specific features that frame epidemic outbreaks as a unique type of SC disruption risks. Second, we demonstrate how simulation-based methodology can be used to examine and predict the impacts of epidemic outbreaks on the SC performance using the example of coronavirus COVID-19 and anyLogistix simulation and optimization software. We offer an analysis for observing and predicting both short-term and long-term impacts of epidemic outbreaks on the SCs along with managerial insights. A set of sensitivity experiments for different scenarios allows illustrating the model\u2019s behavior and its value for decision-mak...","","AbstractThe emergence of a novel, highly pathogenic coronavirus, 2019-nCoV, in China, and its rapid national and international spread pose a global health emergency. Coronaviruses use their spike proteins to select and enter target cells and insights into nCoV-2019 spike (S)-driven entry might facilitate assessment of pandemic potential and reveal therapeutic targets. Here, we demonstrate that 2019-nCoV-S uses the SARS-coronavirus receptor, ACE2, for entry and the cellular protease TMPRSS2 for 2019-nCoV-S priming. A TMPRSS2 inhibitor blocked entry and might constitute a treatment option. Finally, we show that the serum form a convalescent SARS patient neutralized 2019-nCoV-S-driven entry. Our results reveal important commonalities between 2019-nCoV and SARS-coronavirus infection, which might translate into similar transmissibility and disease pathogenesis. Moreover, they identify a target for antiviral intervention.One sentence summaryThe novel 2019 coronavirus and the SARS-coronavirus...","","Surveillance is essential for communicable disease prevention and control. Traditional notification of demographic and clinical information, about individuals with selected (notifiable) infectious diseases, allows appropriate public health action and is protected by public health and privacy legislation, but is slow and insensitive. Big data\u2013based electronic surveillance, by commercial bodies and government agencies (for profit or population control), which draws on a plethora of internet- and mobile device\u2013based sources, has been widely accepted, if not universally welcomed. Similar anonymous digital sources also contain syndromic information, which can be analysed, using customised algorithms, to rapidly predict infectious disease outbreaks, but the data are nonspecific and predictions sometimes misleading. However, public health authorities could use these online sources, in combination with de-identified personal health data, to provide more accurate and earlier warning of infectio...","ABSTRACT \u2022 ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY and improved surgical techniques have led to new therapeutic uses for allografts. \u2022 DISEASE TRANSMISSION via allograft tissue transplants has prompted federal intervention in the tissue banking industry and resulted in federal regulations. \u2022 NEW STANDARDS from the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations became effective July 1,2005, and apply to all hospitals that store or implant allograft tissues. These standards include mandatory policies on all aspects of hospital transplantation programs, including tissue ordering, receipt, storage, issuance, and record keeping. AORN J 82 (November 2005) 806\u2013814.","The Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) has spread through 27 countries and infected more than 2,200 people since its first outbreak in Saudi Arabia in 2012. The high fatality rate (35.4%) of this novel coronavirus and its persistent wide spread infectiousness in animal reservoirs have generated tremendous global public health concern. However, no licensed therapeutic agents or vaccines against MERS-CoV are currently available and only a limited few have entered clinical trials. Among all the potential targets of MERS-CoV, the spike glycoprotein (S) has been the most well-studied due to its critical role in mediating viral entry and in inducing a protective antibody response in infected individuals. The most notable studies include the recent discoveries of monoclonal antibodies and development of candidate vaccines against the S glycoprotein. Structural characterization of MERS-CoV S protein bound with these monoclonal antibodies has provided insights into the mech...","Summary Indoor ventilation with good air quality control minimises the spread of airborne respiratory and other infections in hospitals. This article considers the role of ventilation in preventing and controlling infection in hospital general wards and identifies a simple and cost-effective ventilation design capable of reducing the chances of cross-infection. Computational fluid dynamic (CFD) analysis is used to simulate and compare the removal of microbes using a number of different ventilation systems. Instead of the conventional corridor air return arrangement used in most general wards, air return is rearranged so that ventilation is controlled from inside the ward cubicle. In addition to boosting the air ventilation rate, the CFD results reveal that ventilation performance and the removal of microbes can be significantly improved. These improvements are capable of matching the standards maintained in a properly constructed isolation room, though at much lower cost. It is recomme...","Abstract Background With its epicenter in Wuhan, China, the COVID-19 outbreak was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO). While many countries have implemented flight restrictions to China, an increasing number of cases with or without travel background to China are confirmed daily. These developments support concerns on possible unidentified and unreported international COVID-19 cases, which could lead to new local disease epicenters. Methods We have analyzed all available data on the development of international COVID-19 cases from January 20th, 2020 until February 18th, 2020. COVID-19 cases with and without travel history to China were divided into cohorts according to the Healthcare Access and Quality Index (HAQ-Index) of each country. Chi-square and Post-hoc testing were performed. Results While COVID-19 cases with travel history to China seem to peak for each HAQ-cohort, the number of non-travel related COVID-19 cases seem to continuously increase in the HAQ-c...","Abstract Objective MERS-CoV infection is uncommonly identified among patients visiting healthcare facilities &amp; we were vigilant in screening all patients entering our hospital to prevent cross infection among patients, visitors &amp; healthcare providers and aiming to prevent potential outbreaks with MERS-CoV infection. In spite of our efforts on practicing Failure Mode Effect Analysis for MERS-CoV infection management we ended up having an outbreak with MERS-CoV. Based on our experience, we actively implemented policies, procedures &amp; practices on early identification &amp; appropriate isolation practices along with supplemental infection prevention &amp; control measures for preventing future outbreaks at our healthcare facility. Methods Retrospectively we analyzed our failure in preventing the outbreak of MERS-CoV infection among our hospitalized patients by identifying the outbreak &amp; actively intervening as a team to control the outbreak with the support of Hospital Higher management, Administr...","","Background What are the health and wellbeing conditions of people during the COVID-19 outbreak in China? The epidemiological reports now focus on the confirmed COVID-19 cases, and we aim to assess the health and wellbeing of normal adults living and working after one month of public health emergencies into the COVID-19 outbreak in China. Methods One month into the outbreak, on Feb 20/21, 2020, we sampled 369 adults on the eight dimensions of health (SF12), distress (K6), and life satisfaction in 64 cities that varied in their densities of coronavirus confirmed cases. The participants also reported their work status, whether they had chronic health issues, the number of hours they exercised per day in the past week. Findings In general, life of normal adults was severely disrupted. 33% of the participants had not left their home at all during the one-month period due to the restrictive measures to contain COVID-19 in China. 27% of the participants worked at office; 38% resorted to worki...","Abstract To overcome the limitations of the state-of-the-art influenza surveillance systems in Europe, we established in 2008 a European-wide consortium aimed at introducing an innovative information and communication technology approach for a web-based surveillance system across different European countries, called Influenzanet. The system, based on earlier efforts in The Netherlands and Portugal, works with the participation of the population in each country to collect real-time information on the distribution of influenza-like illness cases through web surveys administered to volunteers reporting their symptoms (or lack of symptoms) every week during the influenza season. Such a large European-wide web-based monitoring infrastructure is intended to rapidly identify public health emergencies, contribute to understanding global trends, inform data-driven forecast models to assess the impact on the population, optimize the allocation of resources, and help in devising mitigation and co...","Objective: To review and critically appraise published and preprint reports of models that aim to predict either (i) presence of existing COVID-19 infection, or (ii) future complications in individuals already diagnosed with COVID-19. Any models to identify subjects at risk for COVID-19 in the general population were also included. Design: Rapid systematic review and critical appraisal of prediction models for diagnosis or prognosis of COVID-19 infection. Data sources: PubMed, EMBASE via Ovid, Arxiv, medRxiv and bioRxiv until 13th March 2020. Study selection: Studies that developed or validated a multivariable COVID-19 related prediction model. Two authors independently screened titles and abstracts. Data extraction: Data from included studies were extracted independently by at least two authors based on the CHARMS checklist, and risk of bias was assessed using PROBAST. Data were extracted on various domains including the participants, predictors, outcomes, data analysis, and predictio...","Background: Since the new coronavirus epidemic in China in December 2019, information and discussions about COVID-19 have spread rapidly on the Internet and have quickly become the focus of worldwide attention, especially on social media. Objective: This study aims to investigate and analyze the public's attention to COVID-19-related events in China at the beginning of the COVID-19 epidemic in China (December 31, 2019, to February 20, 2020) through the Sina Microblog hot search list. Methods: We collected topics related to the COVID-19 epidemic on the Sina Microblog hot search list from December 31, 2019, to February 20, 2020 and described the trend of public attention on COVID-19 epidemic-related topics. ROST CM6.0 (ROST Content Mining System Version 6.0) was used to analyze the collected text for word segmentation, word frequency, and sentiment analysis. We further described the hot topic keywords and sentiment trends of public attention. We used VOSviewer to implement a visual clust...","Abstract Receptor recognition is a major determinant of the host range, cross-species infections, and pathogenesis of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV). A defined receptor-binding domain (RBD) in the SARS-CoV spike protein specifically recognizes its host receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). This article reviews the latest knowledge about how RBDs from different SARS-CoV strains interact with ACE2 from several animal species. Detailed research on these RBD/ACE2 interactions has established important principles on host receptor adaptations, cross-species infections, and future evolution of SARS-CoV. These principles may apply to other emerging animal viruses, including the recently emerged Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). This paper forms part of a series of invited articles in Antiviral Research on \u201cFrom SARS to MERS: 10years of research on highly pathogenic human coronaviruses\u201d.","Abstract Pathogenic viruses are viruses that can infect and replicate within human cells and cause diseases. The continuous emergence and re-emergence of pathogenic viruses has become a major threat to public health. Whenever pathogenic viruses emerge, their rapid detection is critical to enable implementation of specific control measures and the limitation of virus spread. Further molecular characterization to better understand these viruses is required for the development of diagnostic tests and countermeasures. Advances in molecular biology techniques have revolutionized the procedures for detection and characterization of pathogenic viruses. The development of PCR-based techniques together with DNA sequencing technology, have provided highly sensitive and specific methods to determine virus circulation. Pathogenic viruses potentially having global catastrophic consequences may emerge in regions where capacity for their detection and characterization is limited. Development of a loc...","Summary On 11 June WHO announced that the spread of H1N1 had reached pandemic phase 6. Since then countries around the world have increased their planning and preparedness for the continuing pandemic. Guidelines have been issued and circulated but confusion continues over their interpretation. We need to remind ourselves of the principles behind control measures and educate and reinforce standard infection control procedures in the acute hospital setting.","The recent spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) exemplifies the critical need for accurate and rapid diagnostic assays to prompt public health actions. Currently, several quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) assays are being used by clinical, research, and public health laboratories for rapid detection of the virus. However, it is currently unclear if results from different tests are comparable. Our goal was to evaluate the primer-probe sets used in four common diagnostic assays available on the World Health Organization (WHO) website. To facilitate this effort, we generated RNA transcripts to create standards and distributed them to other laboratories for internal validation. We then used these RNA transcript standards, full-length SARS-CoV-2 RNA, and RNA-spiked mock samples to determine analytical efficiency and sensitivity of nine primer-probe sets. We show that all primer-probe sets can be used to detect SARS-CoV-2, ...","Abstract Treatment and control of acute neonatal diarrhea in calves are outlined and discussed. The difficulty in making a definitive etiological diagnosis makes effective treatment and control also difficult and largely empirical. Physiological events in calves with diarrhea are known, and fluid therapy is directed toward treating dehydration and acidosis. Whether affected calves should receive antibacterial agents orally is an open question. Principles of control of diarrhea in calves are outlined and discussed.","Abstract Background and Aims Multiple issues in management of COVID have emerged, but confusion persists regarding rational interpretation. Aim of this brief review is to review these issues based on current literature. Methods This is a narrative review with Pubmed and Google Scholar search till 23 March 2020. Search terms were, COVID-19, treatment of coronavirus, COVID 19 and following terms; chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, ibuprofen, ACE-inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers, cardiovascular disease, diarrhoea, liver, testis and gastrointestinal disease. Results We discuss evidence regarding role of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine in treatment and prophylaxis, use of inhibitors of the renin angiotensin system, safety of ibuprofen, unusual clinical features like gastrointestinal symptoms and interpretation of tests for cardiac enzymes and biomarkers. Conclusions While our conclusions on management of COVID-19 patients with co-morbidities are based on current evidence, howeve...","Abstract Children are seeing rapid changes to their routines and facing an unpredictable future. Palliative care teams may consider expanding their communication training and skillsets to help families consider caring ways to communicate with their children and grandchildren about the coronavirus. Palliative care teams are wise to encourage families to ground their communication with children on key values: honesty and trust, self-compassion, safety, sensitivity, connection, preparedness, community-building, recognition of death as a part of the lifecycle, and legacy.","Abstract This paper describes a proposed Strategic Vaccine Facility (SVF) to provide a capability to the UK to deal with new and emerging disease threats. It would underpin the vaccine manufacturing industry by developing expertise and technology to enable rapid manufacture of small batches of vaccines for emergency use against agents, such as bioterrorist agents and emerging diseases. It would have a rare ability to work with dangerous pathogens under containment, allowing the production of inactivated and live vaccines, which would be difficult in a conventional plant. The facility's output will include vaccine candidates and manufacturing protocols for transfer to industry, small vaccine batches for emergency use or clinical trials, and vaccine reference standards. It would also be available for manufacturing small batches of experimental and public health vaccines for the UK and the developing world, allowing clinical trials to be undertaken against key diseases.","Abstract Concept of \u201crisk analysis\u201d in food safety management needs to be understood to assess, manage, and communicate risks for proper implementation of food safety policies, food laws, and standards, in a country. Science-based approaches, which are an integral part of risk analysis to improve modern food safety systems, are intimately linked to processes such as good quality practices. Risk analysis strengthens the ability of traditional food safety systems to meet current challenges. Risk analysis is just one part of an effective food safety system. Other components of food safety system like food safety policies, food legislation, food inspection, laboratory analysis, epidemiological surveillance of food-borne diseases, monitoring systems for chemical and microbiological contamination in foods, and information, education and communication, also need to be improved continuously. \u201cFood safety controls\u201d are now being replaced by \u201crisk-based controls\u201d in all stages of food production...","The current state of much of the Wuhan pneumonia virus (COVID-19) research shows a regrettable lack of data sharing and considerable analytical obfuscation. This impedes global research cooperation, which is essential for tackling public health emergencies, and requires unimpeded access to data, analysis tools, and computational infrastructure. Here we show that community efforts in developing open analytical software tools over the past ten years, combined with national investments into scientific computational infrastructure, can overcome these deficiencies and provide an accessible platform for tackling global health emergencies in an open and transparent manner. Specifically, we use all COVID-19 genomic data available in the public domain so far to (1) underscore the importance of access to raw data and to (2) demonstrate that existing community efforts in curation and deployment of biomedical software can reliably support rapid, reproducible research during global health crises. A...","Abstract The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) was first diagnosed in Wuhan, China in December 2019 and has now spread throughout the world, being verified by the World Health Organization as a Pandemic on March 11th. This had led to the calling of a national emergency on March 13th in the United States. Many hospitals, healthcare networks, and specifically Departments of Surgery are asking the same questions of how to cope and plan for surge capacity, personnel attrition, novel infrastructure utilization, and resource exhaustion. Herein, we present a tiered plan for surgical department planning based on incident command levels. This includes Acute Care Surgeon deployment (given their critical care training and vertically integrated position in the hospital), recommended infrastructure and transfer utilization, triage principles, and faculty, resident and advanced care practitioner deployment.","As the Coronavirus (COVID-19) expands its impact from China, expanding its catchment into surrounding regions and other countries, increased national and international measures are being taken to contain the outbreak. The placing of entire cities in \u2018lockdown\u2019 directly affects urban economies on a multi-lateral level, including from social and economic standpoints. This is being emphasised as the outbreak gains ground in other countries, leading towards a global health emergency, and as global collaboration is sought in numerous quarters. However, while effective protocols in regard to the sharing of health data is emphasised, urban data, on the other hand, specifically relating to urban health and safe city concepts, is still viewed from a nationalist perspective as solely benefiting a nation\u2019s economy and its economic and political influence. This perspective paper, written one month after detection and during the outbreak, surveys the virus outbreak from an urban standpoint and adva...","This case study is the first to be developed in the Middle East region to document what happened during the response to the 2013 MERS outbreak in Qatar. It provides a description of key epidemiologic events and news released from a prime daily newspaper and main Emergency Risk Communication (ERC) actions that were undertaken by public health authorities. Using the Crisis and Emergency Risk Communication (CERC) theoretical framework, the study analyzes how the performed ERC strategies during the first days of the outbreak might have contributed to the outbreak management. Methods: MERS-CoV related events were chronologically tracked, together with the relevant stories that were published in a major newspaper over the course of three distinct phases of the epidemic. The collected media stories were then assessed against the practiced emergency risk communication (ERC) activities during the same time frame. Results: The Crisis &amp; Emergency Risk Communication (CERC) framework was partially ...","N4-hydroxycytidine (NHC) has been recently reported to have promising antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2. To join worldwide efforts in identifying potential drug targets against this pandemic, the target landscape of NHC was defined by extracting all known targets of its chemical neighborhood, including drugs, analogues, and metabolites, and by performing target predictions from two independent platforms, following the recent Public Health Assessment via Structural Evaluation (PHASE) protocol. The analysis provides a list of over 30 protein targets that could be useful in future design activities of new COVID-19 antivirals. The relevance for existing drugs within the same chemical space, such as remdesivir, is also discussed.","The outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003 was controlled by public health measures at a time when specific interventions such as antiviral drugs, vaccines and immunotherapy were not available. Since then, several animal models have been developed for the study of SARS and, although no model replicates the human disease in all aspects, the use of animal models for SARS has led to the establishment of several important principles for vaccine and immunotherapy. Consistency and reproducibility of findings in a given model must be demonstrated to establish the superiority of one model over others. Here, we suggest aspects of an ideal animal model for studies of SARS pathogenesis and vaccine development and present our assessment of the strengths and limitations of the current animal models for SARS.","Background Emergency school closures are often used as public health interventions during infectious disease outbreaks in an attempt to minimise the spread of infection. However, if children continue to mix with others outside the home during the closures, these measures are unlikely to be effective. Objectives This review aimed to summarise existing literature on children's activities and contacts made outside the home during unplanned school closures. Methods We searched four databases from inception to February 2020 for relevant literature. Main findings were extracted. Results 3,343 citations were screened and 19 included in the review. Activities and social contacts appeared to decrease during closures but contact was still common. All studies reported children leaving the house or being looked after by non-household members. There was some evidence that older child age and parental disagreement with closure were predictive of children leaving the house, and mixed evidence regardi...","Abstract The application of optical biosensors, specifically those that use optical fibers and planar waveguides, has escalated throughout the years in many fields, including environmental analysis, food safety and clinical diagnosis. Fluorescence is, without doubt, the most popular transducer signal used in these devices because of its higher selectivity and sensitivity, but most of all due to its wide versatility. This paper focuses on the working principles and configurations of fluorescence-based fiber optic and planar waveguide biosensors and will review biological recognition elements, sensing schemes, as well as some major and recent applications, published in the last ten years. The main goal is to provide the reader a general overview of a field that requires the joint collaboration of researchers of many different areas, including chemistry, physics, biology, engineering, and material science.","BACKGROUND: A novel coronavirus of zoonotic origin (2019-nCoV) has recently been identified in patients with acute respiratory disease. This virus is genetically similar to SARS coronavirus and bat SARS-like coronaviruses. The outbreak was initially detected in Wuhan, a major city of China, but has subsequently been detected in other provinces of China. Travel-associated cases have also been reported in a few other countries. Outbreaks in health care workers indicate human-to-human transmission. Molecular tests for rapid detection of this virus are urgently needed for early identification of infected patients. METHODS: We developed two 1-step quantitative real-time reverse-transcription PCR assays to detect two different regions (ORF1b and N) of the viral genome. The primer and probe sets were designed to react with this novel coronavirus and its closely related viruses, such as SARS coronavirus. These assays were evaluated using a panel of positive and negative controls. In addition, ...","Abstract The globe is currently in the midst of a COVID-19 pandemic resulting in significant morbidity and mortality. This pandemic has placed considerable stress on health care resources and providers. This document from the Canadian Association of Interventional Cardiology - Association Canadienne de Cardiologie d'intervention, specifically addresses the implications for the care of patients in the Cardiac Catheterization Laboratory (CCL) in Canada during the COVID-19 pandemic. The key principles of this document are to maintain essential interventional cardiovascular care while minimizing risks of COVID-19 to patients/staff and maintaining the overall healthcare resources. As the COVID-19 pandemic evolves, procedures will be increased or reduced based on the current level of restriction to health care services. While some consistency across the country is desirable, provincial and regional considerations will influence how these recommendations are implemented. We believe the framew...","Background: China has experienced an outbreak of a novel human coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) since December 2019, and it was announced a worldwide pandemic in March 2020. There is limited evidence on the mortality risk effect of pre-existing comorbidity for clinical disease (coronavirus disease 2019 [COVID-19]), which has important implications for early treatment. Objective: To evaluate the risk of the common preexisting comorbidities, including hypertension, coronary heart diseases (CHD), respiratory diseases and diabetes on COVID-19 mortality, and provide clinical suggestions accordingly. Method: This study used a nested case-control design to assess the impact of pre-existing comorbidities on the hazard of COVID-19 in mainland China. A total of 321 publicly reported confirmed cases (146 cases and 175 controls) with trackable time-to-death information and history of comorbidities were collected between December 18th, 2019 and March 8th, 20...","Practical relevance Blood transfusions are a potentially life-saving procedure that are within the reach of most small animal practitioners. Only minimal equipment is required. Patient group Any cat with clinical signs attributable to a reduced red blood cell mass that is affecting oxygen transport (as a result of reduced packed cell volume or acute blood loss) is a potential candidate for a transfusion. Clinical challenges Although the principles of transfusion medicine are not complicated, there can be fatal consequences if certain steps are omitted. Diagnostics Blood typing kits and blood filters are readily available from veterinary wholesalers, laboratories and blood banking services. Evidence base Over the past three decades, a substantial body of clinical research and reports has built up covering feline blood types and transfusion medicine. This article draws on that research to provide clinical guidance aimed at all veterinarians in feline or small animal practice who either c...","The large outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) that started in Wuhan, China has now spread to many countries worldwide. Current epidemiologic knowledge suggests that relatively few cases are seen among children, which limits opportunities to address pediatric specific issues on infection control and the children's contribution to viral spread in the community. Here, we report the first pediatric case of COVID-19 in Korea. The 10-year-old girl was a close contact of her uncle and her mother who were confirmed to have COVID-19. In this report, we present mild clinical course of her pneumonia that did not require antiviral treatment and serial viral test results from multiple specimens. Lastly, we raise concerns on the optimal strategy of self-quarantine and patient care in a negative isolation room for children.","Much of the uncertainty about the progression of the COVID-19 pandemic stems from questions about when and how non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPI) by governments, in particular social distancing measures, are implemented, to what extent the population complies with these measures, and how compliance changes through time. Further uncertainty comes from a lack of knowledge of the potential effects of removing interventions once the epidemic is declining. By combining an epidemiological model of COVID-19 for the United Kingdom with simple sub-models for these societal processes, this study aims to shed light on the conceivable trajectories that the pandemic might follow over the next 1.5 years. We show strong improvements in outcomes if governments review NPI more frequently whereas, in comparison, the stability of compliance has surprisingly small effects on cumulative mortality. Assuming that mortality does considerably increase once a country's hospital capacity is breached, we show...","The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak, which was identified in late 2019, requires special attention because of its future epidemics and possible global threats. Beside clinical procedures and treatments, since Artificial Intelligence (AI) promises a new paradigm for healthcare, several different AI tools that are built upon Machine Learning (ML) algorithms are employed for analyzing data and decision-making processes. This means that AI-driven tools help identify COVID-19 outbreaks as well as forecast their nature of spread across the globe. However, unlike other healthcare issues, for COVID-19, to detect COVID-19, AI-driven tools are expected to have active learning-based cross-population train/test models that employs multitudinal and multimodal data, which is the primary purpose of the paper.","Abstract The outbreak of COVID-19, a respiratory disease from a novel coronavirus that was first detected in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China is now a public health emergency and fast approaching a pandemic. Singapore, as a major international transportation hub in Asia, is one of the worst hit countries of COVID-19. With the advent of local transmission of cases, we share our preparation and response planning for the operating room from the National Heart Centre Singapore, the largest cardiothoracic tertiary center in Singapore. Protection of staff and patients, environmental concerns as well as other logistic and equipment issues must be considered.","Abstract As the global COVID-19 pandemic escalates there is a need within radiation oncology to work to support our patients in the best way possible. Measures are required to reduce infection spread between patients and within the workforce. Departments need contingency planning to create capacity and continue essential treatments despite a reduced workforce. The #radonc community held an urgent online journal club in March 2020 to discuss these issues and create some consensus on urgent next steps. There were 121 global contributors. This document summarises these discussions around themes of infection prevention, rationalisation of workload and working practice in the presence of infection","With the human society transfers from scattered pieces to a society as a whole and the advent of the aviation era, the occurrence of infectious diseases and their diffusion have led to international health security issues. As the world\u2019s largest and irrevocable annual transnational religious movement, the Hajj and its connection with health security concerns have caught attention since the ancient times, because a huge population from all over the world gathers in the holy city of Mecca, which has tropical arid climate. Currently, the international community and international organizations are implementing multilevel governance with respect to the health security issues of the Hajj. Relevant agencies include the World Health Organization and its regional branches, International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement (ICRC), the Ministry of Hajj as well as the Ministry of Health of Saudi Arabia, and the public health sectors/agencies in various countries that are involved with Hajj activit...","The study of virus evolution has historically been concerned with disease and its emergence and has not been integrated into the general study of evolution. Yet viruses dominate our planet and their evolution is a broad and applied field that can be studied in the real time (such HIV in human disease) and can also be applied to biotechnological problems. Virus evolution is very similar, but not identical, to host evolution. Darwinian principles apply, such as with Fisher population genetics, but other features, such as reticulated and quasispecies-based evolution, distinguish virus evolution. In RNA viruses, high error rates have led to the quasispecies concept in which collective populations are the basis of evolution. These populations provide viruses with high capacities for adaptation. Yet some RNA viruses show remarkable evolutionary stability. With DNA viruses, especially of bacteria, extensive recombination defines vast dynamic and ancient genetic pools. Temperate viruses can di...","The novel coronavirus infection (COVID-19 or Coronavirus disease 2019) that emerged from Wuhan, Hubei province of China has spread to many countries worldwide. Efforts have been made to develop vaccines against human coronavirus (CoV) infections such as MERS and SARS in the past decades. However, to date, no licensed antiviral treatment or vaccine exists for MERS and SARS. Most of the efforts for developing CoV vaccines and drugs target the spike glycoprotein or S protein, the major inducer of neutralizing antibodies. Although a few candidates have shown efficacy in in vitro studies, not many have progressed to randomized animal or human trials, hence may have limited use to counter COVID-19 infection. This article highlights ongoing advances in designing vaccines and therapeutics to counter COVID-19 while also focusing on such experiences and advances as made with earlier SARS- and MERS-CoVs, which together could enable efforts to halt this emerging virus infection."],"title":["Hospital accreditation and the surgeon: The Canadian experience","Appealing for Efficient, Well Organized Clinical Trials on COVID-19","Lessons from the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Outbreak in Hong Kong","Isotype-specific antibody responses to bovine herpesvirus 1 in sera and mucosal secretions of calves after experimental reinfection and after reactivation","Quantifying dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 transmission suggests that epidemic control and avoidance is feasible through instantaneous digital contact tracing","To translate, or not to translate: viral and host mRNA regulation by interferon-stimulated genes","Predicting the impacts of epidemic outbreaks on global supply chains: A simulation-based analysis on the coronavirus outbreak (COVID-19/SARS-CoV-2) case","Scientific and ethical basis for social-distancing interventions against COVID-19","The novel coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV) uses the SARS-coronavirus receptor ACE2 and the cellular protease TMPRSS2 for entry into target cells","A Commentary on \u201cA new item in Italian law: Revenge malpractice.

Fever, although still common, may be lower and the presence of underlying cardiac and pulmonary conditions may obscure the diagnosis. In addition, patients who have cognitive impairment may be unable to articulate their symptoms. Among elderly outpatients, cough, fever, and acute onset of symptoms had a positive predictive value for influenza of 30% in contrast to young adults, in whom this triad of symptoms had a value of 78% [23] . The presence of gastrointestinal complaints, fever, and myalgias, with a lack of significant rhinorrhea and wheezing, may help distinguish influenza from respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), another common winter virus [24, 25] . Because of infection control issues and potential therapeutic interventions, clinicians should have a high index of suspicion for influenza during the winter months, particularly when viral activity is high.","There is still a need for improved speed, ease of use, accuracy and longer read lengths. However, given the ongoing, relentless improvements in performance and cost-effectiveness of high-throughput sequencing, it is likely that these financial and technical challenges will be met relatively easily over the coming years [51]. Nonetheless, improvements in the analysis, archiving and sharing of WGS data need to occur before sequencing results can become trustworthy enough to guide clinical decision-making. Significant investment in establishing standards, databases and communication tools will be required to maximize the opportunities provided by WGS in epidemiology. There may also be organizational and ethical issues with data ownership and access [52].","Perhaps a more important but easily neglected issue is the psychological impact on children and adolescents. Stressors such as prolonged duration, fears of infection, frustration and boredom, inadequate information, lack of in-person contact with classmates, friends, and teachers, lack of personal space at home, and family financial loss can have even more problematic and enduring effects on children and adolescents. 4 For example, Sprang and Silman 6 showed that the mean post traumatic stress scores were four times higher in children who had been quarantined than in those who were not quarantined. Furthermore, the interaction between lifestyle changes and psychosocial stress caused by home confinement could further aggravate the detrimental effects on child physical and mental health, which could cause a vicious circle. To mitigate the consequences of home confinement, the government, nongovernmental organisations (NGOs), the community, school, and parents need to be aware of the downside of the situation and do more to effectively address these issues immediately. Experiences learned from previous outbreaks can be valuable for designing a new programme to tackle these issues in China. 7 The Chinese Government needs to raise the awareness of potential physical and mental health impacts of home confinement during this unusual period. The government should also provide guidelines and principles in effective online learning and ensure that the contents of the courses meet the educational requirements. Yet it is also important not to overburden the students. The government might mobilise existing resources, perhaps involving NGOs, and create a platform for gathering the best online education courses about healthy lifestyle and psychosocial support programmes available for schools to choose from. For example, in addition physical activities, appropriate diet, and good sleep habits, and integrate such health promotion materials into the school curriculum. 3 In the event of home confinement, parents are often the closest and best resource for children to seek help from. Close and open communication with children is the key to identifying any physical and psychological issues and to comforting children in prolonged isolation. 10, 11 Parents are often important role models in healthy behaviour for children. Good parenting skills become particularly crucial when children are confined at home. Besides monitoring child performance and behaviour, parents also need to respect their identity and needs, and they need to help children develop selfdiscipline skills. Children are constantly exposed to epidemic-related news, so having direct conversations with children about these issues could alleviate their anxiety and avoid panic. 10, 11 Home confinement could offer a good opportunity to enhance the interaction between parents and children, involve children in family activities, and improve their self-sufficiency skills. With the right parenting approaches, family bonds can be strengthened, and child psychological needs met. 12 Since the COVID-19 epidemic is no longer confined to China, 13 school closure and home confinementrelated issues also become relevant in other affected countries. As children are vulnerable to environmental risks and their physical health, mental health, and productivity in adult life is deeply rooted in early years, 14 close attention and great efforts are required to address these emergency issues effectively and avoid any longterm consequences in children. Any sustainable programme must involve local professionals to culturally adapt the interventions to the administrative system and to the regional and community environment, and it must develop contextually relevant material for children and adolescents. 7 ","The contribution of this study is twofold. First, we articulate the specific features that frame epidemic outbreaks as a specific SC risk. Second, we demonstrate how simulation-based methodology can be used to examine and predict the impacts of epidemic outbreaks on the SC performance using the example of coronavirus COVID-19 and anyLogistix simulation and optimization software. More specifically, we offer analysis for predicting both short-term and long-term impacts of epidemic outbreaks on the SCs and uncover critical parameters and scenarios of positive and negative SC performance dynamics. This analysis can help to identify the successful and wrong elements of risk mitigation/preparedness and recovery policies in case of epidemic outbreaks. A set of sensitivity experiments for different epidemic scenarios allows to illustrate the model's behavior, its value for decision-makers, and to derive several useful insights. The outcomes of this research can be used by decision-makers to predict the operative and long-term impacts of epidemic outbreaks on the SCs and develop pandemic SC plans.","All procedures performed in studies involving human participants were in accordance with ethical standards of the institutional and/or national committee and with the 1964 Helsinki declaration and its later amendments or comparable ethical standards.","Animal and human rights statement All procedures performed in this study were in accordance with the ethical standards of the institutional and/or national research committee and with the1964 Helsinki declaration and its later amendments or comparable ethical standards. No animal or human experimental studies were carried out by the authors for this article.","The course had initially been organized around three face-to-face modules of four days each, with a final module of two days, delivered over a nine-month period, with time between modules for application and practice. The first module entitled 'Understanding' introduced participants to the current state of research in transformational change. Two external program sponsors then posed wicked transformational challenges, on which participants worked as members of a team, for the entire program. The second module, 'Activation', presented a theoretical lens for interpreting the wicked challenges and focused on scoping the project work. Module 3, 'Implementing and Adjusting', deepened participants' understanding of transformational change by drawing upon previous insights of transformational leader-practitioners. Dialectic debate through Modules 1 and 2 surfaced conflicting cognitive frames between research and practice. In Module 3, intensifying deadline pressure exposed participants to their assumptions and blind spots, which brought frustrations into the open as they grappled with tensions between theory and practice. As the date for delivery loomed, pressure to articulate a strategy resolved the tension into synthesis. Module 4 concluded the program with presentations of findings to sponsors and a broader audience of practitioners, and sharing of team and individual reflections.","however, the mechanism is unclear and existing theories cannot explain this phenomenon. Moreover, basic research efforts should be devoted to the molecular mechanisms and separation and/or purification. Another disturbing fact is that some unreasonable clinical trial schemes are consuming precious patient resources; and some others have not even been approved by an ethics committee. Clinical trials must be undertaken actively, carefully and scientifically reflecting the basic principles of the Helsinki Declaration and its relevant laws and regulations. Despite the urgency generated by the emergence of a new coronavirus, the researchers should maintain rigorous evidence and follow the guidelines for clinical trial statistics and the basic principles including randomization, control and repetition. 'First, do no harm' should still be the top priority.","Besides newly emerging viruses, the variants of existing viruses also cause serious epidemics. These viruses have infected humans in the past. However, they continue to appear in drug-resistant forms or reappear after apparent control or elimination. These variant viruses are termed \"reemerging viruses.\" Influenza virus represents the best example. Three distinct kinds of influenza virus variants are responsible for flu epidemics: the seasonal flu, the pandemic flu, and the avian flu. Since the mechanisms underlying seasonal and pandemic flu emergence have been described in chapter \"Influenza Viruses,\" these two kinds of variants will be described briefly. On the other hand, the avian influenza virus will be described with an emphasis on the mechanism of zoonotic infection. Seasonal Flu: The seasonal flu, as its name implies, is a flu epidemic that occurs yearly. Why are influenza viruses able to infect people who have previously been infected in the past? Multiple reinfection capabilities represent a salient feature of influenza virus infection. The reason for this is because variants with distinct antigenicity emerge each year. This is known as \"antigenic drift\" (see Fig. 15 .15). The antibodies circulating in the person previously infected are unable to neutralize a new seasonal strain.","In The Lancet Respiratory Medicine, Kollengode Ramanathan and colleagues 1 provide excellent recommendations for the use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) for patients with respiratory failure from acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) secondary to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The authors describe pragmatic approaches to the challenges of delivering ECMO to patients with COVID-19, including training health-care personnel, resolving equipment and facilities issues, implementing systems for infection control and personal protection, providing overall support for health-care staff, and mitigating ethical issues. They also address some of the anticipated challenges with local and regional surges in COVID-19 ARDS cases; although there has been an increase in hospitals with the capacity to provide ECMO, the potential demand might exceed the available resources. Furthermore, some health-care systems offer advanced therapies such as ECMO but lack a coordinated local, regional, or national referral protocol.","According to Brodie (1981) , the traditional role of dispensing medications has been expanded. Pharmacists should be both health generalists and health specialists, which will have an impact on public health. Even the American Public Health Association (1981) supports the pharmacists' role in public health. Should community pharmacists move beyond their traditional role? Even when dispensing medicines through paper-based prescription services, pharmacists should comply with some fundamental standards. Safety issues must be considered when dispensing medications. The Pharmacy Board of Australia published guidelines for medication dispensing (i.e., guidelines for scanned and faxed prescriptions and steps to take when handling Internet or mail-order dispensing); guidelines for dispensing extemporaneous medications; guidelines when handling errors (e.g., dispensing errors); guidelines for appropriate medication labeling; guidelines for patient counseling, privacy, and confidentiality; and pharmacy technicians' functions, responsibilities, and competencies (Pharmacy Board of Australia, n.d.). In addition, for pharmacies that use electronic and computer systems, the Royal Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain (n.d.) has provided several guidelines and principles for good dispensing and appropriate dispensing procedures (e.g., professional checking, medication substitution, and labeling). Malaysia, a developing country, has also developed Guide to Good Dispensing Practice (Malaysian Pharmaceutical Services Division, 2016) . These guidelines aim to have both public and private facilities dispensing medications according to the law and guidelines, which may ensure that patients receive the correct medications, adherence is improved, adverse effects are minimized, and errors are avoided. The document's contents relate to processing prescriptions, preparing medications, labeling, recoding, and issuing medications to the patient. In geographical areas where no pharmacists are available, a guide about managing medicines would be a handy document indeed (Andersson &amp; Snell, 2010) .","Sharara and Kanj [1] examined the war and infectious diseases and studied the influence of circumstances of war on the prevalence of infectious diseases of global concern in a public health emergency. It has been notified that the poliomyelitis outbreaks have led the focus on the severity of the prevailing health issues internationally after the Syrian conflict. This attention also assisted to recognize the significance of reinvigorating elimination campaigns in the endemic nations including Nigeria, Pakistan, and Afghanistan for the prevention of such outbreaks. Polio has been declared as a public health emergency in Syria that needs international solidarity and efforts to avoid epidemic globally [1]. Similarly, Doganay and Demiraslan [5] studied the impact of reemerging infections, health services, and biosecurity in Turkey. In gunshot or surgical wounds, multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacterial infections appear to be a rising issue. Malaria, hepatitis A, and varicella have been seen with increasing incidence among the refugees. There are several issues, waiting to be resolved for living and health standards [5].","Ethical challenges. The unprecedented challenge represented by COVID-19 has brought novel and dramatic ethical dilemmas, ranging from policy issues (e.g. focusing on containment and mitigation vs. herd immunity), as well as clinical dilemmas (e.g. considering all patients alike vs triaging patients according to age, comorbidities and expected prognosis, similar to other catastrophic circumstances).","Although existing disease surveillance systems (predominantly general practitioner (GP)-based but also involving laboratory-based reporting, mandatory notifications, etc.) have a fundamental role in monitoring and understanding the spread of communicable diseases, they also have several important limitations. One of the major issues is that, for diseases such as influenza-like illness (ILI), only an unknown proportion of all infected individuals see a doctor. In addition, consultations frequently occur with a considerable delay, taking place only when a complication has occurred or a doctor's certificate is required (for example, in Sweden such a certificate is not required until after 1 week of absence from work). Other issues concern: the time delay in data reporting and aggregation; the lack of information on the patterns of household transmission; the lack of uniform standards for clinical definitions, which may vary considerably between countries and even between reporters (European Influenza Surveillance Network). Furthermore, age-stratified rates of physician consultation may vary widely with different healthcare and health insurance systems. Healthcare-seeking behaviour can change unpredictably during an epidemic, making extrapolations of those statistics to the general population uncertain.","Ethical approval: All data or studies related to human subjects or animal experimentation was from previously published data by other groups. Ethical issues would have been addressed at the time of publication.","During crises, health care resources should be allocated in an ethical, rational, and structured way to do the greatest good for the greatest number of patients. Hospitals and health systems must set aside a \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d mentality and focus on how best to accommodate the patients likely to benefit the most from care. Specifically, a plan that outlines what services and types of procedures will be provided (for example, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation) and what will not (for example, elective cases) must be developed. Accordingly, clinical guidelines for use (or denial) of scarce services, such as mechanical ventilation and critical care, should be outlined, in consultation with ethics and medical staff. A protocol that defines how patients will be triaged for admission, observation, early discharge, and quarantine is important. Hospitals should anticipate that normal staffing ratios and some standards of care are unlikely to be maintained; plans for contingency and crisis standards that lay out a legal and ethical framework for care decisions, including who will make decisions, how, and under what circumstances, must be readied. At Michigan Medicine, scarce resource guidelines have not only been developed, but portions have been revised and circulated to staff to ensure agreement and buy-in for execution.","All research was conducted with integrity and in line with generally accepted ethical principles and approved by the Research Ethics Committee of Chaohu Hospital, Anhui Medical University (202001-kyxm-01), and Wuxi Mental Health Center, Nanjing Medical University (WUXIMHCIRB2020-005).

Most security programs in the 1950s and 1960s concentrated on antitheft and information protection measures. But by the late 1970s, some security programs * The specialized nature of information identification and assignment of security classifications produced a group of managers who founded the National Classification Management Society in 1964. Classification management may be part of the responsibility of a security operative. began to absorb other management and administrative duties, including safety. In the 1990s, data security, emergency planning, and organizational ethical concerns became significant management issues. In the twenty-first century, a variety of issues emerged without any reduction in the significance of earlier protective mandates. Antiterrorism, protection of intellectual property, and rapid recovery from untoward incidents (contingency planning) became paramount issues for management attention.","Despite our best preparations, it remains likely that in a pandemic scenario, the number of critically ill patients will overwhelm our critical care capacity. There is a need to develop triage protocols to prioritize access to limited resources, including mechanical ventilation [34] . Triage criteria should be based on clinical indicators of survivability, and resources allocated to those most likely to benefit. These are difficult decisions and cannot be left until times of crisis. Development of triage protocols should be done in advance, with careful consideration of ethical principles [35] . It is crucial to engage the community in this process so that public trust exists when it is most needed.","Great efforts have been made to develop preventive and therapeutic interventions against MERS-CoV infection. In particular, monoclonal antibodies and vaccines targeting the Spike glycoprotein are major areas of focus due to its critical role in mediating viral entry, and its potential in inducing protective antibody responses in infected individuals. So far, more than twenty monoclonal antibodies with nanomolar neutralizing activities have been reported and many vaccine candidates are underway in preclinical and clinical studies. In this review, we aim to capture the current advances and discuss possible strategies to translate these discoveries into an ultimate medical intervention against MERS-CoV infection.","Neoplasia is a common cause of abdominal and thoracic effusions in dogs and cats (Fig. 6-2) . Gross appearance and cell count and total protein concentration parameters are generally not helpful in classifying neoplastic effusions. The salient cytologic characteristic is the microscopic observation of neoplastic cells.","All procedures followed were in accordance with the ethical standards of the responsible committee on human experimentation (the institutional review board at Tsinghua University) and with the Helsinki Declaration of 1975, as revised in 2000. Informed consent was obtained from all subjects for being included in the study. All patient data were anonymized before study inclusion. The blood samples of COVID-19 patients and healthy donors were obtained from Chui Yang Liu Hospital affiliated to Tsinghua University in Beijing.","In particular, the large discrepancies between criteria suggest that authors care about good reporting practices but that certain criteria are far more salient and highly valued than others.

In the following section, we will review salient studies that have provided such fundamental insight, focusing on agents from the CDC Categories A to C.","An interesting finding of our study was that most ERRPs did not agree that they should not be looking after patients infected with MERS. We think that these finding are reflections of the high standards of ethical values of ERRPs and their professional obligation toward their jobs and patients.","Considering such critical issues and the latest position papers of stakeholder associations (Various Associations, 2019a,b), the establishment of harmonized metrics to classify the impact of medicine shortage on the National Healthcare Systems is a mandatory step to enhance the cooperation among competent National Authorities of the European countries and to rationalize the efforts to mitigate them. Regulators and professional associations have proposed several systematic measures to assess shortage problems (Beck et al., 2019; Bochenek et al., 2018; EMA, 2019c; Jia and Zhao, 2017; Panzitta et al., 2017; PDA, 2014) . However, the proposed strategies are generally designed to face a specific shortage's root cause (e.g., manufacturing failures, low price, distribution-problem). Such strategies cannot be applied to solve all shortage types, and the communications/cooperation among stakeholders may be limited. However, in the end, the existing problem-solving strategies aimed to face the same issue: the medicine unavailability for the patients and the increased risks for their health (Phuong et al., 2019) . Consequently, in the estimation of the shortage impact on the patient needs, this aspect should be primary for harmonizing the existing metrics and rationalizing the problem-solving strategies to be adopted. Based on this assumption, it is proposed a procedure to determine the impact of shortage/unavailability on the healthcare assistance and, therefore, the patient accessibility to therapies, other than the communication strategies to adopt (Fig. 1) .","All procedures performed in studies involving human participants were in accordance with the ethical standards of the institutional and/or national research committee.

These drugs and therapies may be not beneficial to the patients, leading to non-compliance to ethical standards. These unnecessary trials may also waste medical resources, as well as diverting patients resources. WHO has suggested an establishment of a centralized research program to ensure the most promising researches 4 .","Our findings suggest that, because of the speed of their release, preprints-rather than peer-reviewed literature in the same topic area-might be driving discourse related to the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak. Although our analysis focused on search trends and news media data as a measure for general discourse, it is likely that preprints are also influencing policy making discussions, given that WHO announced on Jan 26, 2020, that they would be creating a repository of relevant studies-including those that have not yet been peer-reviewed. 20 Nevertheless, despite the advantages of speedy information delivery, the lack of peer review can also translate into issues of credibility and misinformation, both intentional and unintentional. This particular drawback has been highlighted during the ongoing outbreak, especially after the high-profile withdrawal of a virology study from the preprint server bioRxiv, which erroneously claimed that COVID-19 contained HIV \"insertions\". 21 The very fact that this study was withdrawn showcases the power of open peer-review during emergencies; the withdrawal itself appears to have been prompted by outcry from dozens of scientists from around the globe who had access to the study because it was placed on a public server. 22 Much of this outcry was documented on Twitter (a microblogging platform) and on longer-form popular science blogs, signalling that such fora would serve as rich additional data sources for future work on the impact of preprints on public discourse. 22 However, instances such as this one described showcase the need for caution when acting upon the science put forth by any one preprint.","Enhanced real-time PCR.

The salient feature of this new assay is the use of the amplification product from an initial round of conventional PCR as the template for a second round of TaqMan real-time fluorescent PCR (using the amplification profiles described above) to increase the sensitivity of SARS-CoV detection. The same primers were used for the initial pre-amplification by conventional PCR and the real-time PCR stages.","The International Plant Protection Convention (IPPC) is an international agreement on plant health to which 181 countries are signatories. The Secretariat of the IPPC is provided by the Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations. The IPPC has the mission to protect cultivated and wild plants by preventing the introduction and spread of pests and pathogens. They develop standards (International Standards for Phytosanitary Measures (ISPMs)) that are recognized by participating countries and provide for science-based standards for the safe movement of plants and plant products. As an example, ISMP No. 28 (Anonymous, 2007b) provides recognized standard treatments to eliminate plant pathogens and pests, including fumigation, cold treatment, heat treatment, and irradiation; and ISMP No. 31 (Anonymous, 2008) provides agreed on sampling levels that participating countries use when shipping plants or plant products internationally to protect against movement of quarantine pests and pathogens. The IPPC develops standards for range of issues related to plant protection. Once the standards are approved by the IPPC member countries, they become an ISMP.","The American Medical Association (AMA) established guidelines that help in developing and posting contents of websites targeting professionals and consumers with certain standards that satisfy quality, ethical principle, and professionalism (Winker et al., 2000) . The guidelines covered aspects such as site ownership; website policy toward site viewing, viewer access, payment, and privacy if applicable; funding and sponsorship of specific contents; quality of editorial content, linking to intrasite contents; intersite navigation; instructions regarding downloadable contents, and navigation of contents.","Currently known RNA structures that recur across betacoronaviruses provide potential starting points for therapeutic development targeting the SARS-CoV-2 RNA genome. Here, we include secondary structures for the 5\u00b4 UTR (Figure 4a ), frame-shifting element (Figure 4b ), and 3\u00b4 UTR ( Figure 4c ) for SARS-CoV-2, built by analyzing homology to literature-annotated structures in related betacoronaviruses. We additionally include computer-readable secondary structures in Table 4 and Supplementary File 1. A brief review of salient secondary structure features in these regions and their putative functional roles in the betacoronavirus life cycle follows.","\u2022 Fill gaps in understanding of the natural history of infection to better define the period of infectiousness and transmissibility; more accurately estimate the reproductive number in various outbreak settings and improve understanding the role of asymptomatic infection. \u2022 Comparative analysis of different quarantine strategies and contexts for their effectiveness and social acceptability \u2022 Enhance and develop an ethical framework for outbreak response that includes better equity for access to interventions for all countries \u2022 Promote the development of point-of-care diagnostic tests \u2022 Determine the best ways to apply knowledge about infection prevention and control in health-care settings in resource-constrained countries (including identification of optimal personal protective equipment) and in the broader community, specifically to understand behaviour among different vulnerable groups \u2022 Support standardised, best evidence-based approach for clinical management and better outcomes and implement randomised, controlled trials for therapeutics and vaccines as promising agents emerge \u2022 Validation of existing serological tests, including those that have been developed by commercial entities, and establishment of biobanks and serum panels of well characterised COVID-19 sera to support such efforts \u2022 Complete work on animal models for vaccine and therapeutic research and development include some identified by the global community and by the Research and Development Blueprint Scientific Advisory Group. The STAG-IH emphasises the importance of the continued rapid sharing of data of public health importance in medical journals that provide rapid peer review and online publication without a paywall. It is sharing of information in this way, as well as technical collaboration among clinicians, epidemiologists, and virologists, that has provided the world with its current understanding of COVID-19.","Donor screening and blood collection must be conducted under specific rules found in the CFR, as well as in applicable FDA guidelines and memoranda. In addition, the AABB, the preeminent nongovernmental organization involved with transfusion medicine in the United States, issues a publication, the Standards for Blood Banks and Transfusion Services (Standards), 52 which is adhered to by the majority of American blood centers and has been adopted into law, in varying degrees, by many states. The AABB Standards are upgraded regularly, to keep pace with current trends in transfusion medicine and the most recent federal regulations. Websites for the AABB (www. aabb.org) and the FDA (www.fda.gov/cber) are good sources for the most up-to-date transfusion-related regulations and information. Additionally, state and local regulations regarding blood collection practices often apply. Qualifying donor requirements, as stipulated in the most recent edition of the AABB Standards, are listed in Table 11 -3.","The diagnosis of gastrointestinal disease is facilitated by knowledge of the entities that may be expected in a particular species and age group, and the clinicopathologic syndromes with which they are associated. In the next section, etiologic entities associated with various syndromes in the domestic species are briefly summarized. The salient diagnostic features of some conditions, or the steps required at necropsy to confirm a diagnosis, are mentioned. The diseases causing gastritis, and those causing typhlocolitis in all species, have been discussed in previous sections. They are only briefly reiterated here in a general context. Further information on the pathogenesis and diagnosis of most infectious and parasitic conditions is found in the next section.","What all such epidemics tell is that choices are forefront, despite authorities' denial, probably for political correctness. Which patient to be oriented to intensive care units, and which ones not? Will it be an age limit? The application of ethical principles of beneficence, non-maleficence, autonomy, justice and dignity may be summoned\u2026 and questioned. So will the principle of unreasonable obstinacy. It appears obvious that the patient's autonomy is discussed alongside the citizen's one, at a time where authoritarian decisions are made by governors and politicians to e.g. limit freedom to move out (which indeed seems appropriate to limit infection spreading)? Regarding restrictions in peoples' moves to restrict the virus propagation, which actions would be taken to ease blood donations? Will some systems impose blood donation (a message picked up from the \"American Association of Blood Banks\" may be alarming: http://www.aabb.org/press/Pages/pr200312.aspx?PF=1)? It also seems that scientific committees' members are not unanimous regarding prevention, treatment options (including compassionate ones). The main lesson from this pandemic outbreak is that no one is really knowledgeable.","Regardless of the particular mechanism through which we attempt to characterize the 339 changes in diagnostic sensitivity and specificity, our results demonstrate (in both theory 340 and practice) how these dynamics may be incorporated into epidemiological modeling 341 efforts and how the results may translate into a more accurate understanding of infectious 342 disease dynamics. 343 344 Some studies have been able to assess the impact of public health announcement-or 345 media-driven behavioral change with regard to disease risk and diagnosis (e.g. (Sharma et 346 al. 2003) ). It is clear that we will need to develop better models that explicitly capture the 347 major factors that can effect change in public behavior regarding health care and 348 diagnosis. While it may be impossible to accurately assess the impact of behavioral 349 changes in health care seeking behavior for past epidemics, one possible course of action 350 going forwards would be to ask physicians, hospitals and laboratories to record and report 351 the number of tests performed in addition to merely the number of cases positively 352 diagnosed, regardless of acknowledge threat of outbreaks. 353 354 These models and insights may also be of critical use our collective ongoing efforts to 355 understand and predict the progression of COVID-19. Not only do we provide the 356 obvious alternations to the standard epidemic predictions for error rates in testing, we 357 also provide a mechanism by which to correct our understanding of 0 R based on changes 358 in access to tests of various sensitivities and specificities over time. This is especially 359 important given both the formulation of governmental responses to the pandemic (i.e. 360 .

There are nine RPPOs (Asian and Pacific PPO; Caribbean Plant Protection Commission; Comite de Sanidad Vegetal del Cono Sur; Comunidad Andina; European and Mediterranean PPO (EPPO); InterAfrican Phytosanitary Council; Near East PPO; North American PPO; Organismo Internacional Regional de Sanidad Agropecuaria and Pacific PPO (Roy, 2011) ). There are also efforts at harmonizing certification standards across some of the RPPOs, such as for fruit trees and grapevines in NAPPO countries, and the EPPO countries have adopted certification schemes for 20 crops (Roy, 2011; EPPO website) . These RPPO-developed standards are often a minimum standard that is required, but member countries can require a more stringent standard internally. Although this is happening at the international level, there are many cases where the harmonization of certification programs within countries has not happened. In countries where these programs are regulated at the province or state level, there are often significant differences between the certification standards. For example, in the United States some states require that the G1 plants for some crops be maintained within protected culture (screenhouse) to minimize vector transmission of pathogens, whereas other states do not require that same level of protection. Also, the type and level of testing required at each level in the certification scheme can vary between states. There is an effort underway to harmonize certification standards for some of the fruit crops across the United States. As these programs are developed, they are looking at certification schemes in other countries and RPPOs with the goal of harmonizing standards on a broader scale if possible.","For the specific epidemic situation of COVID-19, we chose to conduct an open-label nonrandomized control study in the isolation ward of the national clinical research center for infectious diseases (The Third People's Hospital of Shenzhen), Shenzhen, China. From 30 January to 14 February 2020, laboratory-confirmed patients with COVID-19 were consecutively screened, and eligible patients were included in the FPV arm of the study. Patients who had initially been treated with antiviral therapy with LPV/RTV from 24 January to 30 January 2020 were screened, and eligible patients were included in the control arm of the study. The study was conducted according to the guidelines of the Declaration of Helsinki and the principles of good clinical practice, and was approved by the ethics committee of The Third People's Hospital of Shenzhen (No.:2020-002-02). Written informed consent was obtained from all patients. The study was reported according to the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials guidelines and was registered on the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (ID: ChiCTR2000029600)","In Italy, the tests were carried out mainly on the symptomatic subjects for Covid-19. Tests have not been carried out initially in healthcare professionals (who could, therefore, have contributed to the spread of the disease), in patients' sick in-home quarantine. Finally, Italy, like the majority of nations, was not prepared for the rapid spread of the pandemic and many protection systems such as masks, produced almost exclusively abroad, were not sufficient even for health personnel and simply there were no enough ventilators for all patients who needed them, raising important ethical issues.","The guiding principles divide the population affected by NCP into 6 categories and 4 levels and require the first-level population to be the focus of psychological crisis intervention. Then the intervention shall be gradually expanded to the second, third, and fourth levels, and finally, involve all populations. Common psychological and behavioral issues that have emerged from the outbreak, as well as psychological crisis interventions and principles have been explained in detail [10]. In order to alleviate the current acute stress responses of individuals and patients and reduce the incidence of psychological distress or PTSD, we should take appropriate measures for the support of public mental health. Probable practices are as follows:Disseminating knowledge on mental health to the public;Setting up psychological counseling hotlines nationwide;Launching individualized psychological support by psychiatrists and psychologists;Encouraging public and private physicians to provide psychological assistance;Encouraging voluntary support by infected survivors;Developing mental health insurance for special periods.","It is at times of stress that we most need to keep our wits about us. Unfortunately, it's at these exact times that doing so becomes most difficult. We're making ethical-based decisions all the time without even realising it. Paying close attention to everything we do isn't going to solve the issues, but it's a start in recognising that the problem exists.","In 2001, the CCHSA introduced the Achieving Improved Measurement (AIM) Accreditation Programme. The Canadian approach to accreditation is a rigorous peer review process comprised of a self-assessment against a set of standards, an on-site survey and follow-up action on recommendations that arise from the survey. In Canada, the process occurs over a three-year cycle. The standards are national in scope and allow for both standardisation and benchmarking against similar organisations throughout Canada. The standards were developed and are updated using a broadly based consultation process with input from healthcare professionals across Canada. The standards address patient care issues within a quality framework that defines the programme. The quality framework is applicable to the organisation as a whole and is based on four quality dimensions: Responsiveness, System Competency, Client/Community Focus and Work-life. The quality dimensions represent a balanced scorecard relevant to healthcare organisations within which organisations may structure their quality improvement initiatives. Surgery and all other care teams function within this framework. While the quality framework underpins the accreditation programme, it also forms a basis for delivery of acute care services such as surgery.","This study applies a descriptive analysis to dental data in the special period and presents salient and meaningful findings of emergency dental visits. We observed significant utilization reductions in emergency dental services at the beginning of the COVID-19 epidemic. The results strongly suggest that COVID-19 significantly influenced people's dental care-seeking behavior. As most of the routine dental care was not available during the epidemic, more patients were expected to seek emergency dental service when it was needed. However, according to the Chinese authorities' recommendations and fearing of epidemics, people are reluctant to go outside but stay in house, with less willing to go to dental institutions. As a result, the overall dental emergency patients count reduced by 38%. However, the previous study showed that there was a potential risk for transmission of acute viral respiratory tract infections in the dental office because of aerosol production during certain dental procedures. 5 Although the number of patients was reduced, it took a strongly prolonged time for the dental institution to carry out strict infection control measures. Consequently, the emergency center was unprecedented stressed. It was necessary to increase the dental units to meet the patients' need for emergency dental services.","We reviewed here all confirmed cases out of China from January 3 to February 13, 2020 and gathered detailed information on case history and epidemiological links. We identified salient epidemiological features, and modeled the number of importations over time. International exportations from Hubei grew rapidly, fueled by the local epidemic, up to the closure of Wuhan airport preventing further travel of cases. Exportations from other Chinese provinces and other countries grew at a considerably slower pace. This is related to the difference in the increase of cases between Hubei province, origin of the outbreak, and the rest of the affected areas 1 . Such difference is likely an outcome of the implementation of containment measures in China 3,20,21 , and of the increased awareness at different phases of the outbreak 22-26 (i.e. before and after containment measures) leading to self-isolation and quarantine.","Of course, this subscription model considers only the development cost of vaccines. Once developed, the production and stockpiling of these vaccines would require further funding, but the subscription model can be applied on an ongoing basis, and at a much lower annual cost. Access to these vaccines by non-G7 countries must also be considered, but such access involves political and ethical issues that are beyond the scope of this economic analysis.","Research on interventions to prevent or mitigate pandemics has assessed their effectiveness, using modelling45 46 or empirical evidence,47 48 on their indirect effects,49 50 their economic impacts51 52 and the
