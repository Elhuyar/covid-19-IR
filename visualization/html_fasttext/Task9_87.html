Decisions about its pandemic threat and the appropriate level of public health response depend heavily on estimates of its basic reproduction number and assessments of interventions conducted in the early stages of the epidemic. Methods We conducted a mathematical modeling study using five independent methods to assess the basic reproduction number (R0) of COVID-19, using data on confirmed cases obtained from the China National Health Commission for the period 10th January to 8th February. We analyzed the data for the period before the closure of Wuhan city (10th January to 23rd January) and the post-closure period (23rd January to 8th February) and for the whole period, to assess both the epidemic risk of the virus and the effectiveness of the closure of Wuhan city on spread of COVID-19. Findings Before the closure of Wuhan city the basic reproduction numb...","Abstract We present here the proceedings of the 5th seminar on emerging infectious diseases, held in Paris on March 22nd, 2016, with seven priority proposals that can be outlined as follows: encourage research on the prediction, screening and early detection of new risks of infection; develop research and surveillance concerning transmission of pathogens between animals and humans, with their reinforcement in particular in intertropical areas (\u201chot-spots\u201d) via public support; pursue aid development and support in these areas of prevention and training for local health personnel, and foster risk awareness in the population; ensure adapted patient care in order to promote adherence to treatment and to epidemic propagation reduction measures; develop greater awareness and better education among politicians and healthcare providers, in order to ensure more adapted response to new types of crises; modify the logic of governance, drawing from all available modes of communication and incorpor...","Abstract This chapter describes the source, access, extent, and quality of information available among pharmacists and pharmacy personnel in developing countries to practice effectively. Our world today witnesses huge advancements in the information-related technologies and in the amount of medicines information available and accessible by all healthcare providers as well as the public. Remaining in the front line as medicines information providers represents great challenge for pharmacists. Scientific biomedical journals represent the core source of our knowledge about medicines. Textbooks and books represent the cornerstone for a user who has no or little basic information about certain topic. Today, the Internet is the most commonly used source of information for a variety of uses and topics. The literature available in our hand indicates the presence of medicines information centers in a variety of countries from the developing world. Manufacturers of medicines usually represent an...","This year marks the 15th anniversary of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in Canada and the 100th anniversary of the 1918 Spanish influenza pandemic. These, and other recent public health events, provide an opportunity for us to review and reflect on the evolution of Canada\u2019s public health emergency response over the past 15 years\u2014from SARS, to the 2009 H1N1 pandemic influenza, to Ebola virus and Zika virus disease. Key lessons have been learned and milestones achieved that have shaped and sharpened our response approach and structures. While SARS was a wake-up-call to strengthen infection prevention and control capacity in health care settings and led to the formation of the Public Health Agency of Canada, it also strengthened our Federal/Provincial/Territorial (FPT) senior-level governance and led to agreements for pan-Canadian mutual aid and infectious disease information sharing. As well, our collective public health laboratory capacity has been strengthened through ongoing ...","Objective: Establishing a social contact data sharing initiative and an interactive tool to assess mitigation strategies for COVID-19. Results: We organized data sharing of published social contact surveys via online repositories and formatting guidelines. We analyzed this social contact data in terms of weighted social contact matrices, next generation matrices, relative incidence and R0. We incorporated location-specific isolation measures (e.g. school closure or telework) and capture their effect on transmission dynamics. All methods have been implemented in an online application based on R Shiny and applied to COVID-19 with age-specific susceptibility and infectiousness. Using our online tool with the available social contact data, we illustrate that social distancing could have a considerable impact on reducing transmission for COVID-19. The effect itself depends on assumptions made about disease-specific characteristics and the choice of intervention(s). Keywords: social contact ...","Abstract The global spread of COVID-19 is placing unprecedented demands on healthcare services. In this time of crisis, innovative and adaptive methods of practising will be required across all health professions. In order to maximise the use of current available resources, it is vital that existing services are comprehensively reviewed and full use is made of any unrealised potential among healthcare providers. Community pharmacy is one of a number of health professions that has a key role to play in responding to the current pandemic. As the scope of community pharmacy practice varies considerably across countries, it is important to examine ways in which the profession can assist with the public health response to COVID-19 and maintaining the continuity of healthcare services. This article seeks to highlight roles and activities that community pharmacists can undertake to help in relieving pressure on other areas of the health service, such as general practice. This information coul...","This case study is the first to be developed in the Middle East region to document what happened during the response to the 2013 MERS outbreak in Qatar. It provides a description of key epidemiologic events and news released from a prime daily newspaper and main Emergency Risk Communication (ERC) actions that were undertaken by public health authorities. Using the Crisis and Emergency Risk Communication (CERC) theoretical framework, the study analyzes how the performed ERC strategies during the first days of the outbreak might have contributed to the outbreak management. Methods: MERS-CoV related events were chronologically tracked, together with the relevant stories that were published in a major newspaper over the course of three distinct phases of the epidemic. The collected media stories were then assessed against the practiced emergency risk communication (ERC) activities during the same time frame. Results: The Crisis &amp; Emergency Risk Communication (CERC) framework was partially ...","Abstract There is a current worldwide outbreak of the novel coronavirus Covid-19 (coronavirus disease 2019; the pathogen called SARS-CoV-2; previously 2019-nCoV), which originated from Wuhan in China and has now spread to 6 continents including 66 countries, as of 24:00 on March 2, 2020. Governments are under increased pressure to stop the outbreak spiraling into a global health emergency. At this stage, preparedness, transparency, and sharing of information are crucial to risk assessments and beginning outbreak control activities. This information should include reports from outbreak site and from laboratories supporting the investigation. This paper aggregates and consolidates the epidemiology, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, treatments and preventions of this new type of coronavirus.","As the Coronavirus (COVID-19) expands its impact from China, expanding its catchment into surrounding regions and other countries, increased national and international measures are being taken to contain the outbreak. The placing of entire cities in \u2018lockdown\u2019 directly affects urban economies on a multi-lateral level, including from social and economic standpoints. This is being emphasised as the outbreak gains ground in other countries, leading towards a global health emergency, and as global collaboration is sought in numerous quarters. However, while effective protocols in regard to the sharing of health data is emphasised, urban data, on the other hand, specifically relating to urban health and safe city concepts, is still viewed from a nationalist perspective as solely benefiting a nation\u2019s economy and its economic and political influence. This perspective paper, written one month after detection and during the outbreak, surveys the virus outbreak from an urban standpoint and adva...","AbstractThe rapid sharing of sequence information as seen throughout the current SARS-CoV-2 epidemic, represents an inflection point for genomic epidemiology. Here we describe aspects of coronavirus evolutionary genetics revealed from these data, and provide the first direct RNA sequence of SARS-CoV-2, detailing coronaviral subgenome-length mRNA architecture.","As the international community responds to an outbreak of coronavirus-induced pneumonia in Wuhan, China, early and open data sharing \u2014 which are vital for its control \u2014 depend on the trust that the data will not be used without proper attribution to those who generated it.","To learn how outbreaks of infectious disease are detected and to describe the entities and information systems that together function to identify outbreaks in the U.S., the authors drew on multiple sources of information to create a description of existing surveillance systems and how they interact to detect outbreaks. The results of this analysis were summarized in a system diagram. The authors reviewed a sample of recent outbreaks to determine how they were detected, with reference to the system diagram. The de facto U.S. system for detection of outbreaks consists of five components: the clinical health care system, local/state health agencies, federal agencies, academic/professional organizations, and collaborating governmental organizations. Primary data collection occurs at the level of clinical health care systems and local health agencies. The review of a convenience sample of outbreaks showed that all five components of the system participated in aggregating, analyzing, and sha...","The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared COVID-19 a global pandemic. Healthcare providers should prepare internal guidelines covering all aspect of the organization in order to have their unit ready as soon as possible. This document addresses the current COVID-19 pandemic for maternal-fetal medicine (MFM) practitioners. The goals the guidelines put forth here are two fold- first to reduce patient risk through healthcare exposure, understanding that asymptomatic health systems/healthcare providers may become the most common vector for transmission, and second to reduce the public health burden of COVID-19 transmission throughout the general population. Box 1 outlines general guidance to prevent spread of COVID-19 and protect our obstetric patients. Section 1 outlines suggested modifications of outpatient obstetrical (prenatal) visits. Section 2 details suggested scheduling of obstetrical ultrasound. Section 3 reviews suggested modification of nonstress tests (NST) and biophysic...","","Abstract In August 2015, the Corona outbreak caused by Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) was the 9th episode since June 2012 in Saudi Arabia. Little is known about the public awareness toward the nature or prevention of the disease. The aim of this work was to assess the knowledge of the adult population in Riyadh toward the MERS-CoV. In this cross-sectional survey, a self-administrated questionnaire was distributed to randomly selected participants visiting malls in Riyadh. The questionnaire contained measurable epidemiological and clinical MERS-CoV knowledge level variables and relevant source of information. The study included 676 participants. Mean age was 32.5 (\u00b1SD 8.6) years and 353 (47.8%) were males. Almost all participants heard about the corona disease and causative agent. The study showed a fair overall knowledge (66.0%), less knowledge on epidemiological features of the disease (58.3%), and good knowledge (90.7%) on the clinical manifestation of the ME...","","The novel coronavirus, COVID-19, has sparked an outflow of scientific research seeking to understand the virus, its spread, and best practices in prevention and treatment. If this international research effort is going to be as swift and effective as possible, it will need to rely on a principle of open science. When researchers share data, code, and software and generally make their work as transparent as possible, it allows other researchers to verify and expand upon their work. Furthermore, it allows public officials to make informed decisions. In this study, we analyzed 535 preprint articles related to COVID-19 for eight transparency criteria and recorded study location and funding information. We found that individual researchers have lined up to help during this crisis, quickly tackling important public health questions, often without funding or support from outside organizations. However, most authors could improve their data sharing and scientific reporting practices. The contr...","Abstract Context In 2012, the French Infectious Diseases Society (French acronym SPILF) initiated the \u201cCoordination of epidemic and biological risk\u201d (SPILF-COREB - Emergences [SCE]) group to support the readiness and response of healthcare workers (HCWs) to new alerts. Objective To present the SCE group, its functioning, and the main support it provided for frontline HCWs. Methods A multidisciplinary group of heads of infectious disease departments from reference hospitals was created to build a network of clinical expertise for care, training, and research in the field of epidemic and biological risk (EBR). The network developed a set of standardized operational procedures (SOPs) to guide interventions to manage EBR-suspect patients. Results A working group created the SOP aimed at frontline HCWs taking care of patients. Priority was given to the development of a generic procedure, which was then adapted according to the current alert. Five key steps were identified and hierarchized: ...","Abstract The current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia pandemic, caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus, is spreading globally at an accelerated rate, with a basic reproduction number (R0) of 2 \u2013 2.5, indicating that 2 \u2013 3 persons will be infected from an index patient. A serious public health emergency, it is particularly deadly in vulnerable populations and communities in which healthcare providers are insufficiently prepared to manage the infection. As of March 16, 2020, there are more than 180,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19 worldwide, with over 7,000 related deaths. The SARS-CoV-2 virus has been isolated from asymptomatic individuals, and affected patients continue to be infectious two weeks after cessation of symptoms. The substantial morbidity and socioeconomic impact have necessitated drastic measures across all continents, including nationwide lockdowns and border closures. Pregnant women and their fetuses represent a high-risk populat...","Protection of frontline HCPs is paramount. However, PPE is a limited resource and often requires providers to be adaptive and resourceful in a crisis. The inexpensive and simple method of using clear drapes during extubation (and possibly intubation) of COVID-19 patients may be considered by frontline HCPs and infection control specialists as an additional precaution. Modifications of the clear plastics can be adapted for surgical procedures that may be AGMPs.","Abstract The emergence of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic presents an unprecedented health communications challenge. Healthcare providers should reinforce behaviors that limit the spread of the pandemic, including social distancing and remaining in the home whenever possible. Formal communications toolkits may not be prepared in a timely fashion. Community pharmacists can reinforce mitigation behaviors by applying the health belief model (HBM). This commentary provides an overview of the HBM and offers suggestions on how community pharmacists can use it as a guide to patient communication in these uncertain contexts.","AbstractThe SARS-CoV-2 epidemic has rapidly spread outside China with major outbreaks occurring in Italy, South Korea and Iran. Phylogenetic analyses of whole genome sequencing data identified a distinct SARS-CoV-2 clade linked to travellers returning from Iran to Australia and New Zealand. This study highlights potential viral diversity driving the epidemic in Iran, and underscores the power of rapid genome sequencing and public data sharing to improve the detection and management of emerging infectious diseases.","With the increasing threat of pandemic influenza and catastrophic bioterrorism, it is important for intensive care providers to be prepared to meet the challenge of large-scale airborne epidemics causing mass casualty respiratory failure. The severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak exposed the vulnerability of health care workers and highlighted the importance of establishing stringent infection control and crisis management protocols. Patients who have acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome who require mechanical ventilation should receive a lung protective, low tidal volume strategy. Controversy remains regarding the use of high-frequency oscillatory ventilation and noninvasive positive pressure ventilation. Standard, contact, and airborne precautions should be instituted in intensive care units, with special care taken when aerosol-generating procedures are performed.","The recently emerged coronavirus in Wuhan, China has claimed at least six lives as of January 22 and infected hundreds if not thousands of individuals. The situation has drawn international attention, including from the virology community. We applaud the rapid release to the public of the genome sequence of the new virus by Chinese virologists, but we also believe that increased transparency on disease reporting and data sharing with international colleagues are crucial for curbing the spread of this newly emerging virus to other parts of the world.","Abstract Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is caused by SARS-COV2 and represents the causative agent of a potentially fatal disease that is of great global public health concern. Based on the large number of infected people that were exposed to the wet animal market in Wuhan City, China, it is suggested that this is likely the zoonotic origin of COVID-19. Person-to-person transmission of COVID-19 infection led to the isolation of patients that were subsequently administered a variety of treatments. Extensive measures to reduce person-to-person transmission of COVID-19 have been implemented to control the current outbreak. Special attention and efforts to protect or reduce transmission should be applied in susceptible populations including children, health care providers, and elderly people. In this review, we highlights the symptoms, epidemiology, transmission, pathogenesis, phylogenetic analysis and future directions to control the spread of this fatal disease.","BACKGROUND: As the 2014 Ebola virus disease outbreak (EVD) transitions to its post-endemic phase, its impact on the future of global public health, particularly the World Health Organization (WHO), is the subject of continued debate. Criticism of WHO\u2019s performance grew louder in the outbreak\u2019s wake, placing this international health UN-specialized agency in the difficult position of navigating a complex series of reform recommendations put forth by different stakeholders. Decisions on WHO governance reform and the broader role of the United Nations could very well shape the future landscape of 21st century global health and how the international community responds to health emergencies. DISCUSSION: In order to better understand the implications of the EVD outbreak on global health and infectious disease governance, this debate article critically examines a series of reports issued by four high-level commissions/panels convened to specifically assess WHO\u2019s performance post-Ebola. Collec...","The review aims to examine the emergence and reemergence of infectious diseases in Jordan, in parallel with the Syrian refugee crisis. Qualitative approach has been adopted for systematically examining the outcomes of the Syrian crisis, which resulted in emerging and reemerging infectious diseases. It has adhered that infectious diseases, including measles, tuberculosis, and cutaneous leishmaniasis, have hazardous effects on Syrian refugees along with the local population in Jordan. The threat of major infectious diseases is higher and alarming in Jordan. National health policies should be implemented to adhere the influence of infectious diseases as well as to reduce the extent of infectious diseases in Jordan. In the 21st century, Syrian conflict can be deliberated as one of the biggest humanitarian disasters. In this multifaceted emergency with devastating requirements and limitations, it has been found essential for dominant medical healthcare providers to develop medical strategie...","Abstract The globe is currently in the midst of a COVID-19 pandemic resulting in significant morbidity and mortality. This pandemic has placed considerable stress on health care resources and providers. This document from the Canadian Association of Interventional Cardiology - Association Canadienne de Cardiologie d'intervention, specifically addresses the implications for the care of patients in the Cardiac Catheterization Laboratory (CCL) in Canada during the COVID-19 pandemic. The key principles of this document are to maintain essential interventional cardiovascular care while minimizing risks of COVID-19 to patients/staff and maintaining the overall healthcare resources. As the COVID-19 pandemic evolves, procedures will be increased or reduced based on the current level of restriction to health care services. While some consistency across the country is desirable, provincial and regional considerations will influence how these recommendations are implemented. We believe the framew...","AbstractBackgroundThe current outbreak caused by novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) in China has become a worldwide concern. As of 28 January 2020, there were 4631 confirmed cases and 106 deaths, and 11 countries or regions were affected.MethodsWe downloaded the genomes of 2019-nCoVs and similar isolates from the Global Initiative on Sharing Avian Influenza Database (GISAID and nucleotide database of the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). Lasergene 7.0 and MEGA 6.0 softwares were used to calculate genetic distances of the sequences, to construct phylogenetic trees, and to align amino acid sequences. Bayesian coalescent phylogenetic analysis, implemented in the BEAST software package, was used to calculate the molecular clock related characteristics such as the nucleotide substitution rate and the most recent common ancestor (tMRCA) of 2019-nCoVs.ResultsAn isolate numbered EPI_ISL_403928 showed different phylogenetic trees and genetic distances of the whole length genome, ...","The current state of much of the Wuhan pneumonia virus (COVID-19) research shows a regrettable lack of data sharing and considerable analytical obfuscation. This impedes global research cooperation, which is essential for tackling public health emergencies, and requires unimpeded access to data, analysis tools, and computational infrastructure. Here we show that community efforts in developing open analytical software tools over the past ten years, combined with national investments into scientific computational infrastructure, can overcome these deficiencies and provide an accessible platform for tackling global health emergencies in an open and transparent manner. Specifically, we use all COVID-19 genomic data available in the public domain so far to (1) underscore the importance of access to raw data and to (2) demonstrate that existing community efforts in curation and deployment of biomedical software can reliably support rapid, reproducible research during global health crises. A...","OBJECTIVES: This study examines perceptions of the operational and organisational management of a major outbreak of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) caused by a novel coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA). Perspectives were sought from key decision-makers and clinical staff about the factors perceived to promote and inhibit effective and rapid control of the outbreak. SETTING: A large teaching tertiary healthcare centre in KSA; the outbreak lasted 6 weeks from June 2015. PARTICIPANTS: Data were collected via individual and focus group interviews with 28 key informant participants (9 management decision-makers and 19 frontline healthcare workers). DESIGN: We used qualitative methods of process evaluation to examine perceptions of the outbreak and the factors contributing to, or detracting from successful management. Data were analysed using qualitative thematic content analysis. RESULTS: Five themes and 15 subthemes were found. The themes were related to: (1...","Abstract Objective MERS-CoV infection is uncommonly identified among patients visiting healthcare facilities &amp; we were vigilant in screening all patients entering our hospital to prevent cross infection among patients, visitors &amp; healthcare providers and aiming to prevent potential outbreaks with MERS-CoV infection. In spite of our efforts on practicing Failure Mode Effect Analysis for MERS-CoV infection management we ended up having an outbreak with MERS-CoV. Based on our experience, we actively implemented policies, procedures &amp; practices on early identification &amp; appropriate isolation practices along with supplemental infection prevention &amp; control measures for preventing future outbreaks at our healthcare facility. Methods Retrospectively we analyzed our failure in preventing the outbreak of MERS-CoV infection among our hospitalized patients by identifying the outbreak &amp; actively intervening as a team to control the outbreak with the support of Hospital Higher management, Administr...","Abstract Apart from bat-SARS-CoV, we have identified a novel group 1 coronavirus, bat-CoV HKU2, in Rhinolophus sinicus (Chinese horseshoe bats). Since it has been suggested that the receptor-binding motif (RBM) of SARS-CoV may have been acquired from a group 1 coronavirus, we conducted a surveillance study and identified bat-SARS-CoV and bat-CoV HKU2 in 8.7% and 7.5% respectively of R. sinicus in Hong Kong and Guangdong. Complete genome sequencing of four strains of bat-CoV HKU2 revealed the smallest coronavirus genome (27164 nucleotides) and a unique spike protein evolutionarily distinct from the rest of the genome. This spike protein, sharing similar deletions with other group 2 coronaviruses in its C-terminus, also contained a 15-amino acid peptide homologous to a corresponding peptide within the RBM of spike protein of SARS-CoV, which was absent in other coronaviruses except bat-SARS-CoV. These suggest a common evolutionary origin in the spike protein of bat-CoV HKU2, bat-SARS-CoV,...","Abstract Introduction Breast radiotherapy accounts for a significant proportion of patient volume in contemporary radiation oncology practice. In the setting of anticipated resource constraints and widespread community infection with SARS-CoV-2 during the COVID-19 pandemic, measures for balancing both infectious and oncologic risk among patients and providers must be carefully considered. Here, we present evidence-based guidelines for omitting or abbreviating breast cancer radiotherapy, where appropriate, in an effort to mitigate risk to patients and optimize resource utilization. Methods Multidisciplinary breast cancer experts at a high-volume comprehensive cancer center convened contingency planning meetings over the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic to review the relevant literature and establish recommendations for the application of hypofractionated and abbreviated breast radiation regimens. Results Substantial evidence exists to support omitting radiation among certain favorabl...","Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a newly emerged infection that is caused by a previously unrecognized virus\u2013a novel coronavirus designated as SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV). From November 2002 to July 2003 the cumulative number of worldwide cases was &gt;8000, with a mortality rate of close to 10%. The mortality has been higher in older patients and those with co-morbidities. SARS has been defined using clinical and epidemiological criteria and cases are considered laboratory-confirmed if SARS coronavirus is isolated, if antibody to SARS coronavirus is detected, or a polymerase chain reaction test by appropriate criteria is positive. At the time of writing (24 May 2004), no specific therapy has been recommended. A variety of treatments have been attempted, but there are no controlled data. Most patients have been treated throughout the illness with broad-spectrum antimicrobials, supplemental oxygen, intravenous fluids, and other supportive measures. Transmission of SAR...","Summary Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a respiratory tract infection caused by a newly emergent coronavirus, that was first recognized in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. Currently, the World Health Organization (WHO) has defined the infection as a global pandemic and there is a health and social emergency for the management of this new infection. While most people with COVID-19 develop only mild or uncomplicated illness, approximately 14% develop severe disease that requires hospitalization and oxygen support, and 5% require admission to an intensive care unit (1). In severe cases, COVID-19 can be complicated by the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), sepsis and septic shock, and multiorgan failure. This consensus document has been prepared on evidence-informed guidelines developed by a multidisciplinary panel of health care providers from four spanish scientific societies (Spanish Society of Intensive Care Medicine [SEMICYUC], Spanish Society of Pulmonologists [SEPAR],...","2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is an emerging infectious disease closely related to MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV that was first reported in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China in December 2019. As of January 2020, cases of 2019-nCoV are continuing to be reported in other Eastern Asian countries as well as in the United States, Europe, Australia, and numerous other countries. An unusually high volume of domestic and international travel corresponding to the beginning of the 2020 Chinese New Year complicated initial identification and containment of infected persons. Due to the rapidly rising number of cases and reported deaths, all countries should be considered at risk of imported 2019-nCoV. Therefore, it is essential for prehospital, clinic, and emergency department personnel to be able to rapidly assess 2019-nCoV risk and take immediate actions if indicated. The Identify-Isolate-Inform (3I) Tool, originally conceived for the initial detection and management of Ebola virus and later adjust...","Abstract First identified in 2001, human metapneumovirus (HMPV) is a novel pathogen and causative agent of acute respiratory tract infection. Re-infection with HMPV is common, and currently there is no available vaccine against HMPV infection. Two genotypes of HMPV have been identified, A and B, both of which can be divided further into at least two distinct sub-genotypes. Here we report the results of the first study to investigate the genetic variability of HMPV strains circulating within Cambodia. The overall incidence of HMPV infection amongst an all-ages population of patients hospitalised with ALRI in Cambodia during 3 consecutive years, between 2007 and 2009, was 1.7%. The incidence of HMPV infection was highest amongst children less than 5 years of age, with pneumonia or bronchopneumonia the most frequent clinical diagnoses across all age groups. The incidence of HMPV infection varied annually. As anticipated, genetic diversity was low amongst the conserved F gene sequences but...","Background: The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) continues to expand across the world. Though both the number of cases and mortality rate in children and adolescents is reported to be low in comparison to adults, limited data has been reported on the outbreak with respect to pediatric patients. To elucidate information, we utilized crowdsourced data to perform a preliminary epidemiologic analysis of pediatric patients with COVID-19 Methods: In this observational study, data was collected from two open-access, line list crowdsourced online databases. Pediatric cases of COVID-19 were defined as patients \u226419 years of age with a laboratory confirmed diagnosis. The primary outcomes were case counts and cumulative case counts. Secondary outcomes included days between symptoms onset and first medical care and days between first medical care and reporting. Tertiary outcomes were rate of travel to Wuhan, rate of infected family members and rates of symptoms. Results: A total of 8...","Objectives The aim of the present study was to prevent cross-infection in the operating room during emergency procedures for patients with confirmed or suspected 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) by following anesthesia management protocols, and to document clinical- and anesthesia-related characteristics of these patients.

Although the risk of infection in the US is currently low, it is important to understand the public perception of risk and trust in sources of information to better inform public health messaging. In this study, we surveyed the adult US population to understand their risk perceptions about the COVID-19 outbreak. Methods and Findings: We used an online platform to survey 718 adults in the US in early February 2020 using a questionnaire that we developed. Our sample was fairly similar to the general adult US population in terms of age, gender, race, ethnicity and education. We found that 69% of the respondents wanted the scientific/public health leadership (either the CDC Director or NIH Director) to lead the US response to COVID-19 outbreak as compared to 14% who wanted the political leadership (either the president or the Congress) to lead the response. Risk perception was low (median score of 5 out of 10) with the respondents trusti...","The last decades have been characterized by the appearance of a substantial number of newly recognized or novel infectious agents and by the re-emergence of infectious diseases with a global impact. The objective of this article is to briefly describe the model of hospital response for early diagnosis and prompt management of patients with highly contagious infectious diseases. We reviewed the main components of hospital preparedness in response to clustering of highly contagious diseases. A model for the initial hospital response to an epidemic in our referral Institute is discussed. Prompt recognition and identification is the initial and indispensable step in facing any communicable diseases, regardless of whether it is a prevalent, a newly emerging one or deliberately released. The importance of developing and implementing nontraditional methods of public health surveillance and a system that allows a wide and immediate dissemination of information and exchange of views on risk ass...","Profiling the genetic evolution and dynamic spreading of viruses is a crucial task when responding to epidemic outbreaks. We aim to devise novel ways to model, visualise and analyse the temporal dynamics of epidemic outbreaks in order to help researchers and other people involved in crisis response to make well-informed and targeted decisions about from which geographical locations and time periods more genetic samples may be required to fully understand the outbreak. Our approach relies on the application of Transcendental Information Cascades to a set of temporally ordered nucleotide sequences and we apply it to real-world data that was collected during the currently ongoing outbreak of the novel 2019-nCoV coronavirus. We assess information-theoretic and network-theoretic measures that characterise the resulting complex network and suggest touching points and temporal pathways that are of interest for deeper investigation by geneticists and epidemiologists.","Abstract This chapter provides an overview of the basic theory of early warning for infectious diseases, including definitions of surveillance, early warning and prediction; the characteristics of early warning (surveillance, information for action, timeliness, insufficiency, and the uncertainty of information); a conceptual framework of an early warning system for infectious diseases (the target setting, data collection and analysis, disseminating early warning signals, response actions, and evaluation); classifying early warning based on the data sources (case-based, event-based, laboratory-based, or syndromic surveillance). The significance of early warning for infectious diseases, the status quo and research and application trends in the field are also highlighted.","These first UK cases of COVID-19 raise important points about the management of cases of HCID in England. The decision to test for SARS-CoV-2 is based on a clinical and epidemiological case definition, and testing is only approved if this is met. When tested, neither of these people clearly met the current case definition, and had criteria been strictly applied, testing might not have been done. A decision to test was made because of high clinical suspicion and in response to latest available information about the distribution of infection. It is important that testing is appropriately targeted, and this is best done by applying clear case definitions. However, with any newly emerging infection, case definitions must evolve rapidly as information accrues. There should also be room for flexibility on the basis of discussion with clinical and public health experts","Resumen Multitud de portales inform\u00e1ticos aparecen d\u00eda a d\u00eda, sobresaturando de informaci\u00f3n a la comunidad m\u00e9dica y no m\u00e9dica, y que no siempre es confiable y puede encubrir motivos comerciales y propaganda diseminada sin control alguno.

In many instances, mouse models have improved our understanding of the human immune response to infection; however, when dealing with emerging zoonotic diseases, they may be of limited use. This is particularly the case when the model fails to reproduce the disease status that is seen in the natural reservoir, transmission species or human host. In this Review, we discuss how researchers are placing more emphasis on the study of the immune response to zoonotic infections in the natural reservoir hosts and spillover species. Such studies will not only lead to a greater understanding of how these infections induce variable disease and immune responses in distinct species but also offer important insights into the evolution of mammalian immune systems.

data sharing is identified as a major requirement for the successful use of HTS in public health microbiology and global surveillance, but raises challenges linked to data access and use. Alan Hay (MRC National Institute for Medical Research, London, UK) shared his experience of the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID). The rapid evolution of human influenza A viruses is driven by a combination of progressive sequence changes in antigenic determinants and infrequent reassortment of the genomes with those of highly distinct animal influenza viruses. A. Hay described how the Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System (and the former Global Influenza Surveillance Network) coordinated by the WHO functions as a highly responsive global cooperative mechanism that provides the basis for biannual recommendations on vaccine composition, and the early detection of and rapid response to novel influenza virus infections. Recent zoonotic infections have increased awareness of the pandemic potential of deadly influenza variants, such as H5N1 or H7N9. The strong demand for transparency of available information, and especially of genome sequence data, led to the establishment in 2008 of the GISAID EpiFlu database, in order to promote responsible sharing of all influenza virus sequences and related clinical and epidemiological data. The EpiFlu database now includes sequences from nearly 100,000 influenza viruses and has two key founding principles. First, submitters are committed to provide data with no restrictions on their use, while retaining ownership. At the same time, users of data are committed to acknowledge the providers and make every effort to collaborate with them. A. Hay described how the resulting trust among scientists fostered international collaboration for the benefit of human as well as animal health.","\u2022 Litigation: negligent hiring/supervision. under the doctrine of respondeat superior, the employer may be held responsible for negligence by an employee. Training that informs workers on what they can and cannot do can mitigate claims. risk analysis further lowers workplace vulnerability to lawsuits. 19 \u2022 Substance abuse (drugs/alcohol in the workplace). employee drug testing is widely used in industry. policies, procedures, consent forms, checklists, and training materials are needed for such programs. 20 \u2022 Business espionage/theft of trade secrets. For many organizations, the loss of crucial information is of greater importance than the fraudulent disappearance of products or supplies. These transgressions include espionage or theft of trade secrets, including developmental procedures and know-how. \u2022 Environmental/social robberies. robberies are categorized as the third most significant crime in the hierarchy of the FBI's Uniform Crime Reports. robbery is the taking or attempting to take anything of value from the care, custody, or control of someone. Force or threat of force of violence and putting the victim in fear is a characteristic of this crime. robbery mitigation is likely to succeed when risk mitigation is put into place. \u2022 Intellectual property/brand protection/product counterfeiting. The brand, product, and information of an organization are precious assets. Intellectual property can walk out the door or be accessed through a few keystrokes. Security practitioners are interested in preventing this loss and also investigating possible incursions early on to lessen the damage. 21 \u2022 Global supply chain security. The stealing of goods that are being transported or stored is an ongoing concern for product manufacturers and distributors. 22 Outright theft requires prompt investigation and response. Broad transportation issues include container tracking and transit point security. \u2022 Executive protection (including travel security). The protection of senior officials from risk has become a highly evolved skill that draws upon management planning and analysis. 23 protection choreography, advance security preparations, domestic and international travel assessment, and physical training are all involved in the process. \u2022 Insurance/workers' compensation fraud. Organizations that provide workers' compensation insurance sometimes encounter abuse, which requires investigation and response. A security program is generally tasked with investigating other incidents concerning insurance claims. \u2022 Crisis management and response: international terrorism. The bombings of the World Trade Center, the Boston Marathon, the Oklahoma City federal building, and public and private assets in various locales domestically and globally suggest the importance of measures to deter such attacks. 24 As a global activity, security planners look at risks from unstable parts of the world, and political risks from groups such as ISIS (or ISIL) that could destabilize the world and affect conventional operations. \u2022 Bombings/bomb threats. Bombings in the workplace are rare. Bomb threats are frequent. Security practitioners devise strategies to analyze and deal with threats as they are received.","This exploration will assist in better visualization of any emerging epidemic spread in a more realistic sense. We also believe that our methods could provide additional tools for those epidemic modelers who frequently use modeling tools such as ODE and PDE, to begin with. We are not only looking for academic development through this project but, also a clear non-trivial body of techniques for applications of harmonic analysis that has never been seen before in terms of developing epidemic analysis. We plan to come up with some interesting insights on how to construct wavelets for medical applications. The bottom line is that we will be able to help public health planners for better management and courses of action during emerging epidemics. The kind of analysis we present here to fill missing pieces of epidemic reporting information can be applied to other areas, for example, constructing total rhythm of a heartbeat from partial information, etc.","There is little modern health care experience with respiratory mass casualties of this scale. However, it is apparent that the mortality, morbidity, and public confidence in the time of an airborne pandemic are likely to be highly dependent on the critical care response. It is therefore imperative for critical care providers to take the lead in planning and preparing for largescale airborne epidemics and pandemics. Issues to be considered include developing triage protocols, augmenting ICU surge staffing, implementing rational infection control measures, stockpiling medical equipment and supplies, and information sharing among many units.","These include citizens' participation in the prevention process, health education, the effectiveness of instructive traditions, environmental conditions, and so on. This article strived to analyze the growth trend of the number of patients, deaths and patients recovered in some provinces of Iran. The knowledge gained can help health planners and planners. Combining the findings of this study with other countries' studies can help to extract a global pattern for the virus outbreak process analysis. We believe that there are still many factors that can be included in the study. Adding these factors helps to validate and consolidate the .

It is meant to provide a practical overview of key recommendations for the management of infectious dead bodies and human remains. In addition, it is also meant for practitioners, managers and planners, including decision makers involved in the overall response to the COVID-19 pandemic.","Patient-to-patient via direct contact Patient-to-patient via indirect contact due to environmental contamination (ie, sharing same hospital room, admission to a hospital room previously occupied by a patient with C auris) Less Common Patient-to-patient via indirect contact: shared equipment due to inadequate disinfection (eg, thermometer) Patient-to-patient via direct contact: donor-derived transmission (eg, lung transplantation) Person-to-person via indirect contact due to transiently colonized health care provider's hands health care providers (2.8%), although this was likely due to inadequate hand hygiene rather than long-term colonization. Schelenz et al, 139 while conducting an outbreak investigation in the United Kingdom, screened (nose, axilla, groin, and throat) &gt;250 health care providers for colonization and found only a single person (nurse) transiently colonized with C auris.","We attempt to describe how the performed ERC strategy, during the first days of the outbreak, might have contributed to the authorities\u2019 credibility, public trust, and outbreak control measures. We believe this case study might be useful to emergency planners for developing scenarios regarding what communication challenges to expect during the first days of a novel virus outbreak. It also represents an example of how practitioners, which are involved in the response to an outbreak, can engage in ERC evaluation efforts. Such efforts can be focused on ERC processes as in this case, or on ERC outcomes, and are both very much needed in public health emergency preparedness, as recently pointed by several literature reviews [9,10,11].","Few population-based estimates of the incidence of RSV disease in developing countries are available, although existing data clearly indicate that, there also, the virus accounts for a high proportion of LRIs in children. Studies in Colombia, Brazil, India and Thailand show that RSV causes 20-30% of LRI cases in children from 1 to 4 years of age, a proportion similar to that observed in industrialized countries. In addition to accurate incidence rates, other important data for developing countries are lacking, such as the severity and case-fatality rates for RSV infection at the community level and the median age of first infection. Preliminary data from community-based studies suggest that the median age of first infection may vary between communities. This information is important for vaccination program planners, when considering the optimal schedule for vaccination. For example, maternal immunization against RSV would be a desirable strategy to adopt if rates of infection during the first two months of life were found to be high.","Hajj planners, public health experts and mass gathering medicine experts must collaborate intensely in advance of these events for the best possible outcomes.","Tort liability shield intended to protect vaccine manufacturers, distributors, program planners, and administrators of vaccines from financial risk in the event of a loss from vaccines.","Many people experiencing homelessness have chronic mental and physical conditions, 4 engage in high rates of substance abuse (including sharing of needles), 5 and have often less access to health care, 6 all of which could lead to potential problems with screening, quarantining, and treating people who might have COVID-19. Such problems have occurred as recently as last year, when outbreaks of typhus, hepatitis A, tuberculosis, trench fever, and Shigella bacteria were reported among people experiencing homelessness in US cities with large homeless populations. 7 There are some additional issues, which are unique to people experiencing homelessness, to consider with regards to COVID-19. Homeless populations might be more transient and geographically mobile than individuals in the general population, 8 making it difficult to track and prevent transmission and to treat those who need care. COVID-19 was recently found to be transmittable via the oral-faecal route. 9 Some major US cities with large homeless populations, like San Francisco, have experienced issues with public defecation, which might pose an additional transmission risk for people experiencing homelessness and other individuals. Together, the multitude of potential vulnerabilities and risks for people experiencing homelessness in becoming infected, needing care, and transmitting COVID-19 cannot be ignored and must be planned for. Some lessons can be learned from the response to severe acute respiratory syndrome among homeless service providers nearly two decades ago. 10 Testing kits and training on how to recognise COVID-19 should be widely disseminated to homeless service providers and deployed in shelters, encampments, and street outreach. Alternative spaces might be needed to quarantine and treat people experiencing homelessness.","Fortunately, public health experts and the field of MG medicine are seasoned at managing outbreaks and preparations are already underway and Hajj planners have a uniquely intense and informed ","The data, available for 27 of the 30 countries where FGM is practiced, will strengthen the economic argument of community activists, policy makers, programme planners and donors working to end this human rights violation.","If public health planners fail to anticipate coronavirus outbreaks during these remarkably international MG events, the ramifications will be global [7] . This is because MGs are effectively massive 'hubs' with the potential to disseminate infection. The MG participants, religious pilgrims and Olympics spectators and participants can act as 'spokes' enabling spread of disease. MG facilitated spread of COVID-19 could overshadow even the epicenter of the outbreak in Wuhan, China.","is the (which was not peer-reviewed) The copyright holder for this preprint . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.25.20043711 doi: medRxiv preprint Outputs from the tool will allow planners to examine how increases in acute and critical resources available for COVID-19 patients can impact healthcare system sustainability. Further, the tool can inform the required intensity for non-pharmaceutical societal interventions like physical distancing based on a healthcare system's proximity to the sustainable threshold.","High population density and high volume of public transportation A larger population to be managed; ease of disease spread between humans in congested areas; difficulties in contact tracing, especially causal contact in public areas; inequalities resulting in poor housing environments that might hinder outbreak prevention and control efforts; closer encounters with wildlife via food markets or because of expansion into previously untouched ecosystems Urban planners can consider epidemic preparedness in their designs and implementation; transport networks can be used to rapidly move supplies to outbreak epicentres; harnessing advancement in technologies for more effective contact tracing","Crisis management and response: political unrest/regional instability/national disasters (evacuation potential) understanding of the security vulnerabilities, these few can cause substantial losses of assets. \u2022 Crisis management and response: domestic terrorism. risk exposures can occur at home and abroad. The security practitioner has the duty to qualify and manage threats and vulnerabilities. 15 Organizations that operate in nations where there are risks to employees and assets require constant monitoring. Optimal security operations must seek to assess the risks in various nations. They must further stay abreast of any changing conditions that could lead to threats to employees or expropriations of assets. In the event of an emergency, security planners must attempt to remove employers safely from harm's way. \u2022 Unethical business conduct. In many circumstances, one of the tasks for security operations is to play varying roles in drafting, monitoring, and enforcing an organizational code of ethical conduct. 16 \u2022 Identity theft. In a recent year almost 12 million persons were victimized by the effects from identity theft in the united States. The crime has no borders, so victims are found globally. Workplaces are impacted when merchandise is transported to perpetrators or their agents. 17 \u2022 Environmental/social pandemics (e.g., Ebola virus). ebola, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SArS), and other viral attacks impact the workplace, although immediate risks are few. Typically, organizations plan on how to conduct operations as close to normal as possible in the unlike event that a pandemic hits close to home. In 2014, security directors of global organizations prepared contingency plans in the event that operations or supply chain activity was interrupted by the ebola virus. \u2022 Crisis management and response: political unrest/regional instability/national disaster (evacuation potential). The supply chain can be shut down if a key material, part, or assembly cannot be delivered due to an interruption. Security practitioners have roles in assuring that, as far as possible, alternative resources are available. Similarly, some security programs have 24/7 active monitoring of global conditions where the organization operates. \u2022 Litigation: inadequate security. The reality or fear of legal action for negligence is one of the driving features in security management today. Security program operators are involved in a variety of activities related to these risks, including instituting procedures and controls to reduce such risks and preparing actions or defenses for legal cases. 18 \u2022 Fraud/white-collar crime. The term \"white-collar crime\" was coined by the sociologist edwin Sutherland, and signifies unlawful, nonviolent conduct committed by corporations and individuals. It includes theft, fraud, and other violations of trust, including embezzlement. embezzlement is the fraudulent appropriation of property by one lawfully entrusted with its possession. Frequently, this crime is committed by someone with a fiduciary responsibility within the organization, which he or she then abuses. The investigation and prevention of fraud (i.e., false representation or intentional perversion of truth to induce another to part with something valuable) is an important task in any organization.","Hajj was canceled predates the formation of the modern KSA, Islam mandates that the sanctity of human life be placed above all other rights including the right of God to demand worship by mankind. With this in mind, the KSA in canceling Hajj 2020 well in advance of the events would be very much in line with Islamic ideals and would contribute greatly to the safety of humanity in doing so [6] . We also predict that Hajj planners and the Saudi authorities will very much set the tone for the international community in addressing many forthcoming mass gatherings including the forthcoming Olympics in Japan (see Fig. 1 ).","Our results show that the 2019 novel Coronavirus is an extremely rapidly spreading and dangerous infectious disease, with the potential to infect a very large proportion of the population very rapidly if not contained. Extreme epidemic prevention measures, including city closures and wide-scale self-quarantine, may be necessary simply to reduce the pace of the epidemic, and even these extreme measures may not be sufficient to prevent pandemic. City officials, public health planners, policy-makers and governments in countries that are beginning to see the spread of this disease domestically need to act quickly, effectively and decisively, as the government of China did, to prevent a serious global pandemic.","Seven priority proposals can be outlined as follows: encourage research on the prediction, screening and early detection of new risks of infection; develop research and surveillance concerning transmission of pathogens between animals and humans, with their reinforcement in particular in intertropical areas (''hot-spots'') thanks to public support; pursue aid development and support in these areas of prevention and training for local health personnel, and to foster risk awareness in the population; ensure adapted patient care in order to promote adherence to treatment and to epidemic propagation reduction measures; develop greater sensitization and training among politicians and healthcare providers, in order to better prepare them to respond to new types of crises; modify the logic of governance, drawing from all available modes of communication and incorporating new information-sharing tools; develop economic research on the fight against EIDs, taking into account specific determining factors in order to create a balance between preventive and treatment approaches.","While the KSA annually hosts 7.5 million religious' visitors-Muslims can perform an abbreviated pilgrimage known as Umrah any time of the year for which the KSA issues visas year-round. In the months leading up to Ramadan-beginning this year on April 23rd and later the Hajj -anticipated in August this year, the KSA attracts longer term religious pilgrims often in KSA for some weeks to months before the pinnacle act of Hajj, one of the five pillars of Islamic belief. With such huge number of pilgrims from almost every nation on earth, Hajj planners and the KSA government have been focused on ways to contain the coronavirus through the lens of an international perspective.","Such a quick response is possible when surveillance works and there is on-site capacity to isolate and identify new viruses. An essential element of this response is prompt, transparent and thorough outbreak reporting and public sharing of the generated data. The sequence information has enabled the design of primers to develop surveillance tests that have enabled subsequent diagnoses and some coronavirus laboratories are already trying to rescue the virus, which will allow the development of antibody-based tests and, possibly, experimentation in animal models if they are susceptible. Although of vital importance and something that has been called for on several occasions, rapid outbreak reporting and open access posting of outbreak data before publication has not always been forthcoming and is thus something to support and celebrate. But it requires trust that the community will not use the data without proper attribution. Indeed, the consortium that published the Wuhan coronavirus sequences encourages the sharing, use and analysis of the data, and only asks that researchers communicate with them if they wish to publish results that use these data in a journal. The trust evidenced by this open sharing of information should not be broken, as the response to future outbreaks could be at stake.","While the overall principles are similar to those reported by colleagues in the US 9 and United Kingdom 10 , the concept of center-wide team segregation is central to our approach and was guided by our experience from the 2003 SARS epidemic. In the last six weeks we have had an opportunity to stress-test this model. We show that despite COVID-19 community transmission, the segregated team model allowed the continuation of cancer care and clinical trials, and may be replicable in other similar centers globally. While the exact workflow will be center-specific, we hope that the principles of the segregated team approach described here may provide a modifiable framework for local strategy planners in cancer centers at high risk for COVID-19 transmission. ","The strategies considered in this study are only a small subset of the conceivable approaches to managing the COVID-19 pandemic. Notably, we did not include the possibility of contact tracing, which can reduce the need for social distancing measures when the number of infected individuals is low, although the resources required to do this during a pandemic make it unlikely to be used on a large scale (Wu et al. 2006 ) . On the other hand, our model did not consider the uncertainty decision makers face regarding the actual number of infected individuals at a given time. Our simulation code, which we provide alongside this paper, is easily modified to model the long-term implications of these and other considerations. We invite planners to adapt it to investigate the specific questions they face.","Each of the 1000 epidemic simulations had a set of parameters, and was run for baseline and the four See Online for appendix control strategies. The median simulation was determined as the median cumulative number of cases at day 80. The same set of parameters was used for each 1000 set of simulations for each R 0 value. When analysing differences across infectivity scenarios, we compared the outputs of each simulation, which used the same parameters, not the medians of each grouping. We calculated IQRs as the 25th and 75th simulation in terms of cumulative case count at 80 days. We used R statistical software (version 3.6.3) to plot graphs and for all analyses. We chose to present intervention data for the scenario in which R 0 is 2\u00b70, because this represents a moderate and likely outbreak for policy planners. The relatively mild (R 0 =1\u00b75) and severe (R 0 =2.5) outbreak scenarios are presented in the appendix (pp 9-10).","Costa Rica (Hall, Gomez, &amp; Fernandez-Llimos, 2006) . Of those, four are MICs and three are medicines information services. The seven MICs and services followed the guidelines established by Pan-American Health Organization (PAHO), and the seven units provide almost comparable wide scope types of activities including as examples answering inquiries from user from inside as well as outside hospitals; preparation of technical reports for hospital committees; conducting research about drug use and adverse drug reactions; delivering lectures and seminars; participation in continuing education activities; conducting educational programs for patients and high-risk groups; publication of drug bulletins, papers, and booklets; supporting rotation programs for trained students; and preparation of guides on drug use for healthcare team. 4. Information sharing systems: A possible compensation for the lack and the scarcity of information is to establish an information sharing system by constructing a national or a regional medicines information database. The database may contain information needed by all stakeholders in the country or the region similar to the national information sharing system suggested by Muangchoo and Kritchanchai (2015) to serve the healthcare supply chain in Thailand.","Our world today witnesses huge advancements in the information-related technologies and in the amount of medicines information available and accessible by all healthcare providers as well as the public. This represents great challenge for pharmacists and puts more responsibility on them as medicines information specialists. To remain in the front line as information providers and as information experts, pharmacists need to provide specific, objective, up-to-date, and unbiased information and be very efficient, competent, and skillful while searching for and providing the information.","While smaller events such as the Formula One Race to be held in China in April have already been postponed, a final decision for postponing the Olympics and the Hajj has not been made awaiting more data on how this infection evolves over time. Our recommendation as experts who have monitored health hazards at the Hajj for over 15 years, especially if the situation with COVID-19 continues to escalate globally is that Hajj 2020 will be at risk of being suspended and a means for Muslims to fulfill their rights in the future either personally or even by proxy must be rapidly announced. While that decision will be heartbreaking for individual Muslims and both spiritually and economically damaging for the Kingdom, solace will be obtained in knowing the Muslim majority world can contribute to the wellbeing of humanity. Further, the Kingdom has the opportunity to lead the world in acknowledging that even the most beloved and long-awaited mass gathering events including the Olympics must sometimes be suspended, postponed or canceled. Hajj planners frequently consult on the management of mass gatherings including the US inauguration, the Olympics and the World Cup. Their preemptive management of the coronavirus crisis in the setting of the world's largest and most diverse mass gathering is being closely followed and will be a blueprint for other mass gatherings soon following.","Provision of medicines and toxicological information during bioterrorism and biologic weapons attacks and other emergencies: An attack with a biologic weapon during a terrorism event or a biologic war is a special medical emergency that requires special readiness with poisoning and toxicology information. In such situation a medicines information pharmacist or an MIC is expected to provide the suitable support to the healthcare team and the attacked victims in a timely and an efficient manner. 5. Provision of medicines information during a pandemic: A pandemic is an epidemic of infectious diseases, such as H5N1 avian flu, Zika virus, Ebola virus disease, Rift Valley fever, and severe acute respiratory syndrome, which have spread through human populations across a large geographical areas including multiple continents or even worldwide. During such situations, a medicines information pharmacist or an MIC experiences a rush of high-frequency calls from healthcare providers asking for treatment information, especially at the beginning of an outbreak when healthcare providers are still not fully aware and may be lacking basic information about the disease.","1. Poorest countries with limited resources should work on establishing national medicines information centers to cover the needs of the whole country. 2. Different institutions within the same country can work on establishing an information sharing system to facilitate information exchange and building up huge medicines information databases. 3. Collaboration among countries from the same region provides great opportunities to save resources and strengthening the capacities for attaining sustainable high-quality services. This can be achieved via sharing available experiences and resources and can be maximized by building collaborative regional MICs. 4. Institutions from developing countries with no or limited access to high-quality medicines information resources should seek assistance from supportive organizations such as the WHO, which can offer free access to the Hinari database. Other freely available resources should be also sought. 5. Medicines information education should be promoted among colleges of pharmacy at various levels including didactic courses during undergraduate studies, during APPE training of PharmD students and as postgraduate studies and training (i.e., residencies, fellowships, and masters programs). 6. Training for developing and strengthening the medicines information skills should be provided regularly to all practicing pharmacists as part of the continuing professional development (CPD) programs 7. Advanced training can be scheduled for pharmacists working on the provision of medicines information services as part of CPD activities to build their capacities and to raise their competencies. 8. Countries with limited experiences in the area of medicines information should work on to learn from countries having well-established systems of medicines information and try to copy successful innovations. 9. There is a need to monitor and evaluate various resources of medicines information available in the developing countries as well as evaluating the services provided by the medicines information centers. This is very useful for improvement and for the expansion and the sustainability of the services. Evaluations are done by conducting scientific research studies. Such researches should be published to allow others make use of the established evidence.","Methods: The team used Maternal Health booklet for reference to formulate Port-A-Cath Care booklet which contained the information of self-assessment, postoperative wound care, infusion notes, principle of care after discharge to home and infusion record after discussions and allowed patients to understand the use and management of port-a-cath. Results: Patients' condition at home and present condition at admission would be understood through self-assessment of brochure after their admission to hospital; therefore, nurses could provide patients with timely access to relevant information and nursing intervention. Since the implementation of the study at a regional hospital in February, 2017, we found that completion rate of port-a-cath care guidance reached 100%; in addition, patient satisfaction scores increased from 3.31 to 4.1, with a significant improvement in suitability of nursing procedure and timeliness of nursing care. Conclusion: Although we worry that giving more information regarding port-a-cath to the patients and family members will increase probability of disputes occurrence between patients and hospital staff if the staff members don't follow the standard of care, it is necessary to incorporate patients and family numbers into the gatekeeper mode to have a better understanding of clinical quality and thereby enhance education training of practice staff to improve patient safety. Background: Effective control of tuberculosis (TB) requires a close partnership between private and public healthcare providers. An integrated web-based information system is vital and crucial for engaging all relevant healthcare providers in prevention, diagnosis and treatment of TB. Methods: A \"MONITOR\" information system was established in 2016 by Taiwan Centers for Disease Control (TCDC) with single entryway and enhanced capacity and flexibility. Main purpose of the system is to promote more rapid response and provide decision support. Information such as TB epidemiology, case management, treatment, DOTS rate, contact tracing coverage, TB clusters, TB statistics and laboratory data are included in the system. Information without personal data can be viewed online with access permission. Daily laboratory data including AFB-smear, culture, identification, drug susceptibility testing and the interferon-gamma release assay (IGRA) are automatically entered from different interface of diverse information systems in clinical settings and public health sectors. The system provides timely warnings of drug-resistant cases, IGRA-positive cases and high-risk populations to management staff according to their responsibilities. In addition, daily scheduled analyses of laboratory quality indicators, turnaround time and visualized profiles are updated automatically.","BioSense is an information platform for the National Syndromic Surveillance Program (NSSP) of the US CDC (2017). It was designed to provide surveillance information that is obtained from unified and broadly applicable health surveillance methods for all levels of public health to detect diseases and related health problems early with a timely assessment and response. BioSense uses many forms of surveillance information, including complaints, symptoms and laboratory tests that are required for clinical diagnoses. Focusing on clinical symptoms and symptoms of diagnosed or undiagnosed cases, it reflects syndrome surveillance and constitutes, together with BioWatch and NBIS, the three core biological surveillance programs. BioSense is an international, multijurisdictional, information-sharing surveillance platform that applies to all levels of the public health sector. At the same time, given its use of standardized data elements and analytical methods, BioSense analysts can compare the public health status in different countries or regions in the same country. BioSense can visualize time, space, people and other information via maps, charts, tables and other forms, and the information that it presents can indicate data anomalies. When receiving a prompt, users can confirm the anomalies with related information and may provide an early warning of health problems. Since its development in 2003, BioSense has been greatly improved and developed to meet changing demands and user feedback, and its sources of information have expanded to the US Department Introduction CHAPTER 1 of Veterans Affairs, health-related information from the US DOD and treatment information for all citizens. It is jointly maintained and managed by the national CDC, state and district health departments, and other departments that apply this system.","Similar to a recent study regarding information-seeking behavior for MERS-CoV in Saudi Arabia [24] , most of the participants in this study reported the Internet as their main source of information about MERS-CoV. For this particular reason, research is urgently needed to determine how the Internet can be used for health promotion, particularly for emerging infectious diseases in this country or in a similar context. Alarmingly, the previous study found that the individuals who underestimated the fatality rate of MERS-CoV disease received their information from the Internet [24] . This finding may suggest that the quality of information currently available through the Internet is inadequate and in need of revision. Moreover, a very low percentage of participants indicated that their main source of information was healthcare providers. This scenario reflects a lack of engagement of healthcare workers in increasing awareness of the public regarding the different aspects of MERS-CoV. Measures should be taken to ensure that healthcare workers actually assume their role as the main providers of reliable and correct information.","SARS galvanized the international community to finally conclude drafting of the revised IHR. The IHR bind WHO member countries to not only notify all events that may constitute a public health emergency, but also to respond to requests for verification of information. WHO has also produced outbreak communication guidelines to aid in the dissemination of information to the public, recognizing that 'expertise [in communications] has become as essential to outbreak control as epidemiological training and laboratory analysis'. 2 The boundaries between risk communication and management are not, however, sharply delineated, as illustrated by the controversy surrounding H5N1 influenza virus sharing. Indonesia is one of the countries hardest hit by outbreaks of H5N1. Virus sharing with the international community is the mechanism by which, first, viruses developing pandemic potential can be tracked (risk communication), and second, vaccines can be developed to meet global need (risk management). Indonesia refused to virus share, not because it was opposed to the sharing of technical information to better understand the threat posed by H5N1 avian influenza, but because it felt excluded from equitable access to the resulting vaccine, meaning that its management of a subsequent pandemic would be constrained. 3 It could be argued that Indonesian authorities currently view virus sharing as an important element in risk management and thus a sovereign issue, although the international community, by contrast, views virus sharing as a critical element of risk communication and, by extension, a global risk management issue. Differing interpretations of international treaties are possible and resolution is proving challenging. 4 Ultimately, the debate is centred on the boundary between the governance of risk communication and risk management, the former now being mandated through international laws, with the latter remaining, to a large degree, a national sovereignty responsibility.","6. Follow the WHO recommendations for PPE (Table 1 ). 14 Familiarize staff with the correct sequence of gowning up (donning) and down (doffing) through teaching videos and diagrams (Table 1) 19 . Note that there is poor correlation between selfperceived proficiency in PPE use and its appropriate use. 17 Repetitive training and demonstrated competency are necessary. Use a buddy system, where another colleague observes the gown up and down procedures to advise on any breach of protocol (Table 2 ). Inform to conserve the use of masks and PPE. 9. Set up a designated area for donning PPE that is easily accessible and near the room. Doffing of PPE ideally occurs in an anteroom or a doffing area that is separate from the procedure room. 20 10 Equally important, staff should take additional precautions to prevent contamination among providers. Work at individual working stations using a designated phone, computer, and chair, and stay at least 6 feet from any other coworkers while at work to the extent possible, recognizing that this will be difficult in some situations. Avoid sharing workstation items and equipment. Wipe workstations before and after use with virucide, following instructions on the virucide exactly as recommended.","As highlighted by the Executive Director of the WHO Health Emergencies Programme, we are entering a new phase of high-impact epidemics where constant outbreaks are the new normal, and one should not expect their frequency to decrease. This increase \u2014 which is linked to rapid urbanization, population growth, global travel, deforestation, climate change and political instability \u2014 emphasizes the need to improve outbreak responses, and open sharing of information as early as possible is a vital part of this effort. Once the outbreak is contained, the sharing of information should extend to the approaches used and know-how gained in the response to empower other local communities, often in areas where public health and research infrastructure is lacking, to better prepare for future outbreaks.","The regional bodies like ASEAN, SAARC, European Union (EU) need to enact regional protocols, coupled with information portals on pandemic risk. Traffic is quite high within the region, especially among countries with land borders. Thus proper protocol on human movement information sharing is required. The information sharing needs to be open and transparent, which enhances safer regional, cross border as well as global movement.","The above impacts demonstrate that the issues of virus outbreaks transcend urban safety and impacts upon all other facets of our urban fabric. Therefore, it becomes paramount to ensure that the measures taken to contain a virus transcend nationalist agendas where data and information sharing is normally restricted, to a more global agenda where humanity and global order are encouraged. With such an approach, it would be easier to share urban health data across geographies to better monitor emerging health threats in order to provide more economic stability, thereby ensuring no disruptions on such sectors like tourism and travel industries, amongst others. This is possible by ensuring collaborative, proactive measures to control outbreak spread and thus, human movements. This would remove fears on travelers, and would have positive impacts upon the tourism industry, that has been seen to bear the economic brunt whenever such outbreaks occur. This can be achieved by ensuring that protocols on data sharing are calibrated to remove all hurdles pertaining to sharing of information. On this, Lawpoolsri et al. [31] posits that such issues, like transparency, timelessness of sharing and access and quality of data, should be upheld so that continuous monitoring and assessment can be pursued.","On this occasion information sharing seems to have been rapid and effective (while recognising that the information available in the early stages of an outbreak is always less than the global community would like). The WHO was notified of the original clustering within days and the full genomic sequence of the new virus was published less than 2 weeks after the cluster was first detected. The WHO has expressed its satisfaction with the actions of the Chinese authorities in sharing information with the WHO.","Lessons from the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic showed the importance of rapid genetic sequencing, and these have been applied for study of the novel coronavirus, 4,9 enabling eff ective sharing of clinical, epidemiological, and microbiological information. 2, [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] Another lesson was that although laboratory testing is important to confi rm infection, it does not replace accurate case defi nitions, regular updates as information evolves for identifying and managing cases, 14 isolation of suspect cases, follow-up of contacts, and prevention of hospital-acquired infection-all essential for interruption of transmission. 15 Although the novel coronavirus does not seem to be as readily transmissible between people as that which caused the SARS epidemic in 2003, vigilance and continued risk assessment are needed. One of the main goals of the Centre for Mass Gatherings Medicine 16 are collaborative risk assessment and surveillance for new and emerging infections. Because of the global nature of religious and sporting events, active surveillance of the participants is of paramount global importance. A unique opportunity now exists for global collaboration, with transparent sharing of information as was done during the SARS outbreak, to improve elucidation of the risks associated with the novel coronavirus so that another SARS-like epidemic does not begin to spread undetected. Collaborations with other consortia such as the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium will ensure that the lessons from the SARS epidemic are applied to provide a valuable resource for risk assessment, surveillance, and response in accordance with the international health regulations. ","Another key factor in successfully preventing and managing emerging threats is the rapid and transparent sharing of information between countries and agencies. There was extensive criticism of China for its perceived failure to share information about the emerging SARS infection early enough in the outbreak to allow countries to prepare and respond. There were similar concerns about information sharing as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) emerged and evolved in the Middle East in 2012, particularly in Saudi Arabia, and about the emergence of Ebola in West Africa in 2014.","Following the above-mentioned alerts, the inter-crisis sharing of information was embedded through regular newsletters (two times a year) to primary care physicians. They aimed to facilitate the sharing of information and experiences between HCWs facing EBR through the national network of 16 reference hospitals. The newsletter was made of three parts: an editorial written by the SCE group on recent actions undertaken by the group, an open forum article alternately written by the ID experts from one of the 16 reference national hospitals, and an update of potentially operational epidemiological information and scientific articles [8] .","Despite the overwhelming uncertainty during the early days of the MERS-CoV epidemic, the SCH\u2019s commitment to a proactive and open risk communication strategy, which included the sharing of information in a timely manner \u201cthrough prearranged channels\u201d on new cases and deaths, and acknowledging the lack of experience in responding to the situation, supported the SCH\u2019s image as a credible source of information and allowed for the quick initiation of overall response efforts. Such actions are well aligned with recommendations that were provided by the CERC framework. We believe that the acknowledgment of uncertainty since the beginning of the response allowed the SCH to increase public attention and situational awareness among responding agencies; and, that close consultation with international institutions of reference (i.e., WHO) contributed to the image of a competent governance and a unified communication strategy. By doing so, the authorities not only acknowledged the situation but also reported actions undertaken (e.g., investigations and epidemiological studies) and worked to achieve credibility by initiating a quick response to rumors and misperceptions.","Do not lose hope. As Wuhan has taught us with social distancing, strict quarantine and abundant testing, we can beat back this disease and mitigate its effect on our communities. In any rapidly evolving crisis, certain principles remain key to combating a constantly evolving and austere situation. Act with speed of the plan above perfection of the plan. Flexibility in the face of adversity is required, and those that are not able to deftly change strategies with new information will be battling the past and not preparing for the future. Even in this response plan, adaptation and integration of individual situations will be required. Communication with an assigned structure is vital to ensuring the entire team, service, facility, and system are working on the same page and criteria. Situation reports within each of these strata is vital to understand the situation on the ground as well as the plan for the institution. However, succinctness is required so that worried and overwhelmed providers can quickly process and implement new information and protocols. Most of all, a sense of community, purpose and legacy is paramount to keep us mission focused on the health of our patients and community; support and acknowledgement of our risk and sacrifice as physicians, providers\u2026as healers, are not in vain.","Adopting an incident response mentality is critical to endoscopy leadership during a time when providers and staff are asked to embrace significantly altered workflows, and both the situation and guidelines are constantly shifting (Figure 2 ). The foundation of this process is having good information upon which the best decisions can be made. This information flow includes having reliable (1) top-down information from CDC, state and local DPH, medical societies, and departmental and hospital leadership and (2) accurate assessment of relevant metrics specific to the endoscopy unit. For the latter, a combination of automated means through software and manual workflows can be used to gather important data. Initial considerations may include number of symptomatic staff, number of available reserve staff, number of active procedure rooms, local epidemiology and anticipated case burden (inpatient and outpatient), stocks of PPE, and the case composition of scheduled patients among others. Additionally, what is considered pertinent data may change over time as the pandemic evolves. It is vital to keep monitoring these metrics throughout the COVID-19 period so that any signals of potential problems can be detected early and more proactive strategies deployed. We recommend regular meetings of endoscopy leadership to review relevant information and plan in an anticipatory fashion. Last, having an upstream communication channel to hospital leadership is important, especially related to information that can affect the safety of patients and staff.","Our study has many limitations. This study presents only a cross sectional snapshot of the available information. The viewership and content on YouTube change on a daily basis. We are unable to comment on how the viewership and content regarding 2019 nCoV will change as the outbreak evolves. We did not analyze other video sharing platforms such as health sharing websites or news channel websites. In addition, YouTube is not accessible from China. Instead, a platform called Youku is used for video sharing. This affects the applicability of results in China which is the epicentre of this disease outbreak. Restriction of YouTube in China also explains the relative lesser number of views of Mandarin language videos compared to those in English. Nonetheless, Mandarin remains the widest spoken language in Asia Pacific region and videos in this language serve as an important source of information to native Mandarin speakers in this region. Another limitation of our study is the possibility of inter and intra observer bias though we used the kappa coefficient to ensure that the results were not too different.","In Asia, the response of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, or ASEAN, is instructive. The ASEAN was established on 8 August 1967 in Bangkok, Thailand, with the signing of the ASEAN Declaration (Bangkok Declaration) by Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore and Thailand. The ASEAN now includes 10 member countries and coordinates regional action. Concerning COVID-19, ASEAN has issued ASEAN Health Sector Efforts in the Prevention, Detection and Response to Coronavirus Disease 2019 (ASEAN, 2020). Guided by the ASEAN Post-2015 Health Development Agenda (APHDA) and its Governance and Implementation Mechanism (GIM), the ASEAN Health Sector Cooperation deployed and operationalized the established and existing health mechanisms for technical exchanges, information sharing, and updates on policy-related measures in responding to COVID-19. ASEAN specialised agencies involved are the ASEAN Emergency Operations Centre Network for public health emergencies (ASEAN EOC Network), ASEAN Senior Officials for Health Development (SOMHD) of ASEAN and China, Japan and Republic of Korea (Plus Three Countries), and ASEAN BioDioaspora Regional Virtual Centre (ABVC) (ASEAN, 2020). There is no indication that the ASEAN Coordinating Centre for Humanitarian Assistance on disaster management (AHA Centre) is involved in the ASEAN's response to COVID-19. AHA Centre is an inter-governmental organisation which aims to facilitate cooperation and coordination among ASEAN Member States and with the United Nations and international organisations for disaster management and emergency response in ASEAN region. Leadership is beyond the mandate of the AHA Center (see https://ahacentre.org/about-us/). But its plethora of existing mechanisms can and should be used. These mechanisms include the Emergency Operations Centre (EOC), the Standard Operating Procedure for Regional Standby Arrangements and Coordination of Joint Disaster Relief and Emergency Response Operations (SASOP), the ASEAN Joint Disaster Response Plan (AJDRP), the Disaster Emergency Logistics System for ASEAN (DELSA), the Emergency Response and Assessment Team (ERAT), the ASEAN Regional Disaster Emergency Response Simulation Exercise (ARDEX), ASEAN-ERAT (ASEAN-Emergency Response and Assessment Team) and the AHA Centre Executive (ACE) Programme (REF). Globally, the ASEAN region is one of the most vulnerable to disasters, and the AHA Center has been praised for its role in strengthening DRM in the region (e.g. [9, 10] ). These competencies surely ought to be deployed in addressing the rapid emergence of COVID-19 as well as building resilience against a repeat.","Pharmacists should identify and be able to use credible, up-to-date, and high-quality information resources while practicing. The information will be used to build pharmacists' own competencies to practice efficiently and ethically and to provide high-quality services. The information will be needed to effectively manage drug supply, monitor and assess medication use, evaluate medications, counsel patients, promote rational use of medicines, and perform administrative works besides other activities. However, acting as a primary source of medicines information for healthcare providers and the public is the job most done by all pharmacists working in different settings of practice in a formal or in an informal manner. This is why this chapter is focusing mainly on the issues related to the source, access, extent, and quality of medicines information available among pharmacists and pharmacy personnel. Nevertheless, any other type of information ahead from medicines information is also applicable to what is described in the chapter.","is the (which was not peer-reviewed) The copyright holder for this preprint . Finally, were people willing to share this message? We gave respondents the option of sharing a message (of their choosing) with up to 5 people. The vast majority (90%) chose not to share the message, but~100 people who received our reflection treatment were significantly less likely to share with anyone. Those who did share were consistently people who strongly believed in the efficacy of social distancing. Nothing else predicted sharing behavior, including receiving an information treatment. There are two explanations for this: (1) most skipped over this prompt (2) most, other than those who strongly endorse social distancing, believe their friends and families already know, and wouldn't additionally benefit from, this information. The latter is consistent with our theory of information overload . It is likely that we can greatly expand this behavior by tuning this message."],"title":["Microbial molecular markers and epidemiological surveillance in the era of high throughput sequencing: an update from the IMMEM-10 conference","2 Core Competencies to Create Effective Protection Programs","True epidemic growth construction through harmonic analysis","Mechanical Ventilation in an Airborne Epidemic","Modeling the Corona Virus Outbreak in IRAN","International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC): General Guidance for the Management of the Dead Related to COVID-19","New and emerging infectious diseases (Ebola, Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome coronavirus, carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae, Candida auris): Focus on environmental survival and germicide susceptibility","How Do the First Days Count?
