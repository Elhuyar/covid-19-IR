However, the significant heterogeneity and less critical outcomes of such trials may be leading to a waste of research resources. This study aimed to develop a core outcome set (COS) for clinical trials on COVID-19 in order to tackle the outcome issues. The study was conducted according to the Core Outcome Measures in Effectiveness Trials (COMET) handbook (version 1.0), a guideline for COS development. A research group was set up that included experts in respiratory and critical medicine, traditional Chinese medicine, evidence-based medicine, clinical pharmacology, and statistics, in addition to medical journal editors. Clinical trial registry websites (chictr.org.cn and clinicaltrials.gov) were searched to retrieve clinical trial protocols and outcomes in order to form an outcome pool. A total of 78 clinical trial protocols on COVID-19 w...","Objectives: To examine heterogeneity of outcomes in protocols of clinical trials of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) and to identify outcomes for prioritization in developing a core outcome set (COS) in this field. Design: This study is a review. Data sources: Databases of ICMJE-accepted clinical trial registry platform were searched on February 14, 2020. Eligibility Criteria: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and non-RCTs of COVID-19 were considered.Conditions of patients include common type, severe type or critical type. Interventions include traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) and Western medicine. We excluded trials that for discharged patients, psychological intervention and complications of COVID-19. Data extraction and synthesis: The general information and outcomes, outcome measurement instruments and measurement times were extracted. The results were analysed by descriptive analysis. Results: 19 registry platforms were searched. A total of 97 protocols were included from 1...","Public health preparedness requires effective surveillance of and rapid response to infectious disease outbreaks. Inclusion of research activities within the outbreak setting provides important opportunities to maximize limited resources, to enhance gains in scientific knowledge, and ultimately to increase levels of preparedness. With rapid advances in laboratory technologies, banking and analysis of human genomic specimens can be conducted as part of public health investigations, enabling valuable research well into the future.","Background: Although a number of antiviral agents have been evaluated for coronaviruses there are no approved drugs available. To provide an overview of the landscape of therapeutic research for COVID-19, we conducted a review of registered clinical trials. Methods: A review of currently registered clinical trials was performed on registries, including the Chinese (chictr.org.cn) and US (clinicaltrials.gov) databases to identify relevant studies up to March, 7th 2020. The search was conducted using the search terms \u201c2019-nCoV\u201d, \u201cCOVID-19\u201d, \u201cSARS-CoV-2\u201d, \u201cHcov-19\u201d, \u201cnew coronavirus\u201d, \u201cnovel coronavirus\u201d. We included interventional clinical trials focusing on patients with COVID-19 and assessing antiviral drugs or agents. Findings: Out of the 353 studies identified, 115 clinical trials were selected for data extraction. Phase IV trials were the most commonly reported study type (n=27, 23%). However, 62 trials (54%) did not describe the phase of the study. Eighty percent (n=92) of the tri...","The novel coronavirus infection (COVID-19 or Coronavirus disease 2019) that emerged from Wuhan, Hubei province of China has spread to many countries worldwide. Efforts have been made to develop vaccines against human coronavirus (CoV) infections such as MERS and SARS in the past decades. However, to date, no licensed antiviral treatment or vaccine exists for MERS and SARS. Most of the efforts for developing CoV vaccines and drugs target the spike glycoprotein or S protein, the major inducer of neutralizing antibodies. Although a few candidates have shown efficacy in in vitro studies, not many have progressed to randomized animal or human trials, hence may have limited use to counter COVID-19 infection. This article highlights ongoing advances in designing vaccines and therapeutics to counter COVID-19 while also focusing on such experiences and advances as made with earlier SARS- and MERS-CoVs, which together could enable efforts to halt this emerging virus infection.","Abstract Background Different degrees of disorders are reported in respiratory function, physical function and psychological function in patients with corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19), especially in elderly patients. With the experience of improved and discharged COVID-19 patients, timely respiratory rehabilitation intervention may improve prognosis, maximize functional preservation and improve quality of life (QoL), but there lacks of studies worldwide exploring the outcome of this intervention. Objective To investigate the effects of 6-week respiratory rehabilitation training on respiratory function, QoL, mobility and psychological function in elderly patients with COVID-19. Methods This paper reported the findings of an observational, prospective, quasi-experimental study, which totally recruited 72 participants, of which 36 patients underwent respiratory rehabilitation and the rest without any rehabilitation intervention. The following outcomes were measured: pulmonary function...","Ten years have elapsed since the World Health Organization issued its first global alert for an unexplained illness named severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). The anniversary provides an opportunity to reflect on the international response to this new global microbial threat. While global surveillance and response capacity for public health threats have been strengthened, critical gaps remain. Of 194 World Health Organization member states that signed on to the International Health Regulations (2005), &lt;20% had achieved compliance with the core capacities required by the deadline in June 2012. Lessons learned from the global SARS outbreak highlight the need to avoid complacency, strengthen efforts to improve global capacity to address the next pandemic using all available 21st century tools, and support research to develop new treatment options, countermeasures, and insights while striving to address the global inequities that are the root cause of many of these challenges.","Social distancing is an effective way to contain the spread of a contagious disease, particularly when pharmacological interventions are not available. Conventional wisdom suggests that social distancing measures should be introduced as soon as possible after the beginning of an outbreak. Using a simple epidemiological model we show, however, that there is in fact an optimal time to initiate a temporal social distancing intervention if the goal is to reduce the final epidemic size or flatten the epidemic curve. The optimal timing depends strongly on the effective reproduction number (R0) of the disease, such that as the R0 increases, the optimal time decreases non-linearly. Additionally, if pharmacological interventions (e.g., a vaccine) become available at some point during the epidemic, the sooner these interventions become available the sooner social distancing should be initiated to maximize its effectiveness. Although based on a simple model, we hope that these insights inspire fu...","Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is caused by a novel coronavirus (CoV), SARS-CoV. In previous studies, we showed that a SARS-CoV spike (S) glycoprotein-based modified vaccinia Ankara (MVA-S) vaccine could induce strong neutralizing antibody (Nab) response which might have played a critical role in protecting Chinese rhesus monkeys from the pathogenic viral challenge. To date, however, it remains unknown what the minimal level of Nab is required to achieve sterile immunity in humans. It is therefore important to explore techniques to maximize the level of Nab response in vivo. Here, we evaluate various vaccination regimens using combinations of DNA-S, MVA-S, and adenovirus type 5 (Ad5-S) vaccines. We show that in vaccinated mice and rabbits, a heterologous MVA-S prime with Ad5-S boost regimen induces the highest and most persistent level of Nab response when compared with other combinations. Interestingly, the initial level of Nab after prime does not necessarily predict the ma...","Various epidemic prevention and control measures aimed at reducing person-to-person contact has paid a certain cost while controlling the epidemic. So accurate evaluation of these measures helps to maximize the effectiveness of prevention and control while minimizing social costs. In this paper, we develop the model in Dirk Brockmann and Dirk Helbing (2013) to theoretically explain the impact mechanism of traffic control and social distancing measures on the spread of the epidemic, and empirically tests the effect of the two measures in China at the present stage using econometric approach. We found that both traffic control and social distancing measures have played a very good role in controlling the development of the epidemic. Nationally, social distancing measures are better than traffic control measures; the two measures are complementary and their combined action will play a better epidemic prevention effect; Traffic control and social distancing do not work everywhere. Traffic ...","AbstractThe beginning of 2020 has seen the emergence of COVID-19 outbreak caused by a novel coronavirus, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). There is an imminent need to better understand this new virus and to develop ways to control its spread. In this study, we sought to gain insights for vaccine design against SARS-CoV-2 by considering the high genetic similarity between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, which caused the outbreak in 2003, and leveraging existing immunological studies of SARS-CoV. By screening the experimentally-determined SARS-CoV-derived B cell and T cell epitopes in the immunogenic structural proteins of SARS-CoV, we identified a set of B cell and T cell epitopes derived from the spike (S) and nucleocapsid (N) proteins that map identically to SARS-CoV-2 proteins. As no mutation has been observed in these identified epitopes among the available SARS-CoV-2 sequences (as of 9 February 2020), immune targeting of these epitopes may potentially offer pr...","The beginning of 2020 has seen the emergence of COVID-19 outbreak caused by a novel coronavirus, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).

We reviewed the characteristics of interventional trials from Chinese Clinical Trial Registration (ChiCTR) and ClinicalTrials.gov. A total of 171 COVID-19-related interventional trials were identified on Feb 22nd, 2020. These trials are classified into 4 categories based on treatment modalities, including chemical drugs, biological therapies, traditional Chinese medicine treatments and other therapies. Our analysis focused on the issues of stage, design, randomization, blinding, primary endpoints definition and sample size of these trials. We found some studies with potential defects including unreasonable design, inappropriate primary endpoint definition, insufficient sample size and ethical issue. Clinical trials on COVID-19 should be designed based on scientific rules, ethics and benefits for patients.","The SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) novel coronavirus represents a significant health risk, particularly in older patients. Cancer is one of the leading causes of death in most rich countries, and delivering chemotherapy may be associated with increased risk in the presence of a pandemic infection. Estimating this risk is crucial in making decisions about balancing risks and benefits from administering chemotherapy. However, there are no specific data about chemotherapy risks per se. Here we develop a simple model to estimate the potential harms in patients undergoing chemotherapy during a COVID outbreak. We use age-related case fatality rates as a basis for estimating risk, and use previous data from risk of death during influenza outbreaks to estimate the additional risk associated with chemotherapy. We use data from randomised trials to estimate benefit across a range of curative and palliative settings, and address the balance of benefit against the risk of harm.

Synthesis Feeding a sufficient volume of colostrum during the first hours of life is crucial to calf health and survival; however, less is known about transition milk feeding and the potential benefits of the myriad of bioactive compounds it contains. After feeding colostrum and transition milk, calves are susceptible to diarrhea when moved onto high amounts of milk, and antibiotic use is often necessary to decrease disease. Feeding an elevated plane of milk nutrition results in increased ADG and, in some studies, increased future milk production. Thus, this nutritional strategy is recommended; however, weaning calves from high volumes of milk represents massive changes in the structure and microbi...","The novel corona virus disease -2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has caused a massive global public health havoc. Recent clinical trials carried out in China has found a promising therapeutic application of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine for COVID-19. This study meticulously evaluated the various dosages of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine utilized in clinical trials registered in Chinese and US clinical trial registries for the treatment of pneumonia caused by SARS-CoV-2.","While the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is hardly hitting the world, it is of extreme importance that significant in vitro observations guide the quick set up of clinical trials. In this study, we evidence that the anti-SARS-CoV2 activity of a clinically achievable hydroxychloroquine concentration is maximized only when administered before and after the infection of Vero E6 cells. This strongly suggests that only a combined prophylactic and therapeutic use of hydroxychloroquine may be effective in limiting viral replication in patients.","Summary The causative agent of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), which affected over 8000 individuals worldwide and was responsible for over 700 deaths in the 2002\u20132003 outbreak, is a coronavirus that was unknown before the outbreak. Although many different treatments were used during the outbreak, none were implemented in a controlled fashion. Thus, the optimal treatment for SARS is unknown. Since the outbreak, much work has been done testing new agents against SARS using in-vitro methods and animal models. In addition, global research efforts have focused on the development of vaccines against SARS. Efforts should be made to evaluate the most promising treatments and vaccines in controlled clinical trials, should another SARS outbreak occur.","Three leading infectious disease experts in China were invited to share their bedside observations in the management of COVID-19 patients. Professor Taisheng Li was sent to Wuhan to provide frontline medical care. He depicts the clinical course of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Furthermore, he observes the significant abnormality of coagulation function and proposes that the early intravenous immunoglobulin and low molecular weight heparin anticoagulation therapy are very important. Professor Hongzhou Lu, a leader in China to try various anti-viral drugs, expresses concern on the quality of the ongoing clinical trials as most trials are small in scale and repetitive in nature, and emphasizes the importance of the quick publication of clinical trial results. Regarding the traditional Chinese medicine, Professor Lu suggests to develop a creative evaluation system because of the complicated chemical compositions. Professor Wenhong Zhang is responsible for Shanghai's overall clinical management of ...","AbstractAn outbreak of new SARS-like viral in Wuhan, China has been named 2019-nCoV. The current state of the epidemic is increasingly serious, and there has been the urgent necessity to develop an effective new drug. In previous studies, it was found that the conformation change in CTD1 was the region where SARS-CoV bound to human ACE2. Although there are mutations of the 2019-nCoV, the binding energy of ACE2 remains high. The surface glycoprotein of 2019-nCoV was coincident with the CTD1 region of the S-protein by comparing the I-TASSER prediction model with the actual SARS model, which suggests that 2019-nCoV may bind to the ACE2 receptor through conformational changes. Furthermore, site prediction on the surface glycoprotein of 2019-nCoV suggests some core amino acid area may be a novel drug target against 2019-nCoV.","The Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) is a new human disease caused by a novel coronavirus (CoV). The disease is reported mainly in adults. Data in children are scarce. The disease caused by MERS-CoV in children presents with a wide range of clinical manifestations, and it is associated with a lower mortality rate compared with adults. Poor outcome is observed mainly in admitted patients with medical comorbidities. We report a new case of MERS-CoV infection in a 9-month-old child complicated by severe respiratory symptoms, multi-organ dysfunction, and death. We reviewed the literature in an attempt to characterize the mode of presentation, the risk factors, and outcome of MERS-CoV infection in the pediatric population.","This work applies a data-driven coding method for prediction of the COVID-19 spreading profile in any given population that shows an initial phase of epidemic progression. Based on the historical data collected for COVID-19 spreading in 367 cities in China and the set of parameters of the augmented Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Removed (SEIR) model obtained for each city, a set of profile codes representing a variety of transmission mechanisms and contact topologies is formed. By comparing the data of an early outbreak of a given population with the complete set of historical profiles, the best fit profiles are selected and the corresponding sets of profile codes are used for prediction of the future progression of the epidemic in that population. Application of the method to the data collected for South Korea, Italy and Iran shows that peaks of infection cases are expected to occur before the end of March 2020, and that the percentage of population infected in each city will be less th...","Abstract To accomplish the goals of successful management practice, what\u2019s important has to be determined. This chapter looks at the evolution of security as a management activity. The growth of services, products, and systems is provided. Most important security threats are presented.","DNA microarrays have emerged as a viable platform for detection of pathogenic organisms in clinical and environmental samples. These microbial detection arrays occupy a middle ground between low cost, narrowly focused assays such as multiplex PCR and more expensive, broad-spectrum technologies like high-throughput sequencing. While pathogen detection arrays have been used primarily in a research context, several groups are aggressively working to develop arrays for clinical diagnostics, food safety testing, environmental monitoring and biodefense. Statistical algorithms that can analyze data from microbial detection arrays and provide easily interpretable results are absolutely required in order for these efforts to succeed. In this article, we will review the most promising array designs and analysis algorithms that have been developed to date, comparing their strengths and weaknesses for pathogen detection and discovery.","Abstract Recently, a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), officially known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), emerged in China. Despite drastic containment measures, the spread of this virus is ongoing. SARS-CoV-2 is the aetiological agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) characterised by pulmonary infection in humans. The efforts of international health authorities have since focused on rapid diagnosis and isolation of patients as well as the search for therapies able to counter the most severe effects of the disease. In the absence of a known efficient therapy and because of the situation of a public-health emergency, it made sense to investigate the possible effect of chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine against SARS-CoV-2 since this molecule was previously described as a potent inhibitor of most coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-1. Preliminary trials of chloroquine repurposing in the treatment of COVID-19 in China have been encouraging, leading to several ne...","Abstract The Internet of Things (IoT) includes three core procedures: full spectrum perception, reliable transmission, and intelligent processing. It can be applied for the prevention and control of SARI (severe acute respiratory infection). By combining sensors, information technology, artificial intelligence, and available dynamic networking devices, IoT could realize long-distance communication between hospitals, patients, and medical devices, which could ultimately improve current medical conditions.","Summary The Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) has infected over 1600 individuals with nearly 600 deaths since it was first identified in human populations in 2012. No antiviral therapies or vaccines are available for its treatment or prophylaxis. Approaches to the development of MERS vaccines are discussed herein, including a summary of previous efforts to develop vaccines useful against human and non-human coronaviruses. A striking feature of MERS is the important role that camels have in transmission. Camel vaccination may be a novel approach to preventing human infection.","Sarcoidosis is a granulomatous disease of unknown etiology, characterized by a Th1 immunophenotype, most commonly involving the lung, skin, lymph node and eyes. Molecular and immunologic studies continue to strengthen the association of sarcoidosis with infectious antigens, particularly those derived from Propionibacterium and Mycobacterium species. Independent studies report the presence of microbial nucleic acids and proteins within sarcoidosis specimens. Complementary immunologic studies also support the role of infectious agents in sarcoidosis pathogenesis. Th-1 immune responses directed against mycobacterial virulence factors have been detected within sarcoidosis diagnostic bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). Th1 and Th17 immune responses against propionibacteria have also been reported. More recently, case reports and clinical trials from Japanese, European and American investigators have emerged regarding the efficacy of antimicrobials against Propionibacterium and Mycobacterium speci...","","Abstract Introduction : The main target of COVID-19 is the lungs where it may cause pneumonia in severely ill patients. Chest X- ray is an important diagnostic test to assess the lung for the damaging effects of COVID-19. Many other microbial pathogens can also cause damage to lungs leading to pneumonia but there are certain radiological features which can favor the diagnosis of pneumonia caused by COVID-19. With the rising number of cases of COVID-19, it would be imperative to develop computer programs which may assist the health professionals in the prevailing scenario. Materials &amp; Methods : A total of two hundred and seventy eight (278) images of chest X-rays have been assessed by applying ResNet-50 convolutional neural network architectures in the present study. The digital images were acquired from the public repositories provided by University of Montreal and National Institutes of Health. These digital images of Chest X-rays were divided into three groups labeled as normal, pneu...","Abstract The fusion subunit of the SARS-CoV S glycoprotein contains two regions of hydrophobic heptad-repeat amino acid sequences that have been shown in biophysical studies to form a six-helix bundle structure typical of the fusion-active core found in Class I viral fusion proteins. Here, we have applied serine-scanning mutagenesis to the C-terminal-most heptad-repeat region in the SARS-CoV S glycoprotein to investigate the functional role of this region in membrane fusion. We show that hydrophobic sidechains at a and d positions only within the short helical segment of the C-terminal heptad-repeat region (I1161, I1165, L1168, A1172, and L1175) are critical for cell\u2013cell fusion. Serine mutations at outlying heptad-repeat residues that form an extended chain in the core structure (V1158, L1179, and L1182) do not affect fusogenicity. Our study provides genetic evidence for the important role of \u03b1-helical packing in promoting S glycoprotein-mediated membrane fusion.","Abstract Purpose COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) is a public health emergency of international concern. As of this time, there is no known effective pharmaceutical treatment, although it is much needed for patient contracting the severe form of the disease. The aim of this systematic review was to summarize the evidence regarding chloroquine for the treatment of COVID-19. Methods PubMed, EMBASE, and three trial Registries were searched for studies on the use of chloroquine in patients with COVID-19. Results We included six articles (one narrative letter, one in-vitro study, one editorial, expert consensus paper, two national guideline documents) and 23 ongoing clinical trials in China. Chloroquine seems to be effective in limiting the replication of SARS-CoV-2 (virus causing COVID-19) in vitro. Conclusions There is rationale, pre-clinical evidence of effectiveness and evidence of safety from long-time clinical use for other indications to justify clinical research on chloroquine in...","Overview Feline coronavirus infection is ubiquitous in domestic cats, and is particularly common where conditions are crowded. While most FCoV-infected cats are healthy or display only a mild enteritis, some go on to develop feline infectious peritonitis, a disease that is especially common in young cats and multi-cat environments. Up to 12% of FCoV-infected cats may succumb to FIP, with stress predisposing to the development of disease. Disease signs The \u2018wet\u2019 or effusive form, characterised by polyserositis (abdominal and/or thoracic effusion) and vasculitis, and the \u2018dry\u2019 or non-effusive form (pyogranulomatous lesions in organs) reflect clinical extremes of a continuum. The clinical picture of FIP is highly variable, depending on the distribution of the vasculitis and pyogranulomatous lesions. Fever refractory to antibiotics, lethargy, anorexia and weight loss are common non-specific signs. Ascites is the most obvious manifestation of the effusive form. Diagnosis The aetiological di...","The spike glycoprotein (S) of recently identified Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) targets the cellular receptor, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4). Sequence comparison and modeling analysis have revealed a putative receptor-binding domain (RBD) on the viral spike, which mediates this interaction. We report the 3.0 \u00c5-resolution crystal structure of MERS-CoV RBD bound to the extracellular domain of human DPP4. Our results show that MERS-CoV RBD consists of a core and a receptor-binding subdomain. The receptor-binding subdomain interacts with DPP4 \u03b2-propeller but not its intrinsic hydrolase domain. MERS-CoV RBD and related SARS-CoV RBD share a high degree of structural similarity in their core subdomains, but are notably divergent in the receptor-binding subdomain. Mutagenesis studies have identified several key residues in the receptor-binding subdomain that are critical for viral binding to DPP4 and entry into the target cell. The atomic details at the interface betw...","A novel human coronavirus, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), has caused outbreaks of a SARS-like illness with high case fatality rate. The reports of its person-to-person transmission through close contacts have raised a global concern about its pandemic potential. Here we characterize the six-helix bundle fusion core structure of MERS-CoV spike protein S2 subunit by X-ray crystallography and biophysical analysis. We find that two peptides, HR1P and HR2P, spanning residues 998\u20131039 in HR1 and 1251\u20131286 in HR2 domains, respectively, can form a stable six-helix bundle fusion core structure, suggesting that MERS-CoV enters into the host cell mainly through membrane fusion mechanism. HR2P can effectively inhibit MERS-CoV replication and its spike protein-mediated cell\u2013cell fusion. Introduction of hydrophilic residues into HR2P results in significant improvement of its stability, solubility and antiviral activity. Therefore, the HR2P analogues have good potential to b...","Abstract17 years after the SARS-CoV epidemic, the world is facing the COVID-19 pandemic. COVID-19 is caused by a coronavirus named SARS-CoV-2. Given the most optimistic projections estimating that it will take more than a year to develop a vaccine, our best short term strategy may lie in identifying virus-specific targets for small molecule interventions. All coronaviruses utilize a molecular mechanism called -1 PRF to control the relative expression of their proteins. Prior analyses of SARS-CoV revealed that it utilizes a structurally unique three-stemmed mRNA pseudoknot to stimulate high rates of -1 PRF, that it also harbors a -1 PRF attenuation element. Altering -1 PRF activity negatively impacts virus replication, suggesting that this molecular mechanism may be therapeutically targeted. Here we present a comparative analysis of the original SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 frameshift signals. Structural analyses reveal that the core -1 PRF signal, composed of the U UUA AAC slippery site and...","Abstract In December 2019, the outbreak of the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in China spread worldwide, becoming an emergency of major international concern. SARS-CoV-2 infection causes clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus. Human-to-human transmission has been described with incubation times between 2-14 days, facilitating its spread via droplets, contaminated hands or surfaces. Early diagnosis, quarantine, and supportive treatments are essential to cure patients. We therefore reviewed the literature on all available information about the epidemiology, diagnosis, isolation and treatments of COVID-19. Treatments, including antiviral agents, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, corticosteroids, antibodies, convalescent plasma transfusion and vaccines, will be discussed in this article. Additionally, registered trials about treatment were listed to develop approaches for the current urgent demand for therapy.","Background: Chest CT had high sensitivity in diagnosing novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP) at early stage, giving it an advantage over nucleic acid detection in time of crisis. Deep learning was reported to discover intricate structures from clinical images and achieve expert-level performance in medical image analysis. To develop and validate an integrated deep learning framework on chest CT images for auto-detection of NCP, particularly focusing on differentiating NCP from influenza pneumonia (IP). Methods: 35 confirmed NCP cases were consecutively enrolled as training set from 1138 suspected patients in three NCP designated hospitals together with 361 confirmed viral pneumonia patients from center one including 156 IP patients, from May, 2015 to February, 2020. The external validation set enrolled 57 NCP patients and 50 IP patients from eight centers. Results: 96.6% of NCP lesions were larger than 1 cm and 76.8% were with intensity below -500 Hu, indicating less consolidation than IP...","Summary Children are susceptible to infection by SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) but the clinical picture of SARS is milder than in adults. Teenagers resemble adults in presentation and disease progression and may develop severe illness requiring intensive care and assisted ventilation. Fever, malaise, cough, coryza, chills or rigor, sputum production, headache, myalgia, leucopaenia, lymphopaenia, thrombocytopaenia, mildly prolonged activated partial thromboplastin times and elevated lactate dehydrogenase levels are common presenting features. Radiographic findings are non-specific but high-resolution computed tomography of the thorax in clinically suspected cases may be an early diagnostic aid when initial chest radiographs appear normal. The improved reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays are critical in the early diagnosis of SARS, with sensitivity approaching 80% in the first 3 days of illness when performed on nasopharyngeal aspirates, the preferred...","Abstract Since the emergence of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in 2012, many questions remain on modes of transmission and sources of virus. In outbreak situations, especially with emerging organisms causing severe human disease, it is important to understand the full spectrum of disease, and shedding kinetics in relation to infectivity and the ability to transmit the microorganism. Laboratory response capacity during the early stages of an outbreak focuses on development of virological and immunological methods for patient diagnosis, for contact tracing, and for epidemiological studies into sources, modes of transmission, identification of risk groups, and animal reservoirs. However, optimal use of this core public health laboratory capacity requires a fundamental understanding of kinetics of viral shedding and antibody response, of assay validation and of interpretation of test outcomes. We reviewed available data from MERS-CoV case reports, and compared this...","Background. Administration of convalescent plasma may be of clinical benefit for treatment of severe acute viral respiratory infections. However, no clear evidence exists to support or oppose convalescent plasma use in clinical practice. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the evidence of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in the convalescent plasma for the treatment of severe influenza. Methods. Healthcare databases were searched in February 2020. All records were screened against the eligibility criteria. Data extraction and risk of bias assessments were undertaken. The primary outcome was case fatality rates by influenza. Results. We identified 5 RCTs of severe influenza. The pooled analyses showed no evidence for a reduction in mortality (Odds Ratio (OR) 1.06; p = 0.87; I2 = 35%). We also found non significant reductions in days in ICU and hospital, and days on mechanical ventilation. There seemed to have a biological benefit of increasing HAI titer levels...","Enveloped viruses have evolved membrane glycoproteins (GPs) that mediate entry into host cells. These proteins are important targets for antiviral therapies and vaccines. Several efforts to understand and combat infection by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) have therefore focused on the viral GP, known as spike (S). In a short period of time, important aspects of SARS-CoV S-protein function were unraveled. The identification of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a receptor for SARS-CoV provided an insight into viral tropism and pathogenesis, whereas mapping of functional domains in the S-protein enabled inhibitors to be generated. Vaccines designed on the basis of SARS-CoV S-protein were shown to be effective in animals and consequently are attractive candidates for vaccine trials in humans. Here, we discuss how SARS-CoV S facilitates viral entry into target cells and illustrate current approaches that are used to inhibit this process.","A novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) originating in Wuhan, China presents a potential respiratory viral pandemic to the world population. Current efforts are focused on containment and quarantine of infected individuals. Ultimately, the outbreak could be controlled with a protective vaccine to prevent 2019-nCoV infection. While vaccine research should be pursued intensely, there exists today no therapy to treat 2019-nCoV upon infection, despite an urgent need to find options to help these patients and preclude potential death. Herein, I review the potential options to treat 2019-nCoV in patients, with an emphasis on the necessity for speed and timeliness in developing new and effective therapies in this outbreak. I consider the options of drug repurposing, developing neutralizing monoclonal antibody therapy, and an oligonucleotide strategy targeting the viral RNA genome, emphasizing the promise and pitfalls of these approaches. Finally, I advocate for the fastest strategy to develop a treat...","BACKGROUND: Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is a viral respiratory disease. Most people infected with MERS-CoV develop severe acute respiratory illness. It was first reported in Saudi Arabia in 2012 and has since spread to several other countries. We report the clinical course of MERS-CoV infection in a pregnant woman who acquired the infection during the last trimester. CASE PRESENTATION: The patient is a 33-year-old female working as a critical care nurse. She was 32 weeks pregnant when she presented with respiratory symptoms after direct contact with a MERS-COV patient. Although the patient was in respiratory failure, necessitated mechanical ventilation, and intensive care (ICU) admission, a healthy infant was delivered. The mother recovered. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported case of a laboratory-confirmed Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus in a pregnant woman. CONCLUSIONS: Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-Co...","The 2009 influenza A (H1N1) pandemic highlighted the importance of quality hospital care of the severely ill, yet there is evidence that the impact of the 2009 pandemic was highest in low\u2010 and middle\u2010income countries with fewer resources. Recent data indicate that death and suffering from seasonal influenza and severe illness in general are increased in resource\u2010limited settings. However, there are limited clinical data and guidelines for the management of influenza and other severe illness in these settings. Life\u2010saving supportive care through syndromic case management is used successfully in high\u2010resource intensive care units and in global programs such as the Integrated Management of Childhood Illness (IMCI). While there are a variety of challenges to the management of the severely ill in resource\u2010limited settings, several new international initiatives have begun to develop syndromic management strategies for these environments, including the World Health Organization's Integrated M...","Bats are implicated as natural reservoirs for a wide range of zoonotic viruses including SARS and MERS coronaviruses, Ebola, Marburg, Nipah, Hendra, Rabies and other lyssaviruses. Accordingly, many One Health surveillance and viral discovery programs have focused on bats. In this report we present viral metagenomic data from bats collected in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia [KSA]. Unbiased high throughput sequencing of fecal samples from 72 bat individuals comprising four species; lesser mouse-tailed bat (Rhinopoma hardwickii), Egyptian tomb bat (Taphozous perforatus), straw-colored fruit bat (Eidolon helvum), and Egyptian fruit bat (Rousettus aegyptiacus) revealed molecular evidence of a diverse set of viral families: Picornaviridae (hepatovirus, teschovirus, parechovirus), Reoviridae (rotavirus), Polyomaviridae (polyomavirus), Papillomaviridae (papillomavirus), Astroviridae (astrovirus), Caliciviridae (sapovirus), Coronaviridae (coronavirus), Adenoviridae (adenovirus), Paramyxoviridae (p...","Abstract A major challenge facing agriculture at present is the development of techniques that can screen field samples and other plant materials simultaneously for the presence of many viruses. Microarray techniques show promise in this regard, as their high throughput nature can potentially detect a range of viruses using a single test. In this paper we present an array that can detect a wide spectrum of 169 plant virus species from 13 different genera. The array was constructed using an automated probe design protocol which generated a minimal number of probes to detect viruses at the genus level. The designed arrays showed a high specificity and sensitivity when tested with a set of standard virus samples. Field samples collected from a severe disease outbreak of Panax notoginseng farms in Yunnan, China, in 2001 were screened, where a potyvirus infection was identified associated with the disease.","The current state of much of the Wuhan pneumonia virus (COVID-19) research shows a regrettable lack of data sharing and considerable analytical obfuscation. This impedes global research cooperation, which is essential for tackling public health emergencies, and requires unimpeded access to data, analysis tools, and computational infrastructure. Here we show that community efforts in developing open analytical software tools over the past ten years, combined with national investments into scientific computational infrastructure, can overcome these deficiencies and provide an accessible platform for tackling global health emergencies in an open and transparent manner. Specifically, we use all COVID-19 genomic data available in the public domain so far to (1) underscore the importance of access to raw data and to (2) demonstrate that existing community efforts in curation and deployment of biomedical software can reliably support rapid, reproducible research during global health crises. A...","","DNA microarrays may be used to identify microbial species present in environmental and clinical samples. However, automated tools for reliable species identification based on observed microarray hybridization patterns are lacking. We present an algorithm, E-Predict, for microarray-based species identification. E-Predict compares observed hybridization patterns with theoretical energy profiles representing different species. We demonstrate the application of the algorithm to viral detection in a set of clinical samples and discuss its relevance to other metagenomic applications."],"title":["Core Outcome Set for Clinical Trials on Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COS-COVID)","Outcome reporting from protocols of clinical trials of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19): a review","Human genomics and preparedness for infectious threats","A brief review of antiviral drugs evaluated in registered clinical trials for COVID-19","COVID-19, an emerging coronavirus infection: advances and prospects in designing and developing vaccines, immunotherapeutics, and therapeutics","Respiratory rehabilitation in elderly patients with COVID-19: A randomized controlled study","Progress in Global Surveillance and Response Capacity 10 Years after Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome","Optimal timing for social distancing during an epidemic","Heterologous MVA-S prime Ad5-S boost regimen induces high and persistent levels of neutralizing antibody response against SARS coronavirus","Which Measures are Effective in Containing COVID-19?

However, studies have found that the outcomes used in clinical research are frequently inconsistent, nonstandard, irrational, or inessential, weakening the scientific and practical nature of research results and leading to research waste [1] [2] [3] . In order to overcome these problems, experts in evidence-based medicine and clinical research methodology have put forward strategies to develop core outcome sets (COSs). A COS refers to an agreed-upon standard set of outcomes that should be measured and reported, as a minimum, in all clinical trials in specific areas of health or healthcare [4] . A COS is helpful to regularize outcomes adopted in clinical trials, so as to improve the practicability, comparability, and transparency of the results [4] . In 2010, the Core Outcome Measures in Effectiveness Trials (COMET) Initiative y was launched to promote research on COS by developing methodological guidelines. Thus far, a series of guidelines and handbooks have been published, including the COMET Handbook (version 1.0) [5] , the COS-STAndards for Development (COS-STAD) [6] , the COS-STAndards for Reporting (COS-STAR) [7] , and the COS-STAndardised Protocol Items (COS-STAP) [8] .","However, in the years following two major coronavirus outbreaks SARS-CoV in 2003 and MERS-CoV in 2012, there remains no consensus on the optimal therapy for either disease [116, 117] . Well-designed clinical trials that provide the gold standard for assessing the therapeutic measures are scarce. No coronavirus protease inhibitors have successfully completed a preclinical development program despite large efforts exploring SARS-CoV inhibitors. The bulk of potential therapeutic strategies remain in the experimental phase, with only a handful crossing the in vitro hurdle. Stronger efforts are required in the research for treatment options for major coronaviruses given their pandemic potential. Effective treatment options are essential to maximize the restoration of affected populations to good health following infections. Clinical trials have commenced in China to identify effective treatments for 2019-nCoV based on the treatment evidence from SARS and MERS. There is currently no effective specific antiviral with high-level evidence; any specific antiviral therapy should be provided in the context of a clinical study/trial. Few treatments have shown real curative action against SARS and MERS and the literature generally describes isolated cases or small case series.","The usability of an application provides one of the biggest sources of frustrations for our clients. We have addressed this issue using the Profiler Component and, more specifically, a service such as the Disease Access Service in IDSS. This Service only presents the necessary data elements to a user based on their role, privileges and interest. Therefore, a data entry clerk does not have to sort through a screen full of irrelevant data elements in order to enter data into one or two fields. Furthermore, most of the field surveillance officers enter data onto paper forms that data entry clerks enter into the system. We are currently investigating the feasibility of using Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs) that can be distributed to the field in order for the data to be entered once and synchronized with the application at the end of each day. This will help automate the data entry process. An issue still to be resolved is the privacy concerns of information stored and transferred using a PDA.","\u2022 Flexibility: Tracking and monitoring diseases is a dynamic activity. Emerging diseases, such as SARS can appear very quickly, requiring public health officials and surveillance applications to respond just as quickly [10] . When a disease outbreak occurs, it is essential that the technology tools be in place to track cases and contact information. Public health officials do not have the luxury of time to develop systems in response to each disease outbreak. An application must be flexible to handle new diseases [10] . In addition, given the possible links between outbreak events, epidemiologists analyzing data collected by a surveillance system may need to gather different data as they discover new information. A surveillance application must be able to adapt to these changing data and analysis requirements. \u2022 Maintainability: Applications are inherently expensive to maintain. The cost of supporting a deployed software product can be between 60 and 80% of its lifetime cost [11, 12] . The greater the degree of heterogeneity that exists in the application suite available for an organization, the more expensive it is to maintain. For example, different applications tend to use different technologies and different versions of third party software. Keeping track of all the applications' technology version matrices can be complex, and the licensing costs can be expensive. Making viable the sharing of common architectural components among applications reduces support complexity and licensing costs. \u2022 Jurisdictional configurability: Each jurisdiction collecting public health surveillance data has its own policies or business rules governing the content and format of data to be collected. For instance, larger jurisdictions may be able to collect last names of their subjects, while smaller jurisdictions may only be allowed to collect their initials. Similarly, some jurisdictions may want to include the complete date when collecting a birth date, while others can only record the month and the year. An application distributed to different jurisdictions must be able to handle these variations in policy. Furthermore, since policies can change within jurisdictions, established or already implemented applications must be readily configurable. \u2022 Alert notifications: A core requirement of a surveillance application is to send alert notifications to designated people indicating that a certain event has occurred. An event could be the occurrence of two or more cases of a similar disease being reported in potentially multiple jurisdictions within a certain time frame (i.e., outbreak). Another event may raise attention to data anomalies within a case that requires attention. An event could even be a user accessing an application after hours. Events such as these help users to manage their applications and understand the data being stored. Alerts could take the form of an email notification, a message sent to a Personal Digital Assistant (PDA)/cell phone, or a posting to a web site. \u2022 Security: Due to the sensitive nature of public health surveillance data, security is of the utmost concern. One area of concern within security is authorization. Particular individual users of applications may only see a subset of the data, and only certain functions of the application depending upon their role. For instance, if an application collects data from different jurisdictions, a public health official in one jurisdiction should not be able to see data collected in another jurisdiction. Furthermore, access to different parts of the application should be restricted only to those who are authorized. Auditing functions can also assist in monitoring what applications and which data are being accessed by a specific user. \u2022 Usability: Prior to the analysis and reporting of public health information, data must exist in a repository. Currently, data collection poses the single most resource intensive component of surveillance cost, since data must be manually entered into a repository. A disease case can require the collection of, potentially, a few hundred data elements. Based on our experiences, data entry clerks often complain of user interfaces being crowded with irrelevant data fields since not all data elements need to be collected for a case. To reduce this overhead associated with data collection, the presentation of a surveillance application interface must optimize data entry and filter out irrelevant data. \u2022 Data sharing: Public health surveillance applications collect data about different diseases from different demographics. This data is usually stored in different databases. Valuable information could be discovered if field entries from these databases were cross-referenced, and in line with existing legislation and privacy controls stored in a central database. The Pan-Canadian Electronic Health Record project by Canada Health Infoway is a multi-year initiative focussed on integrating Canadian surveillance systems from a data perspective [13] . To support this important objective, a surveillance application must have the capability of sharing data with other applications. \u2022 Statistical analysis and reporting tools: Once data has been collected and entered into the system, epidemiologists and other public health professionals must be able to analyze the data and report on its contents. A number of commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) statistical analysis and reporting tools adequately support this requirement. Thus, PHAC has elected to integrate COTS products into the surveillance environment to support this need.","The Workflow Component assists in addressing the jurisdictional configurability and usability requirements. Workflows are configured based on the jurisdiction in which the application is deployed without affecting the underlying code. Fig. 5 -Modeling a workflow using a graph.  Fig. 6 -Business Rule to validate date of birth.","The importance of developing a coronavirus RT-PCR assay that is able to identify both Alphacoronaviruses and Betacoronaviruses which attack animals and humans, and Gammacoronaviruses which attack birds, is that such assays could identify zoonotic coronaviruses associated with more severe disease in humans [2, 5, 30, 31]. Therefore the clinical usability of any PCR assay for the identification of all or most coronaviruses depends on its ability to amplify a region which is common to all coronaviruses (both human and human adapted animal viruses), and its sensitivity. The primers for coronavirus we designed target the replicase ORF1b nsp15 (XendoU/NendoU) uridylate specific endonuclease gene, which is highly conserved among all coronaviruses [21, 22] and we confirmed our results with a TaqMan probe. The quality of primers depends, among others, on their ability not to give nonspecific amplifications. Our primers for identification of coronaviruses did not give nonspecific amplifications as indicated by the melting curves. In addition, the hCoV standard curve experiments indicated that the hCoV RT-PCR assay was able to pick up to 2 copies/\u00b5l of human coronavirus RNA template, our assays results compare equally with those of a previously published SYBR green assay for coronaviruses [24\u201326]. We are therefore confident that it could be applied for diagnosis of coronaviruses in clinical settings subject to further experiments in statistically significant number of samples.","All three of the EIDs discussed here have experienced a changing epidemiology during their respective epidemics. This varying disease landscape critically affects clinical trial design. Since study size of Phase II and Phase III clinical trials are critically dependent upon the event rate, it requires careful consideration of how to maximize the number of infections. For EIDs (and for any other infection), it is important to be able to exclude individuals who have prior disease exposure and/or who become infected after enrollment but prior to when immunity is expected to develop. With a changing ecology and epidemiology, one needs to consider the future rather than the present dynamics of such epidemics.","Chemically reactive groups are a well-known source of false-positive screening hits. 14 Several commercial and in-house filters for identifying and removing reactive species are currently in use. 50, 56 Despite the widespread use of filters, reactive compounds remain a significant challenge for discovery efforts. For example, Blanchard and co-workers reported that of 69 HTS hits against coronavirus protease, 64 (93%) were discarded after repeat assays with DTT suggested thiol reactivity. 30 To address this persistent problem, Hajduk's group at Abbott has proposed the thiol reactivity index (TRI) for estimating the probability that a given compound will be reactive. 15 Their recently developed ALARM NMR method for detecting thiol reactivity found that of 476 lead compounds experimentally shown to be reactive, only 156 (33%) were predicted as such by computational filters. To better define the relevant moieties, structural descriptors were calculated for a series of reactive compounds. The probability of reactivity (P R ) for any given structure was then defined as the sum over all structural descriptors of the number of occurrences of each descriptor in that compound weighted by the TRI for that descriptor. If the P R for a compound was greater than 0.3, the compound was predicted to be reactive. The TRI for each descriptor was determined by using nonlinear regression to maximize the agreement between observed and predicted reactivity as described by a scoring function. 15 The final set of 75 nonzero TRIs was applied to a data set of 3504 compounds studied by ALARM NMR. 15 Using a P R of 0.3, 486 of 509 experimentally reactive compounds (95%) were correctly predicted and 2005 of 2995 experimentally nonreactive compounds (67%) were correctly predicted. As described, the method has a high sensitivity and a low number of false negatives, making it a useful flag for identifying compounds for follow-up experimental reactivity testing. 15 ","Kaplan and Victor [6] stated that the choice of antihypertensive therapy, particularly for the first-line agent, should be made with care as more patients with less severe hypertension are being treated with medications. The Task Force for the Management of Arterial Hypertension of the European Society of Hypertension (ESH) and of the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) has long recognized the limitations of event-based randomized therapeutic trials [7] . These include the need to select elderly or higher risk patients to maximize the number of events collected and achieve adequate study power. As a result, younger, uncomplicated patients with lower cardiovascular risks are under-represented, and little information is available on treatment benefits in a large number of hypertensive populations. Another important caveat is that therapeutic programs in RCTs usually diverge from usual clinical practice since drugs randomly allocated at trial commencement are continued irrespective of blood pressure lowering effects; but in clinical practice physicians normally do not continue the prescriptions which are ineffective. In trials the benefits conferred to patients are therefore diluted by the lack of benefits in non-responsive patients, and they are usually of short durationwhich will imply that their generalizability to the general population is limited. These randomized trials should be interpreted in parallel with observational studies to achieve a balanced decision regarding the choice of the most preferred first-line antihypertensive agent.","This review is the first to evaluate the outcome reporting of protocols of TCM and western medicine clinical trials for treating COVID-19. The results showed variations in the outcome reporting. For outcome measurement instruments/outcome definitions and outcome measurement time, there is also heterogeneity. However, many primary investigators did not provide outcome measurement instruments/outcome definitions or outcome measurement time. It is difficult to predict results of clinical trials now. But it is obvious that these problems may result in the exclusion of some studies from systematic reviews/meta-analyses due to the heterogeneity of outcomes or outcome measurements. It is a waste.","The FDA has published a Guidance for Industry to assist sponsors in the clinical development of drugs for the treatment and prevention of disease caused by RSV (U.S. Food and Drug Administration, 2017). Although the guidance focuses primarily on the development of drugs for RSV in infants and children, special populations are also given attention. New drugs for treatment and prevention should demonstrate broad antiviral activity against diverse RSV strains and sponsors should monitor for the emergence of amino acid substitutions that may confer resistance. Randomized, double-blind, comparative trials should be conducted for both treatment and prevention products. Optimal endpoints have not been established for treatment trials. Phase 2 studies should evaluate a combination of clinical and virologic endpoints, while phase 3 trial endpoints should reflect improvement in clinical signs and symptoms of RSV-associated illness (\"feel, function, and survive\"). For prevention trials, FDA's preferred endpoint is laboratoryconfirmed, medically attended LRTI. In order to facilitate development of novel drugs, collaborative efforts are needed to develop definitions of disease severity, establish consensus definitions of LRTI, and develop reliable instruments to measure clinical improvement.","There remains a need for effective therapeutics and vaccines. Treatment remains symptomatic, with insufficient clinical data on other therapeutic options. These options will always be limited in number, but their development should be approached more systematically with shared protocols and critical comparison of results. As a number of drug and vaccine candidates have been identified, there may be more options available for future clinical trials. There appear to be efforts underway to develop some clinical trials based on standardized protocols. This is needed, despite the challenges presented by the sporadic nature of the cases, and the relative rarity of clinical MERS.","Integrating genomics research into the context of public health surveillance and response can help maximize the use of limited resources, enhance the exchange and growth of scientific knowledge, and increase preparedness for infectious threats. Such research should be based on sound protocols that protect human subjects. Specimens should be processed and banked, enabling future research on genetic variation of both pathogen and host, as well as gene expression profiles, proteomics, and other measures. Epidemiologic data about environment and behaviors should be collected and stored to support additional analysis of gene-environment interactions. Such efforts will require a shift in culture and broadening of traditional public health definitions of preparedness and response, research, and collaboration.","The virus is maintained in a bird-mosquito-bird cycle, with birds developing high levels of viremia and serving as amplifying hosts. Mosquitoes primarily of the genus Culex transmit WNV, although the virus has been isolated from many genera and species of mosquitoes. Although most species of infected birds generally remain asymptomatic, WNV-related mortality has been noted in more than 160 avian species in the United States and Canada. 399 Crows and related birds of the Corvidae are especially susceptible to mortality from WNV infection, and die-offs of these birds have been used as one indicator of active WNV transmission. 399 Equines are frequently infected with WNV, with 36 U.S. states reporting equine infections in 2009. 400 Approximately 80% of WNV infections in humans are asymptomatic, 20% develop fever, and less than 1% are WNV neuroinvasive disease. Most symptomatic persons have an acute febrile illness consisting of headache, myalgia, or arthralgia that lasts from 3 to 6 days. 401 WNV neuroinvasive disease is characterized by acute neurologic manifestations, usually encephalitis, meningoencephalitis, or acute flaccid paralysis. 384, 396, 402 The mortality rate from WNV neuroinvasive disease is approximately 10%. Long-term outcome among survivors varies, with some persons showing little neurologic and functional improvement and others experiencing substantial gains. 403 Persons suffering paralytic disease with respiratory involvement are at greatest risk for death and have a poor long-term outcome. [401] [402] [403] Although WNV strains circulating in the United States have genotypic differences and the predominant circulating strain has changed over time, 404, 405 no strain-specific differences in virulence or clinical disease in humans have been documented, and no antigenic differences have been identified that would pose a challenge to vaccine development. Nevertheless, the sporadic and unpredictable pattern of WNV incidence represents a considerable barrier to randomized clinical trials of vaccines or treatments. 406 Although vaccines for use in horses are licensed-and phase I and II clinical trials of candidate vaccines for human use have been completed-no phase III trials in humans have been attempted. 407 At the present time, prevention of WNV infection relies on a cadre of efforts that include mosquito, bird, and human disease surveillance; mosquito control; the use of personal protective measures; and screening of the blood supply. There is no treatment of proven efficacy for WNV infection. 392","Data (IPD) from multiple countries and healthcare systems may facilitate better understanding of the generalizability and implementation prediction models across different settings and populations, and may greatly improve their applicability and robustness in routine care. [29] [30] [31] [32] The evidence base for the development and validation of prediction models related to COVID-19 will quickly increase over the coming months. Together with the increasing evidence from predictor finding studies 33 and open peer review initiatives for COVID-19 related publications, 34 data registries [35] [36] [37] [38] are being set up. To maximize the new opportunities and to facilitate IPD meta-analyses, the WHO has recently released a new data platform to encourage sharing of anonymized COVID-19 clinical data. 39 To leverage the full potential of .

Randomized controlled trials, non-randomized controlled trials, case series, and cohort studies aimed at evaluating different interventions for COVID-19 were included. Studies that included suspected cases, diagnostic tests, and syndrome surveys were excluded. Clinical trials from the registries were screened by two reviewers according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria. A predesigned Excel spreadsheet was used to extract data, including design type, intervention, patient, outcome, and so forth. Information on outcomes, which was extracted by two authors independently, included the outcome name, measurement method, measurement time point, and data type. Disagreements were resolved by discussion.","The large population movements that accompany infrastructure construction, as well as improved transportation networks that open up opportunities for trade, commerce, travel, and an expanded sex industry, provide opportunities to spread HIV. Thus, to preserve the economic and social opportunities presented by construction while preventing further spread of HIV, the ASEAN countries agreed to coordinate efforts of finance and planning, construction and transportation, agriculture and rural development, and health planning in the form of an international AIDS committee. The committee\u2019s goal was to maximize the utility of investments provided through infrastructure construction, while mitigating the potential negative impacts such construction might bring to surrounding communities.","Population coverages for sets of T cell epitopes were computed using the tool provided by the Immune Epitope Database (IEDB) (http://tools.iedb.org/population/; accessed 21 February 2020) [30] . This tool uses the distribution of MHC alleles (with at least 4-digit resolution, e.g., A*02:01) within a defined population (obtained from http://www.allelefrequencies.net/) to estimate the population coverage for a set of T cell epitopes. The estimated population coverage represents the percentage of individuals within the population that are likely to elicit an immune response to at least one T cell epitope from the set. To identify the set of epitopes associated with MHC alleles that would maximize the population coverage, we adopted a greedy approach: (i) We first identified the MHC allele with the highest individual population coverage and initialized the set with their associated epitopes, then (ii) we progressively added epitopes associated with other MHC alleles that resulted in the largest increase of the accumulated population coverage. We stopped when no increase in the accumulated population coverage was observed by adding epitopes associated with any of the remaining MHC alleles.","Population coverages for sets of T cell epitopes were computed using the tool provided by the Immune Epitope Database (IEDB) (http://tools.iedb.org/population/; accessed 9 February 2020) (Vita et al., 2019).

To identify the set of epitopes associated with MHC alleles that would maximize the population coverage, we adopted a greedy approach: (i) we first identified the MHC allele with the highest individual population coverage and initialized the set with their associated epitopes, then (ii) we progressively added epitopes associated with other MHC alleles that resulted in the largest increase of the accumulated population coverage. We stopped when no increase in the accumulated population coverage was observed by adding epitopes associated with any of the remaining MHC alleles.","Several key parameters have been identified in efforts to maximize the diagnostic yield from sputum culture. Procurement of adequate sputum samples is an essential first step. With increasing numbers of epithelial cells and decreasing numbers of neutrophils, an increased amount of oropharyngeal contamination is present, as indicated by the isolation of more bacterial species. The presence of alveolar macrophages does not alter the bacteriologic findings when substantial numbers of epithelial cells are present, indicating that otherwise adequate samples of sputum can be contaminated with oropharyngeal contents and thereby rendered nondiagnostic. This type of initial screening has proved helpful in differentiating adequate sputum samples from saliva, thereby increasing the diagnostic yield of sputum culture.","This study was conducted and reported following the COMET Handbook, COS-STAD, and COS-STAR. A research plan was publicized on the websites of COMET and the Chinese Clinical Trials Core Outcome Sets Research Center. \u00e0\u00e0","with \u02db1,\u02db2, 1 , 2 &gt; 0 representing the weights in the cost index, t i \u2265 0 is the fixed initial time and t f &gt; 0 is the fixed final time of the control interval. The aim is to minimize the infected and susceptible individuals and to maximize the total number of removed subjects using minimal control efforts. Obviously the adopted cost index takes into account also the more common case in which the objective is to minimize only the infected subjects, and not also the susceptible ones. Let us consider the following problem. Problem: Given the model (3) with initial conditions (2), determine the state x \u2022 and the controls u and v satisfying the system (3), the conditions (4) and that minimize the cost index (12) .","In the 17 outcome domains of protocols of western medicine clinical trials, 5 outcome domains (adverse events/effects, delivery of care, economic, metabolism and nutrition outcomes, mortality/survival) consisted of only one outcome. These outcomes are reported between 1 and 36 times, and the median outcome reporting time is 1. Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal outcomes included the largest number of outcomes, which includes 31 outcomes; chest imaging is reported more frequently than other outcomes. The number of outcomes in different outcome domains in protocols of western medicine clinical trials is shown in Figure 7 .","On the other hand, another study compared the effectiveness of conservative nonsurgical treatment with core decompression with or without DC electrical stimulation. 184 The clinical symptom scores and the rate of progression to arthroplasty were best in the group with core decompression and DC electrical stimulation and worst in the nonoperative group. Capacitive coupling can be performed with or without core decompression and grafting. Forty patients with stage 1 to 3 osteonecrosis underwent core decompression and grafting; half of the patients wore active capacitive coupling units with electrodes over the femoral head for 6 months. The control group was 55 patients with osteonecrosis who were treated conservatively. Follow-ups at 2 and 4 years showed that core decompression with or without capacitive coupling provided a better clinical and radiologic outcome than did conservative treatment. Capacitive coupling did not improve the results further when used with core decompression and grafting.","The first group to issue its recommendations was the WHO Interim panel comprised of independent experts appointed by WHO, who at the May 2015 68th World Health Assembly (WHA) delivered a report stating that the agency lacked the \u201ccapacity or organizational culture\u201d to respond to emergency public health events [38]. The Interim Panel also concluded that WHO managed the crisis by prioritizing \u201cgood diplomacy\u201d over necessary action, but offered no alternative to WHO, arguing instead that the agency should continue in its central role as the world\u2019s lead health emergency response agency [38]. The panel recommended a set of reforms largely aimed at re-establishing WHO\u2019s central role in health emergencies by advocating for: (a) strengthening of the IHR; (b) establishing a contingency fund for outbreak response; (c) formation of an independent Centre for Emergency Preparedness and Response (housed within WHO but overseen independently); (d) support for a WHO plan to develop a global health emergency workforce; and (e) WHO playing a more central role in R&amp;D efforts for future health emergencies [38]. It also recommended the UN Secretary-General consider the appointment of a Special Representative or Special Envoy aimed at garnering greater political and financial support during a global health crisis, but did not recommend establishment of a permanent UN structure/mission. Importantly, many of these core proposals would set the framework for similar proposals expanded upon and carried forward by the other panels.","To determine the position of Anthops within our tree, a separate analysis was carried out on a subset of data, comprising only Hipposideridae species. The analysis was constrained to include only Hipposideridae species as it was important to maximize the number of confidently aligned positions available in this reduced intron data set to accurately determine the position of Anthops. Each gene fragment was aligned separately using T-Coffee (Notredame et al. 2000), all resulting ambiguous alignment regions were removed, and fragments were subsequently concatenated. jModeltest was used to determine the most appropriate model of sequence evolution for the concatenated alignment and AIC indicated a TVM + G model was best. Bayesian analysis was carried out in BEAST and analyzed as above. As TVM + G is not directly implemented in BEAST, our analysis was run under the next most complicated model GTR+G.","Children who are born deaf and are younger than the age of 3 years, as well as children who have already developed communication skills, language, and speech before losing their hearing, derive the greatest benefit from cochlear implants. Cochlear implantation is approved for children 12 months of age or older by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. After a cochlear implant is performed, considerable auditory oral training is required to maximize a child's benefit to develop skills of audition, speech, and language. A child who has been deaf and without sound perception for several years is expected to benefit to a lesser degree. 33","Several attempts have been made to develop vaccines against human coronavirus infection in the past decades. But the degree of cross-protection provided by such vaccines is greatly limited due to the extensive diversity in antigenic variants even within the strains of a phylogenetic sub-cluster (Graham et al. 2013). As for MERS and SARS coronaviruses, there is no licensed specific antiviral treatment or vaccine available till now. However, few of the advances made in developing vaccines and therapeutics for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV could be exploited for the countering 2019-nCoV. But since the efforts to design and develop any vaccine or antiviral agent to tackle the presently emerging coronavirus pathogen would take some time, therefore till then we need to rely extensively on enforcing highly effective prevention and control measures to minimize the risk of 2019-nCoV transmission and spread to the best feasible extent (Cheng et al. 2020). Majority of the vaccines that are being developed for coronaviruses targets the Spike glycoprotein or S protein (Graham et al. 2013). This is mainly because of the fact that S protein is the major inducer of neutralizing antibodies (Jiang et al. 2005). Several kinds of vaccines and antiviral drugs that are based on S protein have been previously evaluated. Among them, the S protein-based vaccines include full-length S protein vaccines, viral vector-based vaccine, DNA-based vaccine, recombinant S protein-based and recombinant RBD protein-based vaccines. Whereas S protein based antiviral therapies include RBD\u2013ACE2 blockers, S cleavage inhibitors, fusion core blockers, neutralizing antibodies, protease inhibitors, S protein inhibitors, and small interfering RNAs (Du et al. 2009). Even though such therapeutic options have proven efficacy in the in vitro studies, however most of these haven\u2019t undergone randomized animal or human trials and hence are of limited use in our present 2019-nCoV scenario. Remdesivir is a novel nucleotide analog prodrug that was intended to be used for the treatment of Ebola virus disease. It also has anti-coronavirus activity due to its inhibitory action on the SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV replication (Sheahan et al. 2017). At present, efforts are being made to identify and develop monoclonal antibodies that are specific and effective against 2019-nCoV. Combination therapy with 2019-nCoV specific monoclonal antibodies and remdesivir can be considered as the ideal therapeutic option for 2019-nCoV (Cohen 2020). Further evaluation is required before confirming the efficacy of such combination therapy. A variety of different therapeutic and vaccine designing approaches against coronaviruses are being explored and yet to be evaluated in terms of their potency, efficacy and safety, but hopefully the process of evaluation will be accelerated in the coming days (Cyranoski 2020; Lu 2020; Pillaiyar et al. 2020; Zaher et al. 2020).","Portions of the HIV env gp120 gene and the RT genes were specifically chosen to be sequenced in an attempt to maximize the phylogenetic information in the dataset. The env gene evolves relatively quickly, being selected upon by hosts' immune systems, and is capable of recovering relationships among recently diverged HIV lineages. The RT gene evolves more slowly, due to greater functional constraints, and can provide insight into relatively older divergences. Using both sequences thus provides a broader range of evolutionary rates than either does alone.","\"3. It might be needed to set an age limit for the admission to intensive care. It is not a mere choice related to values, but to spare resources that might be extremely scarce to those who have in primis the highest chance of survival and then to those who may have more years of life saved, in order to maximize benefits for the largest number of persons. 4. The presence of comorbidity and functional status must be carefully evaluated in addition to age. It is possible that a relatively short stay in healthy persons might potentially become longer and thus resource consuming over the healthcare system in case of persons with advanced age, frailty or severe comorbidity.\"","Genomic assembly and sequence analyses. After examining the high similarity among the samples from three animals, to maximize the coverage of the virus genome, clean reads from three animals were pooled together and de novo assembled using MEGAHIT v1. 2.9 [19] . The assembled contigs were used as references for mapping those the rest unmapped reads using Salmon v0.14. 1 [20] , and multiple rounds were implemented to maximize the mapping (Table S2) .","1.

It showed us how rapidly emerging infectious diseases in distant parts of the globe can reach our doorsteps in days, and highlighted the importance of global cooperation to contain infectious diseases. It demonstrated the vulnerability of health care facilities in an airborne epidemic, and the necessity of establishing stringent infection control measures and crisis management protocols. The high proportion of patients requiring mechanical ventilation alerted us to the ease at which an outbreak could overwhelm our critical care resources if we do not develop adequate surge capacity. Finally, SARS renewed our faith in the dedication of the medical professionals who care for patients, even at the risk of their own lives, while underlining the critical duty of health care administrators and senior physicians in instituting procedures to maximize the safety of frontline staff.","As with any other novel disease, governments, public health services and the scientific community have been working towards stopping the spreading of COVID-19 as soon as possible and with the lowest possible impact on the population [4, [7] [8] [9] . From a scientific point of view, there are two course of actions that can be followed. On the one hand, new vaccines and pharmaceutical interventions need to be developed. This usually requires months of work. Therefore, on the other hand, it is important to study the large-scale spatial spreading of the disease through mathematical and computational modeling, which allows evaluating \"in-silicon\" what-if-scenarios and potential contention measures to stop or delay the disease. This modeling effort is key, as it can contribute to maximize the effectiveness of any protection measures and gain time to develop new drugs or a vaccine to protect the population. Here, we follow the modeling path and analyze, through a data-driven stochastic SEIR-metapopulation model, the temporal and spatial transmission of the COVID-19 disease in Spain as well as the expected impact of possible and customary contention measures.","During the epidemic, rapid integration of the government and social forces into the Internet framework can maximize effective management of the psychological crisis. We established a pyramid structure of psychological crisis management with government as the core leader. At the bottom of the pyramid are communities, which mainly provide psychosocial support. Psychological assistance (such as hotline, online consulting) is used to identify and help the target groups who need intervention. Through the Huayitong app and Psyclub applet (two integrated APPs for online registration, appointment, payment and other functions for West China Hospital and Sichuan psychological consultant platform), telephone hotline and WeChat platform, we quickly organized physicians at all levels of the West China Hospital (including retired professors) and psychologists from all over Sichuan Province to form psychological rescue teams to formulate solutions (e.g. developing technical guidelines and training programs, starting online consultation and setting up problem feedback mechanisms). Psychological rescue teams conduct crisis interventions for confirmed patients and front-line staff. The expert team at the top of the pyramid provide health education and training during the whole process (Fig. 2) . How to quickly identify the emotional and stress problems of individuals is an important part of basis for psychological intervention. We screened the mental health status of suspected cases, medical staffs and general population via WeChat platform and/or telephone by using questionnaires (e.g. Mood Index Questionnaire, Patient Health Questionaire-9) as the evaluation tool. 13, 14 Proper intervention strategies were chosen based on the screening results. Follow-up is performed regardless of whether the individual reports mental health problems or not. The process and content of psychological intervention is shown in Fig. 3 and Table 1 .","There is still a need for improved speed, ease of use, accuracy and longer read lengths. However, given the ongoing, relentless improvements in performance and cost-effectiveness of high-throughput sequencing, it is likely that these financial and technical challenges will be met relatively easily over the coming years [51]. Nonetheless, improvements in the analysis, archiving and sharing of WGS data need to occur before sequencing results can become trustworthy enough to guide clinical decision-making. Significant investment in establishing standards, databases and communication tools will be required to maximize the opportunities provided by WGS in epidemiology. There may also be organizational and ethical issues with data ownership and access [52].","Low-fat, highly digestible diets are necessary to maximize absorption of nutrients.","is the (which was not peer-reviewed) The copyright holder for this preprint . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.30.20048132 doi: medRxiv preprint Optimal timing for peak reduction Figure 11 : (left) Optimal t 0 to initiate social distancing to maximize the delay of the epidemic peak as a function of R 0 (x axis), and time to pharmacological intervention (t I ) (y axis).

Rubinson and colleagues [32] have recommended modifying usual standards of care, termed ''emergency mass critical care practices,'' to maximize the number of patients treated. Others feel that over-stretching resources and deploying unfamiliar staff may backfire and result in staff infection, as well as a standard of care too poor to be of value. However, most investigators agree that there is a need to develop some surge capacity in response to an epidemic. Preparations include stockpiling positive pressure ventilators and medical supplies, adapting general hospital beds for critical care delivery, augmenting and training staff, enhancing infection control measures, and conducting preparedness exercises. To this end, many local, state, and national bodies have developed such stockpiles and disaster management plans. It is incumbent that all critical care practitioners be aware of these resources and plans . The Appendix lists resources for pandemic influenza planning and preparedness.","In conclusion, the primary aim of this study was to develop and validate a mathematical model to describe piperacillin and tazobactam concentration in plasma and the lung of critically ill patients. Additionally we show an unexpected relationship of increased pulmonary permeability being associated with a reduction in pulmonary piperacillin penetration. We also demonstrated that predicting pulmonary piperacillin and tazobactam exposures on the basis of plasma drug exposures may be unreliable. Approprialty powered clinical trials are required to further defined the relationship between plasma and pulmonary drug exposures and establish the impact of pulmonary, rather than plasma, drug exposure on clinical outcome. Additionally pre-clinical and clinical studies are required to investigate mechanisms lung penetration in patients with pneumonia. Biomarkers related to pulmonary permeability or drug penetration could be incorportated as covariates into mathematical models to improve predictions of pulmonary drug exposures. New regimens of piperacillin-tazobactam may be required which optimise drug concentrations in the lung, at the site of infection. It is likely that a single regimen is not suitable for all individuals. If ELF exposure is shown to predict clinical outcome, with great accuracy than plasma exposure, and covariates for pulmonary drug penetration cannot be identified then direct measurement of drug concentrations in the pulmonary compartment, and adjustment of individual regimens may be required.","As human SARS has disappeared, the role of an exuberant (but perhaps appropriate for the titre of the virus) immune response will need to be addressed using animal models of SARS. Mice, cats, ferrets, macaques and civet cats are all susceptible to SARS-CoV, but none, with the exception of aged mice, develop severe disease (reviewed in Ref. 129). In efforts to develop models that closely mimic human disease, mice that are transgenic for the expression of human ACE2 were developed and infected with SARS-CoV130,131. Although these mice develop more severe pulmonary disease than non-transgenic mice, they also develop an overwhelming neuronal infection, accompanied by high cytokine and/or chemokine expression and minimal cellular infiltration in the brain132. Although the severity of the brain infection observed in human ACE2 transgenic mice is greater than that seen in human patients, infection of this organ has been detected in some studies and patients who survived SARS had a greater incidence of neurological and psychiatric sequelae than anticipated63,133,134. The high susceptibility of these mice to infection with SARS-CoV makes them useful for vaccine and therapeutic trials. Another approach to developing an animal model for SARS was to adapt the virus by passage 10\u201315 times through the lungs of BALB/c mice or rats103,135,136. Three to six mutations were detected in the adapted viruses, with changes most commonly observed in the S protein and in nsp5 (3CLpro). The adapted virus caused extensive pulmonary infection and disease was most severe in aged animals. These viruses will be useful for studies of pathogenesis and for vaccine and therapeutic trials.","Similar to previous studies on HIV and HCV [35] [36] [37] [38] , we estimated population coverages for various combinations of MHC alleles associated with these 102 epitopes. Our aim was to determine sets of epitopes associated with MHC alleles with maximum population coverage, potentially aiding the development of vaccines against SARS-CoV-2. For selection, we adopted a greedy computational approach (see Materials and Methods), which identified a set of T cell epitopes estimated to maximize global population coverage. This set comprised of multiple T cell epitopes associated with 20 distinct MHC alleles and was estimated to provide an accumulated population coverage of 96.29% (Table 3) . Interestingly, the majority of the T cell epitopes for which a positive immune response has been determined using T cell assays (Table 2) were presented by the globally most-prevalent MHC allele (shown in blue color in Table 3 ). Moreover, the functionally important epitopes located in the SARS-CoV receptor binding motif were associated with the second and third most-prevalent MHC alleles (underlined in Table 3 ). Thus, while the ordering of T cell epitopes in Table 3 is based on the estimated global population coverage of the associated MHC alleles, it is also a natural order in which these epitopes should be tested experimentally for determining their potential to induce a positive immune response against SARS-CoV-2. We also computed the population coverage of this specific set of epitopes in China, the country most affected by the COVID-19 outbreak, which was estimated to be slightly lower (88.11%), as certain MHC alleles (e.g., HLA-A*02:01) associated with some of these epitopes are less frequent in the Chinese population (Table 3) . Repeating the same greedy approach but focusing on the Chinese population, instead of a global population, the maximum population coverage was estimated to be 92.76% (Table S4) . Table 3 . Set of the SARS-CoV-derived spike (S) and nucleocapsid (N) protein T cell epitopes (obtained from positive MHC binding assays) that are identical in SARS-CoV-2 and that maximize estimated population coverage globally (87 distinct epitopes). Due to the promiscuous nature of binding between peptides and MHC alleles, multiple S and N peptides were reported to bind to individual MHC alleles. Thus, while we list all the S and N epitopes that bind to each MHC allele (Table 3) , the estimated maximum population coverage may be achieved by selecting at least one epitope for each listed MHC allele. Likewise, many individual S and N epitopes were found to be presented by multiple alleles and thereby estimated to have varying global population coverage (listed in Table S5 ).","5.1. Clinical outcome endpoints for respiratory viral illnesslearning from the past John Beigel, NIAID, Bethesda, MD, USA. The primary outcome measure in definitive trials should be a \"clinical event relevant to the patient\" (Temple, 1995) or an endpoint that \"measures directly how a patient feels, functions or survives\" (U.S. Food and Drug Administration, 2011) where function refers to patients' ability to perform activities in their daily lives. Registrational trials of therapeutics for acute uncomplicated influenza used the duration of defined influenza symptoms as the primary endpoint. However, the choice of endpoints is not as clear when conducting trials in a population hospitalized with severe influenza. Could \"how a patient feels\" be used in this population? In some hospitalized influenza studies, 82% of the population are on oxygen, 58% are in the intensive care unit, and 43% are on mechanical ventilation (Beigel et al., 2017) . Limiting to those capable of answering patient reported outcomes would not fully reflect the hospitalized population. Can we use mortality as an endpoint? In prior studies with severe influenza, mortality rates were 6% (Beigel et al., 2017) , and are as low as 1% in other hospitalized influenza studies (de Jong et al., 2014) . While these rates are significant public health concerns, demonstrating a 50% improvement in these rates will require a sample size exceeding 1000 participants. As such, mortality is not a feasible primary outcome for these trials.","With WiDNdisorder, the deep networks consist of four layers. For Tier 1, the input layer consists of 1911 features, and the second and third layers each consist of 240 maxout nodes [46]. The final output is a two-class multinomial node. The deep network was trained using the PyLearn2 library [47] with stochastic gradient descent on batches of 1000 training examples. In addition to the maxout nodes, a dropout procedure [48] was used, which randomly dropped out the output of some of the nodes as their values were propagated through the network. This results in a more robust method less prone to overfitting. To select the hyper-parameters for this tier, a grid search was performed using Jobman. The objective was to maximize the area under the ROC curve on the DO1111_VALIDATION dataset. Figure 4 shows the general architecture of the method for Tier 1. The second stage predictor for WiDNdisorder (i.e., Tier 2) was formed using DO1111_TRAIN and DO1111_VALIDATION, the same training and validation sets used for Tier 1. Since Tier 2 refined the predictions from Tier 1 (i.e., re-predicted the order/disorder state using the initial input and the predicted order/disorder state of neighboring residues), the training set was split into two sets. A model was created for each half of the training set and then used to make predictions for the other half. These predictions were used as additional features for the second-stage predictor. For Tier 2, the input layer consisted of 2093 features. The final predicted value is then sent through a linear transformation to scale the output such that the balanced accuracy was maximized on the validation set when using a threshold of 0.5. Figure 5 illustrates the overall architecture of Tier 2.","Discontinuous B cell epitopes 6 Table 2 .

The NIH-sponsored clinical trial, ongoing in the U.S. and the Republic of Korea, is a doubleblinded, placebo-controlled trial in which patients are randomized to receive either placebo or an initial dose of 200mg of intravenous remdesivir on the first day, followed by a maintenance dose of 100mg per day, through discharge up to a maximum of 10 total treatment days [20] . The primary outcome of the trial, as described in the U.S. National Library of Medicine clinical trials registry, will be expressed as the proportion of patients in each category of a seven-category clinical severity scale on the fifteenth day post treatment initiation (Table 2 ) [42] . Additionally, Gilead Sciences is sponsoring a remdesivir study among patients with severe COVID-19 with a composite primary outcome measure of fever normalization and oxygen normalization [43] .","The major improvement from the protocol of Chou et al. (2006) in this investigation was an iterative seed searching algorithm. First, the top ranked conserved regions were identified and 70mers selected as described above. Then a seed of two non-overlapping 70mer probes with the best coverage of the virus genus was created. One probe was added to the seed each time to maximize the coverage of the genus. The search was finished when all the viral sequences in the genus were covered by the probes, or the size of the set reached 15. The seed searching was repeated three times so that most viruses in the genus were detected by three probes. If less than three probes were selected in the current conserved region, the probe selection was repeated using the lower ranked conserved regions. The whole probe design protocol is implemented in Perl, and can be provided upon request. After the probes were selected, a pair-wise BLASTN alignment was performed among the probes and the viral sequences in the genus. The probes were assigned to the probe sets according to the viral sequences that they matched.","The purpose of this study is to create a predictive algorithm to help hospitals and medical facilities maximize the number of survivors by providing an accurate and reliable tool to help medical decision making and triage COVID-19 patients more effectively and accurately during the pandemic.","This important amount of work conducted by researchers is encouraging for the therapeutic research for this new disease. However, care should be taken when designing a clinical trial in this complicated context as robust results are needed in order to be able to find the appropriate treatment. Finding the best agents for rapid implementation in clinical trials for a new outbreak is challenging. Our study underlines the need to register as much details as possible on clinical trials registries during outbreaks in order to inform the development of future trials. The scientific background supporting the use of a treatment should be clear and detailed as much as possible. The dose and duration of drugs evaluated, as well as details on the study design, the population of interest and the primary outcome, are crucial elements that have to be shared in the context of the epidemic response. Reporting as much details as possible is key to have consistent clinical trials and to enhance the reproducibility of the results, especially as studies are more often associated with a low number of planned inclusions and composite or weak outcomes that can limit the efficacy assessment of the treatments. That is why transparency and consistency are crucial when reporting clinical trials in order to improve statistical power by conducting, for example, meta-analyses."],"title":["Core Outcome Set for Clinical Trials on Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COS-COVID)","Potential Rapid Diagnostics, Vaccine and Therapeutics for 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV): A Systematic Review","The ALPHA Project: An architecture for leveraging public health applications","The ALPHA Project: An architecture for leveraging public health applications","The ALPHA Project: An architecture for leveraging public health applications","Pan-human coronavirus and human bocavirus SYBR Green and TaqMan PCR assays; use in studying influenza A viruses co-infection and risk of hospitalization","Vaccine development for emerging virulent infectious diseases","2.18 Promiscuous Ligands","Predictors of the incidence of all-cause mortality and deaths due to diabetes and renal diseases among patients newly prescribed antihypertensive agents: A cohort study","Outcome reporting from protocols of clinical trials of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19): a review","Advances in respiratory virus therapeutics \u2013 A meeting report from the 6th isirv Antiviral Group conference","What Have We Learned About Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus Emergence in Humans?
