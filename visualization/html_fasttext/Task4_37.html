A successful component of this objective is the promotion of adult immunization programs with improved vaccine coverage of individuals at increased risk of complications from influenza. Several groups are developing communications networks and protocols to disseminate up-to-date information to healthcare providers and the public. Research on influenza biology and epidemiology, animal surveillance, and vaccine and antiviral development has been and will continue to be supported by NIH through grants to academic researchers and through grants that support public-private partnerships. Development of cell culture-based vaccines and the testing in humans of candidate pandemic vaccines made using reverse genetics or classical reassortment techniques should be encouraged. There is also a need to test adjuvanted vaccines and to develop new antiviral agents. It is noteworthy that there are currently only two influenza vaccine manufacturers licensed to distribute vaccine in the US for the 2003-2004 influenza season. It is also noteworthy that 80-90% of produced vaccine is purchased privately, and it takes nearly a full year from the time of selection of strains to the production of usable vaccine. As a result, it will be essential to encourage new vaccine manufacturers and new approaches, including reverse genetics to prepare seed strains, in addition to developing and implementing a vaccine policy that ensures adequate and fair procurement and distribution of the vaccine during an influenza pandemic. Such policies will need to take into account liability protection and equitable global access. Finally, identifying appropriate antiviral drugs to stockpile and developing plans to prioritize use of these antivirals are necessary for pandemic preparedness.","Accessibility: The health system should be accessible to all citizens, should offer and distribute in an equitable way health-care services and goods to ensure the basic human rights such as the fundamental right to life, and at the same time prevent the external adverse effects such as the spread of diseases.","Tuberculosis disproportionately affects men and boys compared with women and girls. 9 Early data show that more men are dying from COVID-19, potentially due to sex-based immunological differences or gender-based factors such as prevalence of smoking. 10 The association between COVID-19 and poverty is also unclear but, as more data become available, we will be able to better understand the differential effects of COVID-19 according to socioeconomic position. COVID-19, like tuberculosis, will almost certainly be associated with the medical poverty trap, in which poorer people have a higher likelihood of infection, disease, and adverse outcomes. Moreover, unemployed populations and informal or so-called zero-hours contract workers will experience further impoverishment, which increases risk of tuberculosis. 5 Amid the expanding COVID-19 pandemic, our plea on World Tuberculosis Day is that we do not forget the tuberculosis pandemic, which, at present, is still the leading cause of infectious disease mortality. We need to continue to mobilise funding for research for better tuberculosis diagnostics, vaccine development, novel therapeutics, equitable access to care, and innovative social protection interventions for tuberculosis-affected households. 5 We should drastically increase and sustain investment in health systems that are responsive to the needs of the poor and resilient to the threat of infections, especially those that are air-borne and require isolation facilities. We need to continue to inform, advocate for, and empower local communities and to lobby governments and policymakers to ensure that tuberculosis, as well as COVID-19, remain high on the global agenda. These two pandemics, one old and one new, remind us of the need to be proactive and longsighted, to plan ahead, and to not become complacent.","Within weeks, COVID-19 has transformed our practice of palliative care and clinical medicine as we know it. Telemedicine has emerged as a critical technology to bring medical care to patients while attempting to reduce the transmission of COVID-19 among patients, families, and clinicians. It is also increasingly necessary to preserve scarce resources like personal protective equipment. In this article, we share just-in-time tips to support palliative care clinicians and program leaders in providing the best care possible by telemedicine. These quick, practical tips cover telemedicine set-up, patient considerations, and clinician considerations. Next steps include ensuring equitable access to affordable telemedicine technology for vulnerable populations through creative solutions and financing, and dedicated attention to telemedicine evaluation and quality improvement.","The majority of the respondents from hospitals that would admit EVD patients stated that, PPE (i.e. masks, gloves, gowns, eye protection) was easily accessible to healthcare workers particularly in frontline areas (55, 89 %). However, only 37 respondents (54 %) indicated that a process is in place for regular checks (i.e. expiry date) on PPE items to ensure their appropriate usage. The majority of participants, identified that for scarce supplies of PPE, a system is in place (49; 72 %) to prioritize healthcare workers caring for affected cases (Table 5).","With incredibly high infectivity and mortality rate, COVID-19 has become a global scare. 8, 9 To compound the problem, there are no proven therapeutics to aid the suffering patients 2, 8, [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] . Only viable treatment at the moment is symptomatic and there is a desperate need for developing therapeutics to counter COVID-19. Recently, the proteomics sequences of 'WH-Human 1' coronavirus became available through Metagenomic RNA sequencing of a patient in Wuhan. 4, 15 WH-Human 1 is 89.1% similar to a group of SARS-like coronaviruses. 4 With this sequence available, it is possible to find potential inhibitory antibodies by scanning thousands of antibody sequences and discovering the neutralizing ones [16] [17] [18] . However, this requires very expensive and time-consuming experimentation to discover the inhibitory responses to Corona virus in a timely manner. In addition, computational and physics-based models require the bound crystal structure of antibody-antigen complex, however; only a few of these structures have become available. 19, 20, 21, 22 In the case of COVID-19, the bound antigen-antibody crystal structure is not available to-date 23, 24 . Given this challenge and the fact that ML models require a large amount of data, the ML approach should rely on the sequences of the antibody-antigen rather than the crystal structures 25 .","(1) When a pandemic threat appears, there will be delay in preparing seed strains for vaccine production. This might be overcome by using reverse genetics to prepare these seed strains. In principle, reverse genetics could be used to prepare high-growth variants for efficient production. This may be essential if the pandemic virus is of avian origin because many of these viruses grow poorly (or not at all) in embryonated eggs, the culture system used for all current influenza vaccine production. As long as issues regarding the worker safety and the intellectual property rights attached to reverse genetics can be sorted out beforehand, this promising technique could be the key factor for ensuring adequate production of pandemic vaccine. (2) Whether the pandemic threat is due to a re-emergent (A/H2-like) or novel (e.g. A/H5-like) virus will determine not only the kind of vaccine that should be produced but also whether one or two doses will be required. Every effort must be made to determine the minimal antigenic content of a dose that is acceptably immunogenic. Studies conducted many years ago indicated that whole cell vaccines were more immunogenic than split virus or subunit preparations of similar antigenic content. Moreover, recent studies have shown that an adjuvanted vaccine will probably be needed for at least the first if not both doses. These studies need to be extended in a larger series of clinical trials of candidate 'pandemic-like' vaccines. The trials must be publicly funded and designed to determine the optimal characteristics of a pandemic vaccine and vaccination schedule. (3) Current regulatory requirements will delay the registration of pandemic vaccines. In Western Europe, immunogenicity studies must be undertaken by vaccine companies each year in order to register their products. Such trials are costly and time consuming, and they are not required in North America or Australia. Moreover, there is widespread international trade in influenza vac-cines in inter-pandemic years. For the next pandemic, such trade is likely to be much more extensive. If pandemic vaccines are to be delivered quickly to the countries where they are needed most, a global protocol will be required that will allow the pandemic vaccine produced by any company to be registered for use in any country of the world. The need for a protocol for the global registration of pandemic vaccines should be considered before the next pandemic threat appears. (4) Countries will be better prepared for the next pandemic if they can increase their use of influenza vaccine in inter-pandemic years. This was started by the Canadian province of Ontario in 2000, when it extended its recommendation for influenza vaccine to all people over 6 months in age. One reason for instituting this program was to be better prepared for a pandemic. Health officials can help prepare for the next pandemic by expanding their influenza vaccination recommendations and extending their programs for public reimbursement for vaccination in inter-pandemic years. (5) The traditional market approach for providing interpandemic vaccine will not be able to meet the global demand for pandemic vaccine. Although many vaccine companies are expanding their production facilities, it is still difficult for them to estimate future demand for inter-pandemic and pandemic vaccines. This is unlike the situation for pediatric vaccines for which precise estimates of the size of future target populations are well known. One way to overcome uncertainty about future demand for influenza vaccines would be to: (a) obtain country-specific data on the number of doses of influenza vaccine distributed each year by each vaccine company and rapidly report the total number of doses distributed per 1000 population in all countries; and (b) obtain 5-year rolling forecasts of the demand for inter-pandemic and pandemic vaccine from health officials in each country. The availability of such past and future information would challenge health officials to make more comprehensive plans for vaccination programs and help companies make more realistic plans for vaccine production. (6) Political leaders in most vaccine-producing countries will probably prohibit the export of domestically produced pandemic vaccine to other countries until they are certain their national needs have been met. As a result, countries that do not have vaccine companies, including many that currently use large amounts of vaccine in inter-pandemic years, may find it difficult or impossible to obtain supplies of pandemic vaccine. To prevent this from happening, international political agreements must be negotiated beforehand that ensure adequate production and equitable distribution of pandemic vaccines to both vaccine-producing and non-producing countries. The European Commission has begun doing this for Europe. Something similar needs to be done for the entire world.","In response, to the myriad of recommendations set forth, the WHO, its Executive Board and its decision-making body, the WHA, were tasked with how to prioritize reforms, assess the feasibility and resources necessary to carry them out, and determining what reforms would be agreeable to all of its member states. Complicating this calculus is the fact that WHO\u2019s current governance structure only allows formal participation by state actors, though the influence of powerful non-state actors (including those who provide the majority of funding to WHO through voluntary contributions) is unlikely to be completely silenced. The emergence of the Zika virus, which was declared a PHEIC event (subsequently removed November 2016), also has the potential to delay and/or significantly alter the pathway of post-EVD WHO reform. The emergence of Zika once again demonstrates that changes needed to ensure WHO can lead in averting the next health crisis are not currently in place [43]. Further, current WHO Director-General Dr. Margaret Chan\u2019s tenure is coming to an end, meaning any long-term reforms will likely need to wait until her replacement is elected in 2017 [33, 37, 44].","As recognized by the WHO [13], mathematical models, especially those which are timely, play a key role in informing evidence-based decisions by health decision- and policy-makers. To the best of our knowledge, only a few mathematical models have so far been publicly released, including a Bats-Hosts-Reservoir-People transmission network model and a returning traveler study aimed to compute underestimated coronavirus cases [14,15]. ","Regarding our second objective, we undertook an attempt to observe and predict the impacts of epidemic outbreaks on the SC using simulation-based methodology and the example of coronavirus COVID-19. An SC simulation model along with experimental results have been presented using a case-study constructed on the basis of primary and secondary data and using anyLogistix simulation and optimization software. Our analysis offers possibility of predicting both short-term and long-term impacts of epidemic outbreaks on the SCs and uncovers the most critical epidemic outbreak scenarios in terms of SC performance decrease. This analysis allows identifying the successful and wrong elements of risk mitigation/preparedness and recovery policies in case of epidemic outbreaks. A set of sensitivity experiments allows to illustrate the model's behavior, its value for decision-makers, and to derive useful managerial insights. More specifically, the outcomes of this research can be used by decision-makers to predict the operative and long-term impacts of epidemic outbreaks on the SCs and develop pandemic SC plans. a) production-inventory dynamics b) customer (ELT service level) performance c) financial performance d) lead-time performance Ivanov Transportation Research Part E 136 (2020) 101922 The major observation from the simulation experiments is that the timing of the closing and opening of the facilities at different echelons might become a major factor that determines the epidemic outbreak impact on the SC performance rather than an upstream disruption duration upstream or the speed of epidemic propagation. Other important factors are lead-time, speed of epidemic propagation, and the upstream and downstream and disruption durations in the SC.","\u2022 Steps that modify the pet's environment, such as providing adequate space and footing, building ramps, and fencing outdoor areas, are useful. Frequent attention, close monitoring of nutrition, and \"timed\" feeding and exercising are also advised.","Several specific actions can mitigate future threats to the health of the global population. First, we need to fully implement the International Health Regulations (IHR) in countries of all income levels. Reports from WHO and the Global Preparedness Monitoring Board have shown that responses to urgent crises have improved under the IHR (2005), but important deficiencies in coverage still exist. 3, 4 We must scale up laboratory capacity and other surveillance capabilities, augment the readiness of health systems to care for large numbers of seriously ill patients while safe guarding the health-care workforce, and improve communication and coordination strategies and implementation. 5 Procurement and supply chain management must also be enhanced to ensure adequate stocks of personal protective equipment and essential medications and to enable equitable access to new diagnostics, therapeutics, and vaccines during health emergencies. 6 Second, we need to accelerate progress towards achieving the priorities and targets of the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction, 7 which was adopted by UN member nations in 2015. The Sendai Framework applies an all-hazards approach to increasing international, regional, national, and local resilience to withstand a broad spectrum of disasters, including epidemics, pandemics, and epizootics. Preparedness for emerging infectious diseases requires strengthening health systems and developing response plans that account for the social, environmental, political, and institutional factors that can either support or disrupt emergency management efforts. 8 The Sendai Framework complements the IHR by integrating infrastructure, climate change, and economic considerations into disaster management plans and promoting inclusive policies that protect vulnerable populations during all phases of mitigation, preparedness, response, and recovery. 7 Third, plans for preventing, detecting, and controlling outbreaks of emerging infectious diseases need to be built on a One Health foundation that emphasises the interconnectedness of humans, animals, and ecosystems. 9 Transdisciplinary, multisectoral strategies are necessary when seeking to solve complex problems that threaten global public health and safety. 10 More specifically in relation to diseases such as COVID-19, One Health focuses on the danger existing at the human-wildlife interface. The ability to detect viruses in livestock and wildlife is a crucial component of early warning systems for human pandemics. 11 ","Telemedicine is a proven modality for delivering palliative care value to the most vulnerable people. Care of people with serious illness and their families now requires impeccable social distancing for their protection and for all healthcare professionals so critically needed in response to COVID-19. Preparation, patience, and practice will help ensure effective implementation of telemedicine. The quick tips offered above are an excellent starting point, but additional support and innovation can help eliminate barriers and stimulate rapid mastery. First, we must find creative ways to ensure that all patients have equitable access to this valuable resource. We must reach individuals with poor social networks, poor technological literacy, and who lack access to technology. Soliciting the help of volunteers, philanthropy, and tech companies who can create plug-and-play telemedicine devices at low-cost can help shore up potential gaps in access. Second, reimbursement for telephone visits, particularly to those in whom video visits are not possible, will incentivize the use of this important modality when it is needed. Third, we must capitalize on this unprecedented time in which telemedicine will become a critical part of healthcare delivery to study processes and outcomes through programmatic evaluation and research to guide best practices in the future.","The following examples highlight the ethical challenges that have arisen in resource allocation of critical care services. The 2010 Haiti earthquake, which killed 230,000 and displaced approximately 2 million, prompted the development of one of the first ever neonatal-PICUs in the country via non-governmental organization support. Limitation of care decisions were made in the setting of cardiac arrest or respiratory failure necessitating intubation in children with chronic disease. The delivery of quality ICU care was challenging, but was most successful and beneficial for otherwise healthy children who presented with early, acute, reversible disease (74). In South Africa, in an attempt to provide a reasonable process for fair and equitable utilization of scarce resources, the local PICU team at Red Cross War Memorial Hospital developed explicit admission exclusion criteria (Table 1) (75).","The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03. 15.20035360 doi: medRxiv preprint (e.g. high dependency unit), earlier on, for patients at highest risk of severe infection. These can also be formalised within risk stratification tools to aid clinical decision-making, such as the CURB65 tool for community-acquired pneumonia (20) . As the number of hospitalised COVID-19 cases continues to increase, hospitals will increasingly need to ration limited resources and improve clinical pathways to effectively prioritise patients with greatest clinical need. This is important, as COVID-19 is already placing increased pressure on ICUs, and anticipation of future demand, based on local population characteristics, may enable more timely planning and resource mobilisation (21) . Identifying those at the highest risk will also facilitate better-informed discussions between clinicians, patients and patients' families about the anticipated clinical trajectory, allowing more accurate and timely advance care discussions to occur.","We are faced with primordial questions which are more or less difficult to answer. Are we witnessing an increased frequency of EIDs appearance? Are there more cases today? Can we predict patterns, or rules, of emergence? Are there geographic areas in which these emerging infections are more frequently or widely observed today? Do we possess the scientific ability to predict exactly where the next infectious epidemic will start? Evidently, if we were so able we might allocate the financial resources and technical and scientific support to suspected areas. At the moment, we do just the opposite, or we do nothing, and we are disconcerted at each new emergence. In order to convince governing bodies and public decision-makers, we must demonstrate to them that predictive approaches are less costly than curative ones. Using approaches inherited from ecology and biogeography EcoHealth Alliance has adapted the same principles to understanding the ecology and spatial distribution of EID principles observed over the last decades. Their work shows that of the nearly 400 new EIDs which have appeared, the so-called zoonotic ones originating in wild animals have been in net increase in the last 40 years; 3 out of 5 new infections which appear each year originate in wild fauna. What's more, the risk of infectious transmission is highly and doubly correlated with human density, as are these diseases of animal origin to the areas' biodiversity. They called these areas ''hot-spots'' for disease risks, mostly situated in intertropical regions. They are advocating for these specific zones to be those on which they concentrate our research efforts as well as international public aid for development. In fact, it is not only biological diversity in animals which must be taken into account, but also the evolution of natural ecosystems and their disappearance over recent years. Deforestation and land use changes by populations are driving forces in the appearance in new EIDs. Therefore, international politicians must better link economic strategies to those of habitat and biodiversity coordination if we wish to avoid new pandemics.","in this same group. Another relevant limitation was to consider that all primary health services 170 will have the same capacity in identifying the severity of clinical conditions, in a region with 171 more than 20 million people living with a GINI index ranging from 0.40 to 0.69 [25] , indicating, 172 among other factors, quite different levels of access to tertiary healthcare services. Furthermore, 173 one must consider the possibility that the health infrastructure available can be precociously 174 collapsed. We also assume that, during the 60 days lapse from the epidemic onset, no significant 175 behavioral changes would occur, neither strong interventions from by policy decision makers.","As recognized by the World Health Organization (WHO), mathematical models, especially those devised in a timely fashion, can play a key role in providing health decision- and policy-makers with evidence-based information. Modeling can, indeed, better help understanding: i) how transmissible the disease is, ii) when the infectiousness is highest during the course of infection, iii) how severe the infection is, and iv) how effective interventions have been and ought to be.","The control, containment, mitigation and final resolution of the coronavirus epidemic requires careful consideration of alternative scenarios as pointed out very clearly in [19] . Models like the ones presented here can help decision-makers to have amore comprehensive understanding of the epidemic and thus a better set of criteria on which to base decisions.","During the peak of the 2003 outbreak, ESRI China (Hong Kong) launched \"SARS GIS\", a new mapping Web site dedicated to SARS ( \u2013 Figure 5). ESRI China believes that GIS can be used to help raising the community's spatial awareness for combating the SARS virus. They have established \"SARS GIS\" in order to distribute timely information to the public regarding SARS cases and distribution around the world.","While a number of different measures to contain the virus have been implemented by countries all over the world, their effectiveness remains to be seen. The models used to inform decision-makers are differing significantly in their basic assumptions because it is the first coronavirus of such an impact in terms of the number of fatal cases. Also the existing modelling approaches often use biased data for tuning parameters or assessing models quality. Until an effective treatment is available, the accuracy of these models and the decisions made on their basis are the major factors in reducing the overall mortality in the COVID-19 pandemic.","Applications of AI and deep learning argued to be useful tools in assisting diagnosis and treatment decision making [10] [11] . There were studies which promoted disease detection through AI models [12] [13] [14] [15] . Use of mobile phones [16] [17] [18] [19] and web based portals [20] [21] have been tested successfully in health related data collection. However, one need to apply such techniques in a timely way for faster results. Apart from cost-effectiveness, the proposed modeling will be of great assistance in identifying and controlling when populations are closed due to virus spread. In addition to these, our proposed algorithm can be easily extended to identify individuals who might have any mild symptoms and signs.","3. Check, replenish, distribute and keep the inventory of PPE to ensure a sufficient supply of equipment.","The Shanghai Medical Team dispatched to Wuhan is a major component of the national medical response team. On January 28, the first four psychiatrists were dispatched to Wuhan after a 3-day NCP-specific skill training. The group established a PCI department in the Tongren Hospital of Wuhan University, and set up a work schedule to provide assistance. Due to different populations being affected by the epidemic to different degrees, the psychiatrists identified high-risk populations on which to prioritize their efforts, in order to prevent extreme events such as suicide and impulsive behavior. They drafted the signs of psychological crisis and provided feasible methods, providing timely report to the leading group of the joint prevention and control of the epidemic situation. Thus, the ninth batch of the Shanghai Medical Team was dispatched with 50 psychological therapists on February 21, as a second team for providing of mental health support.","Seven priority proposals can be outlined as follows: encourage research on the prediction, screening and early detection of new risks of infection; develop research and surveillance concerning transmission of pathogens between animals and humans, with their reinforcement in particular in intertropical areas (''hot-spots'') thanks to public support; pursue aid development and support in these areas of prevention and training for local health personnel, and to foster risk awareness in the population; ensure adapted patient care in order to promote adherence to treatment and to epidemic propagation reduction measures; develop greater sensitization and training among politicians and healthcare providers, in order to better prepare them to respond to new types of crises; modify the logic of governance, drawing from all available modes of communication and incorporating new information-sharing tools; develop economic research on the fight against EIDs, taking into account specific determining factors in order to create a balance between preventive and treatment approaches.","Patient and family empowerment has followed the general trend in Canadian society to greater individual rights which began with the introduction of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms (1982) . Since that time, the legislatures and Parliaments have enacted legislation related to privacy, confidentiality, patient rights and responsibilities and substitute decision makers. At the same time, there has been an increase of advance directives and requests for do-not-resuscitate status. These standards have proven to be among the most challenging for many surgical teams to achieve acceptable compliance.","Nonetheless, the qualitative insights around the role of social distancing, the relatively long intervention durations required to bend the epidemic curve, and the potential use of cyclic interventions can be used to policy-makers and decision makers, along with emerging empirical evidence from other countries, to consider the best approaches for epidemic control over the coming months. Lastly, we have not modeled the fact that that abrupt surges in death resulting from full ICUs would, result in lower demands for ICU beds. Our goal here is to inform policy so that such outcomes are avoided to the extent possible.","Firstly, countries need to take immediate preventive and control measures based on potential transmission risks, rather than allowing them to remain unchecked. Considering the population density and climatic conditions of different countries, zoning management is important and this needs to be adjusted in time according to the risk level of the epidemic to avoid the negative effects of strict management. Secondly, governments of countries need to strive for a unified and equitable allocation of resources and to improve the efficiency of resource distribution through coordinated management. At global scale, beyond the WHO, collaborative international organizations such as the United Nations (UN) should unite different subordinate departments to cooperatively develop global management plans, thereby suggesting countermeasures for countries. Thirdly, the education, participation and support of all members of society is essential to defeating the epidemic. As such, governments have the responsibility and obligation to take measures that foster the willingness of the broader population to collaborate. It is also very important to publish accurate information about infection status in a timely manner and to actively seek collaboration with the international community.","In essence, during the current time of widespread anxiety around the COVID-19 pandemic [16], a pragmatic guide based on underlying risk stratification and resource utilization will help support our ethical duty of assuring access to timely and appropriate surgical care to our patients, while maintaining an unwavering stewardship for scarce resources and emergency preparedness. Figure 1 provides a tentative decision-making algorithm based on elective surgical indications and predicted perioperative utilization of critical resources, including the consideration for intra\u2212/postoperative blood product transfusions, estimated postoperative hospital length of stay, and the expected requirement for prolonged ventilation and need for postoperative ICU admission. ","The measures proposed in this paper are an approximation to the current healthcare capacity in Europe. Unfortunately, data on health care capacity is rel atively scarce and we have to rely on data from 2017,2018 or even older. Data availability is even worse for critical care beds, on which we rely on multicountry data from 2010. Remuzzi &amp; Remuzzi report ICU capacity of 5200 beds for Italy as a whole, which is lower than the 7550 critical care beds reported by Rhodes et al. [1, 5] . It is likely that other EU countries have downsized their critical bed capacity too. In terms of curative beds per 100 000 population as reported by Eurostat, for most countries (all except Ireland, Bulgaria, Poland and Romania), we observed a downward trend in the past 10 years. Moreover, hospital capacity strain was recently found to be associated with increased mortality and decreased health outcomes [10] . Note that if we would assume the same extent of downsizing in Italy and other EU countries, our relative comparisons would not change. Note that we compare these countries by their base capacity, while clearly many countries have expanded their base capacity to differing degrees (eg, additional beds, mobilizing volunteers or retired Physicians x critical care beds (Physicians + nurses) x critical care beds health care workers). We therefore will track at which relative pressure individual countries can no langer handle the volume of critical patients and which pressure on their base capacity they experience at the peak. Note also that we do not account for health care workers' incapacitation from COVID-19 or other causes as the epidemic unfolds. Our analysis shows that many European countries are soon to be confronted with a health care pressure that will exceed current healthcare capacity. Based on the intensity-approach and the composite measures, we believe that the healthcare pressure in Spain is already at very high levels. For The Netherlands and France the pressure on healthcare systems will soon reach Italy's levels. Where this is not yet done, policymakers should urgently expand their health care capacities to avoid pressure as experienced in Italy. Our analysis informs policy makers on how far their country is removed from an overloaded healthcare system. As such, this information can be useful to plan ahead in order to relieve pressure on their national healthcare system. Moreover, the evolving healthcare pressure, especially the pressure experienced by each country at the peak, will be useful to plan future outbreaks and a timely expansion of health care capacity.","Synthetic recombinant interferon \u03b1 has proven to be effective in treatment of SARS patients in clinic trials [55] . Pulmonary X-ray abnormal remission time was reduced by 50% in the interferon-treated group compared with the glucocorticoid-treated group alone. Interferon was also found to be an effective inhibitor of MERS-CoV replication [56] . Those findings suggested that interferon could be used in the treatment of COVID-19. Intravenous immunoglobulin might be the safest immunomodulator for long-term use in all ages, and could help to inhibit the production of proinflammatory cytokines and increase the production of anti-inflammatory mediators [57] . Moreover, Thymosin alpha-1 (Ta1) can be an immune booster for SARS patients, effectively controlling the spread of disease [58] . Intravenous immunoglobulin and Ta1 may also be considered as therapeutics for COVID-19.","is the (which was not peer-reviewed) The copyright holder for this preprint . https://doi.org /10.1101 /10. /2020 With growing number of cases have occurred in more than 150 countries and regions, modeling the COVID-19's transmission dynamics and estimating its development are crucial to provide decision supports for public health departments and healthcare policy makers. Mathematical models are widely used in evaluating epidemic transmissions, forecasting the trend of disease spread, and providing optimal intervention strategies and control measures. Considerable recent studies have contended to estimate COVID-19's scale and severity, several mathematical models and predicting approaches have attempted to estimate the transmission of COVID-19 [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] . Majority of the researches estimated the basic reproductive number R 0 , a key parameter to evaluate the potential of COVID-19 transmission. However, different models often yield different conclusions in terms of differences in model structure and input parameters. It is imperative and critical to improve early predictive and warning capability for the pandemic.","Researchers are searching for effective and suitable vaccine candidates and therapeutics for controlling the deadly COVID-19. There are no effective vaccines or specific antiviral drugs for COVID-19. Hence, we have to rely exclusively on enforcing strict preventive and control measures that minimize the risk of possible disease transmission. Results obtained from the recently conducted in vitro study against COVID-19 are promising since the drugs remdesivir and chloroquine were found to be highly effective in controlling the infection. Direct clinical trials can be conducted among the patients infected with COVID-19 since these drugs are being used for treating other diseases and have well-established safety profiles, making the further evaluation of these drugs much easier. S protein is considered a key viral antigen for developing CoV vaccines, as shown in several preclinical studies. Although research is in progress to improve prevention, treatment, and control of COVID-19, the documented clinical data on different therapeutic approaches for CoVs are scarce. Further research should be directed toward the study of SARS-CoV-2 in suitable animal models for analyzing replication, transmission, and pathogenesis.","Therefore, a deliberate release of Y. pestis is feasible but unlikely to occur due to technical constraints, particularly of release, and the strong public health response would prevent the spread of pneumonic plague. The next steps would be to create a viable vaccine, continue research on novel therapies, distribute rapid diagnostic tests, and raise the awareness of clinicians to the possibility of an attack. Moreover, it is vital to acknowledge the importance of early isolation of patients and timely initiation of public health mechanisms.","1. The adequacy and viability of the health system in order to meet health needs despite of potential shortages of resources (human, material, financial) and the absence of innovative organizational, management, and operation methods. 2. The promotion of accessibility to quality and safe health services and the equitable distribution of health resources (regardless of income, social status, place of residence, ethnicity).","In Bangladesh, 67% of the total egg production is contributed by backyard sector with an annual egg production of 4.4 billion from this sector itself (Dolberg, 2008) . In India, this rural poultry sector contributes 23% of the total national egg production (Ngullie and Sharma, 2012) and the income per bird per annum ranges between US$ 0.6-2.3 (Indian rupees 4-13 per bird/month) (Ahuja et al., 2008) . This contribution is considerably low for a rural livelihood, but it can be increased by expanding the egg production level. The major constraint in increasing the egg production in backyard birds is microbial infection due to lack of biosecurity practices followed by the farmers (Conan et al., 2012) . Similarly, in developed countries, such as Chile, the farmers mostly sell their products to their neighbors during any occasion or to the tourists who occasionally visit the farms (Hamilton-West et al., 2012) . Thus, the income is not sustainable and considerably low.","If transdisciplinary approaches yield longer-lasting effects, make medical interventions more successful or less necessary, provide health-care access to more sectors of the community, and more effectively address economic and gender inequities than do standard biomedical interventions alone, these gains can help achieve a fundamental shift in devising and implementing disease-prevention strategies. The successes, and policy relevance, of these approaches will be key to their institutionalization (Lebel, 2004). Additionally, teams and communities of transdisciplinary researchers must communicate their successes and failures so that they are understood by a wide range of audiences and measured by appropriate indices, particularly because holistic systems-based research can take a long time to complete and tends not to make the same splash as large drug or vaccine trials. Substantial outreach and education efforts will be required to achieve these goals, which include communication with, and participation by, those whose health is being studied as well as by decision-makers at multiple levels, from emergency physicians and veterinarians to funding agencies and global policy makers.","Since the first maps used by Dr John Snow in 1854 to trace the origin of a cholera outbreak in London's Soho district, it has become evident that carefully planned and designed maps can be very powerful decision support and spatio-temporal analysis tools [10]. In the case of infectious disease epidemics, they allow public health decision makers, travellers and local populations at risk to visually monitor and appreciate at a glance changes, trends and patterns buried in large datasets that are continuously varying with time (like SARS datasets \u2013 see below). This kind of support is vital for making well-informed decisions when designing and following up epidemic control strategies or issuing and updating travel advisories.","This study specifically shows a holistic picture of the current research in response to the outbreak of COVID-19. We conducted a topic-based bibliometric study to address two questions \"What is the CoVs research interested in?\" and \"Where are we with our research about COVID-19?\". An LDA-based model was used to identify the hotspots and their difference between COVID-19 and other CoV infections in a quantitative way. Generally, eight main research areas are identified, i.e., clinical characterization, pathogenesis research, therapeutics research, epidemiological study, virus transmission, vaccines research, virus diagnostics, and viral genomics. The results also indicate that studies in diagnostics, therapeutics, vaccines, viral genomics, and pathogenesis are urgently needed to minimize the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak. As COVID-19 can be considered a recent emerged disease, we characterize a 'snapshot' of this field at an early stage in its development. Our findings can potentially aid governments and the research community in understanding recent development of the research field, optimizing research topic decision, and monitoring new scientific or technological activities.","China is a country with unique challenges; it is a rapidly developing country with a very large population and expanding economy. Through this, China faces a number of complex challenges with regards to health, the economy and the environment. A number of infectious diseases of significant global concern have emerged from China over the past 20 years; many of which have been associated with production animals or live animal markets. Despite this, response to EID events in China has had a primary focus on human health and economic factors. It is becoming apparent that such approaches do not adequately address the root causes of the emergence of these diseases. EID events are highly complex in nature and cannot be merely reduced to a simple \u201ccause and effect\u201d model; adequate response requires a broader perspective. It is through this perspective that a One Health approach can be used to better address emerging and complex health issues affecting China, such as EIDs. One Health allows more proactive, systems based approaches to be developed to address complex issues.","The Interagency Pandemic Influenza Working Group is also focused on improving national readiness to respond to a pandemic. The CDC has developed a planning guide for state and local health officials (http://www.cdc.gov/od/nvpo/ pandemicflu.htm) that has helped in the development of pandemic planning guides for 47 states, 4 of which are available on the internet. The focus of these plans is to create decision-making protocols for response to a pandemic, to develop flexible contingency plans for procurement and distribution of vaccines and antivirals, to reduce liability risks, and to prioritize groups for receipt of vaccines and/or antivirals. Improved readiness has also focused on identification of specific resources required for a response, including additional medical personnel, medications and vaccines. A web-based program, FluAid 2.0 (http://www2.cdc.gov/od/fluaid) has been developed which will help states estimate the potential impact of influenza.","adrenomedullin A vasodilator peptide (ADM, 52aa) related to calcitonin gene related peptide (CGRP). In addition to vasodilatory effects it has been reported that adrenomedullin protects a variety of cells against oxidative stress induced by stressors such as hypoxia, ischemia/reperfusion, and hydrogen peroxide through the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-dependent pathway. Adrenomedullin-2 (intermedin, 148aa) may regulate gastrointestinal and cardiovascular activities through a cAMP-dependent pathway.

It is essential that policy makers and the public understand the potential threat that influenza poses to mankind so that firm political and financial commitments are made to minimize the impact of a pandemic. The best defense against an influenza pandemic is to strengthen the capacity to respond to seasonal epidemics of influenza through improved surveillance, increased vaccine use, enhanced vaccine production, and development of a more effective vaccine delivery infrastructure that could function effectively in an emergency. Policy makers should take advantage of and integrate bioterrorism planning with pandemic influenza preparedness and develop flexible, science-based policies. By combining all of these efforts we will be better prepared for the next pandemic of influenza.","This simple formula implies, in particular, that when the number of daily new cases equals H, people reduce their contacts twice. The value of parameter H can be culturedependent. In figure 3A we show long-term epidemic dynamics assuming H = 10 000. In the considered scenario, the number of daily new cases relatively quickly approaches 15 000 and then decreases slowly over years with a decreasing susceptible fraction, f S . The scenario depicted in figure 3A results in a manageable number of new cases and grants time to develop, produce, and distribute a vaccine.","Several approaches can be used to increase the likelihood of identifying virus, including 'querying' translated DNA sequences against a translated DNA database, as evolutionary relationships remain detectable for longer at the amino acid than at the nucleotide level. The computational generation of theoretical ancestral sequences, and their subsequent use in sequence similarity searches, may also improve identification of highly divergent viral sequences (Delwart, 2007) . Computational biologists have also developed new ingenious algorithms and techniques to analyse data produced by next generation sequencing to aid the identification of novel viruses (Wooley et al., 2010) .","There are no proven or registered therapeutics or vaccines for COVID-19 infection at this time. Treatment is largely supportive44, though a number of therapeutics are under investigation with some undergoing clinical trials in China and elsewhere. Of particular interest currently are the HIV protease inhibitor combination lopinavir/ritonavir and a new broad-spectrum antiviral agent called remdesivir, which has shown promising activity against MERS-CoV in animal models. Combinations of these with interferon-\u03b2 and/or ribavirin are being considered, while other groups are looking at other antivirals, convalescent plasma, and monoclonal antibodies.","A further issue is production capacities of established methods, which are often insufficient to support global vaccination. Even if the potential threat is known and vaccine manufacturing technologies are established, like for pandemic influenza vaccine, production capacity to meet peak demands during a pandemic remains problematic. Thanks to efforts coordinated by the WHO, the potential production capacity for pandemic influenza vaccines in 2015 could in theory support the vaccination of 43% of the population with two doses of vaccine (16). However, the global distribution of vaccine production is far from equal between industrial nations and the developing world: according to a survey made in 2015, only 5% of influenza vaccine doses were distributed among Southeast Asia, Eastern Mediterranean, and Africa WHO regions, which comprise about half of the world's population (17). In addition, most currently licensed vaccines would take 5\u20133 months between identification of a pandemic influenza and vaccine distribution, which would give a pandemic virus ample time for global spread. Hence, technologies that enable fast production of large amounts of vaccine are direly needed in the face of pandemic threats.","Determining which types of cells are involved can aid in treatment and prognosis (see below).","Therefore, decision-makers must balance public health concerns with economic considerations in fighting this epidemic.","Depending on features of the virus structure, transmission dynamics, entry requirements, tropism, and replication strategy, a vaccine approach should be proposed, designed, and evaluated in small animals for immunogenicity and protection against challenge. Manufacturing a candidate vaccine for which there is no immediate market poses a significant dilemma because most stages of advanced vaccine development are carried out by large pharmaceutical companies that need to make profit to stay in business. While emerging infectious diseases pose a public health threat, they rarely present a compelling commercial opportunity. Vaccines require a large investment and historically have a relatively low probability of being successful without an extensive iterative process of evaluation and redesign. Therefore, in addition to new biological tools, there needs to be political will to prioritize public funding of advanced vaccine development and new business models for managing this process. 3 In this review, we describe the vaccine development efforts for three distinct viruses that collectively capture many of the challenges faced when developing vaccines for emerging viral threats. Ebola, a member of the Filoviridae family, is spread by body fluids and secretions with a relatively low attack rate but causes a systemic disease with high mortality. Chikungunya, an alphavirus in FIGURE 28.1 Time from identification of a viral pathogen to vaccine availability. Vaccine development is a lengthy process often measured in decades. Many steps are required even for a traditional empirical approach including identification of target antigen; assay development; defining seroprevalence and incidence in relevant populations; understanding transmission dynamics and whether there is an intermediate animal host; developing animal models; exploring pathogenesis and defining immune mechanisms of protection; designing vaccine antigens; determining formulation, delivery route and method; preclinical evaluation for safety and immunogenicity; manufacturing; and several years of clinical evaluation and clearing regulatory hurdles. Vaccines can fail at any of these steps, and it is rare for the first attempted concept to become the final product."],"title":["Current research on respiratory viral infections: Fifth International Symposium","Chapter 25 Public Health Policies in European Union: An Innovation Strategy\u2014Horizon 2020","Tackling two pandemics: a plea on World Tuberculosis Day","Telemedicine in the Time of Coronavirus","Preparedness of institutions around the world for managing patients with Ebola virus disease: an infection control readiness checklist","Potential Neutralizing Antibodies Discovered for Novel Corona Virus Using Machine Learning","Current research on respiratory viral infections: Fifth International Symposium","The Ebola Outbreak: Catalyzing a \u201cShift\u201d in Global Health Governance?","Estimation of the Transmission Risk of the 2019-nCoV and Its Implication for Public Health Interventions","Predicting the impacts of epidemic outbreaks on global supply chains: A simulation-based analysis on the coronavirus outbreak (COVID-19/SARS-CoV-2) case","Chapter 126 Diseases of the Brain and Cranial Nerves","Will COVID-19 generate global preparedness?","Telemedicine in the Time of Coronavirus","A Review of Pediatric Critical Care in Resource-Limited Settings: A Look at Past, Present, and Future Directions","Systematic review and meta-analysis of predictive symptoms and comorbidities for severe COVID-19 infection","Need for integrative thinking to fight against emerging infectious diseases.

Telemedicine has emerged as a critical technology to bring medical care to patients while attempting to reduce the transmission of COVID-19 among patients, families, and clinicians. It is also increasingly necessary to preserve scarce resources like personal protective equipment. In this article, we share just-in-time tips to support palliative care clinicians and program leaders in providing the best care possible by telemedicine. These quick, practical tips cover telemedicine set-up, patient considerations, and clinician considerations. Next steps include ensuring equitable access to affordable telemedicine technology for vulnerable populations through creative solutions and financing, and dedicated attention to telemedicine evaluation and quality improvement.","Ever since the development of the first vaccine more than 200 years ago, vaccinations have greatly decreased the burden of infectious diseases worldwide, famously leading to the eradication of small pox and allowing the restriction of diseases such as polio, tetanus, diphtheria, and measles. A multitude of research efforts focuses on the improvement of established and the discovery of new vaccines such as the HPV (human papilloma virus) vaccine in 2006. However, radical changes in the density, age distribution and traveling habits of the population worldwide as well as the changing climate favor the emergence of old and new pathogens that bear the risk of becoming pandemic threats. In recent years, the rapid spread of severe infections such as HIV, SARS, Ebola, and Zika have highlighted the dire need for global preparedness for pandemics, which necessitates the extremely rapid development and comprehensive distribution of vaccines against potentially previously unknown pathogens. What ...","Coronavirus infection spreads in clusters and therefore early identification of these clusters is critical for slowing down the spread of the virus. Here, we propose that daily population-wide surveys that assess the development of symptoms caused by the virus could serve as a strategic and valuable tool for identifying such clusters to inform epidemiologists, public health officials, and policy makers. We show preliminary results from a survey of over 38,000 Israelis and call for an international consortium to extend this concept in order to develop predictive models. We expect such data to allow: Faster detection of spreading zones and patients; Obtaining a current snapshot of the number of people in each area who have developed symptoms; Predicting future spreading zones several days before an outbreak occurs; Evaluating the effectiveness of the various social distancing measures taken, and their contribution to reduce the number of symptomatic people. Such information can provide a...","The emergence of new pathogens, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and Ebola virus, poses serious challenges to global public health and highlights the urgent need for novel antiviral approaches. Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) have been successfully used to treat various diseases, particularly cancer and immunological disorders. Antigen-specific mAbs have been isolated using several different approaches, including hybridoma, transgenic mice, phage display, yeast display, and single B-cell isolation. Consequently, an increasing number of mAbs, which exhibit high potency against emerging viruses in vitro and in animal models of infection, have been developed. In this paper, we summarize historical trends and recent developments in mAb discovery, compare the advantages and disadvantages of various approaches to mAb production, and discuss the potential use of such strategies for the development of antivi...","","ABSTRACTSevere Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 is rapidly spreading around the world. There is no existing vaccine or proven drug to prevent infections and stop virus proliferation. Although this virus is similar to human and animal SARS- and MERS-CoVs the detailed information about SARS-CoV-2 proteins structures and functions is urgently needed to rapidly develop effective vaccines, antibodies and antivirals. We applied high-throughput protein production and structure determination pipeline at the Center for Structural Genomics of Infectious Diseases to produce SARS-CoV-2 proteins and structures. Here we report the high-resolution crystal structure of endoribonuclease Nsp15/NendoU from SARS-CoV-2 \u2013 a virus causing current world-wide epidemics. We compare this structure with previously reported models of Nsp15 from SARS and MERS coronaviruses.","COVID-19 threatens to overwhelm hospital facilities throughout the United States. We created an interactive, quantitative model that forecasts demand for COVID-19 related hospitalization based on county-level population characteristics, data from the literature on COVID-19, and data from online repositories. Using this information as well as user inputs, the model estimates a time series of demand for intensive care beds and acute care beds as well as the availability of those beds. The online model is designed to be intuitive and interactive so that local leaders with limited technical or epidemiological expertise may make decisions based on a variety of scenarios. This complements high-level models designed for public consumption and technically sophisticated models designed for use by epidemiologists. The model is actively being used by several academic medical centers and policy makers, and we believe that broader access will continue to aid community and hospital leaders in their ...","Abstract We present here the proceedings of the 5th seminar on emerging infectious diseases, held in Paris on March 22nd, 2016, with seven priority proposals that can be outlined as follows: encourage research on the prediction, screening and early detection of new risks of infection; develop research and surveillance concerning transmission of pathogens between animals and humans, with their reinforcement in particular in intertropical areas (\u201chot-spots\u201d) via public support; pursue aid development and support in these areas of prevention and training for local health personnel, and foster risk awareness in the population; ensure adapted patient care in order to promote adherence to treatment and to epidemic propagation reduction measures; develop greater awareness and better education among politicians and healthcare providers, in order to ensure more adapted response to new types of crises; modify the logic of governance, drawing from all available modes of communication and incorpor...","Abstract The people of rural and periurban India depend on backyard farming system for poultry meat and eggs. It is used by weaker sections of society, such as marginal farmers as insurance against crop failure, for ready cash and to ensure basic economic returns and the empowerment of women and children. However, backyard farming does not appear to be a promising strategy to achieve the poverty reduction until the production level is increased. The major constraint in increasing the production in backyard birds is microbial infection due to lack of biosecurity knowledge among the farmers. The mitigation of the microbial infection depends on the detection of the infection route and its prevention. The source of microbial infection (Salmonella, Escherichia coli) and their dissemination through the eggs in backyard flocks kept in different agroclimatic zones of West Bengal, a major egg producing state in India, was identified. The pattern of virulence gene specially associated with urina...","The two largest Brazilian cities, Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo, have declared community transmission of COVID-19 on mid March, 2020. In this study we estimated the most vulnerable areas in Brazil for COVID-19, both in terms of risk of introduction and risk of mortality associated with social vulnerability. We explore the most likely routes of spread through the country, from the already exposed cities, according to human mobility statistics. The resulting maps should help authorities in their efforts to prioritize actions and if resource allocation to mitigate the effects of the pandemic.","Abstract Bacterial pneumonia caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and Klebsiella pneumoniae represents a frequent cause of mortality worldwide. The increased incidence of pneumococcal diseases in both developed and developing countries is alarmingly high, affecting infants and aged adult populations. The growing rate of antibiotic resistance and biofilm formation on medical device surfaces poses a greater challenge for treating respiratory infections. Over recent years, a better understanding of bacterial growth, metabolism, and virulence has offered several potential targets for developing therapeutics against bacterial pneumonia. This chapter will discuss the current and developing trends in treating bacterial pneumonia.","","The need to protect public health during the current COVID-19 pandemic has necessitated conference cancellations on an unprecedented scale. As the scientific community adapts to new working conditions, it is important to recognize that some of our actions may disproportionately affect early-career researchers and scientists from countries with limited research funding. We encourage all conference organizers, funders and institutions who are able to do so to consider how they can mitigate the unintended consequences of conference and travel cancellations and we provide seven recommendations for how this could be achieved. The proposed solutions may also offer long-term benefits for those who normally cannot attend conferences, and thus lead to a more equitable future for generations of researchers.","With the expanding use of molecular assays, viral pathogens are increasingly recognized among critically ill adult patients with community-acquired severe respiratory illness; studies have detected respiratory viral infections (RVIs) in 17\u201353% of such patients. In addition, novel pathogens including zoonotic coronaviruses like the agents causing Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019 nCoV) are still being identified. Patients with severe RVIs requiring ICU care present typically with hypoxemic respiratory failure. Oseltamivir is the most widely used neuraminidase inhibitor for treatment of influenza; data suggest that early use is associated with reduced mortality in critically ill patients with influenza. At present, there are no antiviral therapies of proven efficacy for other severe RVIs. Several adjunctive pharmacologic interventions have been studied for their immunomodulatory effects, including macrol...","","","Abstract Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), a novel human coronavirus that caused outbreaks of a SARS-like illness in the Middle East, is now considered a threat to global public health. This review discusses the challenges in identifying the source of this fatal virus and developing effective and safe anti-MERS-CoV vaccines and therapeutics in order to control its spread and to combat any future pandemic.","Severe acute respiratory syndrome Covid-19 (SARS-CoV-2) has been declared a worldwide emergency and a pandemic disease by the World Health Organisation (WHO). It started in China in December 2019, and it is currently rapidly spreading throughout Italy, which is now the most affected country after China. There is great attention for the diffusion and evolution of the CoVid-19 infection which started from the north (particularly in the Lombardia region) and it is now rapidly affecting other Italian regions. We investigate on the impact of patients hospitalisation in Intensive Care Units (ICUs) at a regional and subregional granularity. We propose a model derived from well-known models in epidemic to estimate the needed number of places in intensive care units. The model will help decision-makers to plan resources in the short and medium-term in order to guarantee appropriate treatments to all patients needing it. We analyse Italian data at regional level up to March 15th aiming to: (i) s...","Given the scale of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the need for reliable, scalable testing, and the likelihood of reagent shortages, especially in resource-poor settings, we have developed a RT-qPCR assay that relies on an alternative to conventional viral reverse transcriptases, a thermostable reverse transcriptase / DNA polymerase (RTX)1. Here we show that RTX performs comparably to the other assays sanctioned by the CDC and validated in kit format. We demonstrate two modes of RTX use - (i) dye-based RT-qPCR assays that require only RTX polymerase, and (ii) TaqMan RT-qPCR assays that use a combination of RTX and Taq DNA polymerases (as the RTX exonuclease does not degrade a TaqMan probe). We also provide straightforward recipes for the purification of this alternative reagent. We anticipate that in low resource or point-of-need settings researchers could obtain the available constructs from Addgene or our lab and begin to develop their own assays, within whatever regulatory framework ...","Exotic and emerging viral pathogens associated with high morbidity and mortality in humans are being identified annually with recent examples including Lujo virus in southern Africa, Severe Fever with Thrombocytopenia Syndrome virus in China and a SARS-like coronavirus in the Middle East. The sporadic nature of these infections hampers our understanding of these diseases and limits the opportunities to design appropriate medical countermeasures against them. Because of this, animal models are utilized to gain insight into the pathogenesis of disease with the overall goal of identifying potential targets for intervention and evaluating specific therapeutics and vaccines. For these reasons it is imperative that animal models of disease recapitulate the human condition as closely as possible in order to provide the best predictive data with respect to the potential efficacy in humans. In this article we review the current status of disease models for highly pathogenic and emerging viral p...","Cases of a novel coronavirus were first reported in Wuhan, Hubei province, China, in December 2019 and have since spread across the world. Epidemiological studies have indicated human-to-human transmission in China and elsewhere. To aid the analysis and tracking of the COVID-19 epidemic we collected and curated individual-level data from national, provincial, and municipal health reports, as well as additional information from online reports. All data are geo-coded and, where available, include symptoms, key dates (date of onset, admission, and confirmation), and travel history. The generation of detailed, real-time, and robust data for emerging disease outbreaks is important and can help to generate robust evidence that will support and inform public health decision making.","ABSTRACT This consensus document has been drawn up by the Techniques and Transplantation and Nursing areas of the Spanish Society of Pulmonology and Thoracic Surgery (SEPAR) and the Spanish Society of Respiratory Endoscopy (AEER) with the aim of providing information on the safe and effective use of bronchoscopy in patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 infection. Our priority is to ensure the safety of our patients, the health workers caring for them, and the community in general.At this stage in the pandemic, our information on the use of bronchoscopy in patients of this type is based on the experience of hospitals in other countries, and scientific publications are scarce. The objective of this document is to compile these experiences, based on recommendations from official agencies, in a document offering guidance in daily clinical practice.","Abstract RNA viruses are a significant source of morbidity and mortality in humans every year. Additionally, the potential use of these viruses in acts of bioterrorism poses a threat to national security. Given the paucity of vaccines or postexposure therapeutics for many highly pathogenic RNA viruses, novel treatments are badly needed. Sequence-based drug design, under development for almost 20 years, is proving effective in animal models and has moved into clinical trials. Important advances in the field include the characterization of RNA interference in mammalian cells and chemical modifications that can dramatically increase the in vivo stability of therapeutic oligonucleotides. Antisense strategies utilize single-stranded DNA oligonucleotides that inhibit protein production by mediating the catalytic degradation of target mRNA, or by binding to sites on mRNA essential for translation. Double-stranded RNA oligonucleotides, known as short-interfering RNAs (siRNAs), also mediate the...","Abstract Background An ongoing epidemic of respiratory diseases caused by a novel coronavirus (COVID 2019, SARS-CoV2) started in Wuhan, Hubei, in China at the end of December 2019. The French government decided to repatriate the 337 French nationals living in Wuhan and place them in quarantine in their home country. We decided to test them all for SARS-Cov2 twice in order to reduce anxiety among the population and decision-makers. Methods We investigated the presence of SARS-CoV-19 in asymptomatic carriers by testing all repatriated patients within the first 24 h of their arrival in France and at day 5. Viral RNA was extracted from pooled nasal and oropharyngeal swab fluids or sputum in the absence of nasal/oropharyngeal swabs. Detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA was then carried out using several real-time reverse transcription (RT)-PCR assays. Results We tested 337 passengers at day 0 and day 5. All the tests for SARS-CoV2 were negative. By optimising the sampling process, sending samples se...","Models that enable the continent to better allocate scarce resources to better prepare and respond to the COVID-19 epidemic are crucial. The modelling study by Marius Gilbert and colleagues in The Lancet identifies each African country's risk of importation of COVID-19 from China, using data on the volume of air travel from three airports in provinces in China to African countries. Gilbert and colleagues use two indicators to determine the capacity of countries to detect and respond to cases: preparedness, using the WHO International Health Regulations Monitoring and Evaluation Framework; and vulnerability, using the Infectious Disease Vulnerability Index. Based on their analysis, Egypt, Algeria, and South Africa had the highest importation risk, and a moderate to high capacity to respond to outbreaks. Nigeria, Ethiopia, Sudan, Angola, Tanzania, Ghana, and Kenya had moderate risk with variable capacity and high vulnerability. In the model, the risk mainly originates from Guangdong, Fuj...","Abstract A diet containing high levels of fruit has been associated with a lowered risk of chronic diseases as, in addition to their vitamin and mineral content, they also contain various compounds with health-protective effects, in particular antioxidant and antiinflammatory compounds. Wild plant species are of interest to the food industry because of their ability to replace synthetic chemicals and nutraceuticals; however, the nutritional, economical, and sociocultural values of some neglected and underutilized natural resources have not yet been fully exploited. Some of these less well-known and underutilized fruits, which have the potential to provide novel sources of health-promoting agents, are presented in this chapter (i.e., Asimina triloba (L.) Dunal, Crataegus azarolus L., Lycium barbarum L., Morus nigra L., and Amelanchier canadensis (L.) Medicus). Underutilized fruits could represent an opportunity for growers to gain access to these special markets where consumers place em...","Social distancing is an effective way to contain the spread of a contagious disease, particularly when pharmacological interventions are not available. Conventional wisdom suggests that social distancing measures should be introduced as soon as possible after the beginning of an outbreak. Using a simple epidemiological model we show, however, that there is in fact an optimal time to initiate a temporal social distancing intervention if the goal is to reduce the final epidemic size or flatten the epidemic curve. The optimal timing depends strongly on the effective reproduction number (R0) of the disease, such that as the R0 increases, the optimal time decreases non-linearly. Additionally, if pharmacological interventions (e.g., a vaccine) become available at some point during the epidemic, the sooner these interventions become available the sooner social distancing should be initiated to maximize its effectiveness. Although based on a simple model, we hope that these insights inspire fu...","These first UK cases of COVID-19 raise important points about the management of cases of HCID in England. The decision to test for SARS-CoV-2 is based on a clinical and epidemiological case definition, and testing is only approved if this is met. When tested, neither of these people clearly met the current case definition, and had criteria been strictly applied, testing might not have been done. A decision to test was made because of high clinical suspicion and in response to latest available information about the distribution of infection. It is important that testing is appropriately targeted, and this is best done by applying clear case definitions. However, with any newly emerging infection, case definitions must evolve rapidly as information accrues. There should also be room for flexibility on the basis of discussion with clinical and public health experts","Abstract An important effort has been performed after the emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic in 2003 to diagnose and prevent virus spreading. Several types of vaccines have been developed including inactivated viruses, subunit vaccines, virus-like particles (VLPs), DNA vaccines, heterologous expression systems, and vaccines derived from SARS-CoV genome by reverse genetics. This review describes several aspects essential to develop SARS-CoV vaccines, such as the correlates of protection, virus serotypes, vaccination side effects, and bio-safeguards that can be engineered into recombinant vaccine approaches based on the SARS-CoV genome. The production of effective and safe vaccines to prevent SARS has led to the development of promising vaccine candidates, in contrast to the design of vaccines for other coronaviruses, that in general has been less successful. After preclinical trials in animal models, efficacy and safety evaluation of the most promising vaccin...","COVID-19 is now a pandemic and many of the affected countries face severe shortages of hospital resources. In Brazil, the first case was reported on February 26. As the number of cases grows in the country, there is a concern that the health system may become overwhelmed, resulting in shortages of hospital beds, intensive care unit beds, and mechanical ventilators. The timing of shortage is likely to vary geographically depending on the observed onset and pace of transmission observed, on the availability of resources, and on the actions implemented. Here we consider the daily number of cases reported in municipalities in Brazil to simulate twelve alternative scenarios of the likely timing of shortage, based on parameters consistently reported for China and Italy, on rates of hospital occupancy for other health conditions observed in Brazil in 2019, and on assumptions of allocation of patients in public and private facilities. Results show that hospital services could start to experien...","Abstract The World Health Organisation has declared a pandemic caused by the newly discovered SARS-CoV-2. Due to growing demand for reagents used for SARS-CoV-2 RNA extraction for subsequent molecular diagnostics, there is a worldwide risk of kit- and/or reagent-shortages for extraction. With a detection sensitivity of 97.4% (95% CI=86.2-99.9%), we describe a simple, fast, alternative workflow for molecular detection of SARS-CoV-2, where samples are simply heat-processed for 5 minutes at 98\u00b0C prior to the RT-qPCR reaction.","With the worldwide outbreak of COVID-19, an accurate model to predict how the coronavirus pandemic will evolve becomes important and urgent to help policy makers in different countries address the epidemic outbreak and determine policies to control spread more efficiently and effectively. Unlike the classic public health and virus propagation models, this new projection model takes government intervention and public response into account to make reliable projections of the outbreak 10 days to 2 weeks in advance.","Emergence of new viral diseases is linked to mutation or recombination events. The likelihood of cross-species transmission is related to phenotypic plasticity of a virus and its capacity to produce genetically variable progeny. Herein a model is described connecting the production of genetic variability with increasing genome size. Comparing all known zoonotic viral genome sizes to known non-zoonotic viral genome sizes demonstrates that zoonotic viruses have significantly larger genomes. These results support the notion that large viral genomes are important in producing new zoonotic disease, and suggest that genome size may be a useful surrogate in screening for potential zoonotic viruses.","","Abstract The aim of this chapter is to describe the animal models generated by transgenic technology for the functional analysis of the protective axis of the renin\u2013angiotensin system, consisting of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), angiotensin (Ang)-(1-7), and Mas. Transgenic overexpression of the components of this axis in general led to an ameliorated cardiac and vascular damage in disease states and to an improved metabolic profile. Knockout models for ACE2 and Mas, however, show aggravated cardiovascular pathologies and a metabolic syndrome-like state. In particular, the local production of Ang-(1-7) in the vascular wall, in the heart, and in the brain was found to be of high physiological relevance by the use of transgenic animals overexpressing ACE2 or Ang-(1-7) in these tissues.","Summary Children are susceptible to infection by SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) but the clinical picture of SARS is milder than in adults. Teenagers resemble adults in presentation and disease progression and may develop severe illness requiring intensive care and assisted ventilation. Fever, malaise, cough, coryza, chills or rigor, sputum production, headache, myalgia, leucopaenia, lymphopaenia, thrombocytopaenia, mildly prolonged activated partial thromboplastin times and elevated lactate dehydrogenase levels are common presenting features. Radiographic findings are non-specific but high-resolution computed tomography of the thorax in clinically suspected cases may be an early diagnostic aid when initial chest radiographs appear normal. The improved reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays are critical in the early diagnosis of SARS, with sensitivity approaching 80% in the first 3 days of illness when performed on nasopharyngeal aspirates, the preferred...","This study shows that the disease free equilibrium (E_0 ) for COVID-19 coronavirus does not satisfy the criteria for a locally or globally asymptotic stability. This implies that as a pandemic as declared by WHO (2020) the COVID-19 coronavirus does not have a curative vaccine yet and precautionary measures are advised through quarantine and observatory procedures. Also, the Basic Reproductive number (R_0&lt;1) by Equation (33) shows that there is a chance of decline of secondary infections when the ratio between the incidence rate in the population and the total number of infected population quarantined with observatory procedure. The effort to evaluate the disease equilibrium shows that unless there is a dedicated effort from government, decision makers and stakeholders, the world would hardly be reed of the COVID-19 coronavirus and further spread is eminent and the rate of infection will continue to increase despite the increased rate of recovery because of the absence of vaccine at the...","Introduction: The highly pathogenic coronaviruses severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) are lethal zoonotic viruses that have emerged into human populations these past 15 years. These coronaviruses are associated with novel respiratory syndromes that spread from person-to-person via close contact, resulting in high morbidity and mortality caused by the progression to Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). Areas covered: The risks of re-emergence of SARS-CoV from bat reservoir hosts, the persistence of MERS-CoV circulation, and the potential for future emergence of novel coronaviruses indicate antiviral drug discovery will require activity against multiple coronaviruses. In this review, approaches that antagonize viral nonstructural proteins, neutralize structural proteins, or modulate essential host elements of viral infection with varying levels of efficacy in models of highly pathogenic coronavirus di...","Abstract Children are seeing rapid changes to their routines and facing an unpredictable future. Palliative care teams may consider expanding their communication training and skillsets to help families consider caring ways to communicate with their children and grandchildren about the coronavirus. Palliative care teams are wise to encourage families to ground their communication with children on key values: honesty and trust, self-compassion, safety, sensitivity, connection, preparedness, community-building, recognition of death as a part of the lifecycle, and legacy.","Objective To provide an overview of supply and demand issues in the vaccine industry and the policy options that have been implemented to resolve these issues. Data sources Medline, Policy File, and International Pharmaceutical Abstracts were searched to locate academic journal articles. Other sources reviewed included texts on the topics of vaccine history and policy, government agency reports, and reports from independent think tanks. Keywords included vaccines, immunizations, supply, demand, and policy. Study selection Search criteria were limited to English language and human studies. Articles pertaining to vaccine demand, supply, and public policy were selected and reviewed for inclusion. Data extraction By the authors. Data synthesis Vaccines are biologic medications, therefore making their development and production more difficult and costly compared with \u201csmall-molecule\u201d drugs. Research and development costs for vaccines can exceed $800 million, and development may require 10 y...","Background: The first outbreaks of COVID-19 in Italy occurred during the second half of February 2020 in some areas in the North of the country. Due to the high contagiousness of the infection, further spread by asymptomatic people, Italy has become in a few weeks the country with the greatest number of infected people after China. The large number of severe cases among infected people in Italy led to the hospitalization of thousands of patients, with a heavy burden on the National Health Service. Methods: We analyzed data provided daily by Italian Authorities for the period from 24 February 2020 to 26 March 2020. Considering such information, we developed a forecast model in real-time, based on the cumulative logistic distribution. We then produced an estimate of the overall number of potentially infected individuals and epidemic duration at a national and Regional level, for the most affected Regions. Results: We reported the daily distribution of performed swabs and confirmed cases,...","Background Similar to outbreaks of many other infectious diseases, success in controlling the novel 2019 coronavirus infection requires a timely and accurate monitoring of the epidemic, particularly during its early period with rather limited data while the need for information increases explosively. Methods In this study, we used a second derivative model to characterize the coronavirus epidemic in China with cumulatively diagnosed cases during the first 2 months. The analysis was further enhanced by an exponential model with a close-population assumption. This model was built with the data and used to assess the detection rate during the study period, considering the differences between the true infections, detectable and detected cases. Results Results from the second derivative modeling suggest the coronavirus epidemic as nonlinear and chaotic in nature. Although it emerged gradually, the epidemic was highly responsive to massive interventions initiated on January 21, 2020, as indi...","Abstract Post-transcriptional gene silencing (PTGS) makes possible new approaches for studying the various steps of the viral cycle. Plus-strand RNA viruses appear to be attractive targets for small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), as their genome functions as both mRNA and replication template. PTGS creates an alternative to classic reverse genetics for viruses with either negative-strand or double-stranded RNA genomes and for those with a large genome. PTGS allows modification of the expression of a given cellular gene as a means to elucidate its role in the viral cycle and in virus\u2013host cell interactions, and to investigate cellular pathways involved in viral pathogenesis. It also allows the creation of new animal models of human diseases. In addition, PTGS already appears to be a promising new therapeutic tool to fight viral multiplication and dissemination through the host and to prevent inflammation and virus-induced pathogenesis, including virus-induced tumorigenesis.","AbstractRapid production and publication of pathogen genome sequences during emerging disease outbreaks provide crucial public health information. In resource-limited settings, especially near an outbreak epicenter, conventional deep sequencing or bioinformatics are often challenging. Here we successfully used metagenomic next generation sequencing on an iSeq100 Illumina platform paired with an open-source bioinformatics pipeline to quickly characterize Cambodia\u2019s first case of COVID-2019.","","","Abstract Concept of \u201crisk analysis\u201d in food safety management needs to be understood to assess, manage, and communicate risks for proper implementation of food safety policies, food laws, and standards, in a country. Science-based approaches, which are an integral part of risk analysis to improve modern food safety systems, are intimately linked to processes such as good quality practices. Risk analysis strengthens the ability of traditional food safety systems to meet current challenges. Risk analysis is just one part of an effective food safety system. Other components of food safety system like food safety policies, food legislation, food inspection, laboratory analysis, epidemiological surveillance of food-borne diseases, monitoring systems for chemical and microbiological contamination in foods, and information, education and communication, also need to be improved continuously. \u201cFood safety controls\u201d are now being replaced by \u201crisk-based controls\u201d in all stages of food production...","The past century witnessed a rapid development of respiratory medicine in China. The major burden of respiratory disease has shifted from infectious diseases to chronic noninfectious diseases. Great achievements have been made in improving the national standard of clinical management of various respiratory diseases and in smoking control. The specialty of respiratory medicine is expanding into pulmonary and critical care medicine. Nevertheless, respiratory diseases remain a major public health problem, with new challenges such as air pollution and nosocomial infections. This review describes the history, accomplishments, new challenges, and opportunities in respiratory medicine in China.","Publisher Summary Kawasaki disease (KD) is an acute febrile systemic vasculitis usually occurring in children younger than five years, and rarely reported in neonates and adults. This chapter discusses the epidemiology, etiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and treatments of KD. The etiology still remains unknown, although epidemiological and clinical features strongly suggest an infectious cause. Immunological abnormalities in the acute phase of the disease reflect activation of immune system and marked production of cytokines by activated cells. KD has some similarities to toxin-mediated diseases, both from a clinical and an immunological point of view. The role of one or more superantigens competent of stimulating large numbers of T cells produced by certain strains of Staphylococcus or Streptococcus is discussed in the chapter, in the context of the etiology of KD. Atypical cases are those with fever, acute surgical symptoms, or neurological manifestations as presenting ...","Policies and public health efforts have not addressed the gendered impacts of disease outbreaks.1 The response to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) appears no different. We are not aware of any gender analysis of the outbreak by global health institutions or governments in affected countries or in preparedness phases. Recognising the extent to which disease outbreaks affect women and men differently is a fundamental step to understanding the primary and secondary effects of a health emergency on different individuals and communities, and for creating effective, equitable policies and interventions. Although sex-disaggregated data for COVID-19 show equal numbers of cases between men and women so far, there seem to be sex differences in mortality and vulnerability to the disease.2 Emerging evidence suggests that more men than women are dying, potentially due to sex-based immunological3 or gendered differences, such as patterns and prevalence of smoking.4 However, current sex-disaggrega..."],"title":["Telemedicine in the Time of Coronavirus","New Vaccine Technologies to Combat Outbreak Situations","A framework for identifying regional outbreak and spread of COVID-19 from one-minute population-wide surveys","Human monoclonal antibodies as candidate therapeutics against emerging viruses","How health anxiety influences responses to viral outbreaks like COVID-19: What all decision-makers, health authorities, and health care professionals need to know","Crystal structure of Nsp15 endoribonuclease NendoU from SARS-CoV-2","A model to forecast regional demand for COVID-19 related hospital beds","Need for integrative thinking to fight against emerging infectious diseases.
