and (2) to use these specifications as input to the construction of a system intended to meet these requirements. An important goal was to provide information about the diffusion of a communicable disease without being dependent on centralised storage of information about individual patients or revealing patient-identifiable information. Methods The method applied is rooted in the engineering paradigm involving phases of analysis, system specification, design, implementation, and testing. The requirements were established from earlier projects\u2019 conclusions and analysis of disease outbreaks. The requirements were validated by a literature study of syndromic and disease surveillance systems. The system was teste...","Abstract The paper presents a novel, n-gram-based method for analysis of bacterial genome segments known as genomic islands (GIs). Identification of GIs in bacterial genomes is an important task since many of them represent inserts that may contribute to bacterial evolution and pathogenesis. In order to characterize and distinguish GIs from rest of the genome, binary classification of islands based on n-gram frequency distribution have been performed. It consists of testing the agreement of islands n-gram frequency distributions with the complete genome and backbone sequence. In addition, a statistic based on the maximal order Markov model is used to identify significantly overrepresented and underrepresented n-grams in islands. The results may be used as a basis for Zipf-like analysis suggesting that some of the n-grams are overrepresented in a subset of islands and underrepresented in the backbone, or vice versa, thus complementing the binary classification. The method is applied to ...","The 2019-nCov will not be the last epidemic to challenge public health experts. The growth of AI-driven techniques to identify epidemiologic risks early will be key to our improvement of prediction, prevention, and detection of future global health risks. The devastating situation in Wuhan, China and future epidemics will also find value in ongoing research in 2019-nCov case detection, spread prediction, treatment effectiveness, and containment. The wide variety, velocity, and veracity of data now available in crises yield data sets that many researchers will now need to incorporate into evermore complex models. This requires expansion of talent within AI for healthcare applications. AI is no longer a niche research area nor is it a tool for the most advanced healthcare systems only, its global impact on healthcare is real and its potential to save lives in this epidemic as well as future epidemics should not be underestimated. It is critical to the global health of all humankind for t...","Abstract Health planning and policy seek to create a group of mutually interacting bodies to produce goods and services to meet the health needs of a population. Recent developments in the health status of the population are characterized by continuous improvement in life expectancy, chronic diseases which absorb 90% of total health care expenditure, differences in the causes of mortality (more than 70% mortality from cancer, heart and brain, and external causes). The new trends in health indicators define the current health policies and lead to the necessity of adapting the health system so as to meet the changing health needs of the population. Especially in the context of the changes in the epidemiological spectrum and the variability in the indices of morbidity and mortality, the focus is not only to further prolong life expectancy but also to improve life expectancy without chronic diseases and without disabilities and to reduce the avoidable mortality, the potential years of life...","Individual quarantine and active monitoring of contacts are core disease control strategies, particularly for emerging infectious diseases such as Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). To estimate the comparative efficacy of these interventions to control COVID-19, we fit a stochastic branching model, comparing two sets of reported parameters for the dynamics of the disease. Our results suggest that individual quarantine may contain an outbreak of COVID-19 with a short serial interval (4.8 days) only in settings with high intervention performance where at least three-quarters of infected contacts are individually quarantined. However, in settings where this performance is unrealistically high and the outbreak of COVID-19 continues to grow, so too will the burden of the number of contacts traced for active monitoring or quarantine. In such circumstances where resources are prioritized for scalable interventions such as social distancing, we show active monitoring or individual quarantine...","Infections with 2019-nCoV can spread from person to person, and in the earliest phase of the outbreak the basic reproductive number was estimated to be around 2.2, assuming a mean serial interval of 7.5 days [2]. The serial interval was not precisely estimated, and a potentially shorter mean serial interval would have corresponded to a slightly lower basic reproductive number. Control measures and changes in population behaviour later in January should have reduced the effective reproductive number. However, it is too early to estimate whether the effective reproductive number has been reduced to below the critical threshold of 1 because cases currently being detected and reported would have mostly been infected in mid- to late-January. Average delays between infection and illness onset have been estimated at around 5\u20136 days, with an upper limit of around 11-14 days [2,5], and delays from illness onset to laboratory confirmation added a further 10 days on average [2].","Summary The Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is a lethal zoonotic pathogen that was first identified in humans in Saudi Arabia and Jordan in 2012. Intermittent sporadic cases, community clusters, and nosocomial outbreaks of MERS-CoV continue to occur. Between April 2012 and December 2019, 2499 laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection, including 858 deaths (34\u00b73% mortality) were reported from 27 countries to WHO, the majority of which were reported by Saudi Arabia (2106 cases, 780 deaths). Large outbreaks of human-to-human transmission have occurred, the largest in Riyadh and Jeddah in 2014 and in South Korea in 2015. MERS-CoV remains a high-threat pathogen identified by WHO as a priority pathogen because it causes severe disease that has a high mortality rate, epidemic potential, and no medical countermeasures. This Seminar provides an update on the current knowledge and perspectives on MERS epidemiology, virology, mode of transmission, pathogenesis, diag...","After the spread of SARS-CoV-2 epidemic out of China, evolution in the pandemic worldwide shows dramatic differences among countries. In Europe, the situation of Italy first and later Spain has generated great concern, and despite other countries show better prospects, large uncertainties yet remain on the future evolution and the efficacy of containment, mitigation or attack strategies. Here we applied a modified SEIR compartmental model accounting for the spread of infection during the latent period, in which we also incorporate effects of varying proportions of containment. We fit data to quarantined populations in order to account for the uncertainties in case reporting and study the scenario projections for the 17 individual regions (CCAA). Results indicate that with data for March 23, the epidemics follows an evolution similar to the isolation of 1.5 percent of the population and if there were no effects of intervention actions it might reach a maximum over 1.4M infected around A...","The impact of COVID-19 pandemic on the global health and world's economy have been profound and unseen since the Spanish flu of 1918-19. As of now, many countries have been severely affected, partly because of slow responses to the crisis, ill-preparedness of their health system, and the fragile health infrastructure and the shortage of protective equipment. This note evaluates various scenarios, based on an estimation of number of identified and unidentified infected cases, and examines the effectiveness of different policy responses to contain this pandemic. Our result, based on an estimation of the model for Iran, show that in many instances the number of unidentified cases, including asymptomatic individuals, could be much bigger than the reported numbers. The results confirm that in such circumstances, social distancing alone cannot be an effective policy unless a large portion of the population confine themselves for an extended period of time, which is not only difficult to impl...","Abstract Background The current 2019 novel coronavirus outbreak is rapidly evolving. YouTube has been recognized as a popular source of information in previous disease outbreaks. We analyzed the content on YouTube about n-CoV in English and Mandarin languages. Methods YouTube was searched using the terms \u20182019 novel coronavirus\u2019, \u2018Wuhan virus\u2019 and \u2018\u6b66\u6c49\u75c5\u6bd2\u2019 (Mandarin for Wuhan virus) on 1st and 2nd February 2020. First 50 videos in each group were analyzed. Videos in other languages, duplicate videos, those without an audio and duration &gt;15 min were excluded .72 videos in English and 42 in Mandarin were reviewed. 2 reviewers classified the videos as useful, misleading or news based on pre specified criterion. Inter-observer agreement was evaluated with kappa coefficient. Modified DISCERN index for reliability and medical information and content index (MICI) score were used for content analysis. Results These videos attracted cumulative 21,288,856 views. 67% of English and 50% Mandarin vid...","BACKGROUND: The SARS outbreak of 2002\u20132003 presented clinicians with a new, life-threatening disease for which they had no experience in treating and no research on the effectiveness of treatment options. The World Health Organization (WHO) expert panel on SARS treatment requested a systematic review and comprehensive summary of treatments used for SARS-infected patients in order to guide future treatment and identify priorities for research. METHODS AND FINDINGS: In response to the WHO request we conducted a systematic review of the published literature on ribavirin, corticosteroids, lopinavir and ritonavir (LPV/r), type I interferon (IFN), intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), and SARS convalescent plasma from both in vitro studies and in SARS patients. We also searched for clinical trial evidence of treatment for acute respiratory distress syndrome. Sources of data were the literature databases MEDLINE, EMBASE, BIOSIS, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) up...","Global airline networks play a key role in the global importation of emerging infectious diseases. Detailed information on air traffic between international airports has been demonstrated to be useful in retrospectively validating and prospectively predicting case emergence in other countries. In this paper, we use a well-established metric known as effective distance on the global air traffic data from IATA to quantify risk of emergence for different countries as a consequence of direct importation from China, and compare it against arrival times for the first 24 countries. Using this model trained on official first reports from WHO, we estimate time of arrival (ToA) for all other countries. We then incorporate data on airline suspensions to recompute the effective distance and assess the effect of such cancellations in delaying the estimated arrival time for all other countries. Finally we use the infectious disease vulnerability indices to explain some of the estimated reporting del...","Respiratory viruses have emerged and re-emerged in humans for hundreds of years. In the recent past avian and animal influenza viruses have caused human disease ranging from conjunctivitis to respiratory illnesses, including the 2009\u201310 A(H1N1)pdm09 pandemic. Coronaviruses, human metapneumovirus (hMPV) and enteroviruses have also impacted humans globally. Since the likely public health impacts are common, plans and policies for intervention strategies can be developed, encompassing early detection through surveillance and diagnostics, as well as treatment and prevention through clinical and non-clinical interventions. The global comprehensiveness of these varies according to differing resources, competing health priorities and the causative agent, yet, irrespective of this, activities must be proportional to the threat. Pandemics and severe epidemics enable policies to be tested and gaps identified.","In an era of global health threats caused by epidemics of infectious diseases and rising multidrug resistance, microbiology laboratories provide essential scientific evidence for risk assessment, prevention, and control. Microbiology has been at the core of European infectious disease surveillance networks for decades. Since 2010, these networks have been coordinated by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC). Activities delivered in these networks include harmonization of laboratory diagnostic, antimicrobial susceptibility and molecular typing methods, multicentre method validation, technical capacity mapping, training of laboratory staff, and continuing quality assessment of laboratory testing. Cooperation among the European laboratory networks in the past 7 years has proved successful in strengthening epidemic preparedness by enabling adaptive capabilities for rapid detection of emerging pathogens across Europe. In partnership with food safety authorities, inte...","Background: COVID-19 could have even more dire consequences among refugees living in camps than in general populations. Bangladesh has confirmed COVID-19 cases and hosts almost 1 million Rohingya refugees from Myanmar with 600,000 concentrated in Kutupalong-Balukhali Expansion Site. Projections of the potential COVID-19 infection burden, epidemic speed, and healthcare needs in such settings are critical to inform preparedness planning. Methods: To explore the potential impact of the introduction of SARS-CoV-2 in Kutupalong-Balukhali Expansion Site, we used a stochastic disease transmission model with parameters derived from emerging literature. We considered three scenarios with different assumptions about the transmission potential of SARS-CoV-2. We estimated the number and daily rate of infections, hospitalizations, deaths, and healthcare needs expected under each scenario. Findings: A large-scale outbreak is highly likely after a single introduction of the virus into the camp across...","Abstract Concept of \u201crisk analysis\u201d in food safety management needs to be understood to assess, manage, and communicate risks for proper implementation of food safety policies, food laws, and standards, in a country. Science-based approaches, which are an integral part of risk analysis to improve modern food safety systems, are intimately linked to processes such as good quality practices. Risk analysis strengthens the ability of traditional food safety systems to meet current challenges. Risk analysis is just one part of an effective food safety system. Other components of food safety system like food safety policies, food legislation, food inspection, laboratory analysis, epidemiological surveillance of food-borne diseases, monitoring systems for chemical and microbiological contamination in foods, and information, education and communication, also need to be improved continuously. \u201cFood safety controls\u201d are now being replaced by \u201crisk-based controls\u201d in all stages of food production...","Aims: Temperature screening is important in the population during the outbreak of 2019 Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19). This study aimed to compare the accuracy and precision of wrist and forehead temperature with tympanic temperature under different circumstances. Methods: We performed a prospective observational study in a real-life population. We consecutively collected wrist and forehead temperatures in Celsius (C) using a non-contact infrared thermometer (NCIT). We also measured the tympanic temperature using a tympanic thermometers (IRTT) and defined fever as a tympanic temperature \u226537.3C. Results: We enrolled a total of 528 participants including 261 indoor and 267 outdoor participants. We divided outdoor participants into four types according to their means of transportation to the hospital as walk, bicycle, electric vehicle, car, and inside the car. Under different circumstance, the mean difference ranged from -1.72 to -0.56C in different groups for the forehead measurements, and...","Abstract INDIA- As for reported in 360 COVID-19 cases (till March 22, 2020), seven people were died, and 23 people were treated successfully.1 This virus can easily affect who having respiratory problem and especially who all have been aged older than sixty. Most of the affected peoples had reached India from different part of the world, as like of carrier. Owing to this, India made several precautionary measures to mitigate/neglect the disease in beginning stage, however, the denser population of country will not be simple to control the same for long time (community spread), if government will not incorporate the visionary strategies. Since attacked several nations have been worried mostly for their people life (health), despite that developing country like India with huge population should consider about the livelihood (for Below Poverty Line (BPL) people), equally with the life. This article will give insights to make effective strategy to culminate the world threat COVID-19 in Ind...","We develop a health informatics toolbox that enables public health workers to timely analyze and evaluate the time-course dynamics of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) infection using the public available data from the China CDC. This toolbox is built upon a hierarchical epidemiological model in which two observed time series of daily proportions of infected and removed cases are emitted from the underlying infection dynamics governed by a Markov SIR infectious disease process. We extend the SIR model to incorporate various types of time-varying quarantine protocols, including government-level macro isolation policies and community-level micro inspection measures. We develop a calibration procedure for under-reported infected cases. This toolbox provides forecast, in both online and offline forms, of turning points of interest, including the time when daily infected proportion becomes smaller than the previous ones and the time when daily infected proportions becomes smaller than that o...","Summary Background Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) is a new human disease caused by a novel coronavirus (CoV). Clinical data on MERS-CoV infections are scarce. We report epidemiological, demographic, clinical, and laboratory characteristics of 47 cases of MERS-CoV infections, identify knowledge gaps, and define research priorities. Methods We abstracted and analysed epidemiological, demographic, clinical, and laboratory data from confirmed cases of sporadic, household, community, and health-care-associated MERS-CoV infections reported from Saudi Arabia between Sept 1, 2012, and June 15, 2013. Cases were confirmed as having MERS-CoV by real-time RT-PCR. Findings 47 individuals (46 adults, one child) with laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV disease were identified; 36 (77%) were male (male:female ratio 3\u00b73:1). 28 patients died, a 60% case-fatality rate. The case-fatality rate rose with increasing age. Only two of the 47 cases were previously healthy; most patients (45 [96%]) had underl...","Abstract Since the middle of December 2019, human-to-human transmission of novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP) has occurred among close contacts. At the same time, greater attention should be paid to psychological crisis intervention (PCI) among affected populations, for the timely prevention of inestimable damage from a secondary psychological crisis. PCI has been initiated via remote (telephone and internet) and onsite medical services to help medical workers, patients, and others affected to overcome any psychological difficulties. This paper outlines experiences based on the work of the Shanghai Medical Team.","Recent study reported in this journal that the threats of continuous evolution and dissemination of 2019 human coronaviruses.1 Since its emergence in December 2019, a \u201cseventh\u201d member of the family of 2019 human coronavirus named \u201cSARS-CoV-2\u201d was responsible for an outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in Wuhan, China.2 As of February 23, 2020, China had reported more than 77,042 confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2, with 2,445 fatalities and counting (http://www.nhc.gov.cn). Strikingly, SARS-CoV-2 had been transmitted rapidly in more than 29 countries to date (https://www.who.int), including Asia, Europe, North America, Africa, and Oceania, posing serious concerns about its pandemic potential. Despite of droplet and contact transmissions of SARS-CoV-2, recent studies demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 might be transmitted via aerosol and fecal\u2013oral routes 3 (Figure 1), which needs to be paid attention in particular.","Background: Since the new coronavirus epidemic in China in December 2019, information and discussions about COVID-19 have spread rapidly on the Internet and have quickly become the focus of worldwide attention, especially on social media. Objective: This study aims to investigate and analyze the public's attention to COVID-19-related events in China at the beginning of the COVID-19 epidemic in China (December 31, 2019, to February 20, 2020) through the Sina Microblog hot search list. Methods: We collected topics related to the COVID-19 epidemic on the Sina Microblog hot search list from December 31, 2019, to February 20, 2020 and described the trend of public attention on COVID-19 epidemic-related topics. ROST CM6.0 (ROST Content Mining System Version 6.0) was used to analyze the collected text for word segmentation, word frequency, and sentiment analysis. We further described the hot topic keywords and sentiment trends of public attention. We used VOSviewer to implement a visual clust...","Abstract The Covid-19 pandemic is changing the organization of healthcare and has a direct impact on digestive surgery. Healthcare priorities and circuits are being modified. Emergency surgery is still a priority. Functional surgery is to be deferred. Laparoscopic surgery must follow strict rules so as not to expose healthcare professionals (HCPs) to added risk. The question looms large in cancer surgery \u2013 go ahead or defer? There is probably an added risk due to the pandemic that must be balanced against the risk incurred by deferring surgery. For each type of cancer \u2013 colon, pancreas, oesogastric, hepatocellular carcinoma \u2013 morbidity and mortality rates are stated and compared with the oncological risk incurred by deferring surgery and/or the tumour doubling time. Strategies can be proposed based on this comparison. For colonic cancers T1-2, N0, it is advisable to defer surgery. For advanced colonic lesions, it seems judicious to undertake neoadjuvant chemotherapy and then wait. For ...","A pneumonia outbreak caused by a novel coronavirus (COVID-19) occurred in Wuhan, China at the end of 2019 and then spread rapidly to the whole country. A total of 81,021 laboratory-confirmed cases, including 3,194 deaths (3.9%) had been reported in China by March 14, 2020, meanwhile, 61,518 laboratory-confirmed cases and 2,199 deaths were reported outside China. Common symptoms of COVID-19 pneumonia included fever, fatigue and dry cough. Faced with such a sudden outbreak of new infectious diseases, we have no history to learn from and no evidence to count on. Traditional models often predict inconsistent results. Aiming at estimate the epidemic trend timely after the outbreak, we mainly used 7-day moving average of log-transformed daily new cases (LMA) to establish a new index named \"epidemic trend index\", which will be used to predict the evolutionary trend of the epidemic situation and support epidemic control decision making processes. We used SARS epidemic data from Hong Kong in 20...","Abstract Recent publications have brought attention to the possible benefit of chloroquine, a broadly used antimalarial drug, in the treatment of patients infected by the novel emerged coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2). The scientific community should consider this information in light of previous experiments with chloroquine in the field of antiviral research.","Coronaviruses (CoVs) have formerly been regarded as relatively harmless respiratory pathogens to humans. However, two outbreaks of severe respiratory tract infection, caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), as a result of zoonotic CoVs crossing the species barrier, caused high pathogenicity and mortality rates in human populations. This brought CoVs global attention and highlighted the importance of controlling infectious pathogens at international borders. In this review, we focus on our current understanding of the epidemiology, pathogenesis, prevention, and treatment of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, as well as provides details on the pivotal structure and function of the spike proteins (S proteins) on the surface of each of these viruses. For building up more suitable animal models, we compare the current animal models recapitulating pathogenesis and summarize the potential role of host receptor...","ABSTRACT Within weeks, COVID-19 has transformed our practice of palliative care and clinical medicine as we know it. Telemedicine has emerged as a critical technology to bring medical care to patients while attempting to reduce the transmission of COVID-19 among patients, families, and clinicians. It is also increasingly necessary to preserve scarce resources like personal protective equipment. In this article, we share just-in-time tips to support palliative care clinicians and program leaders in providing the best care possible by telemedicine. These quick, practical tips cover telemedicine set-up, patient considerations, and clinician considerations. Next steps include ensuring equitable access to affordable telemedicine technology for vulnerable populations through creative solutions and financing, and dedicated attention to telemedicine evaluation and quality improvement.","","","","In the wake of COVID-19 disease, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, we designed and developed a predictive model based on Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning algorithms to determine the health risk and predict the mortality risk of patients with COVID-19. In this study, we used documented data of 117,000 patients world-wide with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19. This study proposes an AI model to help hospitals and medical facilities decide who needs to get attention first, who has higher priority to be hospitalized, triage patients when the system is overwhelmed by overcrowding, and eliminate delays in providing the necessary care. The results demonstrate 93% overall accuracy in predicting the mortality rate. We used several machine learning algorithms including Support Vector Machine (SVM), Artificial Neural Networks, Random Forest, Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, and K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) to predict the mortality rate in patients with COVID-19. In this study, the most...","Abstract Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is caused by SARS-COV2 and represents the causative agent of a potentially fatal disease that is of great global public health concern. Based on the large number of infected people that were exposed to the wet animal market in Wuhan City, China, it is suggested that this is likely the zoonotic origin of COVID-19. Person-to-person transmission of COVID-19 infection led to the isolation of patients that were subsequently administered a variety of treatments. Extensive measures to reduce person-to-person transmission of COVID-19 have been implemented to control the current outbreak. Special attention and efforts to protect or reduce transmission should be applied in susceptible populations including children, health care providers, and elderly people. In this review, we highlights the symptoms, epidemiology, transmission, pathogenesis, phylogenetic analysis and future directions to control the spread of this fatal disease.","Since the first identification of the virus in 1971, the disease caused by canine coronavirus (CCoV) has not been adequately investigated, and the role that the virus plays in canine enteric illness has not been well established. Only after the emergence in 2002 of SARS in human has new attention been focused on coronaviruses. As a consequence of the relatively high mutation frequency of RNA-positive stranded viruses, CCoV has evolved and, with the biomolecular techniques developed over the last two decades, new virus strains, serotypes, and subtypes have been identified in infected dogs. Considering the widespread nature of CCoV infections among dog populations, several studies have been carried out, focusing upon the epidemiological relevance of these viruses and underlining the need for further investigation into the biology of CCoVs and into the pathogenetic role of the infections. This paper reports the evolutionary processes of CCoVs with a note onto recent diagnostic methods.","Abstract We argue that enhanced Traffic Control Bundling (eTCB) can interrupt the community-hospital-community transmission cycle, thereby limiting COVID-19\u2019s impact. Enhanced TCB is an expansion of the traditional TCB that proved highly effective during Taiwan\u2019s 2003 SARS outbreak. TCB\u2019s success derived from ensuring that Health Care Workers (HCWs) and patients were protected from fomite, contact and droplet transmission within hospitals. Although TCB proved successful during SARS, achieving a similar level of success with the COVID-19 outbreak requires adapting TCB to the unique manifestations of this new disease. These manifestations include asymptomatic infection, a hyper-affinity to ACE2 receptors resulting in high transmissibility, false negatives, and an incubation period of up to 22 days. Enhanced TCB incorporates the necessary adaptations. In particular, eTCB includes expanding the TCB transition zone to incorporate a new sector \u2013 the quarantine ward. This ward houses patients...","In December 2019, a new type viral pneumonia cases occurred in Wuhan, Hubei Province; and then named \u201c2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV)\u201d by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 12 January 2020. For it is a never been experienced respiratory disease before and with infection ability widely and quickly, it attracted the world\u2019s attention but without treatment and control manual. For the request from frontline clinicians and public health professionals of 2019-nCoV infected pneumonia management, an evidence-based guideline urgently needs to be developed. Therefore, we drafted this guideline according to the rapid advice guidelines methodology and general rules of WHO guideline development; we also added the first-hand management data of Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University. This guideline includes the guideline methodology, epidemiological characteristics, disease screening and population prevention, diagnosis, treatment and control (including traditional Chinese Medicine), nosocomial...","In 2012, a novel human coronavirus emerged and was tentatively named \u201cMiddle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus\u201d (MERS-CoV). The high mortality rate of MERS-CoV focused attention on the ecology of the virus. It has been found that MERS-CoV belongs to the group C lineage of the genus Betacoronavirus. Coronavirus surveillance studies in different populations of bats have suggested that they are probable reservoirs for this novel virus, and phylogenetic analysis of both the spike (S1) and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase proteins of MERS-CoV have revealed that it is related to bat viruses. Recently, the MERS-CoV and its neutralizing antibodies were detected in dromedary camels. Despite the limited number of reported cases of person-to-person transmission, the rapid evolution of the virus poses a continuous threat to humans worldwide. This paper reviews the current state of knowledge regarding the virology, clinical spectrum, evolution, diagnosis and treatment of MERS-CoV infections.","We are proposing to use machine learning algorithms to be able to improve possible case identifications of COVID-19 more quicker when we use a mobile phone-based web survey. This will also reduce the spread in the susceptible populations.","Background: Imagery techniques have been used as essential parts of diagnostic workup for patients suspected for 2019-nCoV infection, Multiple studies have reported the features of chest computed tomography (CT) scans among a number of 2019-nCoV patients. Method: Study Identification was carried out in databases (PubMed, Embase and Cochrane Library) to identify published studies examining the diagnosis, the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). Heterogeneity among reported prevalence was assessed by computing p-values of Cochrane Q-test and I2-statics. The pooled prevalence of treatment failure was carried out with a fixed effects meta-analysis model, generating the pooled 95% confidence interval. A random-effect model was used to pool the results since this model could incorporate the heterogeneity of the studies and therefore proved a more generalized result. Results: According to the combined results of meta-analysis, the total 55% of corona patients were males. The mean age of the pa...","Background: Sustained spread of SARS-CoV-2 has happened in major US cities. Capacity needs in Chinese cities could inform the planning of local healthcare resources. Methods: We described the intensive care unit (ICU) and inpatient bed needs for confirmed COVID-19 patients in two Chinese cities (Wuhan and Guangzhou) from January 10 to February 29, 2020, and compared the timing of disease control measures in relation to the timing of SARS-CoV-2 community spread. We estimated the peak ICU bed needs in US cities if a Wuhan-like outbreak occurs. Results: In Wuhan, strict disease control measures were implemented six weeks after sustained local transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Between January 10 and February 29, COVID-19 patients accounted for an average of 637 ICU patients and 3,454 serious inpatients on each day. During the epidemic peak, 19,425 patients (24.5 per 10,000 adults) were hospitalized, 9,689 (12.2 per 10,000 adults) were considered to be in serious condition, and 2,087 patients (2....","BACKGROUND: The Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus is a serious and emerging issue in Saudi Arabia and the world. A response was required to reduce possible disease transmission between the hospital and university. College of Nursing academic staff developed a programme in response to the educational and emotional needs of participants. METHODS: A MERS-CoV Task Force responded to the rapidly unfolding epidemic. The aim was to find out what nursing staff and nursing students in the college knew about MERS- CoV. While most gaps in knowledge were addressed after an intense information seminar, other learning needs were identified and responded to. The Task Force developed mandatory information sessions for all nursing faculty, students and staff. All staff were informed by email, letters and posters. There are 28 faculty staff, 84 support staff and 480 students in the College of Nursing. The information settings all took place within the College of Nursing, Princess Nourah Un...","Zoonotic transmission of novel viruses represents a significant threat to global public health and is fueled by globalization, the loss of natural habitats, and exposure to new hosts. For coronaviruses (CoVs), broad diversity exists within bat populations and uniquely positions them to seed future emergence events. In this review, we explore the host and viral dynamics that shape these CoV populations for survival, amplification, and possible emergence in novel hosts.","Viruses are evolving at an alarming rate, spreading and inconspicuously adapting to cutting-edge therapies. Therefore, the search for rapid, informative and reliable diagnostic methods is becoming urgent as ever. Conventional clinical tests (PCR, serology, etc.) are being continually optimized, yet provide very limited data. Could high throughput sequencing (HTS) become the future gold standard in molecular diagnostics of viral infections? Compared to conventional clinical tests, HTS is universal and more precise at profiling pathogens. Nevertheless, it has not yet been widely accepted as a diagnostic tool, owing primarily to its high cost and the complexity of sample preparation and data analysis. Those obstacles must be tackled to integrate HTS into daily clinical practice. For this, three objectives are to be achieved: (1) designing and assessing universal protocols for library preparation, (2) assembling purpose-specific pipelines, and (3) building computational infrastructure to s...","","The outbreak of COVID-19 epidemic has caused worldwide health concerns since Nov., 2019. A previous study described the demographic, epidemiologic, and clinical features for infected infants. However, compared with adult cases, little attention has been paid to the infected pediatric cases. Severity detection is challenging for children since most of children patients have mild symptoms no matter they are moderately or critically ill therein.","Summary Several new viral respiratory tract infectious diseases with epidemic potential that threaten global health security have emerged in the past 15 years. In 2003, WHO issued a worldwide alert for an unknown emerging illness, later named severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). The disease caused by a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV) rapidly spread worldwide, causing more than 8000 cases and 800 deaths in more than 30 countries with a substantial economic impact. Since then, we have witnessed the emergence of several other viral respiratory pathogens including influenza viruses (avian influenza H5N1, H7N9, and H10N8; variant influenza A H3N2 virus), human adenovirus-14, and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). In response, various surveillance systems have been developed to monitor the emergence of respiratory-tract infections. These include systems based on identification of syndromes, web-based systems, systems that gather health data from health facilities (suc...","Letter to the editor. There is no abstract. The summary was showed: SARS-CoV-2 has inevitably mutated during its pandemic spread to cause unpredictable effects on COVID-19 and complicate epidemic control efforts. Here we report that a novel SARS-CoV-2 mutation (ORF3a) appears to be spreading worldwide, which deserves close attention.","Bats are being increasingly recognized as an important reservoir of zoonotic viruses of different families, including SARS coronavirus, Nipah virus, Hendra virus and Ebola virus. Several recent studies hypothesized that bats, an ancient group of flying mammals, are the major reservoir of several important RNA virus families from which other mammalian viruses of livestock and humans were derived. Although this hypothesis needs further investigation, the premise that bats carry a large number of viruses is commonly accepted. The question of whether bats have unique biological features making them ideal reservoir hosts has been the subject of several recent reviews. In this review, we will focus on the public health implications of bat derived zoonotic viral disease outbreaks, examine the drivers and risk factors of past disease outbreaks and outline research directions for better control of future disease events.","Abstract Although Intensive Care Medicine is a young specialty compared with other medical disciplines, it currently plays a key role in the process of care for many patients. Experience has shown that professionals with specific training in Intensive Care Medicine are needed to provide high quality care to critically ill patients. In Europe, important steps have been taken towards the standardization of training programs of the different member states. However, it is now necessary to take one more step forward, that is, the creation of a primary specialty in Intensive Care Medicine. Care of the critically ill needs to be led by specialists who have received specific and complete training and who have the necessary professional competences to provide maximum quality care to their patients. The future of the specialty presents challenges that must be faced with determination, with the main objective of meeting the needs of the population.",""],"title":["Propagation of program control: A

special issue also touches on risk behaviors among marginalized populations. Wang and Shuanglong [16] explored generational differences in smoking, alcohol and dietary consumption behaviours among British minorities. They found that the second generation of migrants is more likely to smoke and consume alcohol and less likely to eat fruits and vegetables than white British, and identified a need for targeting second-generation ethnic minorities adopting unhealthy lifestyles. Pallesen et al. [17] conducted a study of the feasibility of a participatory intervention for improving dietary behaviour among ethnic minority women in Denmark. They reported that minority women of lower socioeconomic backgrounds easily engaged with a culturally relevant and acceptable cardiovascular disease prevention intervention, which positively motivated healthy dietary behaviour, and showed that, with the correct engagement, marginalized groups can have reduced dietary risks. Dearle et al. [18] also explored cultural factors related to risk for NCDs, examining knowledge and attitudes towards diabetes among Fijians. They investigated attitudes towards a traditional diet, the influence of family members, community beliefs, and awareness of diabetes, and found that effective intervention should incorporate cultural values and practices, emphasizing the essential role of family networks and church groups in conveying health messages. ","Although the scientific basis for these interventions might be robust, ethical considerations are multi faceted. 9 Importantly, political leaders must enact quarantine and social-distancing policies that do not bias against any population group. The legacies of social and economic injustices perpetrated in the name of public health have lasting repercussions. 10 Interventions might pose risks of reduced income and even job loss, disproportionately affecting the most disadvantaged populations: policies to lessen such risks are urgently needed. Special attention should be given to protections for vulnerable populations, such as homeless, incarcerated, older, or disabled individuals, and undocumented migrants. Similarly, exceptions might be necessary for certain groups, including people who are reliant on ongoing medical treatment.","While school closures have proven to be an important means for delaying or reducing outbreaks (13, 14) , they come with large economic and societal costs, with generally an outsized impact on disadvantaged and vulnerable populations (15) .","Moreover, in the current pandemic, many women and midwives live, give birth and work in high risk areas. Midwives have been and continue to meet unprecedented circumstances for which they may feel underprepared. Preparing midwives to work in risky situations and stem the spread of infection whilst meeting the needs of women is an ongoing balance of priorities. Some midwives may even feel they are working outside their regional scope of practice. The Ebola outbreak highlighted how practice can be affected. For example, midwives working in Sierra Leone during the Ebola outbreak feared becoming infected, which affected their professional and personal lives [2] . In the study, motivation and support impacted the ability of the midwives to cope in these challenging circumstances. Midwives sense of duty obligated them to step into risky situations in a time of crisis. Likewise, similar scenarios are playing out with the COVID-19 pandemic in China, Iran and Italy. The Erland study highlighted the need for competency, creativity and courage when faced with challenges and ethical dilemmas.","An important indicator that leadership, and the drive to spearhead new approaches, are growing within the research community is the fact that attention is shifting from asking why it is necessary to build collaborative networks across different types of knowledge, to figuring out how this work can be initiated, maintained, and evaluated (Funtowicz, 1994; Gross Stein, 2001; Klein et al., 2001; Horlick-Jones, 2004). It is no longer enough for scientists to hone their own corners of research to perfection, and assume someone else (who?) will put it all together. Increased sophistication in efforts to incorporate systems-based concepts regarding ecology, health, and sustainability into professional curricula (Howard, 2004; Howard and Rapport, 2004) is a step in the right direction for a new generation of researchers. We must also find ways to cultivate leadership in the current generation of researchers because it is they who will be required to build the collegial and collaborative platforms from which to bridge disciplines and policy, and make useful contributions in the multistakeholder arena of EID investigation and control. Critical skills will be required to identify how, when, and where disciplinary, interdisciplinary, and transdisciplinary approaches will be required in building responses to disease emergence. This is not a small task or an \u201cacademic exercise,\u201d but a necessary step in building our capacity to better respond to the emerging infections of the 21st century.","Alongside scalability, a need exists for inclusive tools that allow for genuine and meaningful engagement from children in rural areas, ethnic minorities, gender and sexual minorities, those exposed to poverty and violence, and those who experience health challenges. In our work with the Lancet Commission on Global Mental Health and Sustainable Development on the My Mind Our Humanity campaign, arts-based approaches have allowed us to engage young people from a range of backgrounds, both face-to-face and online. Poetry and music have created safe spaces for sharing deeply personal experiences of mental health challenges and supporting each other. These approaches have allowed us to challenge stigma by reminding young people of our shared humanity. The potential of artsbased and digital tools to foster inclusive engagement and participation is important, and our capacity to empower young generations is dependent on our ability to harness these and other resources to understand their values and experiences.","The above impacts demonstrate that the issues of virus outbreaks transcend urban safety and impacts upon all other facets of our urban fabric. Therefore, it becomes paramount to ensure that the measures taken to contain a virus transcend nationalist agendas where data and information sharing is normally restricted, to a more global agenda where humanity and global order are encouraged. With such an approach, it would be easier to share urban health data across geographies to better monitor emerging health threats in order to provide more economic stability, thereby ensuring no disruptions on such sectors like tourism and travel industries, amongst others. This is possible by ensuring collaborative, proactive measures to control outbreak spread and thus, human movements. This would remove fears on travelers, and would have positive impacts upon the tourism industry, that has been seen to bear the economic brunt whenever such outbreaks occur. This can be achieved by ensuring that protocols on data sharing are calibrated to remove all hurdles pertaining to sharing of information. On this, Lawpoolsri et al. [31] posits that such issues, like transparency, timelessness of sharing and access and quality of data, should be upheld so that continuous monitoring and assessment can be pursued.","The common condition of coverage of health needs under the restriction of the scarcity of financial resources brings forth the theoretical interest regarding the classification of priorities and choices, both for the design of a system for the prevention, preservation, and promotion of health and for other fiscal intervention policies in various areas of socioeconomic activity of individuals. It is also known that these policies affect and shape the state of health of the population to a much greater extent than the health-care system itself. The actual numbers regarding health-care needs, the severity of diseases, the degree of external adverse effects, and the financial resources available determine the hierarchy of options in combination with the analysis of the factors as mentioned above.","Communities can serve as valuable resources in managing difficulties of family matters. For instance, parents' committees can work together to bridge the needs of students with school requirements and to advocate for children's rights to a healthy lifestyle. Psychologists can provide online services to cope with mental health issues caused by domestic conflicts, tension with parents, and anxiety from becoming infected. 7 Social workers can play an active role in helping parents cope with family issues arising from the situation, when needed. Such a social safety net could be particularly useful for disadvantaged or single-parent families, 9 but action is needed to make it accessible to them.","The transition from innovation in the health system to the promotion of health is a prerequisite for ensuring the long-term supply of health services on an equal basis and with equal distribution of all produced results. However, the dilemma of attaining maximalist objectives-the effective development of the health system-at the expense of the minimalist implementation of coverage for the socially disadvantaged, particularly in times of crisis, is of particular interest and guides the analysis of health policies with regards to the allocation of available resources.","We made an effort to distribute and reach all sectors of Israel's population. The survey is distributed in 5 languages -Hebrew, Arabic, English, Russian, and Amharic to reflect and serve the diverse spoken languages of Israel's population. Although at this point we do not see an unbiased representation of the Israeli population in our responses, special efforts to reach underrepresented populations are currently done through several channels: call centers, media appearance and promotion of the survey through Arabic-speaking TV stations to gain interest and compliance in all sectors of the population.","Another important research development is the adoption of methods that depend on community or multistakeholder participation in order to better address issues that span environmental health and sustainability concerns (Merrifield, 1993; O\u2019Fallon and Dearry, 2002; Witten et al., 2000; Parkes and Panelli, 2001; Bunch, 2003; Waltner-Toews, 2003; Brown et al., 2005). Infectious disease researchers are beginning to follow this lead, informed not only by the positive impact of participatory research on communities, but also by the increased attention to the rights of underrepresented and indigenous communities around the world that is changing the political landscape of donor participation in development, the environment (Chapin, 2004), and health (GFHR, 2004). Innovative research projects that bridge disciplines and engage with place-based knowledge sets of communities vulnerable to EID infection, as well as with nonacademic stakeholders who work with such communities, have great potential not only to increase our capacity to prevent and control emerging infections, but also to meet maturing demands of 21st century funders and donors.","Although rates of tuberculosis cases in the USA are at record lows (less than 10 000 new cases were reported in 2012), the disease continues to disproportionately aff ect people born outside the USA and racial and ethnic minorities. 116 Outbreaks also occur in hard-to-reach populations, such as drug users and the homeless. 117, 118 Diagnosis and management of the 11 million people in the USA with latent tuberculosis infection is a challenge but is essential since most active disease results from such infections. 119, 120 Key strategies include targeted testing and treatment and engagement of medical providers outside of public health departments. 119 Although more pressing globally, management of tuberculosis and HIV co-infection and surveillance for drug resistance are important components of tuberculosis control eff orts in the USA. 116, 121 Multidrug-resistant (MDR) and extensively drug-resistant strains continue to challenge elimination goals for tuberculosis, and fi rst-generation and second-generation antituberculosis drug shortages have occurred. The FDA accelerated approval of bedaquiline, a novel drug for the treatment of pulmonary MDR tuberculosis. 122","Not surprisingly, given that the above developments are recent, hypotheses and research methods that integrate the social and ecological causes and effects of global disease emergence are in their infancy. \u201cEcosystem approaches\u201d to health (Waltner-Toews, 2001; Lebel, 2003; De Plaen and Kilelu, 2004) offer examples of research methods that explicitly engage with the ecological and social systems within which health is created and challenged, although these approaches were not developed specifically for EID investigation. However, these and other systems-based approaches provide some common principles with which to help understand the nested, interdependent systems in which diseases emerge, maintain themselves, and evolve on a multitude of levels\u2014molecular, organismal, communal, national, and global (Wilcox and Colwell, 2005). Understanding of these \u201cnested hierarchies\u201d is complemented by the idea of coupled human\u2013natural systems, in which humans are both part of nature and fundamentally conditioned by social activity. This recognition, in turn, encourages researchers to incorporate into their methods and research design the idea that \u201cdelineation between social systems and ecosystems is artificial and arbitrary\u201d (Berkes et al., 2003, p 2). Research that explicitly engages with the complexity of systems\u2019 interactions (Kay et al., 1999), and the associated concepts of adaptation and resilience (Holling, 2001), offer valuable precedents and fertile ground for understanding the social, ecological, and economic contexts in which EIDs occur. Yet, despite these developments, systematic formulation, development, and application of approaches that integrate the social and ecological aspects of disease emergence into research paradigms has not yet occurred. The role of transdisciplinary approaches in helping to achieve such an integration is the central theme of this article.","Clearly, any decision to start a DMT during the COVID-19 pandemic will need to be taken carefully and will depend on the state of the COVID-19 pandemic, not only in the particular country concerned, but in the specific area the patient lives and receives therapy. For example, aggressive public health steps to contain the spread of the virus locally may make it relatively safe for a patient to start an immunosuppressive therapy. Our concern is that the COVID-19 pandemic may trigger a large number of neurologists and patients to reconsider treatment strategy and choice of initial DMT and to opt for less effective immunomodulatory DMTs. This change needs to be considered carefully. The COVID-19 pandemic in all likelihood will be short lived and it would be unfair to patients treated during the epidemic to be disadvantaged in the long term regarding the management of their MS. Neurologists have spent an extraordinary amount of time and effort to activate the MS community: to advance the principle that 'time is brain', to treat MS proactively to a target of no evident disease activity (NEDA) and more recently, to flip the pyramid and use higher efficacy treatments first line. These treatment principles are evidence-based and should not be thrown out in the context of a potential, but yet undefined, risk to our patients.","An ECOSOC UN Global Health Panel would meet many of the needs identified in post-EVD governance reform discussions, including acting as a permanent central body to coordinate global health efforts across the entire UN system (including alignment with the SDGs), allowing engagement with a broader array of stakeholders and creating a \"safe space\" for these interactions through its partnership initiatives and forums, and could be designed in a way that would afford it greater political visibility as well as increased accountability by having it report directly to the UN General Assembly [37, 45, 60\u201362]. Similarly, the creation of a Global Health Committee contained within the UN Security Council - as recommended by the Harvard-LSHTM panel - could also elevate health emergencies to the highest levels of political attention and raise awareness among key decisionmakers. However, the highly political nature of the Security Council could also result in public health priorities being stymied by larger and more influential political, security, and core foreign policy dynamics, as has been the case in other health diplomacy outcomes [63\u201365]. Further, the High-level Council proposed by the Kikwete Panel would not implicitly include important multistakeholder representation from international public health agencies, non-state actors, NGOs, civil society, and other health actors, instead relying upon the exclusive participation of member state political representatives.","Reproductive medicine units in Italy that continue to offer clinical treatments necessitate specific changes to their organization. These include strict adherence to the generic health precautions with clearly visible signs within the clinics at the entrance and throughout the clinics, including private spaces, to remind patients of these general measures. Exposure by scheduled in-person meetings may be reduced by cancelling attendance, and all staff are to consider personal risk when commuting. All non-essential visits by external businesses or academic collaborators are to be avoided and replaced by telecommunications and online platforms. Patient informational events may be held via webinars. Outpatient consultations can be moved to a telemedicine model where feasible, with strict adherence to scheduled appointments for ultrasounds and lab tests to reduce waiting room exposure, coupled with a request to patients to attend alone and to wait outside in their own vehicle until the scheduled appointment to reduce overall risk of transmission. Working agendas are altered to reduce the sharing of common spaces by staff, including the creation of shift teams to reduce the risk that the whole clinic staff is affected and required to self-isolate. Managerial, administrative, and IT staff are similarly to be moved to a rotational schedule to reduce the risk of all being infected simultaneously. Access to common areas of the clinic is strictly limited, with deliveries made outside at specific entrances. All staff must be trained in the processes and protocols for dealing with COVID-19 cases and the use of general precautions and certified particulate filtering face masks to reduce transmission. Should the team members themselves present with respiratory symptoms, the Italian authorities have mandated that, if accompanied by a fever, they are required to abstain from work.","\u25a0 The oral health of people with VI can be disadvantaged, since they are not in a position to detect and recognise early oral disease and may be unable to take immediate action unless informed of the situation \u25a0 The number of dental fractures in children with VI however, is similar to those without VI. As a consequence, mouth-guards are not recommended for everyday life activities.","2019-nCoV pneumonia were also infectious to human beings and follow with extensive interest as zoonoses [13] . However, even in such a present information, increasingly wealthy and technologically adept times, there was still a high mortality rates and its therapeutic efficacy was not ideal. Therefore, the intervention of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) and ethnic minority medicine would provide a new and actual treatment to fit the current situation or need in times of crisis. We will give full play to TCM and folk medicines of ethnic minorities in disease prevention and control.","Consequently, the elucidation of the Spike-ACE2 binding interface is needed to design novel therapeutics. To that end, we used the PIPE-Sites algorithm to predict the three most likely putative interaction interfaces between the Spike (P0DTC2) and ACE2 (Q9BYF1) proteins ( Figure 6 ). Note that all predicted subsequence offsets are 0-indexed. With a maximum landscape peak of 6, the PIPE-Sites algorithm identified three putative interaction interfaces: Most interestingly, certain of these region along the Spike protein appears to coincide with mismatched or gap regions along the dot plot alignment depicted in Figure 7 ). For example, upon closer investigation of the alignment around residue 420, we note six mismatches. Their proximity to a candidate region of interaction certainly warrant additional experimental investigation (Figure 7 ). While numerous inhibitory strategies exist, including the use of small molecules or small interfering RNAs, this research is most directly amenable to the design small inhibitory peptides that inhibit virus infection by preventing Spike protein-mediated receptor binding and blocking viral fusion and entry. Unfortunately, much like small peptides and interfering RNAs, peptide-based solutions are disadvantaged by their low antiviral potency.","On the other side, some tetragrams are overrepresented/underrepresented in a subset of OIs and underrepresented/overrepresented, respectively in the backbone, and may characterize, in a way similar to n-gram frequency distribution, the subset of OIs. For example, ATCC is underrepresented in five OIs, four of which belonging to the 5DC class (#28, #30, #84 and #148) and overrepresented in the backbone; GGCT is overrepresented in six OIs, four of which belong to the 5DC class (#30, #51, #84 and #108) and underrepresented in the backbone. Table AF4a in the additional file represents all the tetragrams that are overrepresented in an OI and underrepresented in the backbone, along with the expected number of occurrences (according to the maximal All the tetragrams that are uniquely overrepresented in one of the 5DC class OIs and underrepresented in the backbone, along with the z-value and rank of the tetragram in both sequences, are listed. Table AF4b in the additional file represents the same data for tetragrams that are underrepresented in an OI and overrepresented in the backbone.","From this discussion, it should be clear why viral infections can result a such a wide array of presentations. Because of the intracellular, parasitic nature of viruses and the resulting dependence on host cell metabolic machinery for proliferation, the use of antiviral drug therapy is limited. Many of the drugs developed for viral disease also have an effect on rapidly growing cells, which limits their use in the newborn. Thus, the newborn is not only vulnerable to infection, but also is disadvantaged for viable treatment options.","In the introductory part of this chapter, we attempt a high-level approach to: (1) the fundamental principles of health policies; (2) the methodological assessment of health needs in conjunction with the investigation of trends in nosology and epidemiology; and (3) the classification of priorities when formulating health policies.","According to this approach to the redesign of health policies in conjunction with the quantitative and qualitative results of the positive and negative health indicators and the changing health needs of the population, the following are the strategic priorities of health policy in the EU for the period 2014-2020. 19, 20 ","Nonetheless, the health sector has much more to do and WHO has identified priorities for improving the collective health response. First, emergency management needs to be strengthened. WHO is assisting member states to undertake all-hazard risk profiling, develop emergency preparedness plans, establish emergency operations centres (EOC), and apply the incident management system. 23 Afghanistan has improved its emergency management, now coordinated from a Crisis Control Centre in Kabul.","What must be done to mitigate the impact of large outbreaks of COVID-19 in prisons? The public health importance of prison responses to influenza outbreaks has been recognised in the USA, 8 where the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have developed a checklist for pandemic influenza preparedness in correctional settings. WHO has also issued prisonspecific guidance for responding to COVID-19 (panel). 9 Prison health is public health by definition. Despite this and the very porous borders between prisons and communities, prisons are often excluded or treated as separate from public health efforts. The fast spread of COVID-19 will, like most epidemics, disproportionately affect the most disadvantaged people. Therefore, to","In an era of personalized medicine, one should not lose sight of how molecular medicine can be used to improve global health. Cheaper drugs and vaccines for all communities is an important benefit that should come from molecular-based technologies. Another would be better NATs. In this respect it is intriguing to recall how direct-to-consumer DNA testing (Chapter 5) makes effective use of the Internet. Could the Internet be one way to improve accessibility for disadvantaged communities or those in rural and remote regions? Consideration of how genomics can play a part in the bioeconomy, with its potential to generate income, improve food production and sustain a better environment, are some of the challenges now being taken up by bodies such as the OECD.","Although it has been more than 40 years since \u201chealth for all\u201d was presented as a focus in the Alma Ata declaration [1], the world is still far from achieving this goal. Although great progress has been made since then in many areas of health, much of that progress has been confined to rich countries, and even within the richest of countries, health inequality persists. New health problems and threats have arisen in the generations since that hopeful statement, with the scourge of HIV and the challenge of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) facing high and low-income countries alike [2]. With these new challenges, we see inequalities forming along the same old social fault lines and the same axes of deprivation and discrimination. In high-income countries, new risk factors such as obesity and food insecurity cluster in the poorest communities [3,4], while on a global level, we see the greatest burden of new diseases such as HIV falling on the poorest countries [5], and continuing challenges of health access and financing for the poorest people [6]. Much of this inequality arises from simple economic inequality and the consequences of colonialism, but much also results from the marginalization of certain individuals and groups at community, national and global levels. Sexual minorities, people with mental illness, migrants, refugees, the homeless, transient populations, transgender people, sex workers and many other groups who do not conform to existing social norms, or who have historically been marginalized and excluded, experience many often completely preventable illnesses. Discrimination against some members of the community, their exclusion from economic, cultural and social processes, and the selective provision of basic services to these communities put them at increased risk of poor health and expose them to preventable risk factors. Because the marginalization of these people is socially and historically determined, the health consequences for these people continue to be severe and pernicious, despite being preventable.","The results of Zipf-like analysis might suggest that some of the n-grams were exclusively overrepresented (or underrepresented) in a single sequence, which would give us a criterion for defining the sequence's n-gram nucleotide signature. We calculated such signatures for each OI as a set of n-grams which were overrepresented in that OI only, and underrepresented in the backbone of the genome, and also for n-grams which were underrepresented in that OI only, and overrepresented in the backbone.","These sobering predictions are presented in the WHO report on cancer: setting priorities, investing wisely and providing care for all, which was published on 4 February along with the International Agency for Research on Cancer\u2019s World cancer report: cancer research for cancer prevention.","To improve efficiency and optimal use of limited medical resources, it is important in the initial stage to establish key target groups and set priorities accordingly. The guiding principles divide the population affected by NCP into 4 levels (see Table 1 ), and require the first-level population to be the focus of PCI (Chinese Society of Psychiatry, 2020) (Ma et al., 2020) . Psychiatrists and psychologists can then carry out assessment of the psychological state of target individuals in a more timely manner. The current PCI efforts provide onsite services to first and second-level populations, and 24/7 real-time remote (telephone and internet) psychological support to third and fourth-level populations.","Around 20 million newly acquired STIs occur every year in the USA, 13 resulting in about $16 billion in health-care costs. 102 Nearly half these infections occur in young people (aged 15-24 years). 13 Similar to HIV, racial and ethnic minorities are disproportionately aff ected by STIs, as shown in chlamydia and gonorrhoea national surveillance data. 103 In 2012, chlamydia and gonorrhoea rates of infection for black people were around seven and 15 times higher, respectively, than those for white people. 103 Another urgent challenge for prevention and control of STIs is the threat of emerging cephalosporin resistance, which could lead to untreatable gonorrhoea (fi gure 3). 104, 105 Gonorrhoea is the second most commonly reported US notifi able disease, 103 and if untreated can lead to severe health outcomes including pelvic infl ammatory disease and subsequent infertility. To address this challenge requires enhanced surveillance of antibiotic susceptibility such as through the Gonococcal Isolate Surveillance Project; improved primary prevention, screening, and partner services; and development of new therapies. 103, 105 Guidelines to treat gonorrhoea have been changed to preserve the last available eff ective treatment option for as long as possible. 106","In early January WHO activated a team to coordinate and facilitate information-sharing on research elements needed for the response. The team will implement the WHO R&amp;D Blueprint, a strategy for accelerating research and development activities during epidemics. The R&amp;D Blueprint includes scenarios for \u201cpathogen x\u201d \u2013 a previously unknown pathogen \u2013 such as COVID-19. WHO convened a meeting of experts in Geneva on 11 and 12 February to set research and development priorities for coronavirus treatment, diagnostics, vaccines, infection prevention and community measures to combat the outbreak.","The 2019-nCov will not be the last epidemic to challenge public health experts. The growth of AI-driven techniques to identify epidemiologic risks early will be key to our improvement of prediction, prevention, and detection of future global health risks. The devastating situation in Wuhan, China and future epidemics will also find value in ongoing research in 2019-nCov case detection, spread prediction, treatment effectiveness, and containment. The wide variety, velocity, and veracity of data now available in crises yield data sets that many researchers will now need to incorporate into evermore complex models. This requires expansion of talent within AI for healthcare applications. AI is no longer a niche research area nor is it a tool for the most advanced healthcare systems only, its global impact on healthcare is real and its potential to save lives in this epidemic as well as future epidemics should not be underestimated. It is critical to the global health of all humankind for the scientific community to embrace AI and leverage its power in securing our collective future.","Overrepresented and underrepresented n-grams Table 2a represents the 10 topmost overrepresented and underrepresented tetragrams (according to z M statistic) in the complete E. coli EDL933 genome, its backbone and 9 OIs from the 5DC class. Among these tetragrams there are 9 different palindromes, all of which are underrepresented, with 29 occurrences in total. There are also 14 pairs of sequences and their reverse complements, each pair simultaneously being either overrepresented or underrepresented. Table 2b represents rank, in the complete genome and the nine 5DC OIs of the 10 topmost overrepresented and underrepresented tetragrams from the backbone. Table AF2 in the additional file contains the same data for all the OIs of length &gt;10 kb, along with the z-values of the z M statistic. It can be seen that the intersection of all the 10 topmost overrepresented tetragram columns is empty, as is the intersection of all the 10 top-most underrepresented tetragram columns, i.e., no tetragram is among the 10 topmost overrepresented tetragrams in all the OIs. However, there are three tetragrams -CACC, CATC, CGCC, that are overrepresented, and one tetragram -GGCC, that is underrepresented (but not in the 10 topmost), in all the OIs, the backbone and the complete genome. Table AF3 in the additional file represents all the tetragrams in all the OIs of length&gt;10 kb, the backbone and the complete genome, along with z-values of the z M statistic.","Patients with lung cancer may be doubly disadvantaged by COVID-19 infection due to the respiratory changes which seems the predominant mode of death in people infected with the virus [39] . Many lung cancer patients will already have compromised lung function and the pneumonitis cause by therapeutic radiation may conceivably increase risk for patients. In this context patient selection for treatment, particularly with respect to fitness and frailty is crucial. Although modest hypofractionation is possible in non-small cell lung cancer dose constraints with acceptable lung V20 of less than 30% may be challenging if the PTV is large. In patients suitable for stereotactic radiosurgery with local access then a single fraction regimen may be possible and preferable to a 3 fraction regimen [40, 41] . Sequential regimens might be preferred for stage III unresectable disease over concurrent RT-CT for reducing the risk of lymphopenia; no data are currently available on the incidence and severity of COVID-19 in patients undergoing maintenance immunotherapy with anti PD-L1 inhibitors after chemoradiation, so caution is advised.","Reporting about the important achievements of developing countries in the area of medicines information is not easy since it stems from evaluating overall performances across different countries and judging what is coming first and what is the next in terms of importance and impact. In the following we are providing snapshots of nice experiences from a variety of countries from the developing world. The purpose of this description is to offer others an opportunity to learn such experiences and replicating them in their own way. To arrange and conduct fellowship training in drugs as well as poison information in support of the concept of rational drug use. (d) To collaborate with the Western Pacific Regional Office in developing computer applications relating to drug information and pharmacoinformatics. (e) To collaborate with the Western Pacific Regional Office in initiating a systematic data and information collection on activities related to the drug utilization, management and policies for identification of priorities and forecasting of needs. (f) To support countries and areas in the region to conceptualize, plan and set up Drug Information Services tailored to individual needs. (g) To undertake relevant drug utilization studies in support of promoting rational use of medicines, develop focused drug information intervention for providers and consumers to improve prescribing and drug use practices, and to undertake proper evaluation of the impact of drug information on rational use of medicines (Information copied from the website of the National Poison Centre of Malaysia http://www.prn.usm.my/who_col-laborating_centre.php accessed December 28, 2016). 2. Going beyond medicines information: The drug information center at Manipal Teaching Hospital, Pokhara, Nepal, founded in November 2003 succeeded in providing activities besides the provision of medicines information services such as running a pharmacovigilance center and a medication counseling center (Shankar, Mishra, Subish, &amp; Upadhyay, 2007) . The center resources are used for teaching of the undergraduates and for continuing pharmacy education program of pharmacists. The center publishes a quarterly bulletin and support research activities.","The Global Influenza Programme has published the updated WHO Public Health Research Agenda for Influenza, in which research priorities were identified for several domains including patient management [76]. Existing knowledge highlights the need for data regarding supportive care and adjunctive pharmacologic therapy that is specific for critically ill patients with severe RVI. Data on supportive management in resource-restricted settings are severely lacking. There is a need for more pragmatic and efficient designs to test antiviral therapeutics, individually and in combination in patients with severe RVI who are at increased risk for complications from both the disease and treatments. Adaptive randomized-controlled trial that tests several treatments, such as the REMAP-CAP trial (NCT02735707), may represent an efficient approach.","Sharara and Kanj [1] examined the war and infectious diseases and studied the influence of circumstances of war on the prevalence of infectious diseases of global concern in a public health emergency. It has been notified that the poliomyelitis outbreaks have led the focus on the severity of the prevailing health issues internationally after the Syrian conflict. This attention also assisted to recognize the significance of reinvigorating elimination campaigns in the endemic nations including Nigeria, Pakistan, and Afghanistan for the prevention of such outbreaks. Polio has been declared as a public health emergency in Syria that needs international solidarity and efforts to avoid epidemic globally [1]. Similarly, Doganay and Demiraslan [5] studied the impact of reemerging infections, health services, and biosecurity in Turkey. In gunshot or surgical wounds, multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacterial infections appear to be a rising issue. Malaria, hepatitis A, and varicella have been seen with increasing incidence among the refugees. There are several issues, waiting to be resolved for living and health standards [5].","Will financial innovation transform humanitarian responses? It already has. The indignation of the public health sector is unlikely to quash new forms of aid, but health partisans can provide safeguards. They can engage with and interrogate the language and priorities of finance. They can require that the bonds' triggers be publicly negotiated and open access. They can push for disbursement criteria that place the needs of the sick before the demands of investors. They can fight for consultation with communities where pandemics occur. But public health influence on these financial instruments will require involvement in global health and humanitarian politics that has heretofore been considered incidental rather than first-order health prevention. 13 We declare no competing interests.","A striking feature of our analysis is the very high value of the basic reproduction number we identified in the period of time up to the closure of Wuhan city. Three of our modeling methods -including the best-fitting method based on a Poisson loss function -identified a value of \" greater than 5, with some possibility of a value over 6. Basic reproduction numbers in the 5-7 range are consistent with extremely contagious diseases such as mumps and smallpox, and indicate a disease with a very high risk of becoming a global pandemic. This finding has significant implications for cities like Singapore, Japan and London which are beginning to experience the first signs of spread of the disease without importation. In light of the epidemic threat identified here, these cities should consider implementing more aggressive prevention policies as necessary, while respecting human rights and the dignity of affected individuals and of those who might be disadvantaged by stricter quarantine and control mechanisms.","Understanding of COVID-19 is evolving rapidly. It is essential to understand the emerging scientific knowledge to coordinate COVID-19 research globally. Recently, the WHO has published a Global Research Roadmap with immediate, mid-term and longer-term priorities to enable the implementation of priority research [8] . Bonilla-Aldana DK et al. [9] and Md Mahbub Hossain MBBS [10] have performed bibliometric analysis to evaluate the scientific literature on coronavirus infection and COVID-19, basing on indicators such as the number of articles, the productivity of authors, geographic distribution of articles and prominent keywords. However, to the best of our knowledge, there is still no quantitative thematic analysis available to date that focuses on CoVs.","The first challenge is that incentives across the analytical pipeline are misaligned. 2 Academics are largely incentivised to write scientific articles and to fund their work through individually led grants. These activities are not conducive to the rapid response to a crisis (although many academics do respond), or to sustained engagement and training of corporate and government teams. Companies are incentivised by profit, and are rightly beholden to national regulatory frameworks and the public with respect to the data they collect. Ministries of health have complex relationships with both the companies that have access to personal data and with the public. They face many competing health priorities and complex political choices when it comes to open sharing of epidemiological data. Disease control programmes are often hampered by limited capacity and high turnover of personnel, and health workers on the ground during an epidemic have their hands full responding to the immediate crisis and might not be trained or incentivised to report epidemiological data accurately. Taken together, these incentive structures create multiple barriers to rapid data generation and the development of streamlined epidemic forecasting systems that use these new data types.","This project was funded by The Change Foundation as part of a project entitled ''Protecting the Faces of Healthcare Workers: Knowledge Gaps and Research Priorities for Effective Protection Against Occupationally-Acquired Respiratory Infectious Diseases.'' 60 ","Several specific actions can mitigate future threats to the health of the global population. First, we need to fully implement the International Health Regulations (IHR) in countries of all income levels. Reports from WHO and the Global Preparedness Monitoring Board have shown that responses to urgent crises have improved under the IHR (2005), but important deficiencies in coverage still exist. 3, 4 We must scale up laboratory capacity and other surveillance capabilities, augment the readiness of health systems to care for large numbers of seriously ill patients while safe guarding the health-care workforce, and improve communication and coordination strategies and implementation. 5 Procurement and supply chain management must also be enhanced to ensure adequate stocks of personal protective equipment and essential medications and to enable equitable access to new diagnostics, therapeutics, and vaccines during health emergencies. 6 Second, we need to accelerate progress towards achieving the priorities and targets of the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction, 7 which was adopted by UN member nations in 2015. The Sendai Framework applies an all-hazards approach to increasing international, regional, national, and local resilience to withstand a broad spectrum of disasters, including epidemics, pandemics, and epizootics. Preparedness for emerging infectious diseases requires strengthening health systems and developing response plans that account for the social, environmental, political, and institutional factors that can either support or disrupt emergency management efforts. 8 The Sendai Framework complements the IHR by integrating infrastructure, climate change, and economic considerations into disaster management plans and promoting inclusive policies that protect vulnerable populations during all phases of mitigation, preparedness, response, and recovery. 7 Third, plans for preventing, detecting, and controlling outbreaks of emerging infectious diseases need to be built on a One Health foundation that emphasises the interconnectedness of humans, animals, and ecosystems. 9 Transdisciplinary, multisectoral strategies are necessary when seeking to solve complex problems that threaten global public health and safety. 10 More specifically in relation to diseases such as COVID-19, One Health focuses on the danger existing at the human-wildlife interface. The ability to detect viruses in livestock and wildlife is a crucial component of early warning systems for human pandemics. 11 ","Many urge early career academics to publish or perish and have done so since the first use of this term in The Academic Man: A Study in the Sociology of a Profession in 1942 (Moosa, 2018) . However, the education market demands much more. Teaching, executive training, book and blog publishing may be low priorities in academia compared to peer-reviewed papers, but are effective ways for researchers to gain practitioner and societal relevance. Our contemporary knowledge consumers see rigor as an order-qualifier while relevance is their orderwinner. Deeper understanding of rigor and relevance is key here Varadarajan, 2003) , as is research-related academic-practitioner engaged scholarship ( Van de Ven, 2018) . A key proposition of this paper is that research alone overlooks an array of interactive educational opportunities in our armoury, and that innovative teaching practice, processes and programs can be used to help bridge the research-practice gap.","underrepresented . Given its popularity, YouTube should be considered as important platform for information dissemination.","From a public health perspective, the real-time whole genome sequencing (WGS) of emerging viruses enables the informed development and design of molecular diagnostic methods, and tracing patterns of spread across multiple epidemiological scales (i.e. genomic epidemiology). However, WGS capacities and data sharing policies vary in different countries and jurisdictions, leading to potential sampling bias due to delayed or underrepresented sequencing data from some areas with substantial SARS-CoV-2 activity.","This article consists of six sections. Section 2 describes the AAEDM which is an enhanced mathematical epidemic diffusion model to predict the number of infected people by typical epidemics. It also introduces the and which are kappa zeta factors capable to determine the characteristics of this prediction model. These factors could be used for understanding the current Covid-19 pandemic situations without analyzing heavy amount of dataset which only available for related professionals. Section 3 provides for data scientists or data analysts who want adapt the AAEDM into their statistical systems or the machine learning systems. There are couple of examples to simplify for gathering data and they could freely modify based on their circumstances with only one solid condition. Section 4 discusses the testing and validation of the AAEDM by using the dataset from the Covid-19 statistics in Korea. Although the AAEDM is a simple and handy model, the performance (mainly, an accuracy of future predictions) is fairly acceptable to be used for a statistical model by using Bigdata. Finally, the conclusion and further discussion regarding this research are provided in Section 5 and 6."],"title":["Progress towards Health for All: Time to End Discrimination and
