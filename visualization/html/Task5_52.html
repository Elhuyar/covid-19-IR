It can be applied for the prevention and control of SARI (severe acute respiratory infection). By combining sensors, information technology, artificial intelligence, and available dynamic networking devices, IoT could realize long-distance communication between hospitals, patients, and medical devices, which could ultimately improve current medical conditions.","We use human mobility models, for which we are experts, and attach a virus infection dynamics to it, for which we are not experts but have taken it from the literature, including recent publications. This results in a virus spreading dynamics model. The results should be verified, but because of the current time pressure, we publish them in their current state. Recommendations for improvement are welcome. We come to the following conclusions: 1. Complete lockdown works. About 10 days after lockdown, the infection dynamics dies down. This assumes that lockdown is complete, which can be guaranteed in the simulation, but not in reality. Still, it gives strong support to the argument that it is never too late for complete lockdown. 2. As a rule of thumb, we would suggest complete lockdown no later than once 10% of hospital capacities available for COVID-19 are in use, and possibly much earlier. This is based on the following insights: a. Even after lockdown, the infection dynamics continue...","","Publisher Summary This chapter discusses the terms: \u201cvocabulary,\u201d \u201ctaxonomy,\u201d and \u201contology.\u201d Terms and facts are semantic constructs. They are meant to have meaning that is shared by anyone who uses them. These terms are chosen from a much larger palette of possible terms for that industry and context. These terms have to be defined and used consistently by all the people and all the programs that access data referred to by the \u201cterms.\u201d The chapter examines where that chaos comes from and the role that taxonomies and ontologies play to help make definitions more precise and more commonly understood. The chapter examines business vocabularies and various ways they are organized. Vocabulary is the set of symbols (words) to which a given language has ascribed shared meaning. Taxonomy is a form of organized vocabulary. Classically the organization is hierarchic, based on some attributes of the things being classified. Ontology is a specification of a conceptualization. The chapter conclud...","Abstract Cancer patients have an increased risk of developing severe forms of COVID-19, and advanced cancer patients who are followed at home, represent a particularly frail population. Although with substantial differences, the challenges which cancer care professionals have to face with during a pandemic are quite similar to those posed by natural disasters. Some of us have already managed the oncological home care service after the 2009 earthquake in L\u2019Aquila (middle Italy). With this letter, we want to share with the medical community the procedures and tools that we have started using at the home care service of the Tuscany Tumor Association during the COVID-19 pandemic.","This study reviewed problems in the prevention of outbreak and spread of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and aimed to provide assistance in establishing policies to prevent and manage future outbreaks of novel infectious diseases of foreign origin via in-depth epidemiological investigation of the patient who initiated the MERS outbreak in Korea, 2015. Personal and phone interviews were conducted with the patient and his guardians, and his activities in Saudi Arabia were investigated with the help of the Saudi Arabian Ministry of Health. Clinical courses and test results were confirmed from the medical records. The patient visited 4 medical facilities and contacted 742 people between May 11, 2015, at symptom onset, and May 20, at admission to the National Medical Center; 28 people were infected and diagnosed with MERS thereafter. Valuable lessons learned included: (1) epidemiological knowledge on the MERS transmission pattern and medical knowledge on its clinical course; (2) imp...","Background What are the health and wellbeing conditions of people during the COVID-19 outbreak in China? The epidemiological reports now focus on the confirmed COVID-19 cases, and we aim to assess the health and wellbeing of normal adults living and working after one month of public health emergencies into the COVID-19 outbreak in China. Methods One month into the outbreak, on Feb 20/21, 2020, we sampled 369 adults on the eight dimensions of health (SF12), distress (K6), and life satisfaction in 64 cities that varied in their densities of coronavirus confirmed cases. The participants also reported their work status, whether they had chronic health issues, the number of hours they exercised per day in the past week. Findings In general, life of normal adults was severely disrupted. 33% of the participants had not left their home at all during the one-month period due to the restrictive measures to contain COVID-19 in China. 27% of the participants worked at office; 38% resorted to worki...","Abstract Background The novel coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19), which was first detected in Wuhan City, has now became a pandemic that affecting patients around the world. Particularly, the community patient population are at high risk of infection and are facing potential failure of proper medication use during the pandemic. Objective To discuss community pharmacists\u2019 role and the content of pharmaceutical care (PC) during the novel coronavirus pandemic to promote effective prevention and control and safe drug use of the community patient population. Method Collect and summarize the experience Chinese community pharmacies gained from providing pharmacy services during the COVID-19 outbreak, and taking the PC needs into consideration, analyze and discuss the methods and strategies that community pharmacies and pharmacists shall use to provide PC during the pandemic. Results Community pharmacy management teams shall support PC services by providing adequate supply of COVID-19 related me...","Abstract The aim is to diagnose COVID-19 earlier and to improve its treatment by applying medical technology, the \u201cCOVID-19 Intelligent Diagnosis and Treatment Assistant Program (nCapp)\u201d based on the Internet of Things. Terminal eight functions can be implemented in real-time online communication with the \u201ccloud\u201d through the page selection key. According to existing data, questionnaires, and check results, the diagnosis is automatically generated as confirmed, suspected, or suspicious of 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection. It classifies patients into mild, moderate, severe or critical pneumonia. nCapp can also establish an online COVID-19 real-time update database, and it updates the model of diagnosis in real time based on the latest real-world case data to improve diagnostic accuracy. Additionally, nCapp can guide treatment. Front-line physicians, experts, and managers are linked to perform consultation and prevention. nCapp also contributes to the long-term follow-up of pa...","Abstract INDIA- As for reported in 360 COVID-19 cases (till March 22, 2020), seven people were died, and 23 people were treated successfully.1 This virus can easily affect who having respiratory problem and especially who all have been aged older than sixty. Most of the affected peoples had reached India from different part of the world, as like of carrier. Owing to this, India made several precautionary measures to mitigate/neglect the disease in beginning stage, however, the denser population of country will not be simple to control the same for long time (community spread), if government will not incorporate the visionary strategies. Since attacked several nations have been worried mostly for their people life (health), despite that developing country like India with huge population should consider about the livelihood (for Below Poverty Line (BPL) people), equally with the life. This article will give insights to make effective strategy to culminate the world threat COVID-19 in Ind...","Abstract Medicine shortages have been spreading in European countries. In many cases, the unavailability of medicinal products has a substantial impact on the capability of National Healthcare Systems in ensuring the continuity of care. Shortages originate from multifactorial causes. In particular, they can be due to supply-related factors (e.g., manufacturing issues, regulatory issues, logistics, distribution) and demand-related ones (e.g., fluctuating drug demand, parallel market, tendering, price and reimbursement policies). However, some extraordinary geopolitical events (e.g., Brexit) may also affect medicines\u2019 availability. The capability of European Regulatory Authorities and other stakeholders, which are involved in the pharmaceutical distribution chain and the healthcare assistance services, to define suitable problem-solving strategies has been limited for years by the fragmentation of the European regulatory framework, starting from the lack of a univocal definition of a med...","The number of COVID-19 cases is continuously increasing in different countries (as of March 2020) including the Philippines. It is estimated that the basic reproductive number of COVID-19 is around 1.5 to 4. The basic reproductive number characterizes the average number of persons that a primary case can directly infect in a population full of susceptible individuals. However, there can be superspreaders that can infect more than this estimated basic reproductive number. In this study, we formulate a conceptual mathematical model on the transmission dynamics of COVID-19 between the frontliners and the general public. We assume that the general public has a reproductive number between 1.5 to 4, and frontliners (e.g. healthcare workers, customer service and retail personnel, food service crews, and transport or delivery workers) have a higher reproduction number. Our simulations show that both the frontliners and the general public should be protected or resilient against the disease. Pr...","Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is infecting people throughout the world. It is probable that coronavirus disease (COVID-19) will be transmitted to people experiencing homelessness, which will become a major problem in particular in North America where there are sizable populations of people experiencing homelessness in nearly every metropolitan city in the USA and Canada. In the USA, more than 500 000 people were reported to be experiencing homelessness on any given night over the past decade (2007\u201319).1 The State of Homelessness in Canada 2016 report2 estimated 35 000 people are experiencing homelessness on any given night in Canada. People experiencing homelessness live in environments that are conducive to a disease epidemic. Many people experiencing homelessness live in congregate living settings\u2014be it formal (ie, shelters or halfway houses) or informal (ie, encampments or abandoned buildings)\u2014and might not have regular access to basic hygiene supplies...","Summary The COVID-19 pandemics is posing unprecedented challenges and threats to patients and healthcare systems worldwide. Acute respiratory complications that require intensive care unit (ICU) management are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in COVID-19 patients. Patients with worst outcomes and higher mortality are reported to include immunocompromised subjects, namely older adults and polymorbid individuals and malnourished people in general. ICU stay, polymorbidity and older age are all commonly associated with high risk for malnutrition, representing per se a relevant risk factor for higher morbidity and mortality in chronic and acute disease. Also importantly, prolonged ICU stays are reported to be required for COVID-19 patients stabilization, and longer ICU stay may per se directly worsen or cause malnutrition, with severe loss of skeletal muscle mass and function which may lead to disability, poor quality of life and additional morbidity. Prevention, diagnosis and treat...","AbstractThe fast and untraceable virus mutations take lives of thousands of people before the immune system can produce the inhibitory antibody. Recent outbreak of novel coronavirus infected and killed thousands of people in the world. Rapid methods in finding peptides or antibody sequences that can inhibit the viral epitopes of COVID-19 will save the life of thousands. In this paper, we devised a machine learning (ML) model to predict the possible inhibitory synthetic antibodies for Corona virus. We collected 1933 virus-antibody sequences and their clinical patient neutralization response and trained an ML model to predict the antibody response. Using graph featurization with variety of ML methods, we screened thousands of hypothetical antibody sequences and found 8 stable antibodies that potentially inhibit COVID-19. We combined bioinformatics, structural biology, and Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations to verify the stability of the candidate antibodies that can inhibit the Corona v...","Background: The first outbreaks of COVID-19 in Italy occurred during the second half of February 2020 in some areas in the North of the country. Due to the high contagiousness of the infection, further spread by asymptomatic people, Italy has become in a few weeks the country with the greatest number of infected people after China. The large number of severe cases among infected people in Italy led to the hospitalization of thousands of patients, with a heavy burden on the National Health Service. Methods: We analyzed data provided daily by Italian Authorities for the period from 24 February 2020 to 26 March 2020. Considering such information, we developed a forecast model in real-time, based on the cumulative logistic distribution. We then produced an estimate of the overall number of potentially infected individuals and epidemic duration at a national and Regional level, for the most affected Regions. Results: We reported the daily distribution of performed swabs and confirmed cases,...","Purpose: The COVID-19 death-rate in Italy continues to climb, surpassing that in every other country. We implement one of the first nationally representative surveys about this unprecedented public health crisis and use it to evaluate the Italian government's public health efforts and citizen responses. Findings: (1) Public health messaging is being heard. At this point, the Italian people understand how to keep themselves and others safe from the SARS-Cov-2 virus. This is true for all population groups we studied, with the partial exception of slightly lower compliance among young adults. Remarkably, even those who do not trust the government, and those who think the government has been untruthful about the crisis mostly believe the public health message and claim to be acting in accordance. (2) The quarantine is beginning to have serious negative effects on the population's mental health. Policy Recommendations: Public health messaging is being heard and understood. The focus now sho...","What has happened in China shows that quarantine, social distancing, and isolation of infected populations can contain the epidemic.1 This impact of the COVID-19 response in China is encouraging for the many countries where COVID-19 is beginning to spread. However, it is unclear whether other countries can implement the stringent measures China eventually adopted. Singapore and Hong Kong, both of which had severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemics in 2002\u201303, provide hope and many lessons to other countries. In both places, COVID-19 has been managed well to date, despite early cases, by early government action and through social distancing measures taken by individuals. The course of an epidemic is defined by a series of key factors, some of which are poorly understood at present for COVID-19. The basic reproduction number (R0), which defines the mean number of secondary cases generated by one primary case when the population is largely susceptible to infection, determines the...","Background: Since late December 2019, novel coronavirus-infected pneumonia (NCP) emerged in Wuhan, Hubei province, China. Meanwhile, NCP rapidly spread from China to other countries, and several countries' government rush to evacuate their citizens from Wuhan. We analyzed the infection rate of the evacuees and extrapolated the results in Wuhan's NCP incidence estimation. Methods: We collected the total number and confirmed cases of 2019-nCov infection in the evacuation of Korea, Japan, Germany, Singapore, and France and estimated the infection rate of the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCov) among people who were evacuated from Wuhan with a meta-analysis. NCP incidence of Wuhan was indirectly estimated based on data of evacuation. Results: From Jan 29 to Feb 2, 2020, 1916 people have been evacuated from Wuhan, among them 17 have been confirmed 2019-nCov infected. The infection rate is estimated to be 1.1% (95% CI 0.4%-3.1%) using one group meta-analysis method with random effect model. W...","Background The epidemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 was first reported in Wuhan, China, and now is spreading worldwide. The Chinese government responded to this epidemic with multiple public health policies including locking down the city of Wuhan, establishing multiple temporary hospitals, and prohibiting public gathering events. Here, we constructed a new real-time status dynamic model of SEIO (MH) to reveal the influence of national public health policies and to model the epidemic in Wuhan. Methods A real-time status dynamic model was proposed to model the population of Wuhan in status Susceptible (S), Exposed (E), Infected with symptoms (I), with Medical care (M), and Out of the system (O) daily. Model parameters were fitted according to the daily report of new infections from Jan. 27th, 2020 to Feb. 2nd, 2020. Using the fitted parameters, the epidemic under different conditions was simulated and compared with the current situation. Finding According to our study, the first patient is mos...","The COVID-19 disease is rapidly spreading in whole globe, affecting millions of people and pushing governments to take drastic measures to contain the outbreaks. The understanding of the dynamics of the epidemic is of great interest for the governments and health authorities that are facing COVID-19 outbreaks. The scarce presence of epidemiologic data, due to the still ongoing outbreaks, makes prediction difficult and mainly based on heuristic (fitting) models. However, these models with non-physical based parameters, can only give limited insight in the evolution of the outbreaks. In this work a SIRD compartmental model was developed to describe and predict the evolution of the Chinese and Italian outbreaks. Exploiting the similarities of the measures taken by the governments to contain the virus and of the total population number of Hubei province and Italy, the model was tuned on the Chinese outbreak (almost extinguished) and by perturbation the Italian outbreak was describe and pre...","The 13th ERS Lung Science Conference (LSC) was organised to bring academics together from all over the world to present and discuss the latest developments regarding lung infection and immunity. The conference took place in breathtaking Estoril, Portugal; however, it wasn\u2019t the beautiful surroundings that were our main motivation to attend, but instead the scientific merit of the conference and the chance to create new scientific collaborations. The scientific programme [1] was packed with the most up-to-date content in the field of lung infection and immunity and included some of the top researchers within this exciting area. Moreover, the convenient size of the LSC offered the opportunity to renew and intensify friendships and collaborations. In particular, for researchers at the start of their career, this is a great feature and we therefore warmly recommend the LSC to ERS Juniors Members!","Summary Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a respiratory tract infection caused by a newly emergent coronavirus, that was first recognized in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. Currently, the World Health Organization (WHO) has defined the infection as a global pandemic and there is a health and social emergency for the management of this new infection. While most people with COVID-19 develop only mild or uncomplicated illness, approximately 14% develop severe disease that requires hospitalization and oxygen support, and 5% require admission to an intensive care unit (1). In severe cases, COVID-19 can be complicated by the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), sepsis and septic shock, and multiorgan failure. This consensus document has been prepared on evidence-informed guidelines developed by a multidisciplinary panel of health care providers from four spanish scientific societies (Spanish Society of Intensive Care Medicine [SEMICYUC], Spanish Society of Pulmonologists [SEPAR],...","Abstract Although Intensive Care Medicine is a young specialty compared with other medical disciplines, it currently plays a key role in the process of care for many patients. Experience has shown that professionals with specific training in Intensive Care Medicine are needed to provide high quality care to critically ill patients. In Europe, important steps have been taken towards the standardization of training programs of the different member states. However, it is now necessary to take one more step forward, that is, the creation of a primary specialty in Intensive Care Medicine. Care of the critically ill needs to be led by specialists who have received specific and complete training and who have the necessary professional competences to provide maximum quality care to their patients. The future of the specialty presents challenges that must be faced with determination, with the main objective of meeting the needs of the population.","The purpose of this article is to reach all those who find it difficult to become well informed about the repercussions of a lockdown strategy to tackle the COVID-19 pandemic and to spark discussion and thought. Here we use simple stochastic simulations to evaluate different approaches taken to tackle the crisis, along with the efficiency they will hold and the number of casualties they may incur. It is clear that the less strict the social distancing the more time it will take for life to return to normal, and the more lives will be at risk. This is shown through simulations formed by an open sourced code, which allows evaluation of the outcomes from different intervention scenarios or conditions.","Clinical assessment of possible infection with SARS-CoV-2, the novel coronavirus responsible for the outbreak of COVID-19 respiratory illness, has been a major activity of infectious diseases services in the UK and elsewhere since the first report of cases in December 2019. We report our case series of 68 patients, reviewed by Infectious Diseases Consultants at a Regional Infectious Diseases Unit in the UK. We prospectively evaluated our service between the 29th Jan 2020 and 24th Feb 2020. Demographic, clinical, epidemiological and laboratory data were collected. We have compared clinical features and subsequent diagnosis between well patients not requiring admission for clinical reasons or antimicrobials with those assessed as needing either admission or antimicrobial treatment. Final microbiological diagnoses included SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19), Mycoplasma pneumonia, influenza A, RSV, non SARS/MERS coronaviruses, rhinovirus/enterovirus. 9/68 were treated with antimicrobials, 15/68 were ad...","To date, official data on the number of people infected with the SARS-CoV-2 , responsible for the CoViD19 , have been released by the Italian Government just on the basis of a non representative sample of population which tested positive for the swab. However a reliable estimation of the number of infected, including asymptomatic people, turns out to be crucial in the preparation of operational schemes and to estimate the future number of people, who will require, to different extents, medical attentions. In order to overcome the current data shortcoming, this paper proposes a bootstrap driven, estimation procedure for the number of people infected with the SARSCoV2. This method is designed to be robust, automatic and suitable to generate estimations at regional level. Obtained results show that, while official data at March the 12th report 12.839 cases in Italy, people infected wiyh the SARSCoV2 could be as high as 105.789.","In March 2020, Coronavirus Disease 2019 originating from Wuhan, China, has become pandemic. Based on epidemic data from China we constructed and constrained a simple Susceptible-Infected-Infectious-Excluded (SIIE) model. The model is characterized by only three parameters: average incubation period, contact rate rC, and exclusion rate rE. These two rates control the daily multiplication coefficient \u03b2 describing epidemic growth in its early exponential phase, during which the number of excluded (confirmed) individuals grows as E = E0 exp(\u03b1,t) with \u03b1 = ln\u03b2. The rates can be modified by non-therapeutic interventions: rC can be reduced by quarantine, while rE can be increased by efficient testing, enabling isolation of infectious individuals. In order to contain exponential epidemic growth, quotient rC/rE has to be reduced to 1. Based on the model, we estimate that the quarantine imposed in China on January 23, 2020 resulted in about 50-fold reduction of this quotient, allowing to terminat...","Abstract The globe is currently in the midst of a COVID-19 pandemic resulting in significant morbidity and mortality. This pandemic has placed considerable stress on health care resources and providers. This document from the Canadian Association of Interventional Cardiology - Association Canadienne de Cardiologie d'intervention, specifically addresses the implications for the care of patients in the Cardiac Catheterization Laboratory (CCL) in Canada during the COVID-19 pandemic. The key principles of this document are to maintain essential interventional cardiovascular care while minimizing risks of COVID-19 to patients/staff and maintaining the overall healthcare resources. As the COVID-19 pandemic evolves, procedures will be increased or reduced based on the current level of restriction to health care services. While some consistency across the country is desirable, provincial and regional considerations will influence how these recommendations are implemented. We believe the framew...","The COVID-19 Acute and Intense Resource Tool (CAIC-RT) is an interactive online tool capable of estimating the maximum daily number of incident COVID- 19 cases that a healthcare system could manage given age-based case distribution and severity.","Abstract Covid-19 is a global pandemic that is wreaking havoc with the health and economy of much of human civilization. Electrophysiologists have been impacted personally and professionally by this global catastrophe. In this joint document from representatives of the HRS, ACC and AHA we identify the potential risks of exposure to patients, allied health care staff, industry representatives and hospital administrators. We describe the impact of COVID-19 on cardiac arrhythmias and methods of triage based on acuity and patient comorbidities. We provide guidance for managing invasive and non-invasive electrophysiology procedures, clinic visits and cardiac device interrogations. We discuss resource conservation and the role of tele-medicine in remote patient care along with management strategies for affected patients.","There is a new public health crises threatening the world with the emergence and spread of 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) or the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The virus originated in bats and was transmitted to humans through yet unknown intermediary animals in Wuhan, Hubei province, China in December 2019. There have been around 96,000 reported cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-2019) and 3300 reported deaths to date (05/03/2020). The disease is transmitted by inhalation or contact with infected droplets and the incubation period ranges from 2 to 14 d. The symptoms are usually fever, cough, sore throat, breathlessness, fatigue, malaise among others. The disease is mild in most people; in some (usually the elderly and those with comorbidities), it may progress to pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and multi organ dysfunction. Many people are asymptomatic. The case fatality rate is estimated to range from 2 to 3%. Diagnosis is...","Objectives: To report our experiences screening and managing patients with suspected or confirmed novel coronavirus (COVID-19) disease using a hospital-specific protocol. Design: Longitudinal cohort study. Setting: A 1,200 bed tertiary care teaching hospital in Chengdu, Sichuan, China. Participants: 802 adults presenting to hospital with concerns of having COVID-19, 1,246 inpatients and 2,531 hospital visitors. Interventions: Screening and management of patients using a hospital-specific protocol, which included fever triage, monitoring visitors and patients, emergency response, personnel training for healthcare team members, health education for patients and family, medical materials management, disinfection and wastes disposal protocols. Results: Between 23 January and 28 February 2020, 73 people were identified as having fever plus respiratory signs with/without a history of exposure and were tested for the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) by our hospital...","Abstract The viral epidemic caused by the new Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 is responsible for the new Coronavirus disease -2019 (Covid-19). This epidemic imposes upheavals in our organizations in healthcare centres which should not obscure the importance of nutritional care. The nutritional diagnosis and the early nutritional care management of Covid-19 infected patients must be integrated into the overall therapeutic strategy, as with any acute situation of acute illness. This document was prepared by the French speaking Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism (SFNCM) in the emergency of the health crisis by a group of experts, based on the national and international recommendations available in the field of malnutrition, critical illness, metabolic stress and intensive care medicine on March 23, 2020. We hope that this article will bring to healthcare professionals, especially those not specialized in nutrition, useful landmarks to help them to manage hospitalized patients, infected ...","","The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic emerged in Wuhan, China, spread nationwide and then onto half a dozen other countries between December 2019 and early 2020. The implementation of unprecedented strict quarantine measures in China has kept a large number of people in isolation and affected many aspects of people\u2019s lives. It has also triggered a wide variety of psychological problems, such as panic disorder, anxiety and depression. This study is the first nationwide large-scale survey of psychological distress in the general population of China during the COVID-19 epidemic.","","As of March 5, 2020, there has been sustained local transmission of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Hong Kong, Singapore, and Japan.1 Containment strategies seem to have prevented smaller transmission chains from amplifying into widespread community transmission. The health systems in these locations have generally been able to adapt,2 , 3 but their resilience could be affected if the COVID-19 epidemic continues for many more months and increasing numbers of people require services. We outline some of the core dimensions of these resilient health systems4 and their responses to the COVID-19 epidemic. First, after variable periods of adaptation, the three locations took actions to manage the outbreak of a new pathogen. Surveillance systems were readjusted to identify potential cases while public health staff identified their contacts. National laboratory networks developed diagnostic tests once the COVID-19 genetic sequences were published5 and laboratory testing capacity was inc...","Recently, more than 300 Chinese patients with psychiatric disorders were diagnosed with the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19). Possible reasons quoted in the report were the lack of caution regarding the COVID-19 outbreak in January and insufficient supplies of protective gear. We outlined major challenges for patients with psychiatric disorders and mental health professionals during the COVID-19 outbreak, and also discussed how to manage these challenges through further mental health service reform in China.","Summary Increasing international travel and migration can interfere with public health in both the country of destination and back home. The revised International Health Regulations (IHR) and travel disease sentinel networks are means to protect public and individual health. Public health risks related to infectious disease are higher in mass gatherings, in travellers visiting friends and relatives and in sexual encounters away from home. In contrast, in-flight transmission of infections plays only a limited role.","BACKGROUND The outbreak of the new coronavirus infection in Wuhan City, Hubei Province in December 2019, poses a huge threat to China and even global public health security. Respiratory droplets and contact transmission are the main routes of transmission of new coronaviruses. Compared with SARS and Ebola viruses, new coronavirus infections are infectious during the incubation period. Traditional SEIR (susceptibility-exposure-infection-Removal) There are some differences in conditions for the prediction of the epidemic trend of new coronavirus infection. The outbreak of the new coronavirus infection coincided with the Spring Festival before and after the Chinese Spring Festival.It is necessary to make appropriate optimization and amendments to the traditional model to meet the actual evolution of the epidemic situation. METHODS The traditional SEIR model assumes that the virus-infected person is not infectious during the incubation period and that the infected person did not take isola...","Abstract Based on its forensic capacity and experience gained worldwide from the management of the dead in emergencies, including epidemics, the International Committee of the Red Cross have been asked by the authorities and other relevant stakeholders to advise on the management of the dead from COVID-19 infection, for which it has prepared the following guidance. This includes advice on the handling of COVID-19 fatalities and a set of considerations for managers faced with the need to plan for adequately responding to a possible surge in fatalities caused by COVID-19.","Mobile phone apps implementing algorithmic contact tracing can speed up the process of tracing newly diagnosed individuals, spreading information instantaneously back through a past contact network to inform them that they are at risk of being infected, and thus allow them to take appropriate social distancing and testing measures. The aim of non-pharmaceutical infection prevention is to move a population towards herd protection, a state where a population maintains R\u200b0&lt;\u200b1, thus making it impossible for a pathogen to cause an epidemic. Here, we address epidemiological issues that affect the feasibility of an algorithmic approach to instantaneous contact tracing; ethical and implementation issues are addressed separately. First we quantify the parameters of COVID-19 in a framework that is consistent with the renewal equation formulation of epidemic spread. Second, we use an analytical solution to application of first-degree contact tracing in the renewal equation model to explore combin...","A SEIR simulation model for the COVID-19 pandemic was developed (http://covidsim.eu) and applied to a hypothetical European country of 10 million population. Our results show which interventions potentially push the epidemic peak into the subsequent year (when vaccinations may be available) or which fail. Different levels of control (via contact reduction) resulted in 22% to 63% of the population sick, 0.2% to 0.6% hospitalised, and 0.07% to 0.28% dead (n=6,450 to 28,228).","Abstract An outbreak of COVID-19 in Wuhan, China caused by SARS-CoV-2 has led to a serious epidemic in China and other countries, resulting in worldwide concern. With the active efforts from prevention and control, the quantity of discharged patients is escalating. How to manage these patients normatively is still challenging. We hereby reported an asymptomatic discharged patient with COVID-19 who was retested positive for SARS-CoV-2, which arouses concern regarding the present discharge standard of COVID-19.","Much of the uncertainty about the progression of the COVID-19 pandemic stems from questions about when and how non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPI) by governments, in particular social distancing measures, are implemented, to what extent the population complies with these measures, and how compliance changes through time. Further uncertainty comes from a lack of knowledge of the potential effects of removing interventions once the epidemic is declining. By combining an epidemiological model of COVID-19 for the United Kingdom with simple sub-models for these societal processes, this study aims to shed light on the conceivable trajectories that the pandemic might follow over the next 1.5 years. We show strong improvements in outcomes if governments review NPI more frequently whereas, in comparison, the stability of compliance has surprisingly small effects on cumulative mortality. Assuming that mortality does considerably increase once a country's hospital capacity is breached, we show...","The rapid spread of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) presents China with a critical challenge. As normal capacity of the Chinese hospitals is exceeded, healthcare professionals struggling to manage this unprecedented crisis face the difficult question of how best to coordinate the medical resources used in highly separated locations. Responding rapidly to this crisis, the National Telemedicine Center of China (NTCC), located in Zhengzhou, Henan Province, has established the Emergency Telemedicine Consultation System (ETCS), a telemedicine-enabled outbreak alert and response network. ETCS is built upon a doctor-to-doctor (D2D) approach, in which health services can be accessed remotely through terminals across hospitals. The system architecture of ETCS comprises three major architectural layers: (1) telemedicine service platform layer, (2) telemedicine cloud layer, and (3) telemedicine service application layer. Our ETCS has demonstrated substantial benefits in terms of the effective...","AbstractAs reported by the World Health Organization, a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) was identified as the causative virus of Wuhan pneumonia of unknown etiology by Chinese authorities on 7 January, 2020. In this study, we developed a Bats-Hosts-Reservoir-People transmission network model for simulating the potential transmission from the infection source (probable be bats) to the human infection. Since the Bats-Hosts-Reservoir network was hard to explore clearly and public concerns were focusing on the transmission from a seafood market (reservoir) to people, we simplified the model as Reservoir-People transmission network model. The basic reproduction number (R0) was calculated from the RP model to assess the transmissibility of the 2019-nCoV.","Abstract At present, the situation of global fight against COVID-19 is serious. WHO (World Health Organization)-China Joint Mission fully confirms the success of \u201cChina's model\u201d against COVID-19 in the report. In fact, one particular power in \u201cChina's model\u201d is acupuncture and moxibustion of traditional Chinese medicine. To better apply \u201cnon-pharmaceutic measures\u201d\u2014the external technique of traditional Chinese medicine, in the article, the main content of Guidance for acupuncture and moxibustion interventions on COVID-19 (Second edition) issued by China Association of Acupuncture\u2013Moxibution is introduced and the discussion is stressed on the selection of moxibustion device and the duration of its exertion.","Abstract A novel coronavirus designated as 2019-nCoV first appeared in Wuhan, China in late December 2019. Dozens of people died in China, and thousands of people infected as 2019-nCoV continues to spread around the world. We have described the discovery, emergence, genomic characteristics, and clinical diagnostics of 2019-nCoV."],"title":["Prospect and application of Internet of Things technology for prevention of SARIs","Mobility traces and spreading of COVID-19","Novel coronavirus: how things are in Wuhan","Chapter 4 Terms Vocabulary, Taxonomy, and Ontology","Home care for cancer patients during COVID-19 pandemic: the \u201cdouble triage\u201d protocol.","The first case of the 2015 Korean Middle East Respiratory Syndrome outbreak","Health, distress, and life satisfaction of people one-month into COVID-19 outbreak in China","Recommendations and guidance for providing pharmaceutical care services during COVID-19 pandemic: A China perspective","Chinese experts\u2019 consensus on the Internet of Things-aided diagnosis and treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)","COVID 19 in INDIA: Strategies to combat from combination threat of life and livelihood","New regulatory strategies to manage medicines shortages in Europe","A mathematical model of COVID-19 transmission between frontliners and the general public","COVID-19: a potential public health problem for homeless populations","Espen expert statements and practical guidance for nutritional management of individuals with sars-cov-2 infection","Potential Neutralizing Antibodies Discovered for Novel Corona Virus Using Machine Learning","First month of the epidemic caused by COVID-19 in Italy: current status and real-time outbreak development forecast","Evaluating COVID-19 Public Health Messaging in Italy: Self-Reported Compliance and Growing Mental Health Concerns","How will country-based mitigation measures influence the course of the COVID-19 epidemic?","Epidemic size of novel coronavirus-infected pneumonia in the Epicenter Wuhan: using data of five-countries' evacuation action","Revealing the influence of national public health policies for the outbreak of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in Wuhan, China through status dynamic modeling","Chinese and Italian COVID-19 outbreaks can be correctly described by a modified SIRD model","13th ERS Lung Science Conference.

If people do start to take this lockdown less seriously -especially young people who believe that they will not get gravely ill due to their youth -it might result in things looking more like Figure 7 , with the 'lockdown' taking over 6+ months and resulting in more than 300, 000 fatalities. This reflects just how important it is to stay at home; the more relaxed we become the longer this is going to take with more deaths occurring, which is what no one wants.","We note that a total of about 131,132 people were quarantined during March\u2013July 2003 [12]. Hence, the effect of people being sick and dying (including the caregivers being away from work and caring for the sick) can have influence on daily ridership. In other words, the fear factor may also implicitly represent effect from people being sick and by people being home caring for the sick. The Level A quarantine was started on 18 March, for those who had been in close contact with a SARS patient were quarantined from 10\u201314 days. These people include health-care workers, (1751), family members (6663), co-workers and friends (4351), classmates and teachers (14,919), passengers sitting adjacent to SARS patients (1380), discharged suspect and probable SARS patient (1796), and others (19i,459). A total of 50,319 people were Level A quarantined. The Level B quarantine, stared on 28 April, applied to those traveled from SARS-related areas. A total of 80,813 people were Level B quarantined for 10 days.","be delivered. For example, mental health professionals, social workers, nursing home administrators, and volunteers should deliver mental health care for people living with dementia collaboratively. Within such a team, dementia experts could take the lead and support team members from other disciplines. Self-help guidance for reducing stress, such as relaxation or meditation exercise, could be delivered through electronic media. Service teams could support behavioural management through telephone hotlines. Psychological counsellors could provide online consultation for carers at home and in nursing homes. 11 In addition, we encourage people who have a parent with dementia to have more frequent contact or spend more time with their parent, or to take on some of the caregiving duties so as to give the carer some respite time.","We shall now begin the derivation of the Coronavirus dynamic model. The derivation is involved, and the final model itself is (7). The flow diagram of people from one category to the other looks like the following, where R denotes a flow rate (i.e. d/dt of a population). In this schematic, R1 is the rate at which healthy, at-large people fall sick, R2 is the rate at which people arrive for quarantine and testing, R3 is the rate at which positive results are detected and R4 is the rate at which negative results are detected. We take for granted that every person who is tested for the virus is in quarantine. We shall now elaborate on the functional forms of these rates. is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the (which was not peer-reviewed) The copyright holder for this preprint . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03. 29.20047035 doi: medRxiv preprint Tradition has it to make R1 proportional to the number of healthy (and susceptible -even when we don't mention this explicitly) people and the number of sick people, i.e. to make R1 have the form kxy where k is some constant. We follow the tradition with a variation. First, recall that by our definition, sick people stay sick for all time. However, they do not transmit the disease for all time. Consider an asymptomatic carrier who remains exposed to society throughout. We assume that the number of asymptomatics is proportional to the total number of sick people exposed to society, i.e. we let the number of asymptomatics be \u03bc1y where \u03bc1 is a number between 0 and 1. After falling sick, an asymptomatic carrier can transmit the disease for 7-10 days, which is called the infection period [46] . Thus, new healthy people can be only be infected by those asymptomatic sick people who have fallen sick within the last 7-10 days, and not those who have fallen sick earlier. The number of such people is the number of asymptomatic sick people today minus the number of those 7-10 days earlier i.e. it is ( )","A key challenge to nursing home and assisted living (AL) facilities during any disaster scenario is the maintenance of adequate staffing levels. All long-term care facilities must have a policy in place that identifies workers who become sick and allows them to be absent from work. Guidance proposed by AMDA includes screening employees at entry for signs of infection. Protocols must also be developed that ensure staffing levels if an employee needs to call off or be sent home. It is noteworthy that many long-term care workers live paycheck to paycheck in an environment without reserve staffing; they therefore may be conditioned to report even when sick. Providing a work environment that allows healthcare workers to call out without repercussion will be critically important. Within the facility, protecting workers involves maintaining an adequate supply of gowns, gloves, and face masks. This involves both keeping track and awareness of inventory and negotiating with suppliers and public health officials who might seek to redirect limited resources to other healthcare environments.","After staying in Bahrain for two weeks, a 68 year old male (68 M) travelled home to South Korea via Qatar, arriving free of symptoms on the 4th May 2015 [187]. He developed fever, myalgia and a cough nearly a week later (11th). He visited a clinic as an outpatient between the 12th and 15th of May and was admitted to Hospital A on the 15th [188]. He was discharged from Hospital A on the 17th then visited and was admitted to the emergency department of Hospital B on the 18th. During this second stay, a sputum sample was taken and tested positive for MERS-CoV on the 20th [187, 188], triggering transfer to the designated isolation treatment facility. Over a period of 10 days, the index case was seen at three different hospitals, demonstrating a key feature of \u201chospital shopping\u201d that shaped the South Korean outbreak. Approximately 34 people were infected during this time [187]. In total 186 cases were generated in this outbreak, all linked through a single transmission chain to 68 M; 37 cases died [189]. In South Korea, the national health insurance system provides for relatively low cost medical care, defraying some costs by making family members responsible for a portion of the ministration of the sick, resulting in them sometimes staying for long periods in the rooms that often have more than four beds in them [24]. Other factors thought to have enabled this outbreak included unfamiliarity of local clinicians with MERS, ease with which the public can visit and be treated by tertiary hospitals, the custom of visiting sick friends and relatives in hospitals, the hierarchical nature of Korean society, crowded emergency rooms, poor IPC measures, a lack of negative pressure isolation rooms and poor inter-hospital communication of patient disease histories [24, 190\u2013192]. All of the reported transmission occurred across three or four generations and apart from one unknown source, were all hospital-acquired [24, 120, 181, 193\u2013195]. Few clinical details about these cases have been reported to date and detail on transmission and contact tracing is minimal. The hospitals involved were initially not identified, governmental guidance and actions produced confusing messages and there was very limited communication at all early on which resulted in unnecessary concern, distrust and a distinct economic impact [191, 196\u2013198]. Early in the outbreak, a infected traveller, the son of an identified case in South Korea, passed through Hong Kong on his way to China where he was located, isolated and cared for in China [91, 199, 200]. No contacts became ill. The outbreak was brought under control in late July/ early August [201] after improved IPC measures were employed, strong contact tracing monitoring and quarantine, expanded laboratory testing, hospitals were better secured, specialized personnel were dispatched to manage cases and international cooperation increased [202, 203]. A review of public data showed that, as for MERS in the KSA, older age and the presence of underlying disease were significantly associated with a fatal outcome in South Korea. [40] Even though R0 is &lt;1, super-spreading events facilitated by circumstances created in healthcare settings and characterized by cluster sizes over 150, such as this one, are not unexpected from MERS-CoV infection [204]. The dynamic of an outbreak depends on the R0 and an individual\u2019s viral shedding patterns, contact type and frequency, hospital procedures and population structure and density [204].","The societal and economic impact of these changes at this time is too large to assess. All schools are closed requiring childcare to be provided at home, social and professional meetings are cancelled, public spaces closed, the mobility of people is restricted to only attend work or for health reasons, and many businesses are closed, including all restaurants and entertainment venues. These measures are combined with existing recommendations from the World Health Organisation for people to wash their hands frequently; avoid touching their eyes, nose, and mouth; by covering the mouth and nose with a tissue when sneezing or coughing and disposing of the tissue immediately and washing hands; keeping an interpersonal distance of at least one meter; avoiding gatherings; and using a surgical mask in the presence of people suspected of being sick. The primary aim of these measures is to flatten the growth curve of new cases, thereby reducing the number of people who will simultaneously require intensive care as well as the overall mortality. As of March 11, 2020, 1,028 of the approximately 5,200 intensive care beds within Italy were already occupied with COVID-19 patients (1) . Parallel to these governmental directives, the Ministry of Health implemented extensive reorganization of national healthcare services to facilitate the treatment of the large numbers of patients who will need intensive support therapy.","(whether cultural, sporting, recreational, or religious). Depending on the country, the policy can prohibit a gathering above a certain size, in which case the number of people is specified by the \" No_gathering_size \" variable. g. \" no_demonstration \": A policy that prohibits protest-specific gatherings. See the section on Korean policy for more information on this policy variable. h. \" social_distance \": A policy that encourages people to maintain a safety distance (often between one to two meters) from others. This policy differs by country, but includes other policies that close cultural institutions (e.g. museums or libraries), or encourage establishments to reduce density, such as limiting restaurant hours. 3. Quarantine and lockdown: a. \" pos_cases_quarantine \": A policy that mandates that people who have tested positive for COVID-19, or subject to quarantine measures, have to confine themselves at home. The policy can also include encouraging people who have fevers or respiratory symptoms to stay at home, regardless of whether they tested positive or not. b. \" home_isolation \": A policy that prohibits people from leaving their home regardless of their testing status. For some countries, the policy can also include the case when people have to stay at home, but are allowed to leave for work-or health-related purposes. For the latter case, when the policy is moderate, this is coded as ' home_isolation = 0.5.' 4. Additional policies a. \" emergency_declaration \": A decision made at the city/municipality, county, state/provincial, or federal level to declare a state of emergency. This allows the affected area to marshal emergency funds and resources as well as activate emergency legislation. b. \" paid_sick_leave \": A policy where employees receive pay while they are not working due to the illness.","The average generation interval of COVID-19 is about 5 days 11, 12, 13 . (Note that estimates of reproductive numbers are proportional to the assumed generation time.) On average, it take patients 2 days after the start of the infectious period, which can precede symptoms, to seek medical care or report illness 14 . Among sick contacts, 80% are traced by public health and quarantined at home. When individuals practice social distancing such as staying at home, contacts will spend more time with each other by a factor of 1.5. For example, a person who usually spends 12 hours a day with family now spends 18 hours with them. For cases isolated at home, routine precautions reduce household transmission by 50%.","You cannot treat such patients sitting at home, though telemedicine may have some role in avoiding excess physical proximity. Will a doctor devoid of adequate PPE and facilities see suspected patients? Would they risk their health while working in such environment? Would their family members pressurise them to take leave in view of risk? Devoid of adequate protective gear, some doctors are terrified in UK and thinking of leaving medicine as a profession (3) . Barring a few such instances, most doctors worldwide would go ahead and manage such patients despite problems. That is what they have been taught and that is what they should do. That does not mean that such brave decisions should be taken for granted. I strongly believe that this is a war like situation, and akin to army, doctors and healthcare workers working with Covid-19 patients should be given extra allowance and adequate rest/leaves to overcome physical and mental fatigue. As a senior physician in Wuhan General hospital remarked; \"If we let ourselves be nervous, then what would happen to the people?\" (3) . In India, a critical care expert spoke to me in anonymity; \"All members of my team are anxious, but we are well trained now to fight it, and we will.\" All of us should have nothing but admiration for these doctors.

In addition, participants were asked about the use of non-pharmacological measures (frequent hand washing, use of alcohol-based hand sanitizers and handwashing at home after touching potentially contaminated surfaces on public transport or in shops, for example) in the seven days before the onset of symptoms in cases and the seven days before the onset of symptoms in the matched case in controls.","These resources focus on concrete tips to build positive relationships, divert and manage bad behaviour, and manage parenting stress. They are shared through social media, and they are accessible on nonsmartphones through the Internet of Good Things. A team of international volunteers are producing translations in 55 languages. Importantly, these parenting resources are based on robust evidence from randomised controlled trials in low-income and middle-income countries.

We need to utilise effective strategies to strengthen families to respond, care, and protect a future for the world's children. 5 We declare no competing interests.","On March 16, 2020 , the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the White House launched a '15 Days to Slow the Spread' campaign, requesting that anyone who feels sick, is in a household with someone who has tested positive for COVID-19, or is elderly or with a serious underlying medical condition, stay at home. 2 Additionally, they requested that people work or engage in school remotely whenever possible, avoid discretionary travel, and avoid gatherings of more than 10 people.","It is essential that we prepare ourselves for what seems like will be the inevitability of having the virus at our doorstep, but we must think ahead to enact common sense policies that will not cripple the normal functioning of our healthcare institutions. That may mean sending people home while waiting for a test result to come back or even providing home care to mild cases, 64 Developing countries face with more critical challenges during outbreaks compared with higher income countries, preventing effective management worldwide (Major Issues and Challenges of Influenza Pandemic Preparedness in Developing Countries: oshitani). The lack of IPC in developing countries with limited resources is a major dilemma that leads to high rates of healthcare-associated infections. 65 Hand hygiene is arguably, the most important infection control procedure, and is often neglected by health-care workers in these countries. 66 While developing countries still lack the equipment, expertise, and health infrastructure to detect and manage patients, 65 SARS-CoV-2 is spreading rapidly in these unprepared countries . 67 It has been recommended to promptly prioritize resources, precise surveillance, and capacity development in countries with low preparedness for diagnosing the virus and limiting transmission. 68","The outcome of each pathogen depends on its R0 value and the population of this closed community ( Table 2) . Instead of focusing prevention and control efforts on preventing the spread of the epidemic, reducing the spread rate and losses, two things are waiting to happen: first, it is expected that specific drugs or vaccines for COVID-19 will be developed as soon as possible; Second, it is expected that more and more healthy young and middle-aged people infected with the virus will be able to develop immunity, thus establishing a group immunity barrier to protect the most dangerous old, weak, sick and disabled. ","On 10 January, the World Health Organization (WHO) published a range of interim guidance for all countries on how they can prepare for nCoV, including how to monitor for sick people, test samples, treat patients, control infection in health centres, maintain the right supplies, and communicate with the public about this novel virus (WHO, 2020a) .","\u2022 Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands. \u2022 Avoid close contact with people who are sick. \u2022 If you feel unwell, stay at home, do not attend work or school. \u2022 Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then throw the tissue in a bin. \u2022 Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces in the home and work environment.","These control measures, along with the professional handling of suspected cases and close contacts, were very effective. Two things were important for disease prevention: avoiding close contact with people whenever possible and wearing masks when contact is required. COVID-19 is apparently more contagious than SARS and, without protection, people can be easily infected by close contact. However, some close contact is inevitable, such as buying necessities and seeing doctors. COVID-19 is transmitted by saliva droplets, contact, and other transmission routes such as aerosols, 23 .24 which can be prevented by wearing masks.","The qualitative discrepancy between SEIR models and actual data suggests that the SEIR ordinary differential equations must be replaced by delay differential equations that explicitly take into account the fact that people who recover at time became sick at earlier times. In this paper, a very simple time-delay model is proposed that gives a reasonably good account of the China and South Korea and data.","CHWs could undertake regular review of vulnerable people at home in person or virtually, depending on need, and when patients become ill CHWs could undertake simple assessment of the need for more advanced care, reporting to other members of the primary care team, including to the COVID-19 Health Management Team that is being commissioned. CHWs would need to be provided with personal protective and other equipment and trained to follow protocols to assess temperature, blood pressure, and, with the provision of portable pulse oximeters, early detection of severe illness, thus collecting data for clinical and epidemiological purposes. Similar protocols are already in place and used by CHWs in diverse settings-eg, as part of the Integrated Management of Newborn and Childhood Illness. 5 Additionally, home visits for vulnerable people would allow CHWs to assess whether individuals have adequate supplies of food and medicines for long-term conditions, are aware of basic hygiene precautions, and whether they have mental health problems. In future, CHWs might be involved in COVID-19 community testing and possibly supporting vaccine trials. Over time, CHWs might also contribute to the management of long-term conditions through monitoring physical and mental health, and reviewing availability and use of medicines.","After the consensus version 1 was published, 14 it was warmly welcomed. However, some improvements were required while applying this consensus. Hence, we have revised the consensus based on these valuable opinions and published it in English to meet more requirements. The IoT was originally referred to as radio-frequency identification technology and equipment combined with the Internet based on the agreed communication protocol to achieve intelligent management of item information. Today, this concept has been expanded and deepened, that is, the use of communication technologies such as local networks or the Internet to connect sensors, machines, people, and things to achieve the connection between people and things, things and things, people-oriented informationization, and remote control and intelligent management. The most basic functional feature of the IoT is ''ubiquitous connectivity.\" Its three basic processes are comprehensive perception ? reliable transmission ? intelligent processing. The application of the IoT to medicine is referred to as the medical IoT (MIoT), [15] [16] [17] [18] which aims to establish a decision-oriented big data analysis model supported by information technology such as communication, electronics, biology, and medicine.","Evaluate and Manage HCP with Symptoms of Respiratory Illness Implement sick leave policies that are non-punitive, flexible, and consistent with public health policies that allow ill HCP to stay home. As part of routine practice, ask HCP (including consultant personnel) to regularly monitor themselves for fever and symptoms of respiratory infection. Remind HCP to stay home when they are ill. If HCP develop fever or symptoms of respiratory infection while at work, they should immediately put on a facemask, inform their supervisor, and leave the workplace. Consult occupational health on decisions about further evaluation and return to work. When transmission in the community is identified, nursing homes and assisted living facilities may face staffing shortages. Facilities should develop (or review existing) plans to mitigate staffing shortages.","At the time of writing this article, the risk of coronavirus in India is extremely low. But that may change in the next few weeks. Hence the following is recommended:Healthcare providers should take travel history of all patients with respiratory symptoms, and any international travel in the past 2 wks as well as contact with sick people who have travelled internationally.They should set up a system of triage of patients with respiratory illness in the outpatient department and give them a simple surgical mask to wear. They should use surgical masks themselves while examining such patients and practice hand hygiene frequently.Suspected cases should be referred to government designated centres for isolation and testing (in Mumbai, at this time, it is Kasturba hospital). Commercial kits for testing are not yet available in India.Patients admitted with severe pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome should be evaluated for travel history and placed under contact and droplet isolation. Regular decontamination of surfaces should be done. They should be tested for etiology using multiplex PCR panels if logistics permit and if no pathogen is identified, refer the samples for testing for SARS-CoV-2.All clinicians should keep themselves updated about recent developments including global spread of the disease.Non-essential international travel should be avoided at this time.People should stop spreading myths and false information about the disease and try to allay panic and anxiety of the public.","\u2022 Between days d+3 and d+4, it will transition to contagious. Only then will it start infecting other synthetic persons. \u2022 Between days d+5 and d+6, it will self-quarantine with a probability of 20%. This is modelling that only 20% of people show strong enough symptoms to recognize that they are sick, and at which point they withdraw from their activities (Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung GmbH 2020). The current model assumes that they go into full quarantine, i.e. they also do not infect people at home. \u2022 Between days d+15 and d+16, it will transition to recovered. At this point, it is assumed that they resume their activities, but that they are immune (Bao et al. 2020 ).","In the absence of vaccines and specific treatment, the only available public health tools to control persontoperson transmittable diseases are isolation and quarantine, social distancing, and community containment measures. 10 Isolation is the separation of ill people from non infected people, and usually occurs in hospital settings, but could also be done at home for mild infections. 11 For isolation to be successful in preventing transmission, case detection should be early-ie, before the onset of viral shedding or at least before the onset of peak viral shedding. For SARS, viral loads peaked at 6-11 days after onset of illness for nasopharyngeal aspirates, enabling early isolation before transmission. 12 The number of secondary cases from an infected patient was clearly reduced if the infected patient was isolated within 4 days after onset of symptoms. 13 For SARS, a highly sensitive case definition was used with a focus on fever or respiratory symptoms, and an epidemiological link (contact or travel history). All suspected patients were isolated until SARS was ruled out. Implementing optimal isolation by itself was modelled to be more costeffective than implementing suboptimal isolation and quarantine together. 14 Secondary household transmission was low in Singapore (6\u00b72%), indicative of rapid detection and isolation of patients. Similarly, in Toronto, secondary attack rate in households was 10%, with a linear association between secondary attack rate and the time that the index patient spent at home after symptom onset. 15 In Singapore, healthcare associated transmission accounted for more than 90% of all cases. 16 Once full measures were in place, almost all patients were promptly isolated before secondary transmission had occurred. The outbreak in Singapore was propagated by five superspreading events, 16 including three super spreading events as a result of atypical clinical manifestations of SARS. 17 Quarantine involves movement restriction, ideally combined with medical observation during the quarantine period, of close contacts of infected patients during the incubation period. 18 The premise for successful quarantine is prompt and comprehensive contact tracing of each and every confirmed patient. Quarantine can take place at home or in designated places such as hotels, and both of these options were used during the SARS epidemic. Quarantined contacts had to record their temperatures, and were visited or telephoned daily by a member of the public healthcare team. If the contact developed symptoms, they were investigated at a designated healthcare facility. The principle is that if the person under quarantine developed illness, that person would not have any close contacts to spread the disease, effectively reducing the R\u2080 of the outbreak to less than 1. As an example of the magnitude of efforts taken, Toronto Public Health investigated 2132 potential cases of SARS and identified 23 103 contacts as requiring quarantine. 19 Legally enforceable quarantine orders were issued to contacts. Police made spot checks in Hong Kong whereas video cameras were installed at the home of each contact in Singapore. 16, 20 Once it is no longer feasible to identify all infectious individuals and their contacts in the attempt to slow the spread of disease, a possible next step is to apply communitywide containment measures. Community wide containment is an intervention that is applied to an entire community, city, or region, designed to reduce personal interactions. 10 These interventions range from measures to encourage personal responsibility to identify disease, increase social distancing among community members including cancellation of public gatherings, and finally implement community quarantine. 11 Enforcement of communitywide contain ment measures is far more complex than isolation or quarantine because of the larger number of people involved. China best exemplified this largescale quarantine by declaring epidemic zones and placing people under collective quarantine in villages, cities, or institutions. 21 In April 2003, the Chinese authorities gained full control of all activities to combat SARS, with guidelines and control measures that were national, unambiguous, rational, and widely followed, under central guidance. The stringent control measures included school closures and closures of all universities and public places, as well as the cancellation of the public holiday in May. Immediately, the R\u2080 decreased greatly and consistently. 22 In May, 2003, China locked down Beijing and closed more than 3500 public places in an effort to curb community spread.","\u2022 Social distancing -keeping at least six feet (1.8 meters) between individuals in waiting rooms and work spaces as much as feasible. \u2022 Encourage sick employees to stay home. Personnel who develop respiratory symptoms (e.g., cough, shortness of breath) or unexplained fever should be instructed not to report to work. \u2022 Ensure that your sick leave policies are flexible and consistent with public health guidance and that employees are aware of these policies. Make contingency plans for increased absenteeism \u2022 Screen patients and visitors for symptoms of acute respiratory illness (e.g., fever, cough, difficulty breathing) or gastrointestinal symptoms and coronavirus exposure in the last 2 weeks before entering one's healthcare facility (4). \u2022 Ensure technologist and CCT imager hand hygiene best practices. If soap and water are not readily available, use of a hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol. \u2022 Consider standard droplet precautions for patients and healthcare personnel as per institutional infection control protocols. \u2022 Increase scheduling intervals or appointment times to allow adequate time to clean equipment as needed. \u2022 Leverage telemedicine technologies and isolated workstations to allow for reading and interpretation, that allow for social distancing to limit staff exposure, when possible. \u2022 Assign a team member to monitor and incorporate regular updates from the CDC and appropriate regional jurisdictions.","\u2022 \"Are there any benefits to spending more time at home?

A friend had told her that \u201cthe virus\u201d was coming and that everyone would be sick. I sat down with her and, before the school bus arrived, we looked at some interactive maps showing how far the new coronavirus outbreak was from Portugal, the predicted spread, and some World Health Organization recommendations: wash your hands often, sneeze to the elbow, let me know if you are feeling sick\u2015all things that she proudly does already.

","Treatment of SARS-CoV patients focuses on emergency management of life-threatening complications and ventilatory support. Interventions to manage profound hypoxemia should be instituted, including intubation, sedation, paralysis, lung recruitment maneuvers, and high-frequency, low-tidal volume and inflation pressure ventilator management. 28 To date, no efficacious antiviral or antiinflammatory drugs are identified. 3, 27 Current research focuses on candidate antiviral agents and vaccine development. If patients are not sick enough to warrant admission, they should be sent home, with strict guidelines regarding activity restriction and hospital return if symptoms worsen. 12, 25 ","An additional evidence-based practice that can appeal to frazzled radiologists and other physicians is the simple act of writing down three things one is grateful for several times a week. This quick practice can aid well-being [7] . Sexton and Adair studied a similar practiced called \"Three Good Things\" in health care workers including physicians, physician assistants, nurses, and 3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53 administrative staff. They found that a 15-day practice of recording three good things had significant positive benefits on self-reported happiness, burnout, work-life balance, and depression [8] . Extending gratitude practices into groups, such as starting meetings by giving kudos for recent efforts, can also help stimulate positive emotions and positive relationships among team members. Clearly many good things are happening in the midst of all the stress and swirl-the dedication of so many, kindness and consideration for those most at risk, and emotional support. To help us survive, our minds are biased to notice risks and danger; consciously noticing the good can help bring balance and calm.","In December 2019, a novel coronavirus, eventually termed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), was identified in Wuhan, China. As of 10 March, 2020, COVID-19 has infected &gt;100 000 people globally and caused thousands of deaths. [1] As of early March 2020, Canada has detected several dozen cases, most of them in returning international travellers or their close contacts. [2] Given that pneumonia is an important cause of maternal morbidity and mortality, the emergence and global spread of COVID-19 has raised concerns about the implications of this outbreak for pregnant women and their fetuses. Pregnant women and their loved ones will be looking to maternal care providers for information and guidance on how to prevent or manage infection with COVID-19.","In this paper, we collected these measures systematically and made respective descriptions. Our purpose is to tell the reader that COVID-19 is spreading globally at an alarming speed, and an outbreak in any environment could bring very serious consequences for each country. Some countries in Europe still take vague attitudes about this outbreak, such as \"herd immunity\". People refuse to wear facemasks and so on. China's experience has shown that non-pharmacology interventions can reduce or even stop transmission in some cases successfully. Even in the face of widespread transmission -what China's experiences have shown was that if we keep calm, take action immediately with global, and implement systematic identification case and contact tracing, we would change the course of the epidemic, prevent people from getting sick and prevent the most vulnerable from dying.","The zoonotic pathogens, such as HPAI are transmitted to humans from the backyard birds through direct or indirect contact. The direct contact takes place while walking through the flocks and handling sick poultry and while slaughtering poultry personally without appropriate protection (Burns et al., 2011; Liao et al., 2009 ). At the time of slaughter, the most commonly identified risk factors were direct contact with infected blood or other body fluids (Van Kerkhove et al., 2011) . Associated risk factors related to environmental exposure include cleaning poultry areas, removal of feces, using poultry waste as fertilizer, inhalation, ingestion, and intranasal inoculation of contaminated water (Van Kerkhove et al., 2011) . Indirect contact is more frequent and takes place when backyard farmers are exposed to apparently healthy poultry without any precautions (Rabinowitz et al., 2010) and when the farmers meet with each other (Burns et al., 2011) . Backyard poultry acted as greater source of HPAI transmission than the commercial birds due to the absence of biosecurity measures. It is also estimated that average daily contact rate of humans was higher with the backyard flocks than with commercial poultry (0.0137 or 5 contacts per year) (Patyka et al., 2013) . Rural people are at higher risk of HPAI transmission than their urban counterparts due to greater amount rearing of these backyard birds. Besides from being an essential component of rural livelihood, poultry rearing is also an important sector of the agricultural ecosystems. The droppings of chickens are used to feed aquatic animals and as soil fertilizers, which facilitates pathogen transmission (Liao et al., 2014) . Moreover, Asian rural people prefer to take freshly slaughtered poultry than the packaged and processed meat. In a study in Southeast Asia, it was observed that almost all Vietnamese and more than half of the Thai people slaughtered the birds by themselves at home. This kind of practice also increases the possibility of disease transmission (Liao et al., 2014) . Cock fighting (a traditional recreation in rural Asia) with backyard birds may also play a role in disease transmission. The owners transport their birds long distances to participate in bouts and sometimes they lick the wounds on their fighting cocks (Edmunds et al., 2013) . More hazardous practices, such as keeping birds inside the bedroom, scavenging of birds around the places where food is cooked, using the same water source where villagers bath or wash their utensils for the birds' drinking were observed in Bangladesh (Sultana et al., 2012b) .","Appropriate preparedness includes 5 key elements: 1) reduce morbidity and mortality among those infected; 2) minimize transmission; 3) ensure protection of health care workers; 4) maintain health care system functioning; and 5) maintain communication with worried residents and family members. 10 These elements offer a critical framework for the long-term care community and the public at large as it prepares for COVID-19. AMDA, The Society for Post-Acute and Long-Term Care Medicine, has recently published interim recommendations (https://paltc.org/COVID-19) for health care providers in Long-Term Care Facilities. The documents offer guidance and address frequently asked questions on how Post-Acute and Long-Term Care Facilities should prepare for and manage individuals with suspected COVID-19. Symptoms of COVID-19 include fever, cough, and shortness of breath, but initial symptoms are milder and frail older adults often present atypically. The symptoms may range from mild to severe. While studies underway to assess antiviral medications for COVID-19 have begun, supportive care is the best available therapeutic option.","Finally, veterinarians must take steps to prevent zoonoses in the personnel under their supervision. These steps may include having standard operating procedures in place to prevent zoonoses, disinfecting contaminated areas, and providing education for staff regarding disease prevention. Specific guidelines regarding disease prevention are available in the Compendium of Veterinary Standard Precautions for Zoonotic Disease Prevention in Veterinary Personnel. 32 Many of these recommendations can also be given to pet owners that are caring for a sick animal at home.","\u201cAs a writer, humor is one of those things you don't want to think about too much, but I suppose I was always kind of a smart aleck \u2026 At the same time, I'm not a hard-nosed journalist; I'm some other kind of non-fiction writer. When I go into the field, it's very hard for me not to like people. Especially if they are unpretentious people like the bamboo rat farmer in China.\u201d","In the United States, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (US CDC) are closely monitoring the situation in China, but also at home, with reported cases in Chicago, Illinois; San Benito, California; Santa Clara, California; Los Angeles, California; Boston, Massachusetts; Tempe, Arizona; Orange, California; and Seattle, Washington. As a consequence, the US CDC have also developed a pack of technical documents for healthcare professionals, including interim guides for the evaluation of patients under investigation for 2019-nCoV, for the prevention and control recommendations for patients with confirmed 2019-nCoV or patients under investigation for 2019-nCoV in healthcare settings, as well as guidance for implementing home care of people not requiring hospitalization for 2019-nCoV, among others [40] .","Since 31 December 2019, when the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission reported 27 cases of viral pneumonia, including 7 critically ill cases, the pneumonia outbreak has received considerable global attention. A novel coronavirus was identified as the causative agent by the Chinese authorities on 7 January 2020, and on 10 January 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) designated the novel coronavirus as 2019-nCoV. On the same day, the WHO released a wide range of interim guidance for all countries on how they can get prepared for coping with this emergency, including how to monitor for potentially infected people, collect and test samples, manage patients, control and mitigate the burden generated by the infection in health centers, maintain the right drug supplies and effectively communicate with the lay public regarding the new virus [12].","Cancer treatment in the era of COVID-19 requires consideration of risks and benefits for patients and staff. 1 Recent data suggests patients who have cancer are at increased risk of infection and serious complications from COVID-19. 1 While ASCO has provided resources for patients receiving systemic therapy (https://www.asco.org/asco-coronavirus-information), there remains minimal granular guidance on the delivery of outpatient radiotherapy. Radiotherapy is delivered to nearly 50% of cancer patients, a particularly vulnerable group given their older age, frequent comorbidities, and underlying cancer diagnosis. 2 Prostate cancer is frequently treated with radiation and the most common solid tumor in men; it is a heterogeneous disease where timely therapy is indicated for some cases, and where watchful waiting, active surveillance, or deferral of treatment could be acceptable for others. 3, 4 Given the current epidemic crisis, delaying radiotherapy treatment (which requires multiple visits to healthcare facilities) for prostate cancer patients may potentially reduce the risk of iatrogenic exposure to COVID-19. At the healthcare system level, when clinically appropriate, reducing visits conserves limited hospital resources (e.g. personal protective equipment (PPE)) for use by health-care workers who will have to care for the potentially vast number of hospitalized COVID-19 patients. The decision to delay life-saving cancer treatment in a time of a resource-intensive pandemic represents a clinical conundrum without modern precedent. In these exigent circumstances, guidelines as to how to manage patients who present with prostate cancer would be valuable for the practicing clinician. This manuscript attempts guidance based on rapid expert opinion as to how to manage prostate cancer patients requiring radiotherapy during the COVID-19 pandemic.","There have been a wide range in responses across states since the first case of COVID-19 was announced in Washington State on January 14, 2020. Upon this, the CDC began releasing recommendations to those at risk of being exposed to the virus. The initial recommendations included travel warnings and restricted travel to countries with confirmed cases and sustained COVID-19 spread. These travel restrictions grew to include inbound and outbound travel bans to a list of 26 countries, in both Europe and Asia. 108 Other policies have included social distancing, which has been widely recommended or enforced at various levels of government. This method involves avoiding crowds, staying home, limiting or avoiding visiting vulnerable populations (such as long-term care facilities) and standing at least six feet away from others in public spaces. Some regions have implemented school closures at both the K-12 and higher education level. Business closures have also been recommended or enforced, such that employees should work from home, unless their work is considered essential to the greater public (e.g. health care, grocery stores). To support employees working remotely or staying home when sick, a number of states have also mandated paid sick leave for those who are affected by . Free testing has also been implemented in certain states, so that anyone experiencing symptoms or has been exposed to the virus can now get tested for free. 111 We coded various policies that cancel events and large gatherings as follows: the cancellation of large events, specifically the election postponement in Louisiana, is categorized as \" event_cancel .\" The separate \" no_gathering \" policy variable represents policy measures that banned all events or mass gatherings of a certain size, i.e. no gatherings over a certain number of people (where this number has varied by region). The \" social_distance \" category includes measures that prevent visits to elderly care facilities, close public facilities such as libraries, and require workers to work remotely. The \" emergency_declaration \" encompasses the declarations of a state of emergency at the city, county, state, and federal level. This declaration allows the affected area to immediately marshal emergency funds and resources and activate emergency legislation, while also giving the public an indication of the gravity of the situation.","The importance of timely, accurate and context-specific risk communication during public health emergencies is increasingly being recognized, particularly with rapid changes in how people consume media. The WHO has produced useful guidance on communicating risk in such situations, which draws on experiences from previous PHEIC [37] . Good risk communication allows people to know from trusted sources in real-time the risks they may face, and any protective measures they can take to help minimise this.","The copyright holder for this preprint . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.14.20023168 doi: medRxiv preprint different level of efforts in containing this virus from spreading. To make things simple, restrictions of patients' activities (including in-hospital treatment, cabin hospital stay, and in-house surveillance) were represented as personal activity index PAI.","It is important to address the fact that this epidemic will unavoidably generate stress, fear and anxiety among the entire laboratory personnel, trainees and pathologists 57, 58 . Psychologic stress may be experienced differently by different people, and may be modulated by personal factors like age, sex, health status, baseline anxiety level and risk perception. More severe psychologic distress may be followed by increased levels of posttraumatic stress symptomatology 59 . Psychological distress may be related to increased work load due to coworker absenteeism, lack of socialization with friends and colleagues, lack of recreational activities due to the closure of gyms, restaurants, movie theaters and other recreational avenues, and increased family stress and parenting issues due to children being at home as a result of school closings. It may also relate to having a friend or family member affected by the disease. All healthcare workers may also feel anxious and stressed due to the fear of contracting the disease, fear of transmitting the disease to members of the family, or financial fears related to the changes implemented during this period. During this period, laboratory directors and other pathologists should be prepared to provide up to date information regarding the most recent developments in our knowledge about the disease and candid information regarding all aspects of the personnel's job. Although such information may also be available from a variety of sources, including the CDC and the health care center's website, in order to alleviate the fear and anxiety, it is important to have clear channels of communication, transmit the information in person, and respond to any questions that may arise. Providing emotional support and an opportunity to discuss any personal and family concerns is crucial during these times. It is very important to communicate effectively the risk to laboratory personnel and trainees, without overly reassuring them, and acknowledging that a lot is unknown about this infection. It is equally important to communicate any changes in policy or schedule as soon as possible 60 . If physical meetings are not possible because of the social distancing measures implemented, web-based conferences using a variety of platforms can be used. This can include SMS text messages, e-mails, using both institutional and personal email, if needed, small group discussions, and websites, in addition to online discussion through apps such as Finally, in addition to these measures meant to prevent infection in the workplace, all pathologists, trainees, cytotechnologists and laboratory personnel should also apply commonsense measures to prevent getting infected outside the laboratory environment. This may include, in addition to personal hygiene measures (handwashing, avoiding touching eyes, nose and mouth), \"social distancing\", avoiding close contact with other people, and, if possible, avoiding public transportation, avoiding crowds and gatherings of over 10 people, avoiding contact with people who might be sick (i.e. people having fever and respiratory symptoms).","Many of us are facing hardship with students or postdoctoral fellows confined at home, or stuck abroad. Many of us have to deal with children at home, or are worrying about their relatives and friends. We understand all that, and we understand that it will slow down academic activities. As mentioned in a tweet dated from March 11, we will accommodate our authors who might need further delays to revise their papers. We will do our best to accommodate reviewers as well, and bear in mind the situations we are all facing. But we will try our best to keep things running.","These estimates assume that a significant proportion of severe cases that would normally require relatively mild intervention (such as supplemental and non-invasive administration of oxygen, intravenous fluids, antibiotics for secondary infections etc) actually manage to access these therapies. The situation in Bergamo and Lombardy in the last few days has stunned the global medical community. If this region, one of the most affluent parts of Europe, with an advanced healthcare, was inundated in the way that we have witnessed in the news, then it simply cannot be excluded that in chaotic situations wherein cases precipitate suddenly, hospitals may simply collapse and the simple provision of basic care may fail. Moreover, morbidity and mortality will also be incurred from non-novel conditions for which there is simple and established treatment. Or failure of care in common situations such as childbirth.","This document describes the results of computer simulations of a standard population level epidemiological model (SEIR-model) with seasonal affects and parameters calibrated to be appropriate for SARS-CoV-2. The calculations are done by solving differential equations of the SEIR model [1] , without spatial extension, demographic stochasticity or attention paid to smallworld and scale-free network effects, but these are potentially important and [2, 3] could be readily added in the future [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] . The model additionally has categories for severely sick people who are hospitalized, people in critical condition in need of ICU rooms and ventilators, and a fatal category. The simulation uses severity assumptions as a function of individual age, informed by epidemiological and clinical observations in China [9] ; no modifications have been to take into account national differences, such as number of smokers in the population etc.","After eradicate people gatherings, government should streamline their bureaucrats for 4 official requirements, and for them, government should provide proper protective gears 5 (like hand wash, sanitizers, masks, etc.). 9 Hence government should regularize the price and 6 supply of hand washer and alcohol sanitizers as much earlier (before curfew), where 7 researchers mentioned handwashing is an essential precaution for the COVID-19. The 8 government officials should analyze the situation carefully and communicate with proper 9 datasheets for further proceedings. They should provide confidence to the people, then 10 only affected people will come to hospital, where they need to stay for fourteen days 11 quarantine. If government failed their credibility, people will get fear for quarantine 12 isolation. Once government strengthened people welfare and mind, everyone can obey the 13 government guidelines and then it will be easy to get rid of from COVID-19. 14 Simultaneously, government should provide good hospital facility for the all affected 15 people, more than that hospital must be stuffed with all the emergency requirements and 16 basic amenities (like beds). 2,10 Hence proper guidance should be provided for all the patients 17 while they are in hospital. The affected peoples must be separated from the general 18 patients in the hospital, especially specific wards should allocate for COVID-19 patients. This 19 isolation step will help to restrain the hospital spread, hence they should be very concerned 20 about it, because in hospital most vulnerable peoples are there. Further, the servicing 21 doctor and nurse's health status has to be checked frequently, and they need to take all the 22 preventive measures before handling the patients. In the case of lack of doctors, 23 government can utilize house surgeons, hence they can ask help from retired doctors.

Health education on self-management for patients should be taken into account to reduce the frequency and severity of exacerbations and to improve quality of life. 90, 91 However, COPD patients were found to lack general knowledge about the disease. For example, the term \"COPD\" was recognized by , 30% of the patients who regularly visited hospitals, whereas an even lower number of rural patients recognized the term. 85, 92 Patients also lacked awareness of COPD risk factors, the importance of lung function tests, inhalation therapy, and oxygen therapy. [93] [94] [95] About 20% of patients were current smokers, of which 23% did not know the harmful effect of smoking on the disease. 96 Unfortunately, no health education program was available in rural areas, although all patients were willing to read information about COPD. 84, 85, 96 Patients took the initial advice for smoking cessation from primary care physicians, so there is a great need to implement evidence-based guidelines and demand that physicians take immediate action. Studies in some urban hospitals demonstrated that 64.5% of the COPD patients quit smoking after application of general interventions, whereas the cessation rate of the control group was only 28%. 86
