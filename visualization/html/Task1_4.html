The efficiency of transmission within healthcare facilities was recognised following significant hospital outbreaks of SARS in Canada, China, Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan and Vietnam. The causative agent of SARS was identified as a novel coronavirus, the SARS coronavirus. This was largely spread by direct or indirect contact with large respiratory droplets, although airborne transmission has also been reported. High infection rates among HCWs led initially to the theory that SARS was highly contagious and the concept of \u2018super-spreading events\u2019. Such events illustrated that lack of infection control (IC) measures or failure to comply with IC precautions could lead to large-scale hospital outbreaks. SARS was eventually contained by the stringent application of I...","The evolution of new and reemerging historic virulent strains of respiratory viruses from animal reservoirs is a significant threat to human health. Inefficient human-to-human transmission of zoonotic strains may initially limit the spread of transmission, but an infection may be contracted by touching contaminated surfaces. Enveloped viruses are often susceptible to environmental stresses, but the human coronaviruses responsible for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) have recently caused increasing concern of contact transmission during outbreaks. We report here that pathogenic human coronavirus 229E remained infectious in a human lung cell culture model following at least 5 days of persistence on a range of common nonbiocidal surface materials, including polytetrafluoroethylene (Teflon; PTFE), polyvinyl chloride (PVC), ceramic tiles, glass, silicone rubber, and stainless steel. We have shown previously that noroviruses are destroyed o...","Background: The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has placed unprecedented challenges on hospital environmental hygiene and medical staff protection. It is crucial to assess hospital environmental hygiene to understand the most important environmental issues for controlling the spread of COVID-19 in hospitals. Objective: To detect the presence of COVID-19 in the samples from the area at risk of contamination in the First Hospital of Jilin University. Methods: Viruses in the air were collected by natural sedimentation and air particle sampler methods. Predetermined environmental surfaces were sampled using swabs at seven o'clock in the morning before disinfection. The real-time reverse-transcription PCR method was used to detect the existence of COVID-19 pathogens. Results: Viruses could be detected on the surfaces of the nurse station in the isolation area with suspected patients and in the air of the isolation ward with an intensive care patient. Conclusion: Comprehensiv...","The use of viral agents for biological warfare has a long history, which predates their recognition and isolation by culture. Advances in viral culture and virus stabilization made during the second half of the twentieth century raised the level of concern by facilitating the large-scale production of viral agents for aerosol dissemination. Furthermore, the nucleic acid of many viruses, including some that are currently not threats, can be manipulated in the laboratory. Thus, the potential for genetic engineering and misuse of biotechnology is a serious threat. An effective defense against viral agents requires a comprehensive approach including restricting access to viral stocks, detecting deliberately induced disease outbreaks, rapid laboratory identification of viral agents in clinical specimens, preventing person-to-person transmission, using reliable decontamination procedures, and developing effective vaccines and antiviral drugs.","Objective: This paper studied the relationship between personality traits and mental health conditions of medical personnel to provide a basis and reference for the implementation of targeted education on mental health. Methods: A self-report inventory, the Symptom Checklist-90 (SCL-90), was used to investigate the mental health status of 548 medical personnel dealing with the new coronavirus pneumonia in eight provinces and cities of China. Results: The overall mean SCL-90 score and mean values of factors (somatization, obsessive-compulsive, anxiety, phobic anxiety, and psychoticism) of the medical personnel were significantly higher than in the norm group (p &lt; 0.05), while their average interpersonal sensitivity score was significantly lower (p &lt; 0.01). In addition, personal factors affecting the mental health status of medical personnel were identified. ( all p &lt; 0.05). Conclusion: The overall mental health status of medical personnel responding to new coronavirus pneumonia is gener...","Summary Currently, the emergence of a novel human coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, has become a global health concern causing severe respiratory tract infections in humans. Human-to-human transmissions have been described with incubation times between 2-10 days, facilitating its spread via droplets, contaminated hands or surfaces. We therefore reviewed the literature on all available information about the persistence of human and veterinary coronaviruses on inanimate surfaces as well as inactivation strategies with biocidal agents used for chemical disinfection, e.g. in healthcare facilities. The analysis of 22 studies reveals that human coronaviruses such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) coronavirus, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) coronavirus or endemic human coronaviruses (HCoV) can persist on inanimate surfaces like metal, glass or plastic for up to 9 days, but can be efficiently inactivated by surface disinfection procedures with 62\u201371% ethanol, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide o...","Abstract Objectives were to determine effects of lactation and pregnancy on endometrial gene expression on d 17 of the estrous cycle and pregnancy. Heifers (n=33) were assigned randomly after parturition to lactating (L, n=17) or nonlactating (NL, n=16) groups. Cows were subjected to an ovulation synchronization program for a timed artificial insemination (TAI); 10 cows in L and 12 in NL were inseminated. Slaughter occurred 17 d after the day equivalent to TAI, and intercaruncular endometrial tissues were collected. Gene expression was determined by DNA microarray analysis for pregnant (L, n=8; NL, n=6) and noninseminated cyclic (L, n=7; NL, n=4) cows. Differentially expressed genes were selected with a P-value &lt;0.01 and absolute expression &gt;40. In addition, a fold effect &gt;1.5 was used as a criterion for genes affected by pregnancy. In total, 210 genes were differentially regulated by lactation (136 downregulated and 74 upregulated), and 702 genes were differentially regulated by pregn...","Abstract Viruses manipulate cellular machinery and functions to subvert intracellular environment conducive for viral proliferation. They strategically alter functions of the multitasking mitochondria to influence energy production, metabolism, survival, and immune signaling. Mitochondria either occur as heterogeneous population of individual organelles or large interconnected tubular network. The mitochondrial network is highly susceptible to physiological and environmental insults, including viral infections, and is dynamically maintained by mitochondrial fission and fusion. Mitochondrial dynamics in tandem with mitochondria-selective autophagy \u2018mitophagy\u2019 coordinates mitochondrial quality control and homeostasis. Mitochondrial dynamics impacts cellular homeostasis, metabolism, and innate-immune signaling, and thus can be major determinant of the outcome of viral infections. Herein, we review how mitochondrial dynamics is affected during viral infections and how this complex interpla...","","Abstract Emerging life threatening pathogens such as severe acute aspiratory syndrome-coronavirus (SARS-CoV), avian-origin influenzas H7N9, and the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) have caused a high case-fatality rate and psychological effects on society and the economy. Therefore, a simple, rapid, and safe method to investigate a therapeutic approach against these pathogens is required. In this study, a simple, quick, and safe cell adhesion inhibition assay was developed to determine the potential cellular binding site on the SARS-CoV spike protein. Various synthetic peptides covering the potential binding site helped to minimize further the binding motif to 10\u201325 residues. Following analyses, 2 peptides spanning the 436\u2013445 and 437\u2013461 amino acids of the spike protein were identified as peptide inhibitor or peptide vaccine candidates against SARS-CoV.","Abstract The application of optical biosensors, specifically those that use optical fibers and planar waveguides, has escalated throughout the years in many fields, including environmental analysis, food safety and clinical diagnosis. Fluorescence is, without doubt, the most popular transducer signal used in these devices because of its higher selectivity and sensitivity, but most of all due to its wide versatility. This paper focuses on the working principles and configurations of fluorescence-based fiber optic and planar waveguide biosensors and will review biological recognition elements, sensing schemes, as well as some major and recent applications, published in the last ten years. The main goal is to provide the reader a general overview of a field that requires the joint collaboration of researchers of many different areas, including chemistry, physics, biology, engineering, and material science.","The main route of transmission of SARS CoV infection is presumed to be respiratory droplets. However the virus is also detectable in other body fluids and excreta. The stability of the virus at different temperatures and relative humidity on smooth surfaces were studied. The dried virus on smooth surfaces retained its viability for over 5 days at temperatures of 22\u201325\u00b0C and relative humidity of 40\u201350%, that is, typical air-conditioned environments. However, virus viability was rapidly lost (&gt;3 log(10)) at higher temperatures and higher relative humidity (e.g., 38\u00b0C, and relative humidity of &gt;95%). The better stability of SARS coronavirus at low temperature and low humidity environment may facilitate its transmission in community in subtropical area (such as Hong Kong) during the spring and in air-conditioned environments. It may also explain why some Asian countries in tropical area (such as Malaysia, Indonesia or Thailand) with high temperature and high relative humidity environment d...","A novel human coronavirus, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), has caused outbreaks of a SARS-like illness with high case fatality rate. The reports of its person-to-person transmission through close contacts have raised a global concern about its pandemic potential. Here we characterize the six-helix bundle fusion core structure of MERS-CoV spike protein S2 subunit by X-ray crystallography and biophysical analysis. We find that two peptides, HR1P and HR2P, spanning residues 998\u20131039 in HR1 and 1251\u20131286 in HR2 domains, respectively, can form a stable six-helix bundle fusion core structure, suggesting that MERS-CoV enters into the host cell mainly through membrane fusion mechanism. HR2P can effectively inhibit MERS-CoV replication and its spike protein-mediated cell\u2013cell fusion. Introduction of hydrophilic residues into HR2P results in significant improvement of its stability, solubility and antiviral activity. Therefore, the HR2P analogues have good potential to b...","Summary The novel human coronavirus 2019-nCoV has become a global health concern causing severe respiratory tract infections in humans. Human-to-human transmissions have been described, probably via droplets but possibly also via contaminated hands or surfaces. In a recent review on the persistence of human and veterinary coronaviruses on inanimate surfaces it was shown that human coronaviruses such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) coronavirus, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) coronavirus or endemic human coronaviruses (HCoV) can persist on inanimate surfaces like metal, glass or plastic for up to 9 days. Some disinfectant agents effectively reduce coronavirus infectivity within 1 minute such 62% - 71% ethanol, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide or 0.1% sodium hypochlorite. Other compounds such as 0.05% - 0.2% benzalkonium chloride or 0.02% chlorhexidine digluconate are less effective. An effective surface disinfection may help to ensure an early containment and prevention of fur...","Based on the detailed hydrophobic-hydrophilic(HP) model of amino acids, we propose dual-vector curve (DV-curve) representation of protein sequences, which uses two vectors to represent one alphabet of protein sequences. This graphical representation not only avoids degeneracy, but also has good visualization no matter how long these sequences are, and can reflect the length of protein sequence. Then we transform the 2D-graphical representation into a numerical characterization that can facilitate quantitative comparison of protein sequences. The utility of this approach is illustrated by two examples: one is similarity/dissimilarity comparison among different ND6 protein sequences based on their DV-curve figures the other is the phylogenetic analysis among coronaviruses based on their spike proteins.","Abstract Medicine shortages have been spreading in European countries. In many cases, the unavailability of medicinal products has a substantial impact on the capability of National Healthcare Systems in ensuring the continuity of care. Shortages originate from multifactorial causes. In particular, they can be due to supply-related factors (e.g., manufacturing issues, regulatory issues, logistics, distribution) and demand-related ones (e.g., fluctuating drug demand, parallel market, tendering, price and reimbursement policies). However, some extraordinary geopolitical events (e.g., Brexit) may also affect medicines\u2019 availability. The capability of European Regulatory Authorities and other stakeholders, which are involved in the pharmaceutical distribution chain and the healthcare assistance services, to define suitable problem-solving strategies has been limited for years by the fragmentation of the European regulatory framework, starting from the lack of a univocal definition of a med...","","","Abstract Advances in molecular biology, bioinformatics, and robotics have allowed microarray technology to be used for in-depth, basic science studies in all fields of microbiology. Recently, translation of these basic science applications to clinical microbiology and infectious diseases has also progressed. From a clinical infectious disease perspective, genome-based organism identification, pathogen discovery, and antimicrobial susceptibility testing of problematic organisms offer the potential to yield diagnostic information that may not otherwise become available. Moreover, microarray-based studies have the ability to provide \u201csignatures\u201d of host cell transcriptional responses for individual pathogens and/or groups of pathogens. This type of information has the potential to confirm difficult diagnoses, to monitor responses to therapeutic intervention, or even to predict prognosis and sequelae following an infectious disease. Examples are presented to illustrate ways in which microa...","Abstract Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infects host cells through binding the receptor binding domain (RBD) on its spike glycoprotein to human receptor dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (hDPP4). Here, we report identification of critical residues on hDPP4 for RBD binding and virus entry through analysis of a panel of hDPP4 mutants. Based on the RBD\u2013hDPP4 crystal structure we reported, the mutated residues were located at the interface between RBD and hDPP4, which potentially changed the polarity, hydrophobic or hydrophilic properties of hDPP4, thereby interfering or disrupting their interaction with RBD. Using surface plasmon resonance (SPR) binding analysis and pseudovirus infection assay, we showed that several residues in hDPP4\u2013RBD binding interface were important on hDPP4\u2013RBD binding and viral entry. These results provide atomic insights into the features of interactions between hDPP4 and MERS-CoV RBD, and also provide potential explanation for cellular and species t...","Since Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) first emerged, the California Department of Public Health has coordinated efforts to identify possible cases in travelers to California, USA, from affected areas. During 2013\u20132014, the department investigated 54 travelers for MERS-CoV; none tested positive, but 32 (62%) of 52 travelers with suspected MERS-CoV had other respiratory viruses.","Background: The overall objective of this rapid review was to identify infection protection and control recommendations from published clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) for adults aged 60 years and older in long-term care settings Methods: Comprehensive searches in MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, and relevant CPG publishers/repositories were carried out in early March 2020. Title/abstract and full-text screening, data abstraction, and quality appraisal (AGREE-II) were carried out by single reviewers. Results: A total of 17 relevant CPGs were identified, published in the USA (n=8), Canada (n=6), Australia (n=2), and the United Kingdom (n=1). All of the CPGs dealt with infection control in long-term care facilities (LTCF) and addressed various types of viral respiratory infections (e.g., influenza, COVID-19, severe acute respiratory syndrome). Ten or more CPGs recommended the following infection control measures in LTCF: hand hygiene (n=13), wearing personal protective equipment...","Prolonged viral shedding is associated with severe status and poor prognosis of COVID-19 patients. Unexpectedly, here we report a non-severe patient with the longest duration of viral shedding. According to the investigation on the clinical and epidemiological information of this case, we concluded that this type of virus might have a low toxicity and transmissibility, but have a prolonged infective ability and was hardly to be eliminated in the body with regular therapy. However, infusion of plasma from recovered patients showed high efficiency in elimination of this virus. Our findings might shed light on the management of COVID-19.","","DNA microarrays may be used to identify microbial species present in environmental and clinical samples. However, automated tools for reliable species identification based on observed microarray hybridization patterns are lacking. We present an algorithm, E-Predict, for microarray-based species identification. E-Predict compares observed hybridization patterns with theoretical energy profiles representing different species. We demonstrate the application of the algorithm to viral detection in a set of clinical samples and discuss its relevance to other metagenomic applications.","The recent outbreak of pneumonia-causing COVID-19 in China is an urgent global public health issue with an increase in mortality and morbidity. Here we report our modelled homo-trimer structure of COVID-19 spike glycoprotein in both closed (ligand-free) and open (ligand-bound) conformation, which is involved in host cell adhesion. We also predict the unique N- and O-linked glycosylation sites of spike glycoprotein that distinguish it from the SARS and underlines shielding and camouflage of COVID-19 from the host the defence system. Furthermore, our study also highlights the key finding that the S1 domain of COVID-19 spike glycoprotein potentially interacts with the human CD26, a key immunoregulatory factor for hijacking and virulence. These findings accentuate the unique features of COVID-19 and assist in the development of new therapeutics.","With limited infection control practices in overcrowded Bangladeshi hospitals, surfaces may play an important role in the transmission of respiratory pathogens in hospital wards and pose a serious risk of infection for patients, health care workers, caregivers and visitors. In this study, we aimed to identify if surfaces near hospitalized patients with respiratory infections were contaminated with respiratory pathogens and to identify which surfaces were most commonly contaminated. Between September-November 2013, we collected respiratory (nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal) swabs from patients hospitalized with respiratory illness in adult medicine and paediatric medicine wards at two public tertiary care hospitals in Bangladesh. We collected surface swabs from up to five surfaces near each case-patient including: the wall, bed rail, bed sheet, clinical file, and multipurpose towel used for care giving purposes. We tested swabs using real-time multiplex PCR for 19 viral and 12 bacterial...","Abstract There are many diseases for which a microbial aetiology is suspected. The hypothesis that a disease has an infectious cause is supported by: clinical features (similar to those of known infectious diseases, e.g. fever, leucocytosis), epidemiology (case clustering in time or location), histology (inflammation of affected tissues, e.g. granulomata) or characteristic microbial structures, treatment (clinical response to antimicrobial treatment), and prevention of disease by vaccines targeting microbial antigens. Proof that a microbe causes a disease requires more rigorous evidence. Future attempts to identify novel microbes associated with human disease may use sequence-based approaches. High-throughput sequencing may allow identification of unique microbial nucleic acid sequences in a background of host DNA. The complete sequencing of the human genome and multiple microbial genomes make this approach more feasible. DNA microarrays are also likely to be used in the search for nov...","2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is an emerging infectious disease closely related to MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV that was first reported in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China in December 2019. As of January 2020, cases of 2019-nCoV are continuing to be reported in other Eastern Asian countries as well as in the United States, Europe, Australia, and numerous other countries. An unusually high volume of domestic and international travel corresponding to the beginning of the 2020 Chinese New Year complicated initial identification and containment of infected persons. Due to the rapidly rising number of cases and reported deaths, all countries should be considered at risk of imported 2019-nCoV. Therefore, it is essential for prehospital, clinic, and emergency department personnel to be able to rapidly assess 2019-nCoV risk and take immediate actions if indicated. The Identify-Isolate-Inform (3I) Tool, originally conceived for the initial detection and management of Ebola virus and later adjust...","The newly emergent Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) can cause severe pulmonary disease in humans(1,2), representing the second example of a highly pathogenic coronavirus, the first being SARS-CoV(3). CD26 (also known as dipeptidyl peptidase 4, DPP4) was recently identified as the cellular receptor for MERS-CoV(4). The engagement of the MERS-CoV spike protein with CD26 mediates viral attachment to host cells and virus\u2013cell fusion, thereby initiating infection. Here we delineate the molecular basis of this specific interaction by presenting the first crystal structures of both the free receptor binding domain (RBD) of the MERS-CoV spike protein and its complex with CD26. Furthermore, binding between the RBD and CD26 is measured using real-time surface plasmon resonance with a dissociation constant of 16.7 nM. The viral RBD is composed of a core subdomain homologous to that of the SARS-CoV spike protein, and a unique strand-dominated external receptor binding motif ...","AbstractThe rigidity and flexibility of two recently reported crystal structures (PDB entries 6Y2E and 6LU7) of a protease from the SARS-CoV-2 virus, the infectious agent of the COVID-19 respiratory disease, has been investigated using pebble-game rigidity analysis, elastic network model normal mode analysis, and all-atom geometric simulations. This computational investigation of the viral protease follows protocols that have been effective in studying other homodimeric enzymes. The protease is predicted to display flexible motions in vivo which directly affect the geometry of a known inhibitor binding site and which open new potential binding sites elsewhere in the structure. A database of generated PDB files representing natural flexible variations on the crystal structures has been produced and made available for download from an institutional data archive. This information may inform structure-based drug design and fragment screening efforts aimed at identifying specific antiviral ...","Background: The first outbreaks of COVID-19 in Italy occurred during the second half of February 2020 in some areas in the North of the country. Due to the high contagiousness of the infection, further spread by asymptomatic people, Italy has become in a few weeks the country with the greatest number of infected people after China. The large number of severe cases among infected people in Italy led to the hospitalization of thousands of patients, with a heavy burden on the National Health Service. Methods: We analyzed data provided daily by Italian Authorities for the period from 24 February 2020 to 26 March 2020. Considering such information, we developed a forecast model in real-time, based on the cumulative logistic distribution. We then produced an estimate of the overall number of potentially infected individuals and epidemic duration at a national and Regional level, for the most affected Regions. Results: We reported the daily distribution of performed swabs and confirmed cases,...","Abstract Metagenomics, i.e., the sequencing and analysis of genomic information extracted directly from clinical or environmental samples, has become a fundamental tool to explore the viral world. Against the background of an extensive viral diversity revealed by metagenomics across many environments, new sequence assembly approaches that reconstruct complete genome sequences from metagenomes have recently revealed surprisingly cosmopolitan viruses in specific ecological niches. Metagenomics is also applied to clinical samples as a non-targeted diagnostic and surveillance tool. By enabling the study of these uncultivated viruses, metagenomics provides invaluable insights into the virus-host interactions, epidemiology, ecology, and evolution of viruses across all ecosystems.","Background: Novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) is extending its range of transmission in all parts of the world, with substantial variation in rates of transmission and severity of associated disease. Methods: We evaluated whether and under which conditions it is possible to control and slow down a COVID-19 epidemic in the early stages by isolation and contact tracing. We used a stochastic transmission model in which every person generates novel infections according to a probability distribution that is affected by the incubation period distribution (time from infection to symptoms), distribution of the latent period (time from infection to a person becoming infectious), and overall transmissibility. The model distinguishes between close contacts (e.g., within a household) and other contacts in the population. Findings: The analyses showed that transmissibility and the duration of the latent period relative to the duration of incubation period have strong impact on the controllability of t...","Importance A large number of healthcare workers (HCWs) were infected by SARS-CoV-2 during the ongoing outbreak of COVID-19 in Wuhan, China. Hospitals are significant epicenters for the human-to-human transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 for HCWs, patients, and visitors. No data has been reported on the details of hospital environmental contamination status in the epicenter of Wuhan. Objective To investigate the extent to which SARS-CoV-2 contaminates healthcare settings, including to identify function zones of the hospital with the highest contamination levels and to identify the most contaminated objects, and personal protection equipment (PPE) in Wuhan, China. Design A field investigation was conducted to collect the surface swabs in various environments in the hospital and a laboratory experiment was conducted to examine the presence of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Setting Six hundred twenty-six surface samples were collected within the Zhongnan Medical Center in Wuhan, China in the mist of the CO...","","Abstract To overcome the limitations of the state-of-the-art influenza surveillance systems in Europe, we established in 2008 a European-wide consortium aimed at introducing an innovative information and communication technology approach for a web-based surveillance system across different European countries, called Influenzanet. The system, based on earlier efforts in The Netherlands and Portugal, works with the participation of the population in each country to collect real-time information on the distribution of influenza-like illness cases through web surveys administered to volunteers reporting their symptoms (or lack of symptoms) every week during the influenza season. Such a large European-wide web-based monitoring infrastructure is intended to rapidly identify public health emergencies, contribute to understanding global trends, inform data-driven forecast models to assess the impact on the population, optimize the allocation of resources, and help in devising mitigation and co...","Abstract Feed for livestock animals have been under increased scrutiny as a vector for pathogenic bacteria leading to human illnesses. Control of these pathogenic bacteria in animal feeds can be controlled via physical and chemical means. Physical methods can include thermal processing, including irradiation, pelleting, and extrusion. Chemical mitigation can be accomplished through the inclusion of various additives, including formaldehyde, organic acids, essential oils, or medium chain fatty acids. While physical and chemical interventions can help mitigate risk of pathogens contaminating finished animal feeds, the implementation of a biosecurity plan at the feed mill can help prevent pathogens from entering or spreading throughout the facility.","Background: The outbreak of novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP) caused by 2019-nCoV spread rapidly, and elucidation the diagnostic accuracy of different respiratory specimens is crucial for the control and treatment of this diseases. Methods: Respiratory samples including nasal swabs, throat swabs, sputum and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) were collected from Guangdong CDC confirmed NCP patients, and viral RNAs were detected using a CFDA approved detection kit. Results were analyzed in combination with sample collection date and clinical information. Finding: Except for BALF, the sputum possessed the highest positive rate (74.4%~88.9%), followed by nasal swabs (53.6%~73.3%) for both severe and mild cases during the first 14 days after illness onset (d.a.o). For samples collected \u2265 15 d.a.o, sputum and nasal swabs still possessed a high positive rate ranging from 42.9%~61.1%. The positive rate of throat swabs collected \u2265 8 d.a.o was low, especially in samples from mild cases. Viral R...","BACKGROUND Person to person spread of COIVD-19 in the UK has now been confirmed. There are limited case series reporting the impact on women affected by coronaviruses (CoV) during pregnancy. In women affected by SARS and MERS, the case fatality rate appeared higher in women affected in pregnancy compared with non-pregnant women. We conducted a rapid, review to guide management of women affected by COVID -19 during pregnancy and developed interim practice guidance with the RCOG and RCPCH to inform maternity and neonatal service planning METHODS Searches were conducted in PubMed and MedRxiv to identify primary case reports, case series, observational studies or randomised-controlled trial describing women affected by coronavirus in pregnancy and on neonates. Data was extracted from relevant papers and the review was drafted with representatives of the RCPCH and RCOG who also provided expert consensus on areas where data were lacking RESULTS From 9964 results on PubMed and 600 on MedRxiv,...","Abstract Reprocessing of used N95 respirators may ameliorate supply chain constraints during the COVID-19 pandemic and provide a higher filtration crisis alternative. The FDA Medical Countermeasures Initiative previously funded a study of HP vapor decontamination of respirators using a Clarus C system (Bioquell, Horsham, PA) which normally is used to fumigate hospital rooms. The process preserved respirator function, but it is unknown if HP vapor would be virucidal since respirators have porous fabric that may harbor virus. We evaluated the virucidal activity of HP vapor using a BQ-50 system (Bioquell, Horsham, PA) after inoculating 3M 1870 N95 respirators (3M, St. Paul, MN) with 3 aerosolized bacteriophage that are a reasonable proxy for SARS-CoV-2. Inoculation resulted in contamination of the respirator with 9.87e4 plaque forming units (PFU) of phage phi-6, 4.17e7 PFU of phage T7 and 1.35e7 PFU of phage T1. Respirators were reprocessed with BQ-50 with a long aeration phase to reduce ...","DNA microarrays have emerged as a viable platform for detection of pathogenic organisms in clinical and environmental samples. These microbial detection arrays occupy a middle ground between low cost, narrowly focused assays such as multiplex PCR and more expensive, broad-spectrum technologies like high-throughput sequencing. While pathogen detection arrays have been used primarily in a research context, several groups are aggressively working to develop arrays for clinical diagnostics, food safety testing, environmental monitoring and biodefense. Statistical algorithms that can analyze data from microbial detection arrays and provide easily interpretable results are absolutely required in order for these efforts to succeed. In this article, we will review the most promising array designs and analysis algorithms that have been developed to date, comparing their strengths and weaknesses for pathogen detection and discovery.","","Systemic feline diseases (parasitic, bacterial, fungal, viral, neoplastic, metabolic, vascular, and immune-mediated) are often associated with ocular symptoms. An ocular examination is an important diagnostic tool and should be part of any physical examination. Conversely, cats afflicted with systemic disease require periodic ocular examinations for prognostic information and to prevent vision threatening complications. Typical feline systemic diseases encountered by the practicing clinician are presented with their commonly associated ocular signs.","","Summary This is an informal review of some of the trends in the infection prevention and control literature since the last Healthcare Infection Society (HIS) conference in late 2012. Google Trends was used to investigate how the volume of interest in various infection control topics had changed over time. Ebola trumped all the others in Google searches, reflecting a surge of publications in the literature. Aside from Ebola, other trends in the infection prevention and control literature covered in this article include Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) coronavirus, universal versus targeted interventions, faecal microbiota transplantation, whole genome sequencing, carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae, and some aspects of environmental science. The review ends with an attempt to predict some of the trends in the infection prevention and control literature between now and the next HIS conference in 2016.","Abstract SARS is a new infection in human. Patients recovering from SARS had palpitation in the form of sinus tachycardia. This study to identify the possible causes for the tachycardia excluded active disease, thyroid dysfunction, haematological, cardiac, autonomic and significant pulmonary defect at 2 months from onset of disease. The symptomatology was attributed to physical deconditioning and anxiety state. Physical and psychological fitness should be restored with rehabilitation.","We integrate the human movement and healthcare resource data to identify cities with high vulnerability towards the 2019-nCoV epidemic with respect to available health resources. The results inform public health responses in multiple ways.","The recent Ebola and Zika epidemics demonstrate the need for the continuous surveillance, rapid diagnosis and real-time tracking of emerging infectious diseases. Fast, affordable sequencing of pathogen genomes \u2014 now a staple of the public health microbiology laboratory in well-resourced settings \u2014 can affect each of these areas. Coupling genomic diagnostics and epidemiology to innovative digital disease detection platforms raises the possibility of an open, global, digital pathogen surveillance system. When informed by a One Health approach, in which human, animal and environmental health are considered together, such a genomics-based system has profound potential to improve public health in settings lacking robust laboratory capacity.

They are readily inactivated by physical and chemical agents. 7 Assuming viral shedding follows the usual pattern for such viruses, surfaces should be easily decontaminated. Infectious droplets generated in aerosols and landing on environmental surfaces will be inactivated by simple detergent treatment. Thus, standard infection control decontamination procedures are entirely appropriate in the current situation, but once again, confusion has arisen because guidelines are not 'standard' or consistent. It is, for example, surprising to notice that WHO recommend decontamination with disinfectant, specifically, chlorine at strength of 500 ppm and not detergent. Indeed, usage of disinfectants during this pandemic has been advised in other European countries and in the USA.","Coronaviruses are airborne viruses that produce nosocomial infections [54] . They are mainly transmitted through droplet infection [55] . When the virus released from the animals or humans, it passes through the air and may drop on some services or objects. Some respiratory pathogens with pandemic potential such as H1N1, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV may remain viable in the environment for a longer time up to months on these objects until picked up with another person to contaminate the mucus membranes through touching the nose, mouse or eyes [56] . There are several factors that control the virus's survival in the environment on these objects, such as the J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Journal Pre-proof temperature, the relative humidity, the strain of the virus [56] . Some coronaviruses such as HCoV-229E and MERS-CoV were detected on some environmental surfaces during some outbreaks [57, 58] . One of the critical control measures in the case of airborne infection is to develop novel assays that enable us to detect and estimate the virus concentration in the air. This approach will have great implications, especially in the health care settings. The process of decontamination of the virus-contaminated surfaces by the appropriate disinfectants or virucidal agents was successful in case of other respiratory viruses such as SARS-CoV and avian influenza [59] . The hydrogen peroxide vapor showed great success in the decontamination of surfaces contaminated with SARS-CoV and avian influenza viruses [59] . The WHO suggested using two ","WHO recommended that probable SARS patients be placed in a negative pressure room, isolated in a single room or cohorted in areas with independent air circulation. 35 In response to this a number of countries and areas designated certain hospitals or wards for SARS patients only. Others constructed new isolation wards and rooms or carried out extensive engineering modifications to existing structures. 22, [36] [37] [38] Those lacking such facilities and resources responded with innovative solutions. Three examples were: hospital staff attempting to create negative-pressure relative to hallways by using fans and windows opening to the exterior; the development of guidelines to enable the re-use of respirators; and the erection of glass walls in hallways to create anterooms to patients' rooms. 7, 22 Physical space separation There is evidence indicating that the risk of developing SARS was related to proximity to a case. 2, 5, 39, 40 In one study a 'Hierarchy of Risk' was developed which showed that the risk of infection increased with proximity of contact, and that in the absence of aerosol-generating procedures, exposures !1 m from a case of SARS (with or without contact) were those that posed the highest risk. 2 These results suggest that physical separation of SARS patients from HCWs, hospital visitors and other patients should reduce the transmission of SARS. Indeed, in many of the areas with a large number of SARS cases several different measures were implemented in order to do this. These included the rapid identification and isolation of possible SARS patients waiting in Emergency Departments; isolating potential SARS patients either individually or in cohorts; designating lifts for use by potential SARS cases only; and, using anterooms for the donning and removal of PPE. 3, 7, 22, 23 Handwashing Despite a number of studies demonstrating that handwashing is effective in reducing the transmission of pathogens, it is recognised that compliance among HCWs is poor. 41, 42 Although there have not been any formal evaluations of the impact of handwashing on SARS-CoV transmission, recent evidence indicates that HCWs who washed their hands while caring for SARS patients were less likely to develop SARS compared to those that did not. 30 Environmental decontamination SARS-CoV is present in all body fluids making precautions with waste disposal essential. There is also evidence of probable survival on inanimate hospital surfaces for up to 72 h. 11 The cleaning and disinfection of environmental surfaces in hospitals employing commonly used disinfectants is believed to be effective against SARS-CoV. 11 There is little research evidence, however, regarding the effectiveness of this practice in reducing hospital transmission of SARS.","Viruses do not replicate outside living cell but infectious virus may persist on contaminated environmental surfaces and the duration of persistence of viable virus is affected markedly by temperature and humidity. Contaminated surfaces are known to be significant vectors in the transmission of infections in the hospital setting as well as the community. The role of fomites in the transmission of RSV has been clearly demonstrated [20]. Survival of viruses on a variety of fomites has been studied for influenza viruses, paramyxoviruses, poxviruses, and retroviruses [21]. The human coronavirus associated with the common cold was reported to remain viable only for 3 hours on environmental surfaces after drying, although it remains viable for many days in liquid suspension [13]. Parainfluenza and RSV viruses were viable after drying on surfaces for 2 and 6 hours, respectively [20, 22]. In aerosolised form, human coronavirus 229E is generally less stable in high humidity [12]. The environmental stability of SCoV was previously unknown and this information is clearly important for understanding the mechanisms of transmission of this virus in a hospital and community setting. ","This increases the intensity of their work and requires great physical energy, causing severe hypoxia and physical symptoms such as headache and muscle soreness. Other symptoms such as obsessive-compulsive symptoms, interpersonal sensitivity, depression, anxiety, phobic anxiety, hostility, and paranoid ideation are all normal psychological reactions in the handling of emergencies and environmental stimuli. In face of a disaster, persons with good mental health will tend to actively take measures such as catharsis, transference, compensation, relaxation, humor, self-consolation, and rational response.

The strong survival ability of SARS-CoV over surfaces of commonly used materials in domestic and working environments have been quantitatively proved by in vitro models.9 Therefore, the disinfection of the ophthalmic instruments as well as the environmental surfaces in frequent contact with patients are deemed as one of the key infection containment measures. Susceptibility of human coronaviruses 229E and OC43 to chemical disinfection has been demonstrated by biological viral titration assay,10, 11 whereas similar in vitro data concerning the efficacy of different hospital disinfectant products (US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) registered disinfectants) against this novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV) is currently lacking.12 Nevertheless, we can still make use of the available chemical germicides that could inactivate related viruses with similar physical and biochemical properties as the possible SARS agents. The adopted disinfection protocols in our ophthalmic practice are in line with the recommendation by the Centers for Disease Control &amp; Prevention13 and based on the scientific evidences provided by APIC guidelines.14","The environmental survival of Ebola virus has been studied using culture-based techniques under a variety of environmental conditions (eg, temperature, humidity), in various liquids, aerosols, and surfaces. [43] [44] [45] [46] [47] [48] [49] These studies may be summarized as follows. First, viable Ebola can survive in liquids (eg, liquid media, tissue culture media, water, liquid blood, plasma) for days to weeks. Second, viable Ebola virus can also survive dried on a variety of surfaces (eg, plastic, glass, stainless steel, polypropylene, nitrile, bank notes) for days to weeks. Third, Ebola survives in liquids and on surfaces for a longer duration of time at lower temperatures (eg, 4\u00b0C vs 21\u00b0C). Fourth, although aerosol transmission has not been observed, Ebola virus has been demonstrated to survive in an aerosol for &gt;3 hours. Fifth, survival of Ebola on porous surfaces, such as cotton, is substantially less than on steel and plastic surfaces.","Since December 2019, more than 350,000 cases of the novel coronavirus have been reported globally, and more than 15,000 people have died. The actual number of cases is likely much higher, 1 and the disease is still in its early phases, meaning that COVID-19 could have a staggering human toll. No matter its ultimate trajectory, the virus has already sparked an economic crisis, which will 2 have its own implications for global justice. 3 More now than ever, scientists and public officials need access to good, accurate information to inform their research and decision-making. Top researchers in affected nations have swiftly taken up the charge, researching the virus, its trajectory, and best practices for treating and preventing the spread of the virus. But scientists' task does not end with analyzing results. Here at Ripeta, we have always recognized that open science supports good science, so this outbreak has heightened the importance of transparently sharing data, analysis methods, software, and code. When research is truly reproducible, it allows researchers to evaluate and expand upon each other's work. Right now, 4 that could mean lives saved. And, the easier it is for researchers to replicate each other's work, the more quickly we will learn about COVID-19. We echo the sentiments of Wellcome Trust, which has urged \" researchers, journals and funders to ensure that the research findings and data relevant to this outbreak are shared rapidly and openly to inform the public health response and help save lives.\" 5","Extensive environmental contamination has been documented by both culture and RT-PCR in clinical areas housing MERS patients. 84, 85 Positive sites have included patient room surfaces (eg, bed sheets, bedrails, intravenous fluid hangers), anteroom surfaces, medical devices (eg, portable x-ray machines, thermometers), and air-ventilating equipment. Touchable surfaces have been found to be contaminated through respiratory secretions from clinically fully recovered patients. 84 MERS-CoV has also been detected in air samples in the vicinity of patients. 85 However, 1 large outbreak evaluation failed to demonstrate any transmission via the potentially contaminated environment without direct contact with the index case. 86 MERS-CoV has been shown to be recoverable after 48 hours on steel or plastic washers (20\u00b0C and 40% relative humidity). 87 Further, no decrease in stability was observed during aerosolization experiments. Multiple studies on CoVs other than MERS-CoV have demonstrated that these viruses can remain viable for days to weeks on environmental surfaces. 88, 89 Survival is enhanced at low temperatures (ie, 4\u00b0C vs 20\u00b0C). 89 ","Several other studies have identified multidrug resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae in hospital environments and its association with severe infections, prolonged hospital stays and increased mortality rates, particularly in debilitated and immunocompromised patients [23, 24]. A 2004 study in an urban tertiary care hospital in Dhaka, Bangladesh, reported that 40% of the clinical specimens (sputum, pus, urine, throat, and vaginal swabs) collected from hospitalized patients were drug resistant [25]. Moreover, our study findings were consistent between the two hospitals despite being located in different geographical areas and may suggest surface contamination with Klebsiella pneumoniae as a wider public health problem. The predominant bacterial pathogens we identified, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Staphylococcus aureus, can survive on surfaces from a few days to a few months [5, 26, 27]. Bacteria, in the presence of low humidity, forms biofilms protecting microorganisms from harsh environmental influences and are difficult to eradicate [28, 29]. In Bangladesh, hospital surfaces are not adequately cleaned and hospitals report insufficient supplies of cleaning agents [7, 8, 30]. To remove and prevent biofilm formation, hospital decontamination protocols should include strategies such as daily cleaning of surfaces with disinfectant (e.g. 0.3% sodium hypochlorite or 2% chlorhexidine solutions).","In addition to population mobility and human-to-human contact, environmental factors can impact droplet transmission and survival of viruses (e.g., influenza) but have not yet been examined for this novel pathogen. Absolute humidity, defined as the water content in ambient air, has been found to be a strong environmental determinant of other viral transmissions (4, 5) . For example, influenza viruses survive longer on surfaces or in droplets in cold and dry air -increasing the likelihood of subsequent transmission. Thus, it is key to understand the effects of environmental factors on the ongoing outbreak to support decision-making pertaining to disease control. Especially in locations where the risk of transmission may have been underestimated, such as in humid and warmer locations.","Risk assessment Phobic patients: \u25a0 are often not just dentally anxious but may show a range of other complaints \u25a0 report poorer perceived dental health, a longer interval since their last dental appointment, a higher frequency of past fear behaviours, more physical symptoms during the last dental injection, and a higher percentage of symptoms of anxiety and depression \u25a0 may genuinely want dental care but can be unable to cooperate, may be unaware of their response to their anxiety and, as a consequence, may be hostile in their responses or behaviour \u25a0 may chat incessantly, have a 355 Specific problem areas -PHOBIAS ","An assessment of the environmental impact of accidental release involves consider ation of the host microorganism and the GMO. Relevant characteristics of the host include reproductive cycles, survival, stability of genetic traits, pathogenicity, viru lence, infectivity, toxicity, host range, natural habitat and geographical distribution, involvement in environmental processes and interactions with other organisms. Characteristics of the GMO which should be evaluated include the nature of the genetic modification, function of the cloned gene(s), the nature and source of the vector, the amount of non-native DNA in the final construct, genetic stability, frequency of plasmid mobilization or other forms of genetic exchange, the level of expression of inserted genes and the activity of expressed protein, survival and multiplication in the environment, and techniques for monitoring persistence and detecting gene transfer. Risk assessment should also take into consideration the site where accidental release might occur, and details of the ecosystem at risk, including geographical and climatic features, social factors and possible methods for decontamination of the area in the event of accident.","Widespread contamination of the surface environment has been reported by multiple investigators. 138 Importantly, contaminated sites have included sites in the patient's room such as surfaces, toilets, ventilator/respiratory equipment, and sites outside of the patient's room such as computer workstations, thermometers, glucometers, housekeeping carts, dialysis equipment, ultrasound equipment, and vital sign machines. 138 The environmental survival of C auris has been studied. 144, 147, 148 In laboratory tests, C auris and other Candida spp were demonstrated to persist for 7 days on moist or dry (steel disks) surfaces. 147 Survival on dry linen for up to 7 days has been demonstrated. 148 C auris cells have been demonstrated to remain viable on plastic surfaces for at least 4 weeks, or 2 weeks after they were no longer culturable. 148 ","We included environmentally mediated transmission and transmission from asymptomatic individuals in our general mathematical framework. However, the relative importance of these transmission routes remain speculative based on current data. Cleaning and decontamination are being deployed to varying levels in different settings, and improved estimates of their relative importance would help inform this as a priority. Asymptomatic infection has been widely reported for COVID-19, e.g., (14) , unlike for SARS where this was very rare (37). We argue that the reports from Singapore imply that even if asymptomatic infections are common, onward transmission from this state is probably uncommon, since forensic reconstruction of the transmission networks has closed down most missing links. There is an important caveat to this: the Singapore outbreak to date is small and has not implicated children. There has been widespread speculation that children could be frequent asymptomatic carriers and potential sources of SARS-CoV-2 (38,39).","Physical preparation of the department should involve removing any extraneous materials from treatment areas. This process will mean that if decontamination is required the process should be more straightforward. Wherever possible staff should be trained in the use of PPE and be fit tested for the appropriate masks. If time and staffing allow the team should rehearse treating a patient whilst wearing PPE so they can be accustomed to this in a non-urgent care setting.","Therefore, when they suddenly encounter such sudden public health events, they tend to suffer anxiety and phobic anxiety, leading to physical and mental problems. That is why scores of the factors somatization, obsessive-compulsive, anxiety, phobic anxiety, and psychoticism were significantly higher than in the norm group. This result suggests that psychologists and team leaders should pay more attention to the anxiety, phobic anxiety, and psychoticism issues of the medical personnel in a team. The average score for the interpersonal sensitivity factor of medical personnel was significantly lower than that of the norm group. This shows that in the event of an infectious disease epidemic, the majority of medical personnel are united and have good professional strengths and qualities for self-regulation and self-protection. The results of this study show partial consistency with the studies of the mental health status of front-line medical personnel for SARS in 2003 [9] .","Because of the potential for transmission to laboratory workers from patient specimens, the CDC recommends that laboratory workers use a class 2 biological safety cabinet and personal protective equipment when processing specimens with potential to generate fine particulate matter. Decontamination of work surfaces and equipment with Environmental Protection Agencyeregistered hospital disinfectant is of paramount importance. 21 When transporting suspected case specimens, the International Air Transport Association guidelines for dangerous goods must be followed. 21 Response and Public Health Impact Chinese officials closed the fish market initially suspected as the source of the virus on January 1, 2020. On January 20, China China was initially lauded for its efforts to control the outbreak, including the construction of a 1000 bed medical facility in less than 10 days. More recently, the death of a Chinese physician Li Wenlinag, who was reprimanded by Chinese authorities for sounding the alarm about a cluster of pneumonia in December, has rekindled misgivings about how China is handling the situation.","The transmission of influenza can be mathematically modeled to help predicting how the virus will spread in a population [27, 28] . People who contract influenza are most infectious between the second and third days after infection, and infectivity lasts for around 10 days [27] . Children are much more infectious than adults, and shed virus from just before they develop symptoms until 2 weeks after infection [27, 29] . For influenza control it is very important to investigate viral shedding and resistant viruses [29] . According to Mitamura and colleagues [29] , viral loads are decreased after the start of antiviral agents, but resistant viruses are detected in some patients. Influenza can be spread by direct transmission when an infected person sneezes mucus into the eyes, nose, or mouth of another person; through people inhaling the aerosols produced by infected people with coughing, sneezing, and spitting; and through hand-to-mouth transmission from contaminated surfaces or direct personal contact [30, 31] . The relative importance of airborne, droplet, and contact transmission of influenza A virus and the efficiency of control measures depends on the inactivation of viruses in different environmental media. Weber and colleagues [31] systematically reviewed information on the environmental inactivation of influenza A viruses and modes of transmission. The airborne route is a potentially important transmission pathway for influenza in indoor environments. The importance of droplet transmission has to be reassessed. Contact transmission can be limited by fast inactivation of influenza virus on hands, and is more dependent on behavioral parameters than airborne transmission. However, the potentially large inocula deposited in the environment through sneezing and the protective effect of nasal mucus on virus survival could make contact transmission a key transmission mode. In the airborne route, it has been demonstrated that the inhalation of just one inhalable droplet (0.5-5 lm in diameter) might be enough to cause an infection [31] . Although a single sneeze releases up to 40,000 droplets [32] , most of these droplets are large and will quickly settle out of the air [31] . The influenza virus can also be transmitted by contaminated surfaces. Successful control of a viral disease requires knowledge of the different vectors that could promote its transmission among hosts. Thomas and colleagues [33] assessed the survival of human influenza viruses on banknotes, given that billions of these notes are exchanged daily worldwide. Banknotes were experimentally contaminated with representative influenza virus subtypes at various concentrations, and survival was tested after different time periods. Influenza A viruses tested by cell culture survived up to 3 days when they were inoculated at high concentrations. The same inoculum in the presence of respiratory mucus showed a striking increase in survival time (up to 17 days). B/Hong Kong/335/2001 virus was still infectious after 1 day when it was mixed with respiratory mucus. When nasopharyngeal secretions of naturally infected children were used, influenza virus survived for at least 48 h in one-third of the cases. The investigators concluded that unexpected stability of influenza virus in this nonbiological environment suggests that unusual environmental contamination should be considered in the setting of pandemic preparedness [33] . Bean and colleagues investigated the transmission of influenza viruses via hands and environmental surfaces; the survival of laboratory-grown influenza A and influenza B viruses on various surfaces was studied. Both influenza A and B viruses survived for 24 to 48 hours on hard, nonporous surfaces such as stainless steel and plastic, but survived for less than 8 to 12 hours on cloth, paper, and tissues. Measurable quantities of influenza A virus were transferred from stainless steel surfaces to hands for 24 hours and from tissues to hands for up to 15 minutes. Virus survived on hands for up to 5 minutes after transfer from the environmental surfaces. Their observations suggest that the transmission of virus from donors who are shedding large amounts could occur for 2 to 8 hours via stainless steel surfaces and for a few minutes via paper tissues. The investigators concluded that the transmission of influenza virus via fomites may be possible under conditions of heavy environmental contamination [34] . However, if the virus is present in mucus, the virus can survive for longer periods [31] .","Human-human transmission occurs through aerosol droplets or contaminated surfaces and fomites. It has been shown that the virus can persist for up to 2 days on environmental surfaces. Many cases were nosocomial as the majority of virus shedding only occurs after the onset of illness (around 5 days postinfection). Approximately 33%-42% of SARS cases were in healthcare works, while 22%-39% of cases were through transmission between family members. The R0 for the virus is between 2 and 4, but measures to limit spread were highly effective and brought this down to around 0.4 to quell the outbreak.","The maximal number of decontamination cycles has been suggested to be determined by the physical degradation of the respirator material, rather than the loss of filtration capacity. 4 As such, we recommend that hospitals employing this approach take additional precautions such as: 1) labeling N95 respirators so that they can be reused by the same individual, and 2) marking the number of times the same mask has undergone decontamination, as was recommended by Lowe et al. 12 In contrast to the eventual degradation of the respirator material, Lindsley et al. 4 found that the straps retained their structural integrity even at high UV doses. This is crucial for maintaining the tight fit of the mask through repeated decontamination cycles.","No data were found to describe the frequency of hands becoming contaminated with coronavirus, or the viral load on hands either, after patient contact or after touching contaminated surfaces. The WHO recommends to preferably apply alcohol-based hand rubs for the decontamination of hands, e.g. after removing gloves. Two WHO recommended formulations (based on 80% ethanol or 75% 2-propanol) have been evaluated in suspension tests against SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, and both were described to be very effective [14] . No in vitro data were found on the efficacy of hand washing against coronavirus contaminations on hands. In Taiwan, however, it was described that installing hand wash stations in the emergency department was the only infection control measure which was significantly associated with the protection from healthcare workers from acquiring the SARS-CoV, indicating that hand hygiene can have a protective effect [15] . Compliance with hand hygiene can be significantly higher in an outbreak situation but is likely to remain an obstacle especially among physicians [16e18] . Transmission in healthcare settings can be successfully prevented when appropriate measures are consistently performed [19, 20] .","In this study, we showed that high temperature at high relative humidity has a synergistic effect on inactivation of SARS CoV viability while lower temperatures and low humidity support prolonged survival of virus on contaminated surfaces. The environmental conditions of countries such as Malaysia, Indonesia, and Thailand are thus not conducive to the prolonged survival of the virus. In countries such as Singapore and Hong Kong where there is a intensive use of air-conditioning, transmission largely occurred in well-air-conditioned environments such as hospitals or hotels. Further, a separate study has shown that during the epidemic, the risk of increased daily incidence of SARS was 18.18-fold higher in days with a lower air temperature than in days with a higher temperature in Hong Kong [24] and other regions [15\u201317]. Taken together, these observations may explain why some Asian countries in tropical area (with high temperature at high relative humidity) such as Malaysia, Indonesia, and Thailand did not have nosocomial outbreaks of SARS (Tables 1 and 2(a)\u20132(c)). It may also explain why Singapore, which is also in tropical area (Table 2(d)), had most of its SARS outbreaks in hospitals (air-conditioned environment). Interestingly, during the outbreak of SARS in Guangzhou, clinicians kept the windows of patient rooms open and well ventilated and these may well have reduced virus survival and this reduced nosocomial transmission. SARS CoV can retain its infectivity up to 2 weeks at low temperature and low humidity environment, which might facilitate the virus transmission in community as in Hong Kong which locates in subtropical area (Table 2(e)). Other environmental factors including wind velocity, daily sunlight, and air pressure, had shown to be associated with SARS epidemic, should also be considered [16, 17]. The dynamics of SARS epidemic involves multiple factors including physical property of virus, outdoor and indoor environments, hygiene, space, and genetic predispositions [10, 15\u201317, 24, 25]. Understanding the stability of viruses in different temperature and humidity conditions is important in understanding transmission of novel infectious agent including that of the recent influenza Apandemic H1N12009. ","\u2022 Ensure proper use of personal protection equipment (PPE). Healthcare personnel including technologists, radiologists and cardiac imagers who come in close contact with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 should wear the appropriate personal protective equipment (5, 6) . Patients should wear a surgical mask during imaging to ensure standard droplet precautions. \u2022 Appropriate environmental cleaning and decontamination of rooms by thorough cleaning of the surfaces by a staff member with appropriate PPE as per CDC and local institutional guidelines for airborne viral diseases (7).","It is best to perform as complete a postmortem examination, including brain and spinal cord, as the signed autopsy permit allows. Because it is difficult to ascertain which cases harbor infective agents, it is prudent to consider all autopsies as potential infective sources. The cornerstone of any autopsy biosafety program, therefore, is the practice of standard (universal) infection control precautions as established by the U.S. CDC, 6 the National Institutes of Health, 7 or the World Health Organization. 8 This approach includes proper attire, barrier protection, care while using sharp instruments, tissue fixation, decontamination of equipment and work surfaces, and hand washing (Box 3-1). It also demands containment and treatment, proper cleaning of spills, immediate treatment of any injuries, and notification of the proper authorities (e.g., infection control, environmental health and safety).","Within this context of scarce resources, describing the magnitude of surface contamination in Bangladeshi hospitals, particularly identifying priority areas for decontamination, could influence infection control policy and practice. Our objective was to assess the frequency with which patients hospitalized for respiratory illnesses in Bangladeshi public hospitals contaminate nearby surfaces, to identify commonly contaminated surfaces, and to determine which pathogens are detected most frequently.","It is however likely that immunosuppressed patients may be prone to acquiring the virus at higher risk due to its high efficiency in transmission. The virus shedding has been noted not only in respiratory specimens but also in serum and stool. Importantly, viral shedding can occur for days for weeks furtively in asymptomatic carrier individuals especially children (3, 9, 10) and fecal shedding has been noted in patients without diarrhea.(10) Significant environmental contamination has been noted, including wash-basin, toilet bowl and air outlet fan surfaces in hospitalized patients.(11) Thus, it is prudent to advise transplant recipients to ardently practice mitigation strategies such as social distancing, sanitization, hand hygiene and avoidance of areas known to harbor potentially infected individuals. These recommendations extend to their care providers as well.","3. Observe proper hand hygiene Frequent and thorough handwashing with soap and water is essential. Alcohol-based handrubs can be used when hands are not visibly soiled and handwashing facilities are not immediately available. Personnel should not rub their eyes or touch their mouth, nose, or other mucous membranes while working on exposed equipment. While wearing gloves, personnel should also avoid touching other surfaces in the room that are not involved in the equipment repair (e.g., doorknobs, telephones, test equipment, computer terminals, keyboards, manuals). In addition, personnel should not eat, drink, chew gum, smoke, or apply cosmetics until they have removed all protective wear and washed their hands. 4. Use proper decontamination and transport procedures Equipment should not be transported until it has been cleaned and disinfected and disposables have been removed by housekeeping, central processing, or other appropriate personnel. (Note that commonly used disinfectants are effective against the SARS virus.) If equipment from the room of a SARS patient must be removed before the exterior can be cleaned and disinfected, follow any hospital policies on transporting contaminated devices. 5 . Choose an appropriate work area Equipment that poses particular infection concerns should be worked on in designated areas where servicing can be performed without the risk of infecting patients or other employees. These areas should not be near any patient care areas, food preparation or storage areas, medication areas, or other clean areas.","filtration efficiency without sacrificing breathability. Representative examples include fabrication using nanofibers and incorporation of electric charge by plasma treatment and charge-carrying agents. However, major technical challenges remain to be addressed for effective preparedness from the standpoint of contamination and infrastructure. Hence, production of a filter that inactivates the collected pathogens would bring key improvements to current surgical masks and respirators, resulting in increased protection, reduced risk of cross[ 1 0 9 _ T D $ D I F F ] -infection, and recyclability without decontamination ( Figure 1 ).","Surface modifications of nanoparticles that change their overall charge and hydrophobicity are aimed at improving mucoadherence properties (des Rieux et al., 2006) . This can be achieved by coating with stabilizers, other polymers, or surfactants. Polyethylene glycol has been used for its stabilizing properties and because it can enhance the affinity of the nanoparticles for mucosal surfaces. Molecules such as lectins and chitosan can also increase interaction with and transport across the mucosal surface. Interestingly, chitosan is reported to be able to open tight junctions between epithelial cells, facilitating the transport of encapsulated macromolecules across the epithelial layer . Nanoparticles coated with mannose (mannan) have also been produced with the aim of targeting mannose receptors on APCs, thus improving cell adhesion and uptake (Cui and Mumper, 2003) .","The international medical and research communities responded with unprecedented speed, and identified the causative agent as a new coronavirus, now called the SARS virus, within 2 months. Genetic analysis indicates that the virus is only identical in 50-60% of nucleotide sequence to other known coronaviruses. As it is an RNA virus, it is inherently highly mutable. Sequence comparisons of different isolates of the SARS virus show several variable sites, the biological significance of which has yet to be determined. Many aspects of the behavior of the SARS virus are currently poorly understood. Questions include the viral concentrations in different body fluids, and the stage of the illness in which viral shedding is highest. Survival time in the environment, on dry surfaces and in suspension (e.g. feces) is also being investigated. There are preliminary suggestions that viable virus could be cultured from surfaces after 24 h, which is longer than many similar viruses are expected to survive in the environment.","To improve the understanding of potential environmental transmission risk of SARS-CoV-2, 30 refine IPC practices and protocols within the NBU and NQU specifically, and inform outbreak control strategies more broadly, we initiated an ongoing study to obtain surface and air samples in 2 NBU hospital and 9 NQU residential isolation rooms where individuals who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 were being monitored. Samples were obtained in the NQU on days 5-9 of activation, i.e. when mildly ill or asymptomatic individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 were housed in their 35 rooms for five to nine days. Samples were obtained in the NBU on day 10, when Patients 1 and 2 had been admitted for ten days. Additional samples were obtained in the NBU on day 18, after Patient 3 had been admitted to the unit for four days. Three types of samples were taken during this survey: surface samples, high volume air samples, and low volume personal air samples. The surface samples fell into three general categories of location: common room surfaces, personal 40 items, and toilets. Personal items were those items considered to be handled routinely by individuals in isolation and included: cellular phones, exercise equipment, television remotes, and medical equipment. Room surfaces were areas such as ventilation grates, tabletops, and window ledges. Toilet samples were taken to evaluate the potential for viral shedding during toileting. Air samples were collected both in isolation rooms and in the hallways of the NBU and NQU during samples were taken in the hallways during sampling activities and samplers were placed on the floor adjacent to rooms where sampling activities were taking place. Personal air samplers were worn by sampling personnel on two occasions during sampling activities: once during sampling at the NQU when 6 individual rooms were sampled, and once in the hospital NBU when one room was sampled. It is important to note that all individuals in NQU isolation had mild illness such as 5 low fever, cough, or body aches, had been advised to maintain a 6-foot distance from staff members who entered their room as well as wear a procedure mask when interacting with these personnel. Individuals in isolation were instructed that they could remove the mask during air sampling activities; however, many individuals were uncomfortable removing their mask and therefore the impact of infected individuals wearing masks can neither be assessed in this study 10 nor can its impacts be removed.","Definitions There are four main types of phobia: \u25a0 Claustrophobiafear of closed spaces, is probably the most common phobic disorder \u25a0 Agoraphobia -fear of being in public places from which escape might be difficult or help unavailable \u25a0 Social phobia -overwhelming anxiety and excessive self-consciousness in normal social situations \u25a0 Simple, or specific phobias (phobic neurosis) -a morbid irrational fear, or anxiety out of all proportion to the threat: \u2022 phobic neuroses differ from anxiety neuroses in that the phobic anxiety arises only in specific circumstances, whereas patients with anxiety neuroses are generally anxious \u2022 common specific phobias are centred on heights, tunnels, driving, water, flying, insects, dogs, injuries involving blood, and dental procedures \u2022 dental 'phobia' is more extreme than straightforward anxiety and is characterised by avoidance behaviour -previous frightening dental experiences are often the major factor in its development.","We designed 14 small peptides derived from S protein to analyze their inhibitory effects on the interaction of S protein and ACE2. Interaction of viral proteins with cellular receptors is mostly determined by hydrophobic interaction, surface charge distribution, and geometry (Dimitrov, 2004) . In an attempt to design the small peptides, we analyzed the hydrophilicity, surface probability, and chain flexibility of SARS-CoV S protein according to Kyte and Doolittle plots, Emini prediction, and Karplus and Schulz prediction, respectively (Emini et al., 1985; Karplus and Schulz, 1985; Kyte and Doolittle, 1982) . Based on these criteria, we designed 14 synthetic peptides of 12 residues ( Table 1 ). The hydrophilic index of 14 small peptides ranged from 1.3344 to \u22120.3012, with an average of 0.042. We employed the Chou-Fasman method which suggested that SP-3 and SP-14 form an \u2423-helical structure while SP-4, SP-8, and SP-10 form a \u2424-sheet (Chou and Fasman, 1978) .","Once COVID-19 has begun to spread within a community, additional efforts to reduce the introduction of the virus into the building can include limiting visitors to the long-term care building. Staff could be screened upon entry for fever or respiratory symptoms. These measures would be in addition to active surveillance for an elevated temperature and even mild respiratory symptoms among residents. Early suspicion and detection of a case will help identify which resources can be deployed to further prevent or reduce the spread of the disease. Hand hygiene remains among the most fundamental measures to prevent disease transmission. Staff, residents, and visitors should all receive instruction on how to properly wash their hands with soap and water. Alcohol hand sanitizer should be available outside of every resident room, as well as in workspaces, dining areas, and other common areas throughout the building. Finally, environmental services should be engaged to perform at least daily cleaning with Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) registered hospital grade disinfectants. These will be paramount to containing the disease, particularly in high traffic areas (eg, dining halls, treatment areas, living spaces, etc.) where residents congregate, and frequently touched surfaces.","Rapid diagnostics plays an important role in disease and outbreak management. The fast and accurate diagnosis of a specific viral infection enables prompt and accurate public health surveillance, prevention and control measures. Local transmission and clusters can be prevented or delayed by isolation of laboratory-confirmed cases and their close contacts quarantined and monitored at home. Rapid diagnostic also facilitates other specific public health interventions such as closure of high-risk facilities and areas associated with the confirmed cases for prompt infection control and environmental decontamination [11, 101] .","Token lists used for symptom identification in narrative notes. \"depression\": [\"depressed\", \"depressive\", \"dysphoric\", \"dysthymic\", \"sad\", \"tearful\"], \"anxiety\" :[\"anxiety\", \"anxious\", \"fearful\", \"frighten\", \"hypervigilant\", \"nervous\", \"panic\", \"phobia\", \"phobic\", \"scared\", \"stress\", \"tense\", \"worried\"], \"suicide\":[\"suicide\",\"suicidal\", \"suicidality\"], \"psychosis\":[\"psychotic\",\"psychosis\",\"hallucinations\",\"delusions\",\"hallucination\",\"delusion\", \"paranoid\",\"paranoia\",\"hallucinate\",\"hallucinated\",\"delusional\"], \"violence\":[\"violence\",\"violent\"]","This risk has historically been mitigated through trailer sanitation and decontamination procedures developed for porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) when high pressure washing alone was found insufficient to inactivate PRRSV [7\u201310]. Because disinfection and drying are more effective when applied to a clean trailer with little or no remaining organic matter, the industry standard for sanitation and decontamination of livestock trailers includes trailer washing, disinfection, and drying, either naturally or with a thermo-assisted drying and decontamination (TADD) system [7\u20139]. Similar research on PEDV demonstrated that the industry standard wash, disinfection, and dry successfully inactivated PEDV on metal surfaces when detergent and a combination of quaternary ammonium and glutaraldehyde disinfect were used [11].","In a recent editorial titled 'Epidemic science in real time', Fineberg and Wilson underscored the critical importance of 'conducting the right science and communicating expert judgment' to 'enable policies to be adjusted appropriately as an epidemic scenario unfolds' [44]. They emphasized that in times of diminishing public health resources, scientists from diverse disciplines - epidemiology, laboratory, social sciences - must work together to respond to immediate threats and follow through with research to understand key attributes of the affected populations and the disease process. The results of such research are needed to inform policy, to develop treatments and interventions, and to update and adjust recommendations as the state of knowledge changes.","For unknown reasons, the cell adhesion of Vero E6 cells to SARS-S (S1-2) substrates, which do not contain the RBD, with a lower efficiency than that of control protein GST (Fig. 2) . The functional comparisons between different but related cell-adhesion proteins are difficult. For example, previously we found that even a single alanine insertion in various places around the cell-binding motif RGD (R: arginine; G: glycine; D: aspartic acid) of the snakevenom-protein rhodostomin could result a dramatically difference of cell-adhesion property. An alanine insertion at position 56 (between 56th and 57th amino acid of rhodostomin) could disrupt the cell-adhesion function of rhodostomin, while single insertions at positions 45-55 were not (Chang et al., 2001) . Because the remaining protein backbone is unchanged in this case, these results suggest that the protein structure of rhodostomin is the key determinant of cell-adhesion function. Even though, the protein backbone may play an important role in other conditions. For example, evidences indicate that positive charge poly-amino acids such as poly-lysine can serve as a cell adhesion component (Mazia et al., 1975; Rajnicek et al., 1998; Brynda et al., 2005) . In addition, net positive charge of cell-attached substratum seems to play a positive role on lamellipodia, filopodia formation, cell-adhesion and cell-growth (Rajnicek et al., 1998; Brynda et al., 2005) . As a result, after analyzing the amino acid sequences of recombinant GST-S1-2 and GST proteins, which encoded by S1-2/pGEX-6P-1 and pGEX-2KS, respectively, we found that pGEX-2KS-encoded GST contains more positive-charge amino acids than S1-2/pGEXT-6P-1-encoded GST-S1-2 (GST: 13%; GST-S1-2: 10%). These phenomena, which include differences on the protein structures and positive changes, may explain the reason why cell adhesion to GST-substrates was more efficient than that of GST-S1-2-substrates. Nonetheless, further functional and structural investigations are needed to address the possibilities. Despite of this, the assay in our condition has a great resolution power (with high reproducibility and significantly) to distinguish the levels of cell adhesion when RBD-containing proteins were used. This suggests that the analysis system has great potentials on the analysis of RBD of viral proteins.","Hospitalized infants with RSV infection should be isolated or grouped to prevent nosocomial cross-infection. Hand washing, use of eye-nose goggles, gowns, gloves, and decontamination of surfaces and fomites are additional control measures.","The SCL-90 self-report inventory: The SCL-90 inventory, compiled by Derogatis in 1975, includes 10 factors and a total of 90 items. Each factor reflects the symptoms and pain of a patient in a certain aspect, and the distribution of symptoms can be understood through the factor scores. The 10 factors include somatization, obsessive-compulsive, depression, anxiety, hostility, phobic anxiety, paranoid ideation, psychoticism, sleep, and diet. Each item was scored using a 5-point Likert scale, ranging none, mild, moderate, moderate to severe, to severe. The total score is the sum of the scores of the 90 items. In previous studies, the homogeneity reliability of the total SCL-90 scale was 0.97, and the homogeneity reliability of each sub-scale was also greater than 0.68. The test-retest reliability was greater than 0.7, and the content validity was above 0.85, which suggest sound reliability and validity.","The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity. 2.2 SCL-90 factor scores of medical personnel compared with national norms [8] The overall average of SCL-90 and mean values of factors (somatization, obsessive-compulsive, anxiety, phobic anxiety, and psychoticism) of medical personnel were significantly higher than that of the norm group (p &lt; 0.05 or p &lt; 0.01),","\u2610Purpose and intent of the external review (e.g., to improve quality, gather feedback on draft recommendations, assess applicability and feasibility, disseminate evidence) \u2610Methods taken to undertake the external review (e.g., rating scale, open-ended questions) \u2610Description of the external reviewers (e.g., number, type of reviewers, affiliations) \u2610Outcomes/information gathered from the external review (e.g., summary of key findings) \u2610How the information gathered was used to inform the guideline development process and/or formation of the recommendations (e.g., guideline panel considered results of review in forming final recommendations) NR","Previous studies have showed that temperature is also an important factor in the survival and transmission of other coronaviruses, like SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Bi et al., 2007; Casanova et al., 2010; Chan et al., 2011; Tan et al., 2005; Van Doremalen et al., 2013) , so we compared our main Journal Pre-proof J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f findings with results in these studies. Tan et al. (2005) found that the optimum environmental temperature related to SARS cases was from 16 \u00b0C to 28 \u00b0C based on data from Hong Kong, Guangzhou, Beijing, and Taiyuan. Moreover, Bi et al. (2007) reported that temperature had a negative relationship with SARS transmission in Hong Kong and Beijing in 2003. A laboratory study using surrogate viruses to investigate the effect of temperature on coronavirus survival on surfaces showed that viruses were inactivated more rapidly at 20\u00b0C than at 4\u00b0C (Casanova et al., 2010) . Another laboratory study found that coronavirus on smooth surfaces was stable for over 5 days when temperature at 22 \u00b0C-25 \u00b0C, and virus viability was rapidly lost at higher temperatures (e.g., 38 \u00b0C) (Chan et al., 2011) . Van Doremalen et al. (2013) also observed that MERS-CoV was less stable at high temperature. In brief, most studies showed that there was an optimum temperature for coronavirus and high temperature was harmful to its viability. However, this paper could not observe a negative effect of high temperature on COVID-19 infection. A possible reason may be that the study period was limited in winter, with maximal mean temperature 26.9 \u00b0C. Further laboratory studies also need to be conducted to determine the underlying mechanism.","\u2610Purpose and intent of the external review (e.g., to improve quality, gather feedback on draft recommendations, assess applicability and feasibility, disseminate evidence) \u2610Methods taken to undertake the external review (e.g., rating scale, open-ended questions) \u2610Description of the external reviewers (e.g., number, type of reviewers, affiliations) \u2610Outcomes/information gathered from the external review (e.g., summary of key findings) \u2610How the information gathered was used to inform the guideline development process and/or formation of the recommendations (e.g., guideline panel considered results of \u2610Types of facilitators and barriers that were considered \u2610Methods by which information regarding the facilitators and barriers to implementing recommendations were sought (e.g., feedback from key stakeholders, pilot testing of guidelines before widespread implementation) \u2610Information/description of the types of facilitators and barriers that emerged from the inquiry (e.g., practitioners have the skills to deliver the recommended care, sufficient equipment is not available to ensure all eligible members of the population receive mammography) \u2610How the information influenced the guideline development process and/or formation of the recommendations NR 19.

The A2a1 and A2a2 haplotypes which had collectively made up 103 out of 157 haplotypes (65.6%) in the early targeted testing were reduced to 44 of 144 haplotypes (30.6%) in the late targeted testing, mostly because of the increased frequency of the A1a and A2a haplotypes, the two most common haplotypes in the population screening. This is probably because the population screening identified clusters of infected individuals who seeded from areas that had not been designated as high-risk e.g. the UK. The later targeted testing was then more likely to find new individuals from these clusters, both because the targeted testing was extended to include more high-risk areas and because the population screening had identified cases that could be used to inform further contact tracking efforts.","National Institutes of Health (www.nih.gov) to JDD [AI064307] and to RSB [AI075297]; National Science Foundation (www.nsf.gov) to MH (MCB 0845512).
