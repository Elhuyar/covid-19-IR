We reviewed the characteristics of interventional trials from Chinese Clinical Trial Registration (ChiCTR) and ClinicalTrials.gov. A total of 171 COVID-19-related interventional trials were identified on Feb 22nd, 2020. These trials are classified into 4 categories based on treatment modalities, including chemical drugs, biological therapies, traditional Chinese medicine treatments and other therapies. Our analysis focused on the issues of stage, design, randomization, blinding, primary endpoints definition and sample size of these trials. We found some studies with potential defects including unreasonable design, inappropriate primary endpoint definition, insufficient sample size and ethical issue. Clinical trials on COVID-19 should be designed based on scientific rules, ethics and benefits for patients.","Surveillance is essential for communicable disease prevention and control. Traditional notification of demographic and clinical information, about individuals with selected (notifiable) infectious diseases, allows appropriate public health action and is protected by public health and privacy legislation, but is slow and insensitive. Big data\u2013based electronic surveillance, by commercial bodies and government agencies (for profit or population control), which draws on a plethora of internet- and mobile device\u2013based sources, has been widely accepted, if not universally welcomed. Similar anonymous digital sources also contain syndromic information, which can be analysed, using customised algorithms, to rapidly predict infectious disease outbreaks, but the data are nonspecific and predictions sometimes misleading. However, public health authorities could use these online sources, in combination with de-identified personal health data, to provide more accurate and earlier warning of infectio...","Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is now a global public health threat with many medical, ethical, social, economic, political, and legal implications. The nonspecific signs and symptoms of this disease, coupled with a relatively long incubation period and the initial absence of a reliable diagnostic test, limited the understanding of the magnitude of the outbreak. This paper outlines our experience with public health issues that have arisen during this outbreak of SARS in Hong Kong. We confirmed that case detection, reporting, clear and timely dissemination of information, and strict infection control measures are essential in handling such an infectious disease outbreak. The need for an outbreak response unit is crucial to combat any future outbreak.","Background Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is a novel coronavirus that causes a severe respiratory disease with high case fatality rate. Starting in March 2014, a dramatic increase of cases has occurred in the Arabian Peninsula, many of which were acquired in health care settings. As of May 9, 2014, 536 laboratory-confirmed cases and 145 deaths have been reported globally. Methods Review of publicly available data about MERS-CoV health care\u2013associated transmission. Results We identified 11 events of possible or confirmed health care\u2013associated transmission with high morbidity and mortality, mainly among patients with comorbidities. Health care workers are also frequently affected; however, they tend to have milder symptoms and better prognosis. Gaps in infection control were noted in all events. Currently, health care\u2013associated outbreaks are playing a pivotal role in the evolution of the MERS-CoV epidemic in countries in the Arabian Peninsula. Conclusion There ...","Two months after the emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the possibility of established and widespread community transmission in the European Union and European Economic Area (EU/EEA) is becoming more likely. We provide scenarios for use in preparedness for a possible widespread epidemic. The EU/EEA is moving towards the \u2018limited sustained transmission\u2019 phase. We propose actions to prepare for potential mitigation phases and coordinate efforts to protect the health of citizens.","OBJECTIVES: This study examines perceptions of the operational and organisational management of a major outbreak of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) caused by a novel coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA). Perspectives were sought from key decision-makers and clinical staff about the factors perceived to promote and inhibit effective and rapid control of the outbreak. SETTING: A large teaching tertiary healthcare centre in KSA; the outbreak lasted 6 weeks from June 2015. PARTICIPANTS: Data were collected via individual and focus group interviews with 28 key informant participants (9 management decision-makers and 19 frontline healthcare workers). DESIGN: We used qualitative methods of process evaluation to examine perceptions of the outbreak and the factors contributing to, or detracting from successful management. Data were analysed using qualitative thematic content analysis. RESULTS: Five themes and 15 subthemes were found. The themes were related to: (1...","AbstractThe outbreak of Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is highly infectious and transmitted mainly through human-to-human transmission via respiratory droplets and direct or close contact to the patients with SARS-CoV-2. The other potential transmission routes remain to be further researched. In some clinical cases, samples of tears and conjunctival secretions from both SARS-CoV[1] and SARS-CoV-2 patients with conjunctivitis[2] displayed detectable viral RNA. A previous study reported the case of a clinician who was infected with SARS-CoV-2 while working with patients under all safeguards except eye protection [2]. By contrast, no SARS-CoV-2 could be detected by RT-PCR in 114 conjunctival swabs samples from patients with COVID-19 pneumonia [4]. Anatomically, the linkage of the ocular with respiratory tissues is primarily by the nasolacrimal system [5]. The potential extra-respiratory transmissible routes of SARS-CoV-2 via ocular remained unclear. Whether ocular conjunctiva is one...","The complete genome of a novel coronavirus was sequenced directly from the cloacal swab of a Canada goose that perished in a die-off of Canada and Snow geese in Cambridge Bay, Nunavut, Canada. Comparative genomics and phylogenetic analysis indicate it is a new species of Gammacoronavirus, as it falls below the threshold of 90% amino acid similarity in the protein domains used to demarcate Coronaviridae. Additional features that distinguish the genome of Canada goose coronavirus include 6 novel ORFs, a partial duplication of the 4 gene and a presumptive change in the proteolytic processing of polyproteins 1a and 1ab.","","Mobile phone apps implementing algorithmic contact tracing can speed up the process of tracing newly diagnosed individuals, spreading information instantaneously back through a past contact network to inform them that they are at risk of being infected, and thus allow them to take appropriate social distancing and testing measures. The aim of non-pharmaceutical infection prevention is to move a population towards herd protection, a state where a population maintains R\u200b0&lt;\u200b1, thus making it impossible for a pathogen to cause an epidemic. Here, we address epidemiological issues that affect the feasibility of an algorithmic approach to instantaneous contact tracing; ethical and implementation issues are addressed separately. First we quantify the parameters of COVID-19 in a framework that is consistent with the renewal equation formulation of epidemic spread. Second, we use an analytical solution to application of first-degree contact tracing in the renewal equation model to explore combin...","Abstract The worldwide outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) raises concerns of widespread panic and anxiety in individuals subjected to the real or perceived threat of the virus. Compared to general populations, patients who are institutionalized in a closed unit are also very vulnerable to COVID-19 infection and complications. This crisis touched on difficult issues of not only psychiatric care and ethics, but also psychological impacts to psychiatric care givers. In this Viewpoint, we address both physical and biopsychosocial aspects of this infection, as well as the psychoneuroimmunity of preventive strategies of healthy lifestyle, regular exercise, balanced nutrition, quality sleep and a strong connection with people. Social distancing and wearing masks might help us from pathogen exposure, yet such these measures also prevent us from expressing compassion and friendliness. Therefore, all forms of psychological support should be routinely implemented not only to consider...","","Accreditation is an internationally recognised process through which healthcare organisations are able to improve the safety and quality of services delivered to patients. The focus of accreditation is to help organisations understand what they are doing well and what opportunities are available for improvement. The Canadian approach to accreditation is a rigorous peer review process comprised of a self-assessment against a set of standards, an on-site survey and follow-up action on recommendations that arise from the survey. The accreditation standards can be used effectively to guide the surgical teams in the transformation of the specialty. The 17 standards that are used to evaluate surgical teams relate to the activities that represent the continuum of clinical care as well as aspects related to learning. Within the subsections and standards are opportunities for surgeons and surgical teams to use the standards to effectively deliver services and to continuously improve patient car...","Abstract The term biological warfare typically conjures images of medieval warriors tossing dead cattle over city walls or clandestine government agents secretly releasing mysterious microbes into enemy territory. Of course, biological warfare does encompass such activity, but the vast majority of what constitutes biological warfare is far more mundane. Ever since life evolved on earth about 3.8 billion years ago, organisms have constantly devised new ways to kill each other. Any organism that makes use of toxins\u2014from bacteria to snakes\u2014is engaging in a form of biological warfare. Humans who engage in biological warfare do so by taking advantage of these toxin-producing organisms.","This article has been retracted: please see Elsevier Policy on Article Withdrawal (http://www.elsevier.com/locate/withdrawalpolicy).

Should a scenario arise where this coronavirus spreads more broadly across China, we evaluate how patterns of international disease transmission could change.","The rapid spread of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) presents China with a critical challenge. As normal capacity of the Chinese hospitals is exceeded, healthcare professionals struggling to manage this unprecedented crisis face the difficult question of how best to coordinate the medical resources used in highly separated locations. Responding rapidly to this crisis, the National Telemedicine Center of China (NTCC), located in Zhengzhou, Henan Province, has established the Emergency Telemedicine Consultation System (ETCS), a telemedicine-enabled outbreak alert and response network. ETCS is built upon a doctor-to-doctor (D2D) approach, in which health services can be accessed remotely through terminals across hospitals. The system architecture of ETCS comprises three major architectural layers: (1) telemedicine service platform layer, (2) telemedicine cloud layer, and (3) telemedicine service application layer. Our ETCS has demonstrated substantial benefits in terms of the effective...","","AbstractAngiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) has been suggested to be the cellular receptor for the new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) that is causing the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Like other coronaviruses such as the SARS-CoV, the 2019-nCoV uses the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the surface spike glycoprotein (S protein) to engage ACE2. We most recently determined the structure of the full-length human ACE2 in complex with a neutral amino acid transporter B0AT1. Here we report the cryo-EM structure of the full-length human ACE2 bound to the RBD of the 2019-nCoV at an overall resolution of 2.9 \u00c5 in the presence of B0AT1. The local resolution at the ACE2-RBD interface is 3.5 \u00c5, allowing analysis of the detailed interactions between the RBD and the receptor. Similar to that for the SARS-CoV, the RBD of the 2019-nCoV is recognized by the extracellular peptidase domain (PD) of ACE2 mainly through polar residues. Pairwise comparison reveals a number of variations that may determine...","Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a new infectious disease caused by a novel coronavirus that leads to deleterious pulmonary pathological features. Due to its high morbidity and mortality and widespread occurrence, SARS has evolved as an important respiratory disease which may be encountered everywhere in the world. The virus was identified as the causative agent of SARS due to the efforts of a WHO-led laboratory network. The potential mutability of the SARS-CoV genome may lead to new SARS outbreaks and several regions of the viral genomes open reading frames have been identified which may contribute to the severe virulence of the virus. With regard to the pathogenesis of SARS, several mechanisms involving both direct effects on target cells and indirect effects via the immune system may exist. Vaccination would offer the most attractive approach to prevent new epidemics of SARS, but the development of vaccines is difficult due to missing data on the role of immune system-vir...","The pathogenic Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-1) and COVID-19 coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) have all emerged into the human population with devastating consequences. These viruses make use of a large envelope protein called spike (S) to engage host cell receptors and catalyze membrane fusion. Because of the vital role that these S proteins play, they represent a vulnerable target for the development of therapeutics to combat these highly pathogenic coronaviruses. Here, we describe the isolation and characterization of single-domain antibodies (VHHs) from a llama immunized with prefusion-stabilized coronavirus spikes. These VHHs are capable of potently neutralizing MERS-CoV or SARS-CoV-1 S pseudotyped viruses. The crystal structures of these VHHs bound to their respective viral targets reveal two distinct epitopes, but both VHHs block receptor binding. We also show cross-reactivity between the SARS-CoV-1 S-dire...","Dromedary, or one-humped, camels Camelus dromedarius are an almost exclusively domesticated species that are common in arid areas as both beasts of burden and production animals for meat and milk. Currently, there are approximately 30 million dromedary camels, with highest numbers in Africa and the Middle East. The hardiness of camels in arid regions has made humans more dependent on them, especially as a stable protein source. Camels also carry and may transmit disease-causing agents to humans and other animals. The ability for camels to act as a point source or vector for disease is a concern due to increasing human demands for meat, lack of biosafety and biosecurity protocols in many regions, and a growth in the interface with wildlife as camel herds become sympatric with non-domestic species. We conducted a literature review of camel-borne zoonotic diseases and found that the majority of publications (65%) focused on Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), brucellosis, Echinococcu...","A SARS-CoV lacking the full-length E gene (SARS-CoV-\u2206E) was attenuated and an effective vaccine. Here, we show that this mutant virus regained fitness after serial passages in cell culture or in vivo, resulting in the partial duplication of the membrane gene or in the insertion of a new sequence in gene 8a, respectively. The chimeric proteins generated in cell culture increased virus fitness in vitro but remained attenuated in mice. In contrast, during SARS-CoV-\u2206E passage in mice, the virus incorporated a mutated variant of 8a protein, resulting in reversion to a virulent phenotype. When the full-length E protein was deleted or its PDZ-binding motif (PBM) was mutated, the revertant viruses either incorporated a novel chimeric protein with a PBM or restored the sequence of the PBM on the E protein, respectively. Similarly, after passage in mice, SARS-CoV-\u2206E protein 8a mutated, to now encode a PBM, and also regained virulence. These data indicated that the virus requires a PBM on a trans...","Abstract Influenza pandemics generally occur at 30-40 year intervals and it has been nearly 40 years since the last one. A global pandemic will result in devastating social, economical, and health consequences. Preparedness is crucial to minimize the threat to hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) patients. Vaccines, antivirals, and infection control measures are important elements of prevention. Antivirals, often given presumptively, are the mainstay of therapy.","Abstract Background: Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is an emerging infection caused by a novel coronavirus known as SARS-CoV, characterized by an over-exuberant immune response with lung lymphomononuclear cells infiltration and proliferation that may account for tissue damage more than the direct effect of viral replication. This study is aimed at investigating the capability of SARS-CoV to activate IFN-\u03b1 and -\u03b3 expression in lymphomonocytes (PBMC) from healthy donors, evaluating whether viral replication is necessary for this activation. Results: SARS-CoV virus is able to induce both IFN-\u03b1 and -\u03b3 mRNA accumulation and protein release in a dose-dependent manner, MOI 10 being the most effective. The time course curve indicated that IFN-\u03b1 mRNA induction peaked at 24 h.p.i,. whereas IFN-\u03b3 mRNA was still increasing at 48 h.p.i. Released IFN (both types) reached a plateau after 24\u201348 h.p.i. and remained rather stable over a 5-day period. A transient peak of negative strand viral R...","Pathogenicity is the capacity of an organism to cause disease. During virus infections, diseases symptoms arise from two causes, direct injury caused by virus replication and the side effects of the immune response to infection. The balance between these two is variable. The majority of virus infections are asymptomatic and do not cause disease. Only a tiny number of infections cause serious or life-threatening consequences such as immunodeficiency, or tumors. Diseases caused by previously unknown viruses continue to be regularly identified. Occasionally, known viruses appear to change their behavior, suddenly causing outbreaks of diseases. Such viruses are known as emerging viruses and frequently the cause of a new disease is when a virus switches host species and begins to infect another, and changes in human activities also result in the emergence of new or previously unrecognized diseases.","Coronaviruses (CoVs) are widespread among mammals and birds and known for their potential for cross-species transmission. In cats, infections with feline coronaviruses (FCoVs) are common. Several non-feline coronaviruses have been reported to infect feline cells as well as cats after experimental infection, supported by their ability to engage the feline receptor ortholog for cell entry. However, whether cats might become naturally infected with CoVs of other species is unknown. We analyzed coronavirus infections in cats by serological monitoring. In total 137 cat serum samples and 25 FCoV type 1 or type 2-specific antisera were screened for the presence of antibodies against the S1 receptor binding subunit of the CoV spike protein, which is immunogenic and possesses low amino acid sequence identity among coronavirus species. Seventy-eight sera were positive for antibodies that recognized one or more coronavirus S1s whereas 1 serum exclusively reacted with human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-...","Summary Starting from Wuhan, China, SARS-CoV-2 has been a catastrophic epidemic involving many countries worldwide. After China, Italy has been heavily affected and severe measures to limit the spread have been taken in the last weeks. Radiation Oncology departments must guarantee optimal cancer treatments even in such a challenging scenario of an ongoing aggressive epidemic. Adopted preventive measures and recommendations are highlighted for patients, professionals and clinical operations to minimize the risk of infection while safely treating cancer patients.","If COVID-19 containment policies fail and social distancing measures cannot be sustained until vaccines becomes available, the next best approach is to use interventions that reduce mortality and prevent excess infections while allowing low-risk individuals to acquire immunity through natural infection until population level immunity is achieved. In such a situation, allowing some infections to occur in lower-risk groups might lead to an overall greater reduction in mortality than trying to protect everyone equally.","Novel coronavirus infection special intensive care team We set up a special emergency multi-disciplinary intensive care team to discuss the problems that we might encounter and countermeasures. Team members include intensive care unit (ICU) physician, infectious disease physician, nurse, respiratory therapist, nosocomial infection control expert, and administrative staff. We first evaluated the isolation conditions and the capacity of our department to admit a larger number of patients. Second, we specified the protection levels for different types of health care activities. Third, we assigned special work such as patient screening, consultation, and transfer to designated staff to minimize the number of health workers who had contact with patients with nCoV infection.ID - LiaoER -","Emerging infections, many zoonotic, are caused by a variety of pathogens with global distribution. Previously rare pathogens have emerged; global travel facilitates their rapid spread. Human encroachment on remote areas has brought contact with zoonotic diseases never before characterized. Although systematic study of rare outbreaks can be challenging, knowledge of emerging pathogens and their effects on women is accumulating. This article discusses effects of lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus, West Nile virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, avian influenza A virus, viral hemorrhagic fevers, spirochetal illnesses, and Chagas' disease. The potential impact of candidate bioterror agents and issues of prophylaxis and therapy are discussed.","Abstract Certification programs have been developed to provide plant material that meets a predetermined level of plant health. The primary objectives of these programs are to limit pathogen incidence in plant material in order to minimize losses by growers and prevent movement of harmful pests and pathogens that may harm the environment. For many fruit and nut crops, orchards are expected to remain productive for years or decades; thus, starting with plants of high health status is essential. The components of certification programs in terms of plant health will be outlined, along with the benefits of harmonizing these programs where possible to facilitate plant movement without increasing trade in plant pathogens.","RNA viruses are known to replicate by low fidelity polymerases and have high mutation rates whereby the resulting virus population tends to exist as a distribution of mutants. In this review, we aim to explore how genetic events such as spontaneous mutations could alter the genomic organization of RNA viruses in such a way that they impact virus replications and plaque morphology. The phenomenon of quasispecies within a viral population is also discussed to reflect virulence and its implications for RNA viruses. An understanding of how such events occur will provide further evidence about whether there are molecular determinants for plaque morphology of RNA viruses or whether different plaque phenotypes arise due to the presence of quasispecies within a population. Ultimately this review gives an insight into whether the intrinsically high error rates due to the low fidelity of RNA polymerases is responsible for the variation in plaque morphology and diversity in virulence. This can be...","Abstract Emerging life threatening pathogens such as severe acute aspiratory syndrome-coronavirus (SARS-CoV), avian-origin influenzas H7N9, and the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) have caused a high case-fatality rate and psychological effects on society and the economy. Therefore, a simple, rapid, and safe method to investigate a therapeutic approach against these pathogens is required. In this study, a simple, quick, and safe cell adhesion inhibition assay was developed to determine the potential cellular binding site on the SARS-CoV spike protein. Various synthetic peptides covering the potential binding site helped to minimize further the binding motif to 10\u201325 residues. Following analyses, 2 peptides spanning the 436\u2013445 and 437\u2013461 amino acids of the spike protein were identified as peptide inhibitor or peptide vaccine candidates against SARS-CoV.","The goal of contact tracing is to reduce the likelihood of transmission, particularly to individuals who are at greatest risk for developing complications of infection, as well as identifying individuals who are in need of medical treatment of other interventions. In this paper, we develop a simple mathematical model of contact investigations among a small group of individuals and apply game theory to explore conflicts of interest that may arise in the context of perceived costs of disclosure. Using analytic Kolmogorov equations, we determine whether or not it is possible for individual incentives to drive noncooperation, even though cooperation would yield a better group outcome. We found that if all individuals have a cost of disclosure, then the optimal individual decision is to simply not disclose each other. With further analysis of (1) completely offsetting the costs of disclosure and (2) partially offsetting the costs of disclosure, we found that all individuals disclose all con...","AbstractThe outbreak of 2019-nCoV pneumonia (COVID-19) in the city of Wuhan, China has resulted in more than 70,000 laboratory confirmed cases, and recent studies showed that 2019-nCoV (SARS-CoV-2) could be of bat origin but involve other potential intermediate hosts. In this study, we assembled the genomes of coronaviruses identified in sick pangolins. The molecular and phylogenetic analyses showed that pangolin Coronaviruses (pangolin-CoV) are genetically related to both the 2019-nCoV and bat Coronaviruses but do not support the 2019-nCoV arose directly from the pangolin-CoV. Our study also suggested that pangolin be natural host of Betacoronavirus, with a potential to infect humans. Large surveillance of coronaviruses in pangolins could improve our understanding of the spectrum of coronaviruses in pangolins. Conservation of wildlife and limits of the exposures of humans to wildlife will be important to minimize the spillover risks of coronaviruses from wild animals to humans.","Since Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) first emerged, the California Department of Public Health has coordinated efforts to identify possible cases in travelers to California, USA, from affected areas. During 2013\u20132014, the department investigated 54 travelers for MERS-CoV; none tested positive, but 32 (62%) of 52 travelers with suspected MERS-CoV had other respiratory viruses.","Abstract The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a pandemic with the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The infection has predominantly respiratory transmission and is transmitted through large droplets or aerosols, and less commonly by contact with infected surfaces or fomites. The alarming spread of the infection and the severe clinical disease that it may cause, have led to the widespread institution of social distancing measures. Due to repeated exposure to potentially infectious patients and specimens, healthcare and laboratory personnel are particularly susceptible to contract COVID-19. This review paper provides an assessment of the current state of knowledge about the disease and its pathology, and the potential presence of the virus in cytology specimens. It also discusses the measures that cytology laboratories can take to function during the pandemic, and minimize the risk to their personnel, trainees and pathologists. In addition, it explores potential means to continue to educate traine...","Although, to our knowledge, there has been no exhaustive or credible review of the evidence of the disease burden of COPD in China, COPD has become an increasing public health concern to the Chinese medical community. The purpose of this article is to review the evidence and evaluate and clarify the disease burden of COPD in China with the aim of improving effective management. We reviewed previous studies of COPD in China, which included data on prevalence, mortality, disease burden, risk factors, diagnosis, and management by searching related Web sites, including PubMed, ProQuest, and Thomson Reuters' Web of Knowledge, as well as major Chinese databases and government Web sites. Reported COPD prevalence varied between 5% and 13% in different provinces/cities across China. In 2008, COPD ranked fourth as a leading cause of death in urban areas and third in rural areas. In addition, COPD accounted for 1.6% of all hospital admissions in China in that year. The high prevalence of smoking ...","Abstract Background and Aims Multiple issues in management of COVID have emerged, but confusion persists regarding rational interpretation. Aim of this brief review is to review these issues based on current literature. Methods This is a narrative review with Pubmed and Google Scholar search till 23 March 2020. Search terms were, COVID-19, treatment of coronavirus, COVID 19 and following terms; chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, ibuprofen, ACE-inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers, cardiovascular disease, diarrhoea, liver, testis and gastrointestinal disease. Results We discuss evidence regarding role of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine in treatment and prophylaxis, use of inhibitors of the renin angiotensin system, safety of ibuprofen, unusual clinical features like gastrointestinal symptoms and interpretation of tests for cardiac enzymes and biomarkers. Conclusions While our conclusions on management of COVID-19 patients with co-morbidities are based on current evidence, howeve...","A zoonotic coronavirus, labeled as 2019-nCoV by The World Health Organization (WHO), has been identified as the causative agent of the viral pneumonia outbreak in Wuhan, China, at the end of 2019. Although 2019-nCoV can cause a severe respiratory illness like SARS and MERS, evidence from clinics suggested that 2019-nCoV is generally less pathogenic than SARS-CoV, and much less than MERS-CoV. The transmissibility of 2019-nCoV is still debated and needs to be further assessed. To avoid the 2019-nCoV outbreak turning into an epidemic or even a pandemic and to minimize the mortality rate, China activated emergency response procedures, but much remains to be learned about the features of the virus to refine the risk assessment and response. Here, the current knowledge in 2019-nCoV pathogenicity and transmissibility is summarized in comparison with several commonly known emerging viruses, and information urgently needed for a better control of the disease is highlighted.","The two largest Brazilian cities, Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo, have declared community transmission of COVID-19 on mid March, 2020. In this study we estimated the most vulnerable areas in Brazil for COVID-19, both in terms of risk of introduction and risk of mortality associated with social vulnerability. We explore the most likely routes of spread through the country, from the already exposed cities, according to human mobility statistics. The resulting maps should help authorities in their efforts to prioritize actions and if resource allocation to mitigate the effects of the pandemic.","From geographic mapping at different scales to location-based alerting services, geoinformatics plays an important role in the study and control of global outbreaks like severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). This paper reviews several geographic mapping efforts of SARS on the Internet that employ a variety of techniques like choropleth rendering, graduated circles, graduated pie charts, buffering, overlay analysis and animation. The aim of these mapping services is to educate the public (especially travellers to potentially at-risk areas) and assist public health authorities in analysing the spatial and temporal trends and patterns of SARS and in assessing/revising current control measures.","Abstract Colombia confirmed its first case of the COVID-19 on March 6th, 2020. On March 16th, 2020, 54 cases have been confirmed (36 imported and 18 associated), therefore, Colombia is at highest alert, and it is now trying to avoid or minimize the last stage of \u201ccommunity transmission\u201d. We present a route proposal that shows how the community pharmacist may develop his responsibility to contribute to the early detection and appropriate referral of possible cases of the COVID-19. In the route have been considered three possible entrances depending on the needs of the users: anti-flu drugs, symptoms related to COVID-19 infection or the request for items for hygiene and prevention of transmission such as alcohol and face masks. Later, self-care education should be given, and the possible cases should be reported to the telephone lines designated by the mayor or the governor, continuing the healthcare process. Community pharmacies and pharmacy staff play a crucial role in minimizing the s...","","","Background and Objective: To predict the epidemic of COVID-19 based on quarantined surveillance from real world in China by modified SEIR model different from the previous simply mathematical model. Design and Methods: We forecasted the epidemic of COVID-19 based on current clinical and epidemiological data and built a modified SEIR model to consider both the infectivity during incubation period and the influence on the epidemic from strict quarantined measures. Results: The peak time of the curve for the infected newly diagnosed as COVID-19 should substantially present on Feb.5,2020(in non-Hubei areas) and Feb.19,2020(in Hubei. It is estimated that the peak of the curve of the cumulative confirmed cases will appear in non-Hubei areas on Mar.3,2020 and in Hubei province on Mar.10,2020,and the total number of the patients diagnosed as COVID-19 is 18,000 in non-Hubei areas and 78,000-96,000 in Hubei.The Chinese COVID-19 epidemic can be completely controlled in May,2020. Conclusions: COVI...","We present here several variants of a mathematical model to explore three main issues related to SARS-CoV-2 spread in scenarios similar to those present in Mexico and elsewhere in Latin America. We explore the consequences for travel inside a given region, in this case Mexico, particularly focusing on airplane transportation but attempting to give a gross approximation to terrestrial movement since this is the main form of population movement across geographical areas in the country; then we proceed to study the effect of behavioral changes required to lower transmission by lowering the contact rate and infection probability and lastly, we explore the consequences of disease spread in a population subject to social isolation.These models are not suitable for predictive purposes although some rough predictions can be extracted from them. They are presented as a tool that can serve to explore plausible scenarios of spread and impact, effectiveness and consequences of contention and mitig...","","ABSTRACT The pathological changes in chronic bronchitis (CB) produce airflow obstruction, reduce the effectiveness of the mucocilliary drainage system and lead to bacterial colonisation of bronchial secretion. The presence of bacteria induces an inflammatory response mediated by leukocytes. There is a direct relationship between the degree of impairment of the mucocilliary drainage system, the density of bacteria in mucus and the number of leukocytes in the sputum. Purulent sputum is a good marker of a high bacterial load. Eventually, if the number of leukocytes is high, their normal activity could decrease the effectiveness of the drainage system, increase the bronchial obstruction and probably damage the lung parenchyma. Whenever the density of bacteria in the bronchial lumen is \u2265 106 CFU/mL, there is a high probability that the degree of inflammatory response will lead to a vicious cycle which in turn tends to sustain the process. This situation can arise during the clinical course ..."],"title":["Appealing for Efficient, Well Organized Clinical Trials on COVID-19","Communicable Disease Surveillance Ethics in the Age of Big Data and New Technology","Lessons from the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Outbreak in Hong Kong","Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus: Implications for health care facilities","Potential scenarios for the progression of a COVID-19 epidemic in the European Union and the European Economic Area, March 2020","Perceptions of postoutbreak management by management and healthcare workers of a Middle East respiratory syndrome outbreak in a tertiary care hospital: a qualitative study","Rhesus macaques can be effectively infected with SARS-CoV-2 via ocular conjunctival route","Genome Organization of Canada Goose Coronavirus, A Novel Species Identified in a Mass Die-off of Canada Geese","Scientific and ethical basis for social-distancing interventions against COVID-19","Quantifying dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 transmission suggests that epidemic control and avoidance is feasible through instantaneous digital contact tracing","Using psychoneuroimmunity against COVID-19","A Commentary on \u201cA new item in Italian law: Revenge malpractice.

The lack of a gold standard in training makes the design of a critical care curriculum in resource-limited settings much more complicated. Many countries have implemented local training programs with guidance from local experts; however, most of these programs lack oversight from a larger governing body or society, such as the American Board of Pediatrics, the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada, or the Joint Faculty of Intensive Care Medicine of Australia and New Zealand. This leads not only to discrepancies in the provision of care but also to duplication of efforts in regions already struggling with scarce resources.","Once the patient is safely administered ECMO, it is important to ensure that an ultra-protective mechanical ventilation strategy is used. 11, 35, 36 There is no consensus on the most appropriate ventilatory strategy for ECMO.

It is essential to understand the emerging scientific knowledge to coordinate COVID-19 research globally. Recently, the WHO has published a Global Research Roadmap with immediate, mid-term and longer-term priorities to enable the implementation of priority research [8] . Bonilla-Aldana DK et al. [9] and Md Mahbub Hossain MBBS [10] have performed bibliometric analysis to evaluate the scientific literature on coronavirus infection and COVID-19, basing on indicators such as the number of articles, the productivity of authors, geographic distribution of articles and prominent keywords. However, to the best of our knowledge, there is still no quantitative thematic analysis available to date that focuses on CoVs.","CBER reviewers have regular internal meetings to discuss relevant scientific issues and develop consistency in oversight of cell therapy products. Staff within the FDA's OCTGT also participate in many outreach activities such as regulatory and scientific meetings in which interested parties can interact and communicate with the people who regulate the cell therapy arena. These interactions enrich both FDA staff and members of the regulated community by providing gains in mutual understanding and appreciation of perspectives, outside of formal regulatory interactions. Within the OCTGT, a number of review scientists also maintain active research programs in cell or developmental biology or other areas relevant to stem cells and other products regulated by the FDA. This approach, deemed the research-reviewer model, is a major factor allowing the FDA to maintain state-of-the-art expertise and scientific credibility during the complex task of regulating stem cells and developing policy that affects the entire field of stem cell therapeutic use. Figure 73 -1 illustrates three crucial cellular signaling pathways that are active research areas within CBER's Division of Cellular and Gene Therapies. The Notch-Delta pathway, the BMP pathway, and the Wnt pathway each influence cell fate specification within a variety of medically significant cellular lineages.","Against the backdrop of still-worsening COVID-19 impacts, this paper discusses resilience building for pandemics and related biological hazards. We examine ongoing efforts to respond to COVID-19 and these efforts' implications for the Sendai Framework. Our analysis reveals specific areas of rapid response to COVID-19. But we find lamentably few actions by DRRrelated organisations, in spite of the SFDRR's call for building resilience to biological hazards. Moreover, the current WHO-led coordinated response reveals little implementation of the WHO Thematic Platform for Health-EDRM adopted in 2019. Existing mechanisms and strategies for disaster resilience, such as those detailed in the SFDRR, offer concrete means to respond effectively to epidemics and even global pandemics such as COVID- 19 . We thus put forward general and DRR-specific recommendations for short and long-term resilience.","There is no direct involvement of human subjects in this study. All the data use existing deidentified biological samples and data from prior studies. Therefore, ethical oversight and patient consent were not handled in this project. Figure   Figure 1 . ACE2 gene expression profiles in groups.","Implementation of these principles into decisional algorithms should, we believe, be part of pandemic preparation everywhere. In settings where rationing of resources becomes a necessity and such preparation has not been made, medical staff or oversight organizations should implement ad hoc guidelines that incorporate key prognostic factors beyond age -most notably frailty, comorbidity, and functional status. 4, 5 In this manner, a sentence about function and comorbidities in an ethics document underscores the need to operationalize the meaning of prognosis at advanced age, 6 and acknowledges the critical role that function and comorbidity play in the aging individual. 7 Clinicians familiar with principles of geriatrics and gerontology could thus support the development of more contemporary recommendations by identifying valid, efficient ways of measuring comorbidities and function across different settings and specialties. We might suggest the use of simple tests and scales, such as the Clinical Frailty Scale, 8 or the assessment of mobility independence, 9 that might optimally capture the pre-illness health status of the individual, mirroring his/her physiological reserve, and, by incorporating such tools into electronic records for rapid assessment, provide support for better clinical decisionmaking than the all-too-simplistic criterion of chronological age.","Ethical challenges. The unprecedented challenge represented by COVID-19 has brought novel and dramatic ethical dilemmas, ranging from policy issues (e.g. focusing on containment and mitigation vs. herd immunity), as well as clinical dilemmas (e.g. considering all patients alike vs triaging patients according to age, comorbidities and expected prognosis, similar to other catastrophic circumstances).","Despite the need for a revitalized WHO, reforms supported by WHO\u2019s own high-level Advisory Group on Reform of WHO\u2019s Work in Outbreaks and Emergencies (WHO Advisory Group, established by the WHO DG in July 2015), whose role was to provide guidance in relation to WHO\u2019s emergency reform process (including the recommendations issued by the various panels), did not recommend some of the major changes advocated by the panels [47]. Instead, at the January 2016 WHO Executive Board meeting (coinciding with WHO declaring that EVD was no longer a PHEIC) , the WHO Advisory Group recommended critical enhancements focused on WHO internal outbreak and health emergency management, but did not recommend larger structural governance changes. Specifically, the group recommended the widely supported establishment of a centrally-managed, separate, dedicated WHO global Programme for Outbreaks and Emergencies headed by an Executive Director having its own budget and workforce that reports to the WHO DG [36, 47]. WHO would leverage the formation of this internal mechanism to also engage in other reform measures including ensuring greater health stakeholder collaboration, establishing better operational/ business processes during outbreaks, calling for an increase in member state assessed contributions for emergencies, capitalizing a contingency fund for emergency response, and improving resource mobilization, political engagement, accountability and external oversight [36, 47].","Modern epidemiology\u2019s limited ability to thoroughly and systematically address global EID emergence is partly due to the fact that, after drug treatments and disease-vector controls were developed, many epidemiologists shifted their efforts from understanding epidemics of infectious diseases to studying individual risk factors for chronic diseases. Epidemiology\u2019s main focus became noncommunicable diseases such as obesity, asthma, vascular disease, cancer, substance abuse, and depression. Epidemiologists in the South were particularly critical of this paradigm, on the grounds that it did not explain large-scale influences affecting groups, and that its ethical and theoretical foundations were flawed (Breilh, 1995). In the North, f called for epidemiological research to engage with the \u201cweb of causation\u201d (Krieger, 2004). The debates and theories of the 1990s led to the establishment of ecoepidemiology (group level effects), life-course epidemiology (time sequences, socio-biology and intergenerational effects) and social epidemiology (social causation) (Evans et al., 1994; Commentaries, 1998; Ben-Shloma and Kuh, 2002).","Virology Journal is taking a leading role in facilitating the dissemination of new information in various emerging infectious diseases including coronaviruses. It is hoped that the present series will stimulate more research and collaborative efforts to control the ongoing and prevent future epidemics caused by coronaviruses. We are grateful to Linfa Wang, Ph.D., Editor in Chief of Virology Journal and Professor at Duke-National University of Singapore for his guidance during the preparation of this thematic series.","In November 2015, the Harvard-LSHTM panel published a set of 10 recommendations in the Lancet, which included several governance reform measures far more expansive than the first set of recommendations made by the Interim Panel. Reforms cover broader areas of global health governance and also include specific reform measures for WHO, all of which are grouped into four thematic areas of preventing, responding, conducting research, and governing the broader global system for disease outbreaks [39]. Reforms specific to WHO included: (a) creating a WHO dedicated independent centre for outbreak response; (b) formation of a politically insulated WHO Standing Emergency Committee for PHEIC declaration; (c) investing and strengthening global capacity to rapidly respond to outbreaks; (d) carrying out time-bound reforms to refocus and streamline WHO; (e) having WHO convene global stakeholders to develop a framework of norms and rules and a global financing facility for R&amp;D relevant to disease outbreaks; and (f) instituting internal good governance reforms in exchange for more sustainable funding [39]. Broadly speaking the Harvard-LSHTM panel calls for more active engagement by WHO with the greater global community in managing infectious disease outbreaks, while also recommending that the agency scale back operational activities and instead focus on certain core functions [39]. Importantly, the panel also took the step of recommending the establishment of two structures by the UN Security Council: an Accountability Commission and a Global Health Committee that would independently assess outbreak response and elevate political attention to international health threats [39].","Unprecedented situations, such as too few ECMO machines, might necessitate rationing of ECMO services and should involve predetermined consensus criteria formulated to empower clinicians during times of crisis while upholding distributive justice. Distributive justice is only invoked in circumstances in which rationing precludes the ability to care for each individual optimally. 56 Appropriate opinions from hospital ethics, social work, and medicolegal committees might be required in ethically challenging scenarios. 57, 58 Desirable elements Shared decision making with family members on aspects of ECMO initiation, continuation, and termination would be desirable. Surrogate decision makers consenting to ECMO do so at a time of high stress related to the disease severity. The involvement of social workers and ethics committee members might help to alleviate some of the ethical hurdles encountered during the management of a patient receiving ECMO in such highpressure settings. 57","At the time of writing, efforts are underway to coordinate compilation of COVID-19 data from online sources across several academic teams. Ultimately, we expect that a line list of patients will be shared by government sources with the global community; however, data cleaning and access issues might take a prohibitively long time to resolve. For the west African Ebola outbreak, a similarly coordinated effort to publish a line list took 2 years. 23 Given the progression of the COVID-19 outbreak, such a long delay would be counterproductive.","At the time of writing, efforts are underway to coordinate compilation of COVID-19 data from online sources across several academic teams.

Yung Kung Campus Chi-Mei Medical Center Background: Since 2009, the WHO has launched the \"Save Lives: Clean Your Hands\" campaign promoting the provision and use of alcoholic hand sanitizer in patient care areas to enhance accessibility of hand hygiene facilities and developed guidelines, including \"Five Moments for Hand Hygiene,\" aiming for minimal complexity of the process and time spent on hand hygiene to ensure maximum protection and embed hand hygiene into an integral practice. To promote hand hygiene in hospitals, the CDC of the Taiwan Ministry of Health and Welfare established hand hygiene model centers and implemented a hand hygiene accreditation program from 2010 to 2011, in an effort to improve hand hygiene behavior and practices among healthcare workers.","It is worth noting that 22.84% of the studies failed ethical verification.All human-oriented clinical trials must in any case follow the \"Helsinki Declaration\", which has become a consensus of the medical community, and follow the basic ethical principle of \"doctors should provide medical care in the best interests of patients\" to ensure the subjects [15, 16] .The ChiCTR Center has issued a warning and requested the supplementary information of the failed units to be reviewed.Medical ethics review should strictly abide by the review work content of the \"Ethical Review Methods for Biomedical Research Involving","Ethical approval for the study was obtained from the National Health Service-Research Ethics Committee (NHS-REC), reference number 11/NW/0698), the University of Manchester Research Ethics Office. Research and Development R&amp;D approval was obtained from the Central Manchester Universities Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust (reference number R01835) (Fig. 1)","This study was reviewed and approved by the ethics committee of the National Institute for Communicable Disease Control and Prevention of the Chinese CDC. All animals were treated strictly according to the guidelines for the Laboratory Animal Use and Care from the Chinese CDC and the Rules for the Implementation of Laboratory Animal Medicine (1998) from the Ministry of Health, China, under the protocols approved by the National Institute for Communicable Disease Control and Prevention. All surgery was performed under ether anesthesia, and all efforts were made to minimize suffering.","The Chinese government has carried out a special project for the prevention and control of major infectious diseases, whose aims are to reduce the incidence and mortality of AIDS, viral hepatitis, and tuberculosis, and to improve the emergency response and capabilities of infectious disease prevention and control. The project has also focused on the detection of infectious diseases and laboratory monitoring with standardized technology, providing technical support for emergency decisions related to infectious diseases. 87 Based on thematic studies, the laboratory network, common technology platform, academic union, demonstration areas, and the effective integration of superior forces, a multi-linked network technology system has been developed, and the prevention and control technology support system for infectious diseases has been established. 87 The project has improved the ability to deal with the traditional infectious diseases and has also contributed to the significantly enhanced emergency response abilities against emerging zoonotic diseases. For example, in response to the pandemic caused by a novel swine-origin influenza A (H1N1) virus in 2009, an effective and safe vaccine for various age groups was first developed in China, which played an important role in controlling the influenza epidemic. 88 Another major breakthrough in the field of global etiological research since the discovery of the SARS coronavirus, is the discovery in 2009 that a novel bunyavirus had been responsible for a life-threatening illness associated with fever and thrombocytopenia in China since 2007. 9","In the coming months, Virology Journal will publish a thematic series of reviews and original articles on emerging and re-emerging coronaviruses.","Despite our best preparations, it remains likely that in a pandemic scenario, the number of critically ill patients will overwhelm our critical care capacity. There is a need to develop triage protocols to prioritize access to limited resources, including mechanical ventilation [34] . Triage criteria should be based on clinical indicators of survivability, and resources allocated to those most likely to benefit. These are difficult decisions and cannot be left until times of crisis. Development of triage protocols should be done in advance, with careful consideration of ethical principles [35] . It is crucial to engage the community in this process so that public trust exists when it is most needed.","The early recognition of outbreaks is exceedingly important in the management of individual cases of diseases like legionellosis. The European Working Group for Legionella Infections (EWGLI) is a network created to report legionella cases diagnosed in patients who have been traveling within the likely incubation period of 2 weeks, together with geographic location of suspected source of transmission. Members of the group report cases of Legionnaires' disease to the coordinating center, which then notifies all EWGLI members of any disease cluster. Other international global and regional surveillance networks, including GeoSentinel and TropNetEurop, play a pivotal role in early detection and public warning of travel-related epidemics. 25, 26 The response to emerging influenza pandemics is an important task for public health interventions. International guidelines were established after the identification in Hong Kong of the first known human outbreak of infection by the influenza A (H5N1) virus, previously known to infect only birds. Massive efforts were put in place by international organizations for the identification and containment of the outbreak, including the slaughtering of 1.6 million chickens, the putative source of the infection. 27 Several measures can help minimize the global public health risks that could arise from large outbreaks of highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza in birds: (1) to halt further spread of epidemics in poultry populations; (2) to vaccinate persons at high risk of exposure to infected poultry, using existing vaccines effective against currently circulating human influenza strains; (3) to protect workers involved in the culling of poultry flocks by proper clothing and equipment; (4) To give antiviral drugs as a prophylactic measure to the same workers. The World Health Organization (WHO) does not recommend screening of travelers coming from H5N1-affected areas. WHO continues to recommend that travelers to affected areas should avoid contact with live animal markets and poultry farms, and any free-ranging or caged poultry.","Ethical approval: All data or studies related to human subjects or animal experimentation was from previously published data by other groups. Ethical issues would have been addressed at the time of publication.","While detailed instructions can be found in these aforementioned documents on how to coordinate efforts in outpatient hemodialysis facilities, it is instructive to categorize these efforts in 4 basic groups (Box 1).","Bats were captured, during the three years of surveillance (2013\u20132016) in the Northwestern Italian regions of Piedmont and Liguria, following ethical and safety recommendations [40]. Samplings were conducted from mid-June to October, a period that approximately corresponds to the pregnancy, lactation, dispersion and mating activity of European bats. To minimize animal disturbance, bats were caught soon after parturition with nylon mist-nets of mesh size of 16 to 19 mm positioned at 10\u201320 m from the reproductive and temporary roost along flight paths towards foraging and drinking areas. During autumn catches were focused particularly at swarming sites in caves where individuals from different colonies meet to mate [41]. All nets were checked every 10 min and captured bats were removed carefully from nets as soon as possible to minimize injury, drowning, strangulation, or stress and individually placed into disposable cloth bags awaiting species identification, collection of biometric data and biological samples.","Ethics Statement A statement within the manuscript indicating any ethical concerns, including the presence of sensitive data.","Subsequently, the patient to be transferred back to an isolated room as an inpatient. During treatment, the patient and involved staff will need to don appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE). These may include N95 respirators, surgical masks and gloves depending on institutional policy, available resources and procedural risks. Appropriate high dusting cleaning of the linac room is done on completion of treatment. (Table 1) 1. Be proactive in anticipating and planning for the impact of COVID-19 2. Engage and coordinate with the parent institution in formulating policies for identifying patients at risk or who are already infected and contextualizing these to the department during implementation 3. Reduce clinical load where possible in anticipation of depletion of resources. This may involve temporarily reducing frequency of follow-up appointments, reducing fractionation schedules where possible, and considering alternative treatment modalities apart from radiotherapy that achieves the same therapeutic goals. 4. Employ staff segregation either spatially or temporally to reduce risk of the entire service succumbing to infection or quarantine. Special attention needs to be paid to \"bottleneck\" personnel (e.g. physicists) where redundancy cannot be built in. 5. Prepare for the possibility of a COVID-19 patient requiring treatment. Plan in advance which indications warrant emergency radiotherapy treatment when proven infectious or merely suspected, what personal protective equipment is required, and how to decontaminate the facility after treatment.","Ethical approval: This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine (2020IIT A0001).","All patients provided written informed consent. All study procedures were performed in accordance with the ethical standards of the Institutional Ethics Review Committee.","However, this structure would also need to leverage the unique strengths of WHO, specifically allowing the embattled agency to focus on its indispensable role as the world\u2019s chief technical health agency by imbuing it as the Chair of the proposed structure and having the newly established WHO Health Emergencies Programme take a leading role when addressing issues related to health emergencies and outbreask with panademic potential [45]. Though some may view a UN-based structure as usurping WHO\u2019s credibility and leading to duplication, by positioning WHO as the chair of a UN Global Health Panel, such a structure could serve the dual role of reestablishing WHO\u2019s relevance and strengthening its response capabilities [66\u201368]. This would be accomplished by enabling WHO with high-level political representation and access to all the resources at the UN system\u2019s disposal.","Exemption for review by the ethical committee system and informed consent was given by the Committee on Biomedical Research Ethics -Capital region in accordance with Danish law on assay development projects.","We attempt to describe how the performed ERC strategy, during the first days of the outbreak, might have contributed to the authorities\u2019 credibility, public trust, and outbreak control measures. We believe this case study might be useful to emergency planners for developing scenarios regarding what communication challenges to expect during the first days of a novel virus outbreak. It also represents an example of how practitioners, which are involved in the response to an outbreak, can engage in ERC evaluation efforts. Such efforts can be focused on ERC processes as in this case, or on ERC outcomes, and are both very much needed in public health emergency preparedness, as recently pointed by several literature reviews [9,10,11].","While SARS-CoV remains a mystery and a loose cannon, another novel coronavirus emerged in Saudi Arabia in 2012, later known as the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) [8]. The fatality rate of MERS-CoV infection is approximately 35.4%, and new cases as well as associated deaths continue to arise to date [9]. Despite that most cases have been attributed to human-to-human transmission, MERS-CoV does not appear to transmit efficiently among humans unless there is close contact. The exact source of MERS-CoV and its routes of transmission to humans still remain uncertain. Dromedary camels are believed to be the animal reservoir for MERS-CoV because isolates from camels are almost identical to those from human, and that many domestic camels are seropositive for MERS-CoV (reviewed in [10,11]). Furthermore, current evidence strongly suggests that bats are the original source for MERS-CoV, as many coronaviruses phylogenetically related to MERS-CoV originate in bats, including BatCoV-HKU4, BatCoV-HKU5 and other MERS-related coronaviruses [12\u201315]. The BatCoV-HKU4 was also shown to be able to engage the cellular receptor of MERS-CoV, adding evidence to the bat origin theory [16]. However, there has not yet been direct evidence for isolating MERS-CoV from bats (reviewed in [10,11,17]).","Crisis Capacity 1) ED can access onsite specialty palliative care 7 days/week from 9am to 6pm, by consult request. Additionally, palliative care telephonic coaching and support available 24 hours a day, 7 days/week 2) Planned daily huddles with ED to address increased need for palliative care Palliative Care Intervention: -Consults for patients with poor prognosis and at risk of intubation or resuscitation prioritized -Patients admitted to the hospital followed daily through check-in with primary team -Support for implementing DNR orders using informed assent or based on medical futility when appropriate -Chart review results and brief or full consults documented in the EHR 3) Embed a palliative care specialist in ED to assist &amp; address high volumes of patients and screen patients based on following criteria:","The labor-intensive technology of differential display was quickly joined by the more efficient gene macroarray technology. Macroarrays are membranes imprinted with hundreds of cDNA probes, usually consisting of a thematic element, such as genes associated with inflammation. The technique used is familiar, and the number of genes evaluated is targeted, but somewhat limited. Analysis and interpretation of macroarray results is accomplished using standard protocols. This technique offers no potential for novel gene discovery because the probes included on the membrane are of known sequences. The concept of depositing multiple DNA spots representing different genes onto a membrane surface is not new, especially in microbiology. More than 10 years ago, Chuang et al. (8) investigated Escherichia coli gene expression on macroarray membranes, and commercial macroarrays have become widely available since their report.","Ethical approval was obtained from the ethics committees of the First Affiliated Hospital of University of Science and Technology of China. This is a retrospective and observational study and the informed consent was obtained.","SARS is the first major new infectious disease of the 21st century and the Internet age, and took full advantage of the opportunities for rapid spread along international air routes. From geographic mapping to location-based alerting services, geoinformatics plays an important role in the study and control of global outbreaks like SARS. Carefully planned and designed maps are powerful decision support and spatio-temporal analysis tools. Web-based maps also allow for quick, frequent map updates based on the latest datasets, for interactivity to be incorporated into the maps (desktop GIS-like functionality, e.g., drill-down and zooming), and for wider and more rapid dissemination of information (compared to other publishing media). In this paper we have reviewed several geographic mapping efforts of SARS that we have found on the Internet. The maps described in this review employed a variety of techniques like choropleth rendering, graduated circles, graduated pie charts, buffering, thematic mapping, overlay analysis and animation to allow public health decision makers, travellers and local populations at risk to visually monitor and appreciate at a glance changes, trends and patterns buried in different online SARS datasets that were continuously varying with time during the 2003 outbreak. Some of the mapping services presented in this paper provided very detailed information down to individual street/building level (in Hong Kong). This kind of support is vital for improving global vigilance and awareness at all levels and for making well-informed decisions when designing and following up epidemic control strategies or issuing and updating travel advisories.","At the onset of an outbreak, it is important for the HSCT team to review its emergency preparedness plan and coordinate plans with the infection control team of the hospital. A suggested framework for HSCT programs has been formulated [14] . Supplies of masks and antiviral medications should be surveyed and fortified, if possible. Dispersal of patients away from the center may need to be considered to minimize spread. Consideration for closure of the program may be necessary if the extent of involvement of staff and general community threatens the center's access to vital resources to provide essential care.","Ideally, a full outbreak management team (OMT) should be formed by the RCF to coordinate the response. The OMT directs and oversees the management of all aspects of an outbreak, meeting at least daily during the peak of the outbreak. It considers the progress of the response, undertakes ongoing monitoring, deals with unexpected issues, and initiates changes, as required.","Ethical approval for the study was obtained from the committee on human research, publications and ethics of the school of medical sciences, Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology (Protocol number CHRPE49/09). Permission for livestock sampling was also obtained from the wildlife division of the Ghana Forestry Commission (Approval Number: AO4957).","All procedures performed in studies involving human participants were in accordance with the ethical standards of the institutional and/or national research committee.

Those include, for example, that some Chinese provinces reported new cases more than once a day, with each report providing only new data. Other provinces provided updates throughout the day and then provided a final update listing all new cases, inclusive of earlier reports. In the latter case, entry of all the newly reported cases would result in duplication of cases from earlier updates. Additionally, as countries began to report asymptomatic PCR-positive individuals, their referencing or indexing of patients sometimes changed. For example, Japan\u2019s Ministry of Health identified novel coronavirus pneumonia cases ordinally up to the country\u2019s eighth case. The next three cases were identified during testing of a Japanese national flown from Wuhan on a charter flight for repatriation. One of those cases became the Ministry of Health\u2019s ninth case while the other two were asymptomatic and not considered the 10th and 11th cases in their press release. As this distinction was not made in other countries, the practice was documented to avoid confusion of cases in the line-list.","The study procedures (ID: 2017021504) were approved by the Medical Ethics Committee of Guangzhou Women and Children's Medical Center.

In this sample, process issues are addressed with a very high frequency relative to outcome issues. This would imply that surgeons in the accredited organisations need to become more proactive in the functioning of the surgical team and to participate more effectively in management issues related to surgical care. Attention to these details will position surgical programmes to effectively deal with the rapid pace of change that is inherent in a modern surgical practice.","\u2022 Blood clotting times, platelet number, and systemic blood pressure should be assessed prior to biopsy. \u2022 Ultrasound-guided percutaneous biopsy is relatively safe but laparotomy or laparoscopy reduces the risk of post-operative bleeding. Renal hemorrhage is a risk, especially if hypertensive. \u2022 Sample must contain &gt;5 glomeruli to make a diagnosis; this usually means multiple needle biopsies or a wedge biopsy are required. \u2022 Routine histopathology (fix sample in buffered normal formalin), electromicroscopy (fix sample in paraformaldehyde-glutaraldehyde), \u00b1 immunohistochemistry (keep fresh and paraffin embed) are needed to confirm a diagnosis. \u2022 On gross inspection kidneys may appear normal, be slightly small, firm and pale, or show irregular pitting and fibrosis. \u2022 Light microscopy typically shows diffuse thickening of the glomerular basement membrane, with variable degrees of cellular proliferation in the affected glomeruli. Special stains can help to define the changes, but electromicroscopy and immunohistochemistry are needed to define the exact nature and extent of the disease.","All research was conducted with integrity and in line with generally accepted ethical principles and approved by the Research Ethics Committee of Chaohu Hospital, Anhui Medical University (202001-kyxm-01), and Wuxi Mental Health Center, Nanjing Medical University (WUXIMHCIRB2020-005).

Accordingly, the Office of Cellular, Tissue, and Gene Therapies (OCTGT) employs scientists and clinicians involved in full-time review and some who, in addition to their review responsibilities, also pursue laboratory research programs in areas such as developmental biology. This approach ensures that all aspects of product, preclinical, and clinical development are overseen by staff possessing state-of-the art expertise and scientific judgment. Moreover, substantial experience with the regulation of other emergent technologies such as use of recombinant proteins, gene transfer, and cellular therapies has resulted in a regulatory and policy framework that can meet the challenge confronting medical use of stem cells. Finally, oversight of this novel therapeutic approach benefits from input provided by external expert panels such as the FDA's Biological Response Modifiers Advisory Committee (BRMAC). For example, the BRMAC convened to consider challenges posed by stem cell-based therapies and has assisted tremendously in development of a regulatory framework for oversight of this field. 1 Stem cell-based therapies will likely include a variety of approaches including administration of undifferentiated stem cells or transplantation of differentiated cells derived from stem cells. Consequently, there is a need for increased understanding of the mechanisms regulating stem cell growth, cell fate determination, and differentiation. An important goal of this understanding is to eliminate the risk of inappropriate cell differentiation or transformation while ensuring that longterm benefits include prolonged function and viability of the therapeutic stem cells or their cellular descendents, in the absence of adverse events."],"title":["A Review of Pediatric Critical Care in Resource-Limited Settings: A Look at Past, Present, and Future Directions","Planning and provision of ECMO services for severe ARDS during the COVID-19 pandemic and other outbreaks of emerging infectious diseases","Understand Research Hotspots Surrounding COVID-19 and Other Coronavirus Infections Using Topic Modeling","73 Stem Cell-based Products in Medicine: FDA Regulatory Considerations","Building resilience against biological hazards and pandemics: COVID-19 and its implications for the Sendai Framework","Bulk and single-cell transcriptomics identify tobacco-use disparity in lung gene expression of ACE2, the receptor of 2019-nCov","COVID-19 in Italy: Ageism and Decision-Making in a Pandemic","Cardiovascular Considerations for Patients, Health Care Workers, and Health Systems During the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Pandemic","The Ebola Outbreak: Catalyzing a \u201cShift\u201d in Global Health Governance?","All Hands on Deck: Transdisciplinary Approaches to Emerging Infectious Disease","Coronaviruses: emerging and re-emerging pathogens in humans and animals","The Ebola Outbreak: Catalyzing a \u201cShift\u201d in Global Health Governance?","Planning and provision of ECMO services for severe ARDS during the COVID-19 pandemic and other outbreaks of emerging infectious diseases","Early epidemiological analysis of the coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak based on crowdsourced data: a population-level observational study","Early epidemiological analysis of the coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak based on crowdsourced data: a population-level observational study","Descriptive review of geographic mapping of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) on the Internet","Immunogenicity and protective efficacy in monkeys of purified inactivated Vero-cell SARS vaccine","Poster Sessions","Advance of Novel Coronavirus Registration Clinical Trial","Pan-human coronavirus and human bocavirus SYBR Green and TaqMan PCR assays; use in studying influenza A viruses co-infection and risk of hospitalization","Discovery, diversity and evolution of novel coronaviruses sampled from rodents in China","Major emerging and re-emerging zoonoses in China: a matter of global health and socioeconomic development for 1.3 billion","Coronaviruses: emerging and re-emerging pathogens in humans and animals","Mechanical Ventilation in an Airborne Epidemic","Chapter 57 Respiratory Diseases","Update on SARS research and other possibly zoonotic coronaviruses","COVID-19 and Dialysis Units: What Do We Know Now and What Should We Do?","Coronavirus and paramyxovirus in bats from Northwest Italy","Reproducibility and reporting practices in COVID-19 preprint manuscripts","Navigating the challenges of the COVID-19 outbreak: perspectives from the radiation oncology service in singapore","Clinical findings in a group of patients infected with the 2019 novel coronavirus (SARS-Cov-2) outside of Wuhan, China: retrospective case series","Clinical characteristics of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 reactivation","The Ebola Outbreak: Catalyzing a \u201cShift\u201d in Global Health Governance?","An alternative workflow for molecular detection of SARS-CoV-2 - escape from the NA extraction kit-shortage","How Do the First Days Count?
