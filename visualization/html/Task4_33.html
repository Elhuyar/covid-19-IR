Patients were given supportive treatment after admission. Antiviral drugs (e.g., lopinavir/ritonavir, arbidol) were tried in a small proportion of patients. Corticosteroid was not used unless a panel discussion by experts considered necessary (e.g., ARDS). A total of 22(8.8%) patients were admitted in ICU 8.5 \u00b1 4.0 days after onset of symptoms. A total of 8(3.2%) patients developed ARDS 4.8 \u00b1 2.4 days after onset of symptoms.

A total of 2 patients died (0.8%).","No drugs are currently approved for Coronavirus Disease-2019 (COVID- 19) , although some have been tried. In view of recent studies and discussion on chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), we aimed to review existing literature and relevant websites regarding these drugs and COVID-19, adverse effects related to drugs, and related guidelines.","Effective therapeutics and antivirals are urgently needed to decrease COVID-19 mortality. As specific therapies targeting 2019-nCoV are lacking, it may be useful to repurpose drugs already licensed for marketing or clinical trials to treat COVID-19 patients in an emergency response; researchers are actively working to identify such drugs. At the time of preparation of this manuscript, the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and the China-Japan Friendship Hospital had launched a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebocontrolled clinical trial in Wuhan to test the effectiveness of remdesivir as an antiviral drug against 2019-nCoV, [12, 13] and studies have already shown that chloroquine phosphate is an effective treatment for COVID-19. [14] Clinical trials are also underway to validate the effectiveness of various other licensed drugs against COVID-19.","Similar to developing vaccines, drugs effective against other RNA viruses were also repurposed for CoVs. Two major types of drugs being nucleoside analogues and immunomodulators. So far, the most common therapies tried in patients with CoVs are ribavirin, lopinavir/ritonavir, IFN, or their combinations [74] . Despite the antiviral activity observed with in vitro studies, the clinical effect was not consistent [75] , in that ribavirin does not prolong the survival of SARS-CoV patients [74, 76] , while lopinavir/ritonavir plus ribavirin seemed to improve clinical outcomes for SARS patients [77] , but the improvement was not confirmed in MERS-CoV patients. IFNs showed effective at inducing antiviral activity against both SARS-CoV and MRES-CoV, but without significant improvement in the outcomes for the patients [78, 79] . In addition to the drug regimens used in patients, numerous drugs developed for the treatment of infection with CoVs were thoroughly discussed in the literature [57] .","Drugs such as lopinavir / ritonavir, interferon, abidol, and chloroquine phosphate can be tried, but their effectiveness needs to be confirmed in clinical studies.In the registration trial, the main treatment was drug therapy, accounting for 68.97%. Among them, there are more CMT and TCM studies, and relatively few BI studies.The most frequently studied CMT is chloroquine phosphate.Chloroquine phosphate is an antimalarial drug marketed for many The \"Scheme\" emphasizes the important role of TCM.

According to the latest treatment protocol (Pilot Version 6) issued by the Chinese health commission, antiviral therapy can be tried with interferon, lopinavir/litonavir, chloroquine phosphate and arbidol. These drugs and other potentially effective drugs are described here.","1. What is the effectiveness and safety of any antiviral and/or monoclonal antibody treatment currently available to treat (COVID-19)? 2. What is the effectiveness and safety of currently available antiviral therapies used to treat other coronavirus infections?","At present, there is no evidence-based medicine to support the effectiveness of antiviral drugs for COVID-19. The previous experience of treating SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV or influenza infections guides the selection of antiviral agents for COVID-19. The current guideline of the NHC recommends IFN-\u03b1, lopinavir/ritonavir, and ribavirin as antiviral therapy. In Huang's study [26] , 38 of 41 patients were given antiviral therapy. The Jinyintan hospital has launched a randomized, controlled trial of the anti-HIV drug combination of lopinavir and ritonavir. In Chen's study [37] , 75 patients received antiviral treatment, including oseltamivir, ganciclovir, and lopinavir/ritonavir, and the duration of antiviral treatment was 3-14 days. In Wang's study [83] , there were 89.9% (124/138) patients who received oseltamivir. And in Guan's study, 35 .8% (393/1099) of patients received oseltamivir [85] . The anti-viral drug remdesivir (Gilead\u00ae) is in clinical trials to treat COVID-19 in Wuhan [132] . Chloroquine phosphate has also been shown to be effective in some patients.","Our approach aimed to identify FDA-approved drugs and bioactives that could be promptly repositioned or developed, respectively, to treat MERS-CoV and potentially COVID-19-infected patients. In previously reported studies, small molecule libraries, including approximately 300 drugs with FDA-approval or in clinical development, were screened against MERS-CoV (De Wilde et al., 2014; Dyall et al., 2014) . Here, our screening included 1,247 FDA-approved drugs, which covers approximately 60% of all FDA-approved compounds. As a result, we identified drugs that were not found in previous studies, indicating that there are still opportunities for identifying novel FDAapproved drugs and bioactives by screening larger compound libraries. Moreover, we corroborated four previously identified hits, including emetine dihydrochloride, ouabain, cycloheximide, and nelfinavir mesylate. This strongly suggests that despite the use of different viral isolates, both our HCS assays and previously published screens reproducibly identified drugs that could be repurposed as potential therapeutic options for patients suffering CoV infections (Dyall et al., 2014) .","Since SARS-CoV-2 is a newly discovered pathogen, no specific drugs have been identified or are currently available. An economic and efficient therapeutic strategy is to repurpose existing drugs. On the basis of genomic sequence information coupled with protein structure modeling, the scientific community has been able to rapidly respond with a suggested list of existing drugs with therapeutic potential for COVID-19. Table 4 provides a summary of such drugs together with potential mechanisms of actions for their activities. Barcitinib was proposed because of its anti-inflammatory effect and possible ability to reduce viral entry.35 A fixed dose of the anti-HIV combination, lopinavir\u2013ritonavir, is currently in clinical trials with Arbidol or ribavirin.22 Remdesivir, developed by Gilead Sciences Inc., was previously tested in humans with Ebola virus disease and has shown promise in animal models for MERS and SARS. The drug is currently being studied in phase III clinical trials in both China and the USA. Favipiravir, a purine nucleoside leading to inaccurate viral RNA synthesis,36 was originally developed by Toyama Chemical of Japan, and has recently been approved for a clinical trial as a drug to treat COVID-19.30 Chloroquine, an antimalarial drug, has proven effective in treating coronavirus in China.32 In addition to the above-mentioned, many other antiviral drugs are also listed.","In late December 2019, an outbreak of an emerging disease (COVID- 19) due to a novel coronavirus (named SARS-CoV-2 latter) started in Wuhan, China and rapidly spread in China and outside [1, 2] . The WHO declared the epidemic of COVID-19 as a pandemic on March 12 th 2020 [3] . According to a recent Chinese stud, about 80% of patients present with mild disease and the overall case-fatality rate is about 2.3% but reaches 8.0% in patients aged 70 to 79 years and 14.8% in those aged &gt;80 years [4] . However, there is probably an important number of asymptomatic carriers in the population, and thus the mortality rate is probably overestimated. France is now facing the COVID-19 wave with more than 4500 cases, as of March 14 th 2020 [5] . Thus, there is an urgent need for an effective treatment to treat symptomatic patients but also to decrease the duration of virus carriage in order to limit the transmission in the community. Among candidate drugs to treat COVID-19, repositioning of old drugs for use as antiviral treatment is an interesting strategy because knowledge on safety profile, side effects, posology and drug interactions are well known [6, 7] .","For treatment of SARS, several drugs were tried clinically with no clear benefit, and since then a number of drugs including protease inhibitors used in HIV have been investigated for efficacy in vitro. The viral S protein has been suggested as a candidate for developing a preventative vaccine against SARS or other coronaviruses. However, the genetic variability of these viruses, and poor immunity after natural infection, indicate the challenges involved.","Patients with COVID-19 in the present study achieved a 100% recovery rate. No effective antiviral drugs that treat COVID-19 have been identified to date, and opinions on whether antiviral drugs should even be used to treat COVID-19 differ. 1 The National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China has repeatedly issued and revised the COVID-19 Diagnosis and Treatment Plan, which recommends antiviral drugs such as lopinavir/ritonavir, ribavirin, umifenovir, . CC-BY-NC 4.0 International license It is made available under a author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.","Identification of targets is important for identifying drugs with high target specificity and/or uncovering existing drugs that could be repurposed to treat SARS-CoV-2 infection. Table 2 lists potential targets, their roles in viral infection, and representative existing drugs or drug candidates that reportedly act on the corresponding targets in similar viruses and thus are to be assessed for their effects on SARS-CoV-2 infection. 3CLpro and PLpro are two viral proteases responsible for the cleavage of viral peptides into functional units for virus replication and packaging within the host cells. Thus, drugs that target these proteases in other viruses such as HIV drugs, lopinavir and ritonavir, have been explored.19 RdRp is the RNA polymerase responsible for viral RNA synthesis that may be blocked by existing antiviral drugs or drug candidates, such as remdesivir.19 Conceivably, the interaction of viral S protein with its receptor ACE2 on host cells, and subsequent viral endocytosis into the cells, may also be a viable drug target. For example, the broad-spectrum antiviral drug Arbidol, which functions as a virus-host cell fusion inhibitor to prevent viral entry into host cells against influenza virus,20 has entered into a clinical trial for treatment of SARS-CoV-2.21,22 The protease TMPRSS2 produced by the host cells plays an important role in proteolytic processing of S protein priming to the receptor ACE2 binding in human cells.11 It has been shown that camostat mesylate, a clinically approved TMPRSS2 inhibitor, was able to block SARS-CoV-2 entry to human cells, indicating its potential as a drug for COVID-19.11","Initial treatment should be with anti-inflammatory drugs. Corticosteroid therapy (prednisolone) may help if a flea allergy or other inflammatory stimulus is suspected. NSAIDs like piroxicam or meloxicam or megestrol can also be tried.","During the outbreak of SARS, given its severity and high mortality rates, a number of therapeutic options including ribavirin, interferon alpha, lopinavir/ritonavir, and nucleoside analogue protease inhibitor combination therapy were all tried. While there is evidence of activity in-vitro, these drugs were not evaluated in controlled clinical trials and their therapeutic benefit remains uncertain.","Although understanding the mechanisms linking viral bronchiolitis and asthma is critical in light of the implications for therapy, this association remains elusive. As a result, treating bronchiolitis with the same strategies for treating an acute asthma episode has not yielded consistent benefit over the past few decades. Corticosteroids (systemic or inhaled), b agonists, mixed a and b agonists, anticholinergics, and theophylline have been tried and have been generally largely ineffective [140] [141] [142] . In light of the pathology of airway obstruction associated with bronchiolitis (desquamation of the respiratory epithelium and airway wall edema), this lack of effectiveness is not surprising. Acute reversible airways obstruction, although common in children who have asthma, is not a constant finding in some patients who have viral bronchiolitis [143] , and may relate to the type of immune response generated by the infection. Advances in knowledge of the immunologic and inflammatory factors that contribute to disease may suggest new approaches to treatment and facilitate understanding of the relationship between viral bronchiolitis and recurrent wheezing [19] .","Drugs Drugs are used to control abnormal heart rhythms or treat related hypertension, coronary artery disease, and heart failure. Anticoagulants also may be given to reduce the risk of stroke in patients with some arrhythmias. Drugs used are mainly: \u25a0 Class I drugs (act on sodium channels; disopyramide, flecainide, moracizine, procainamide, propafenone, quinidine) \u25a0 Class II drugs (beta-blockers) \u25a0 Class III drugs (act on potassium 83 Specific problem areas -CARDIAC ARRHYTHMIAS channels; amiodarone, dofetilide, ibutilide, sotalol) \u25a0 Class IV drugs (calcium channel blockers such as nifedipine, nicardipine or verapamil).","Novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), officially known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the etiological agent of the (Corona Virus Disease 2019) COVID-19, emerged in Wuhan, Hubei province, China. On 11 th March 2020, The World Health Organization (WHO) declared this disease as pandemic [1] . Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention showed an increased mortality in people with diabetes (2.3% vs. 7.3%; overall vs. in patients with diabetes respectively) from a report of 72,314 cases of COVID-19 [2] . People with diabetes and COVID-19 may need special attention and clinical care [3] . In the absence of any known efficient therapy and because of the situation of a \"public-health emergency\", many drugs have been tried recently in the treatment for COVID-19 that includes a low-cost antimalarial drug chloroquine and its derivative hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), along with several other antiviral drugs. Because HCQ has been approved in the treatment of type 2 diabetes in India since 2014 as a third-or fourth-line drug, it would be interesting to research its impact in patients with diabetes, infected with COVID-19.","In late December 2019, an outbreak of an emerging disease (COVID-19) due to a novel coronavirus (named SARS-CoV-2 latter) started in Wuhan, China and rapidly spread in China and outside [1, 2] .

Remdesivir is being developed by Gilead as a monophosphoramidate prodrug: GS-441524. It was intended to be an intravenous treatment for Ebola but it also shows potential against coronavirus and Nipah virus infection. The results from evaluating the antiviral efficiency of remdesivir against a clinical isolate of COVID-19 in vitro suggest that it could inhibit COVID-19 strongly with an EC50 ranging from 0.77 to 1.76 \u03bcM [3] . Remdesivir cured the first case of 2019-nCoV infection confirmed in the USA, which prompted Gilead and the Chinese authorities to move the Phase III trial ahead and expand it to a lot more patients who desperately need treatment. Final results of the clinical trial will be announced in April 2020. In contrast to remdesivir, the activity report of favipiravir in vitro and in vivo is limited. However, there are still three active clinical trials regarding favipiravir that have begun enrolling patients in China. Lopinavir and ritonavir, targeting 3Clpro, were used to treat SARS patients from China in 2003. Shortly after the emergence of MERS-CoV, researchers identified lopinavir and ritonavir as MERS-CoV inhibitors. The national expert group has recommended lopinavir and ritonavir as effective anti-COVID-19 agents in China, and most clinical trials on COVID-19 select both drugs as positive controls. Emtricitabine and tenofovir alafenamide are reverse transcriptase inhibitors that were approved to treat HIV and hepatitis B virus (HBV). Currently, only one trial combines emtricitabine/tenofoviralafenamide and lopinavir/ritonavir to treat COVID-19 patients. Arbidol as a 2\u2032-5\u2032oligoadenylates synthesis (OAS) inhibitor against severe pneumonia and virusassociated cytokine dysregulation has displayed anti-COVID-19 potential in clinical trials [4] . However, the mechanism needs to be clarified in the near future. Chloroquine and its derivatives including hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine phosphate have elicited antiviral effects on several viruses such as SARS-CoV and HCoV-229E by interfering with endosomal acidification. Based on the advantage of known broadspectrum activity and rarely occurring adverse reactions, a series of clinical trials on chloroquine and its derivatives have been advancing rapidly. Presently, Chinese government authorities have approved chloroquine phosphate to be used to treat adult patients suffering from COVID-19 infection. Further, treatments combining Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) and chemical molecules (popularly known as Western medicine in China) have shown some exciting results. In view of inconclusive clinical evidence on TCM efficacy, pharmacologists should separate active pharmaceutical ingredients and identify explicit targets as soon as possible [5] . Surprisingly, various drugs are also in clinical trials despite the lack of biological rationale, such as the antiinfluenza drugs umifenovir and oseltamivir targeting neuraminidase, baloxavirmarboxil targeting cap-dependent endonuclease that is not found in COVID-19, ASC09 targeting protease with no anti-coronavirus research reported, and cobicistat targeting CYP3A4 with only unpersuasive predicted activity by computer virtual docking. As the crystal structures of COVID-19 spike [6] , dimeric full-length human ACE2 [7] and COVID-19 spike receptor-binding domain bound with the ACE2 receptor [8] are published in succession, the lead drug discovery strategy such as structure-based HTS and molecular dynamics simulation to discover inhibitors with affinity to ACE2, the S protein or the protein-protein interaction will be possible in the near future. There have been three major outbreaks of coronaviruses in the 21st century: SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and COVID-19. Drawing experience from effective screening strategies on antitumor drug development, the credible and large-scale screening system of the especially deadly coronaviruses must be set up at the molecular level and in animal models as soon as possible. Although the clinical safety of old drugs has been proven, some of them can cause serious adverse reactions. For example, hydroxychloroquine has the side effect of arrhythmia, which can itself lead to death. Thus, special attention needs to be paid to the safety of old drugs in new indications.","It is very difficult and often impossible to test the efficacy of new treatments for highly lethal infections in human clinical trials. Animal models for human EIDs can play a key role in the development and testing of candidate vaccines and therapeutics and can be used to facilitate their regulatory approval. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has developed The Animal Rule to assist in the regulatory approval process [4] . The rule states that when it would not be ethical to perform human challenge studies to measure the efficacy of vaccines and drugs developed to prevent or treat highly pathogens, the FDA may grant approval based on appropriate animal efficacy studies when the results of those studies establish that the drug is reasonably likely to produce a clinical benefit in humans. The Animal Rule states that the FDA will only rely on evidence from animal studies to provide substantial evidence of effectiveness when strict criteria are met.","Up to half of all invasive fungal infections (IFIs)occur in non-neutropenic ICU patients and the majority are due to Candida species. Despite this, incidence of IFIs on most ICUs is low and ranges from 1\u22125% in most European units. Many candidal infections are nosocomial and preventable. Several RCTs have looked at prophylaxis, predominantly with fluconazole in ICU patients and three systematic reviews have been performed. Meta-analyses reportedly demonstrates a reduction in proven IFI. However, ICU populations are heterogenous:there are marked differences between Europe and North America, diagnostic criteria are not defined and prophylaxis and targeted therapy are not distinguished. Widespread use of azole drugs promotes resistance, pathogen shifts and adverse drug related events. It is necessary to establish methods to identify patients at greatest risk of IFI who will benefit most from antifungal drugs. Numerous risk factors have been identified including length of stay, colonisation, antibiotics, surgery, central venous catheters, total parenteral nutrition, gastric acid suppression, bacterial sepsis etc. but none accurately predict IFI or fungal related mortality. Several prediction rules and scoring systems have been proposed to identify subpopulations of ICU patients who would benefit from prophylaxis. These rules identify different percentages of patients -up to 85% in some centres. Many have been created and validated within the same database and none are practical or have proven robustness across all ICU populations. Cost effectiveness has never been evaluated and numbers needed to treat to prevent a single case remain high in centres with a prevalence of less than 20%. Centres reporting high prevalence of candidal infection should address infection control issues before resorting to prophylactic drugs. Diagnosis still relies on conventional microbiological techniques of culture from sterile sites but the role of biomarkers (antigen and PCR testing) merit further investigation in ICU populations. The high negative predictive value of these newer assays has the potential to influence antifungal strategy by identifying patients who do not have fungal infection. Combined with a robust and simple model to predict the risk of developing invasive Candida infection, these tests that can rapidly exclude fungal infection in high-risk groups and allow a targeted (pre-emptive strategy) to be developed and supersede unnecessary prophylactic treatment. Part of the explanation refers to factors within the patient, for example, the status of innate and adaptive immunity and part of the explanation is probably found within in the bacterium as such.","It is documented elsewhere that DAA drugs such as Osel is only completely effective in the early phase of infection, optimally within 48 hours of symptom onset 31 . And till now, there is no approved drug to treat advanced influenza disease at the late phase specifically. We suppose that S312 could be effective in the middle or late phase of disease because it targets a host pro-viral factor of DHODH not affected by viral replication cycle. To test this, we compared the therapeutic windows of S312 and Osel in early (D3-D7), middle &amp; late (D5-D9)\uff0csevere late (D7-D11 or D6-D14) phases (workflow shown in Fig. 5A ). When drugs were given in the early phase, both Oseltreatment and 'Osel+S312'-combination-treatment conferred 100% protection (Fig.   5B ). When drugs were given at the middle &amp; late phase (Fig. 5C) , single Osel-treatment wholly lost its antiviral effect with no surviving. However, S312-treatment could provide 50% protection, and drug combination reached to 100% protection. When drugs were given at severe late phase of disease that mice were starting dying (Fig. 5D) , neither single treatment of Osel nor S312 can rescue the mice from death but combined treatment still conferred to 25% survival. To really show the advantage of S312 in treating severe disease, we additionally treated the mice a bit early before dying around 80% of initial weights (D6-D14) with a more optimal dose of S312 (5mg/kg). The data in Fig. 5E showed that S312 rescued 50% of mice from severe body-weight losses, and combined treatment coffered additional 25% survival. These results once again highlight that S312 has remarkable advantages over Osel to treat severe diseases at the late phase, and its therapeutic effectiveness could even be improved when S312 was combined with DAA drug.","\u2022 Immediate cessation of antibiotic treatment is essential in any foal that suddenly develops diarrhea. In cases in which it is essential to maintain antibiotic treatment, e.g. septic arthritis, the use of antibiotics such as aminoglycosides that are not excreted or secreted into the bowel could be maintained. \u2022 Diarrhea usually resolves quickly when the inciting cause is removed. However, if treatment with the offending antibiotic is continued after diarrhea has commenced, it may become persistent and diffi cult to treat. \u2022 In cases in which diarrhea does not resolve following removal of the suspected cause, further diagnostics should be performed to rule out other possible causes e.g. Clostridium diffi cile. \u2022 Various treatments have been tried in cases that are slow to resolve.","The imperative need to treat a large number of patients affected by SARS-CoV-2 has motivated the consideration of a reliable, fail-safe, and easy to operate mechanical ventilator that can be produced quickly on a massive scale. We introduce a novel mechanical ventilator (Mechanical Ventilator Milano, MVM), inspired by the Manley ventilator [11] . In 1961, Roger Manley \"suggested the possibility of using the pressure of the gases from the anaesthetic machine as the motive power for a simple apparatus to ventilate the lungs of the patients in the operating theatre\" [12] . We have tried to design the MVM with the same principle of simplicity in mind. The main difference is the use of electricallydriven pneumatic valves instead of mechanical switches to ease large scale production. The MVM does not include a system to measure the tidal volume provided to the patient with each breathing cycle, but rather a system to mea-sure the peak and average expiratory flow rate. The MVM adheres as much as possible to the guidelines for \"Rapidly Manufactured Ventilator System (RMVS)\" [13] recently released by the UK Medicine &amp; Healthcare products Regulatory Agency.","In this issue of the Journal of Integrative Medicine, Zhang et al. [8] provided in silico methods to narrow down TCM remedies that may directly inhibit the coronaviral reproduction. Two principals for selection were proposed: oral effectiveness to inhibit viral infection and compatibility of patient manifestation. The identified TCM remedies should contain anti-novel coronavirus chemicals that meet the requirement for orally administered medical drugs. Meanwhile, the identified TCM remedies should be of the types of TCM remedy that have activity against virus-caused pneumonia. To this end, the authors conducted a series of in silico analyses. A number of natural compounds were selected, which were experimentally validated for their potential activity against SARS or Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus. These chemicals were then evaluated for their suitability for oral administration. Most importantly, the molecular structures of these natural compounds were evaluated for their ability to interact, or dock, with the main proteins of the novel coronavirus. Positive docking suggested their ability to inhibit the novel coronavirus infection. In order to comply with patient manifestation, the authors conducted another three rounds of screening. First, TCM herbs that contained at least two of the above natural compounds were selected from the Traditional Chinese Medicine Systems Pharmacology (TCMSPT) database [9] . These medicinal plants were classified by the types of diseases they are used to treat. Only those belonging to the types that have been classically used to treat viral pneumonia were selected for further studies. Next, comprehensive evaluation of the effectiveness of these TCM herbs was performed. The authors downloaded its documented chemical constituents of each herb and analyzed their cellular protein targets for network pharmacological analysis. All these processes found that at least 26 TCM herbs have potential in vivo anti-novel coronavirus effects and can simultaneously regulate host inflammation responses.","The outbreak of the pneumonia named COVID-19 caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (2019-nCoV) has infected over 110,000 people worldwide by 8th March, 2020. Apart from China, other countries or regions including South Korea, Iran, and Europe have reported a rapid increase in the number of COVID-19 cases, implying that this novel coronavirus has posed a global health threat. Under the current circumstance of the absence of the specific vaccines and medicines against SARS-CoV-2, it is urgent to discover effective therapies especially drugs to treat the resulting COVID-19 disease and prevent the virus from further spreading. Considering that the development of a new drug generally takes years, probably the best therapeutic shortcut is to apply the drug repositioning strategy (i.e., finding the new uses of old drugs) [1, 2, 3] to identify the potential antiviral effects against SARS-CoV-2 of existing drugs that have been approved for clinical use or to enter clinical trials. Those existing drugs with potent antiviral efficacy can be directly applied to treat COVID-19 in a short time, as their safety has been verified in principle in clinical trials.","Recently, sc-RNA seq technology was rapidly developed. It is capable to specifically profile cell populations at the single-cell resolution. Thus, it transformed many fields of genomic research. Here, we tried to explore the utility of sc-RNA seq on personalized COVID-19 treatment. We collected healthy adults sc-RNA seq data from 4 lung and 5 liver tissues.","One record which receives a lot of attention amid the current outbreak is the lopinavir/ritonavir combination 18. They are protease inhibitors originally developed against HIV. During the 2003 SARS outbreak, despite lacking a clinical trial, they were tried as an emergency measure and found to offer improved clinical outcome 18. However, some scientists did express scepticism 19. By analogy, these compounds were speculated to act on SARS-CoV 3CL pro specifically, but there is as yet no crystal structure to support that, although docking studies were carried out to propose various binding modes 20\u2013 23. The IC 50 value of lopinavir is 50 \u03bcM ( K i = 14 \u03bcM) and that for ritonavir cannot be established 24. Although this is far from a cure, based on our results that the two CoV 3CL pro enzymes are identical as far as protein sequences and substrate specificities are concerned, we are of the opinion that this is still one of the recommended routes for immediate treatment at the time of writing (early February 2020). ","At the time of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)associated coronavirus epidemic [6] in 2003, several molecules were tested to assess their effectiveness against this virus. Among these, teicoplanin [7] , an antistaphylococcal agent, had proven efficacy in vitro , and this was also the case for chloroquine, at a 50% effective concentration (EC 50 ) of approximatively 8 \u03bcM, and when added to the cell culture either before of after exposure to the virus [5 , 8-10] . These findings ended up being forgotten because of the disappearance of SARS for reasons that are neither clear nor explained [11] . The novel coronavirus currently isolated in China has been, with staggering speed, evaluated regarding its sensitivity to already used drugs [12] . Thus, the new antiviral drug remdesivir [13] as well as chloroquine, at an EC 50 of 1.1 \u03bcM, were found to be effective in preventing replication of this virus [12] . Chloroquine is perhaps one of the most prescribed drugs in the world [14 , 15] . As a matter of fact, all Europeans visiting malaria-endemic geographic areas for decades received chloroquine prophylaxis and continued it for 2 months after their return. In addition, local residents took chloroquine continuously, and treatment of malaria has long been based on this drug. In addition, hydroxychloroquine has been used for decades at much higher doses (up to 600 mg/day) to treat autoimmune diseases [16] . It is difficult to find a product that currently has a better established safety profile than chloroquine. Furthermore, its cost is negligible. Hence, its possible use both in prophylaxis in people exposed to the novel coronavirus and as a curative treatment will probably be promptly evaluated by our Chinese colleagues. If clinical data confirm the biological results, the novel coronavirus-associated disease will have become one of the simplest and cheapest to treat and prevent among infectious respiratory diseases. ","In this study, we implemented cost-effectiveness analysis tools of two distinct strategies to slowdown the virus spread in Israel, a small country with a population of 9 million. We show that a complete quarantine of the whole population (strategy 1) will result in a total of ~14,995 infected people and around 389 deaths over a period of 200 days. An alternative strategy of \"trace, isolate, test and treat approach\" (strategy 2) in which only individuals who are defined as being at highrisk for being exposed are isolated (relaxed isolation) and repeatedly tested will result in a total of 16,658 infected people with 432 deaths. Overall, strategy 1 is expected to save ~43 more lives, but with a cost of $102,383,282 to prevent one case of death, compared to a more focused approach. As usual ICER in cost-effectiveness analyses relates to cost per Quality-adjusted life year (QALY), and in our study the ICER was measured as cost per one avoided death, we suggest an easy transformation from the ICER in this study to the conventional ICER in cost-effectiveness analyses. Assuming that one case of death is equivalent to a loss of 10 QALYs, the ICER would be $102,383,282 divided by 10, resulting in $10.2 million per QALY. This number is extremely higher than the $150,000 per QALY, recommended by Neumann et al. as the threshold of willingness to pay (19) .","Symptomatic therapy for fever includes: \u2022 Oxygen. \u2022 Crystalloid fluid therapy. \u2022 Antipyretic drugs (NSAIDs) -these act directly on the thermoregulatory center and should be tried before surface cooling, unless the fever is lifethreatening, when they may be instituted together. \u2022 Surface cooling. Core temperature will continue to decrease after surface cooling has ceased, so to avoid large oscillations in temperature, aggressive cooling should stop just prior to reaching the desired temperature.","There are no licensed therapeutics and only supportive care is given for HRV infection. Many antiviral drugs have been proposed, however, all lack potency in humans. For instance, zinc has been tried as an over the counter therapeutic but with limited success. Vaccine development is problematic due to the high variability of surface proteins, although current efforts are directed to regions of conservation between many of the serotypes. Future work on prophylaxis is ongoing.","Drug repositioning (also known as drug repurposing), which concerns the investigation of existing drugs for new therapeutic target indications, has emerged as a successful strategy for drug discovery due to the reduced costs and expedited approval procedures [3] [4] [5] . Several successful examples unveil its great values in practice: Nelfinavir, initially developed to treat the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), is now being used for cancer treatments. Amantadine was firstly designed to treat influenza caused by type A influenza viral infection and is being used for Parkinson's disease later on [6] . In recent years, the rapid growth of drug-related datasets, as well as open data initiatives, has led to new developments for computational drug repositioning, particularly, structural-based drug repositioning (SBDR). Machine learning, network analysis, and text mining and semantic inference are three major computational approaches commonly applied in drug repositioning [7] . The rapid accumulation of genetic and structural databases [8] , the development of low-dimensional mathematical representations of complex biomolecular structures [9, 10] , and the availability of advanced deep learning algorithms have made machine learning-based drug reposition a promising approach [7] . Considering the urgent need for anti-2019-nCoV drugs, a computational drug repositioning is one of the most feasible strategies for discovering 2019-nCoV drugs.","Further, we tried to compare the miRNAs in the genomes and observed some striking findings. We observed that out of all the miRNAs, hsa-miR-27b is the only unique miRNA specific to India SARS-CoV2 and showed no significant complementarity-based nucleotide-binding with the strain of SARS-CoV2 from other countries. This is surprising and is of utmost importance along with our other novel finding of a unique mutation identified in the spike surface glycoprotein (A930V (24351C&gt;T)) in the Indian sequence. The target of the hsa-miR-27b sequence is the location containing A930V mutation in the spike surface glycoprotein which perhaps, should be explored further, experimentally. Reports have demonstrated the ability of miR-27b to inhibit HIV-1 replication (28) . There are contradicting reports regarding the use of HIV antiviral regimen for SARS-CoV2 infection showing no effects in China (29) while the Indian Council of Medical Research (India) has given the guidelines for the use of HIV treatment in these cases as some of the patients showed improvement with the administration. A few other drugs, including FDA approved antiviral and antimalarials are being used with significant claimed-successes. Needless to say, the variation in the protein sequences may have some influence on the therapeutic effects of these drugs.","There have been three or four pandemics of influenza every century for as long as can be ascertained from historical studies and there is every reason to believe that pandemics will come again in the twenty-first century. If H5N1 virus should acquire the ability to spread readily from person to person, and if its high lethality for humans should continue unabated, it could cause a devastating pandemic. Efforts are being made to prepare defenses against this virus, including vaccines and antiviral drugs, supported by the U.S. government and other governments. Promising vaccines are being developed and tested in clinical trials, and plans are to stockpile such a vaccine for possible use if an epidemic of this virus arises. This effort is complicated by the fact that H5N1 influenza, like all influenzas, continues to evolve, and stockpiled vaccine might not be completely effective against the strain that ultimately might emerge as a pandemic strain. Nevertheless, there is hope that at least partial immunity might be effected by such a vaccine that could ameliorate the symptoms of the disease and protect against the extreme virulence of the virus. As described in Chapter 4, new approaches to flu vaccine development are being tried, including development of a universal flu vaccine that would work against any influenza A strain, but such an approach will clearly require many more years of research before a licensed vaccine for general use could be produced. Efforts are also being directed toward producing and stockpiling antiviral compounds directed against influenza. Unfortunately, most H5N1 isolates tested are resistant to amantadine and related compounds, antiflu agents that have been in use for years and that are readily available. It is thought that this is the result of the wide use of amantadine by Chinese farmers to protect their chicken flocks from influenza, thereby selecting for amantadine-resistant variants of the viruses. This effect may be moderating, however, as some recent isolates are sensitive to amantadine. Inhibitors of the influenza neuraminidase such as oseltamivir (Tamiflu) and zanamivir appear to be reasonably effective against H5N1 virus, but these drugs must be used early in infection if they are to be effective. Production of these compounds is limiting at present, but production is being accelerated in order to stockpile them for possible use if or when a pandemic erupts.","In December 2019, a novel coronavirus emerged from China causing pneumonia outbreaks, first in the Wuhan region of China and then spread worldwide because of its probable high transmission efficiency [1 , 2] . This coronavirus, named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) (formerly 2019-nCoV), is responsible for respiratory infections including pneumonia, with an estimated mortality rate of approximately 2-2.5%, increasing with age and the presence of underlying diseases. In the first days of March 2020, an estimated 89 068 cases had been confirmed worldwide by the World Health Organization (WHO) (a number likely underestimated due to the existence of asymptomatic carriers) and the epidemic has already left 3046 dead from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the majority of them occurring in China. Because COVID-19 is now becoming pandemic, and in the absence of a known validated efficient therapy, effort s of laboratories and medical teams have focused on repurposing US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drugs to treat the most severe COVID-19 cases. Drug repurposing is an effective way to quickly identify therapeutic drugs with a known safety profile to treat an emerging disease. Chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine, a front-line drug used in the treatment and prophylaxis of malaria as well as in autoimmune diseases, has been shown to inhibit the replication of several DNA and RNA viruses, including most human coronaviruses [3] . Recently, chloroquine was found to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro, and its hydroxylated form has been proposed as a possible therapy to treat patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 [4 , 5] . In this context, other drugs also showed significant efficacy against SARS-Cov-2 in vitro, including remdesivir, lopinavir, ribavirin and ritonavir ( https://drugvirus.info/ ) [6] .","Attempts to rescue IBV EG3 by manipulation of Golgi pH. Despite intense efforts we were unable to conclusively determine whether an increase in Golgi pH could rescue the deficiencies of the IBV EG3 virus. We tried drugs that neutralize acidic compartments (baflinomycin A1, monensin and ammonium chloride), as well as overexpression of influenza A M2, a pH activated proton channel (4). However, the drugs inhibited exocytosis at all concentrations used (during short or long infections), and, we were unable to obtain a high percentage of M2transfected cells that were subsequently infected with IBV-EG3. In several experiments where the percent of transfected and infected cells was greater than 40%, we obtained 40-75% increases in release of infectious IBV-EG3 virus, but most experiments failed to show a reasonable overlap of transfection and infection and rescue of IBV-EG3 infectivity (data not shown). Additionally, attempts to make stable lines expressing M2 and pHluorin did not yield lines expressing M2 at a high enough level to alter the Golgi pH. We thus turned to another approach to assess the role of neutralization of the Golgi by IBV E during infection.

Furthermore, 83.0 percent of HWs were satisfied with reasonable work shift arrangement, which was an independent protective factor for acute stress and depression. The hospital's psychiatric team had also tried to support staff with relaxation techniques through online WeChat Balint group. However, only 5.0 percent of HWs joined in WeChat Balint group, suggesting that more psychosocial interventions and follow-up programs especially for the susceptible population need to be developed and promoted to reduce the perception of threats of COVID-19 among HWs.","The antiviral agent ribavirin (with or without corticosteroids) has been tried as treatment in an increasing number of patients. However, its effectiveness has not been proven. A coordinated multicenter approach to establish the effectiveness of ribavirin and other interventions has been proposed. There is no evidence for its use as prophylaxis, and many experts believe that it will be some years before an effective vaccine for the virus is available. WHO Revised Guidelines: management of contacts of probable SARS cases A SARS contact is a person who may be at greater risk of developing SARS because of exposure to a suspect or probable case of SARS (Table 1) . A contact of a probable SARS case should be given information about SARS, and placed under active surveillance for 10 days in voluntary home isolation. The contact should record his temperature daily, and be visited or telephoned daily by a member of the public health care team. If the contact develops disease symptoms, they should be investigated locally at an appropriate health care facility. WHO Revised Guidelines: management of contacts of suspect SARS cases It is recommended that contacts of suspect cases should be given information on the clinical picture and transmission of SARS and placed under passive surveillance for 10 days. The contact is free to continue with his usual activities, but if he develops any symptoms, he should telephone the public health authority immediately. CONCLUSION As the work on the virus, its clinical manifestations, treatment and prevention proceed, there are many unanswered questions that will challenge scientists, clinicians, and public health workers. These include: how this new virus entered the human population and succeeded in spreading so rapidly from person-toperson, a phenomenon that is not always the case when respiratory viruses make the species jump to humans; what the variation at the molecular level means for the pathogenesis and epidemiology of this virus; and what will be the results over time of its co-evolution with the human host. As there are numerous as yet uncharacterized animal viruses that periodically enter the human population, this outbreak, although due to a viral infection with a relatively low mortality rate, should serve as a warning to the global public health community of the importance of openness in communicating health care threats at an early stage. To not do so because of political concerns could jeopardize human health due to pandemic influenza, a paramyxovirus that is able to establish human-to-human transmission, another coronavirus, or an unrecognized agent. The political will to ensure this openness must be universal, as a single area that does not cooperate with such a policy risks the health of all humankind.","A number of antiviral molecules that target HSV-1 and HSV-2 are present. All are nucleoside analogs except foscarnet and cidofovir, while acyclovir, famciclovir, and valaciclovir are used to treat the majority of cases of HSV-1 and HSV-2 (Bacon et al., 2003) . Other medications such as foscarnet, valganciclovir, ganciclovir, and cidofovir have activity against the alpha herpesviruses and are recommended in certain circumstances, such as the treatment of some acyclovirresistant HSV. Antiviral drugs for the treatment against HSV infections have been developed over the past 40 years. However, most drug-resistant HSV isolates have been reported such as resistance to acyclovir, etc. So this demands the need of highly effective low toxicity drugs in HSV-resistant isolates. Here is the whole antiviral designing process based on the structural findings of HSV (Jiang et al., 2016) . Viruses of the family Herpesviridae are cause innumerable human diseases. Up to the year 2000, the available treatments were largely ineffective, with the exception of a few drugs for treatment of herpes simplex virus (HSV) infections. However, for some DNA viruses of this family, advancement was made for biochemistry and structural biology of the enzyme viral protease, revealing common features that can be exploited in the development of a new class of antiherpesvirus drugs. So, herpesvirus proteases were identified as a unique class of serine protease with a Ser-His-His catalytic triad. A new, single domain protein fold was determined by X-ray crystallography for the proteases of HSV. It was shown that dimerization is unique for serine proteases and is required for activity of the HSV proteases. With this known fact of dimerization, there was a serious impact on functional analysis and inhibitor discovery. The conserved functional and catalytic properties of the herpesvirus protease enzyme lead to common considerations in the process of inhibitor discovery. Crystal structures of the herpesvirus proteases allowed more direct interpretation of ligand structure\u00c0activity relationships (Waxman and Darke, 2000; Fig. 19.6 ).","In face of this new infectious disease and its complicated features with many unknown factors, single model estimations may infer biased results, therefore, we tried to make overall rigorous estimations by comparing different model results. To achieve an objective estimation, we investigated and implemented two most common approaches and one extended approach: the logistic model, the susceptible-exposed-infected-removed (SEIR) model and the adjusted SEIR model. Countries had different start time and level of interventions and measures to reduce risk of domestic secondary infections of COVID-19. We compared the models that have taken these effects into account or not, predicted the spread of the epidemic, and tried to compare different recommendations from 3 different models.","The primary responsibility of NRAs is to ensure the quality, safety, and effectiveness of pharmaceutical products. The implementation of a strong regulatory system will facilitate these goals, which are especially critical for vaccines that are inherently more difficult to develop, characterize, and manufacture than most pharmaceutical products. The FDA has developed a managed review process that provides regulatory oversight through all phases of vaccine development. Advances across a wide range of scientific disciplines have enhanced the preparations to treat certain complications of smallpox vaccination have been approved. There is one licensed anthrax vaccine in the United States, anthrax vaccine adsorbed (Emergent BioSolutions' BioThrax).","Lipoma is a benign tumor that occurs in older horses (10 to 26 years) and arises from mesenteric adipocytes. The tumor grows on a stalk that wraps around the intestine, causing a strangulating lesion manifested clinically by acute obstructive colic. Intestinal injury caused by pedunculated lipomata may occur in the small intestine, small colon, and rectum. Long-term survival with surgical resection and anastomosis of the affected segment has been reported to be 40% to 50%. 26, 74 ORAL NEOPLASIA Oral cavity neoplasia may involve the dental tissue (odontogenic tumors), bone (osteogenic tumors), or soft tissues (see Box 13.16-1). Ameloblastoma occurs in horses greater than 10 years old and mainly affects the mandible. Ameloblastic odontoma affects younger horses and usually involves the maxilla. Both are benign but locally invasive. Radiographs may distinguish the difference between an ameloblastoma (radiolucent lesion) and ameloblastic odontoma (radiolucent lesion with partially mineralized density). The best treatment option is surgical resection and radiation therapy regardless of the type. 48 Juvenile mandibular ossifying fibroma occurs in the rostral mandible of young horses between the ages of 2 months and 2 years. The fibroma may cause significant distortion of the bone. With early diagnosis and surgical excision of the mass, the horse has a good prognosis. 75 Melanomas, sarcoids, and oral papilloma occur on the mouth and lips. Melanomas rarely metastasize, but they commonly are found in the parotid salivary glands and lymph nodes. Sarcoids are the most common skin tumor that can involve the mouth. Ulcerations of the buccal mucosa are difficult to treat. Intralesional cisplatin, cryosurgery, radiation, and laser excision have been tried with limited success. 5 Equine papilloma virus is responsible for the common skin wart found on the lips and muzzle of young horses. These lesions are usually selflimiting but may be removed successfully by cryosurgery or excision.","The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . After visualizing the docked complexes carefully, we selected 15 drugs (Table 2) for further analysis. There are some differences between the conformations of the protein in the 3D similarity reference and 2GTB model. Therefore, we modelled 10 new homology models using the proteins in 3D similarity reference as templates and we redocked the 15 drugs to the 10 new homology models. 6 drugs (nelfinavir, pitavastatin, perampanel, praziquantel, zopiclone, and eszopiclone) show good docking scores and binding modes (Table 3) . Because eszopiclone and zopiclone was used to treat insomnia in a low dosage which may not be suitable to treat pneumonia, we carried out further binding free energy calculation for the rest 4 drugs. author/funder.

Globally, the amount of antibiotics used in food-producing animals surpasses the amount of antibiotics used to treat human disease. 450 The human health implications of this return to potentially untreatable gonorrhea and prompted changes in U.S. gonorrhea treatment guidelines to prolong the effectiveness of these drugs. 470, 471 Over the past 2 decades, highly drug-resistant strains of M. tuberculosis have also emerged worldwide, 472 including multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (defined as tuberculosis that is resistant to isoniazid and rifampin, the two most effective first-line tuberculosis drugs) and extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (defined as multidrug-resistant tuberculosis that is also resistant to any fluoroquinolone drug and at least one of three second-line injectable drugs: amikacin, kanamycin, or capreomycin). A survey of more than 25 international reference laboratories conducted by the WHO and CDC found that during 2000 to 2004, among 17,690 M. tuberculosis isolates, 20% were multidrug resistant and 2% were extensively drug resistant. 473 Although tuberculosis cases in the United States continue to decline, an estimated one third of the world's population is infected with M. tuberculosis, and each year approximately 9 million people develop tubercular disease and 2 million die from tuberculosis-related deaths. 474 These infections present serious public health challenges and raise the specter of virtually untreatable tuberculosis outbreaks. 475 Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae are also particularly alarming, with some showing resistance to all available antibiotics. 476, 477 These infections are primarily transmitted in health care settings and can be severe, with mortality rates of 40% to 50%. [478] [479] [480] Patients who require prolonged hospitalization and critically ill patients exposed to invasive medical devices (e.g., ventilators and central venous catheters) are at special risk. Resistance to carbapenem antibiotics is mediated through the production of carbapenemases (enzymes that inactivate carbapenems), including Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC), first identified in 2001 in the United States, 481 and New Delhi \u03b2-lactamase (NDM), first identified in 2008 in India. 482 The genes encoding KPC and NDM (carried on plasmids) have spread from K. pneumoniae to other gram-negative bacteria, including E. coli, Klebsi ella species, and Enterobacter species.","(61/63) over the follow-up period. Two patients, a 11-year old girl and her mother, maintained IgG and IgM-negative status during hospitalization, indicating that they did not undergo serological conversion during the observation period. Unfortunately, these two patients were lost for follow-up and the delayed seroconversion cannot be excluded. Serological courses could be followed for 27 patients who were initially seronegative and then underwent a seroconversion during the observation (IgG seroconversion in 19 patients, IgM seroconversion in 20 patients and both seroconversion in 13 patients). All these patients achieved a seroconversion of IgG or IgM within 20 days after symptoms onset. The median day of seroconversion for both lgG and IgM was 13 days (after symptoms onset) (Fig. 3A) . Three types of seroconversion can be observed: synchronous seroconversion of IgG and IgM (10 cases); IgM seroconverted earlier than that of IgG (7 cases); IgM seroconverted later than that of IgG (10 cases). The longitudinal changes of antibody in 6 representative patients of three types were shown in Fig. 3B-D and Fig. S2 . Based on this finding, we recommend that either IgM or IgG seroconversion be used as a confirmation criterion of recent SARS-CoV-2 infection. We tried to identify the factors associated with the different seroconversion types, but found no association between these types and age or gender or hospitalization time (data not shown)."],"title":["The outbreak of COVID-19: An overview","The outbreak of COVID-19: An overview","Clinical progression of patients with COVID-19 in Shanghai, China","Chloroquine and

In view of recent studies and discussion on chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), we aimed to review existing literature and relevant websites regarding these drugs and COVID-19, adverse effects related to drugs, and related guidelines. Aims and methods We systematically searched the PubMed database up till March 21, 2020 and retrieved all the articles published on chloroquine and HCQ and COVID-19. Results Two small human studies have been conducted with both these drugs in COVID-19, and have shown significant improvement in some parameters in patients with COVID-19. Conclusion Considering minimal risk upon use, a long experience of use in other diseases, cost-effectiveness and easy availability across India, we propose that both these drugs are worthy of fast track clinical trial for treatment, and may be carefully considered for clinical use as expe...","Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is caused by the SARS coronavirus (SCV). The disease appeared in the Guandong province of southern China in 2002. The epidemic affected &gt; 8422 patients and caused 908 deaths in 29 countries on 5 continents. Several treatment modalities were tried with limited success to treat SARS and a variety of experimental drugs are under development. Type I interferons (IFNs-\u03b1/\u03b2) were suggested as potential candidates to treat SARS. Several animal and human coronaviruses, including SCV, were shown to be sensitive to IFNs both in vitro and in vivo. A pilot clinical report showed effectiveness of IFN-\u03b1 for the treatment of SARS patients. This review summarises antiviral activities of IFNs with special regard to SARS, and reviews the published clinical and experimental data describing the use of IFNs for SARS.","Background: Coronavirus pandemic is currently a global public health emergency. At present, no pharmacological treatment is known to treat this condition, and there is a need to review the available treatments. Objective: While there have been studies to describe the role of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine in various viral conditions, there is limited information about the use of them in COVID-19. This systematic review aims to summarize the available evidence regarding the role of chloroquine in treating coronavirus infection. Methods: The preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines were used for this review. A literature search was performed using PUBMED &amp; Google Scholar to find articles about the role of CQ in COVID-19 patients. Results: We included 19 publications (Five published articles, three letters/correspondence, one commentary, five pre-proofs of accepted articles, one abstract of yet to be published article, and four were pre-pr...","As coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak, caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), started in China in January, 2020, repurposing approved drugs is emerging as important therapeutic options. We reported here the first clinical study using hepatitis C virus (HCV) protease inhibitor, danoprevir, to treat COVID-19 patients. Danoprevir (Ganovo) is a potent HCV protease (NS3/4A) inhibitor (IC50 = 0.29 nM), which was approved and marketed in China since 2018 to treat chronic hepatitis C patients. Ritonavir is a CYP3A4 inhibitor to enhance plasma concentration of danoprevir while it also acts as a human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) protease inhibitor at high doses. The chymotrypsin-like protease of SARS-CoV-2 shares structure similarity with HCV and HIV proteases. In the current clinical study (NCT04291729) conducted at the Nineth Hospital of Nanchang, we evaluated therapeutic effects of danoprevir, boosted by ritonavir, on treatment naive and experie...","Abstract The outbreak of the new coronavirus infections COVID-19 in December 2019 in China has quickly become a global health emergency. Given the lack of specific anti-viral therapies, the current management of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronaviruses (SARS-CoV-2) is mainly supportive, even though several compounds are now under investigation for the treatment of this life-threatening disease. COVID-19 pandemic is certainly conditioning the treatment strategy of a complex disorder as rheumatoid arthritis (RA), whose infectious risk is increased compared to the general population because of an overall impairment of immune system typical of autoimmune diseases combined with the iatrogenic effect generated by corticosteroids and immunosuppressive drugs. However, the increasing knowledge about the pathophysiology of SARS-CoV-2 infection is leading to consider some anti-rheumatic drugs as potential treatment options for the management of COVID-19. In this review we will critically a...","Abstract Aims A new human coronavirus (HCoV), which has been designated SARS-CoV-2, began spreading in December 2019 in Wuhan City, China causing pneumonia called COVID-19. The spread of SARS-CoV-2 has been faster than any other coronaviruses that have succeeded in crossing the animal-human barrier. There is concern that this new virus will spread around the world as did the previous two HCoVs\u2014Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS)\u2014each of which caused approximately 800 deaths in the years 2002 and 2012, respectively. Thus far, 11,268 deaths have been reported from the 258,842 confirmed infections in 168 countries. Main methods In this study, the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) of the newly emerged coronavirus is modeled, validated, and then targeted using different anti-polymerase drugs currently on the market that have been approved for use against various viruses. Key findings The results suggest the effectiveness of Ribavirin, Remde...","Background The novel coronavirus COVID19 has been classified by the World Health Organisation as a pandemic due to its worldwide spread. The ability of countries to contain and control transmission is critical in the absence of a vaccine. We evaluated a range of social distancing measures to determine which strategies are most effective in reducing the peak daily infection rate, and consequential pressure on the health care system. Methods Using COVID19 transmission data from the outbreak source in Hubei Province, China, collected prior to activation of containment measures, we adapted an established individual based simulation model of the city of Newcastle, Australia, population 272,409. Simulation of virus transmission in this community model without interventions provided a baseline from which to compare alternative social distancing strategies. The infection history of each individual was determined, as was the time infected. From this model generated data, the rate of growth in c...","COVID-19 is an emerging infectious disease and was recently declared as a pandemic by WHO. Currently, there is no vaccine or therapeutic available for this disease. Drug repositioning represents the only feasible option to address this global challenge and a panel of fifty FDA-approved drugs that have been pre-selected by an assay of SARS-CoV was screened to identify potential antiviral drug candidates against SARS-CoV-2 infection. We found a total of 24 drugs which exhibited antiviral efficacy (0.1 \u03bcM &lt; IC50 &lt; 10 \u03bcM) against SARS-CoV-2. In particular, two FDA-approved drugs \u2013 niclosamide and ciclesonide \u2013 were notable in some respects. These drugs will be tested in an appropriate animal model for their antiviral activities. In near future, these already FDA-approved drugs could be further developed following clinical trials in order to provide additional therapeutic options for patients with COVID-19.","AbstractSARS-CoV-2 emerged in China at the end of 2019 and has rapidly become a pandemic with over 400,000 recorded COVID-19 cases and greater than 19,000 recorded deaths by March 24th, 2020 (www.WHO.org) (1). There are no FDA approved antivirals or vaccines for any coronavirus, including SARS-CoV-2 (2). Current treatments for COVID-19 are limited to supportive therapies and off-label use of FDA approved drugs (3). Rapid development and human testing of potential antivirals is greatly needed. A potentially quicker way to test compounds with antiviral activity is through drug re-purposing (2, 4). Numerous drugs are already approved for use in humans and subsequently there is a good understanding of their safety profiles and potential side effects, making them easier to test in COVID-19 patients. Here, we present data on 20 FDA approved drugs tested for antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 that we have previously found to inhibit SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (4). We find that 17 of these also ...","Background: The SARS-CoV-2 shares 74.5% genome identity with SARS-CoV, both exhibiting a similar well conserved structure. Therefore, antibodies produced in COVID-19 and SARS patients should not be that dissimilar. We evaluated SARS-CoV test assays to detect for the presence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 and tried to determine the timing of appearance of these antibodies by testing serial sera from these patients. Methods: Tests were carried out using ELISA (total antibodies) and indirect immunofluorescence (IIFA) (IgM &amp; IgG) methods on serial sera from patients confirmed with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Results: Cross-reactivity was seen in these two test assays with sera from COVID-19 patients and was detected in 6 out of 7 patients from 7 days after onset of symptoms. Five of the patients had detectable antibodies by the 3rd week into their illness and there was evidence of seroconversion in 4 patients. The IIFA method was marginally more sensitive compared to the ELISA assay, however the I...","Background: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a global pandemic currently. Many drugs showed potential for COVID-19 therapy. However, genetic factors which can lead to different drug efficiency and toxicity among populations are still undisclosed in COVID-19 therapy. Methods: We selected 67 potential drugs for COVID-19 therapy (DCTs) from clinical guideline and clinical trials databases. 313 pharmaco-genes related to these therapeutic drugs were included. Variation information in 125,748 exomes were collected for racial differences analyses. The expression level of pharmaco-genes in single cell resolution was evaluated from single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data of 17 healthy adults. Results: Pharmacogenes, including CYP3A4, ABCB1, SLCO1B1, ALB, CYP3A5, were involved in the process of more than multi DCTs. 224 potential drug-drug interactions (DDI) of DCTs were predicted, while 112 of them have been reported. Racial discrepancy of common nonsynonymous mutations wa...","Today, small molecule antiviral drugs are available for the treatment of infections with herpesviruses, HIV, HBV and HCV as well as with influenza viruses. Ribavirin, a broad-spectrum (but aspecific) antiviral, has been approved for the treatment of infections with respiratory syncytial virus, HCV and Lassa virus. Yet, for many other viruses that cause life-threatening infections [most of which are considered emerging and/or neglected] there are no drugs available. Ideally, potent and broad-spectrum (i.e., pan-genus or pan-family virus activity) antiviral drugs should be developed whereby one drug could be used for the treatment of a number of such viral infections. We here review recent evolutions in the search for inhibitors of emerging and neglected RNA viruses.","Background: To identify safe and effective medical countermeasures (e.g., antivirals/antibodies) to address the current outbreak of a novel coronavirus (COVID-19) Methods: Comprehensive literature searches were developed by an experienced librarian for MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, and biorxiv.org/medrxiv.org; additional searches for ongoing trials and unpublished studies were conducted in clinicaltrials.gov and the Global Infectious Diseases and Epidemiology Network (GIDEON). Title/abstract and full-text screening, data abstraction, and risk of bias appraisal were carried out by single reviewers. Results: 54 studies were included in the review: three controlled trials, 10 cohort studies, seven retrospective medical record/database studies, and 34 case reports or series. These studies included patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARs, n=33), middle east respiratory syndrome (MERS, n=16), COVID-19 (n=3), and unspecified coronavirus (n=2). The most common treatment ...","Abstract In 2009, a novel H1N1 Influenza virus has emerged and on June 11 the World Health Organization declared it as pandemic. It may cause acute respiratory failure ranging from severe Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome to exacerbations of airflow limitation. Non-invasive ventilation is now considered first-line intervention for different causes of acute respiratory failure and may be considered in the context of H1N1 pandemic. Although infection control issues have been arisen, non-invasive ventilation was effective and safe during the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome in Asia. It is reasonable to recommend non-invasive ventilation in H1N1-related exacerbations of chronic respiratory diseases, especially in negative-pressure wards. Treatment of early Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome associated with H1N1 using non-invasive ventilation could be tried rapidly identifying those who fail without delaying endotracheal intubation. Considering the high demand for critical care beds dur...","Abstract In 2009, a novel H1N1 Influenza virus has emerged and on June 11 the World Health Organization declared it as pandemic.

There are currently no registered therapies for treating coronavirus infections. Because of time consuming process of new drug development, drug repositioning may be the only solution to the epidemic of sudden infectious diseases. We systematically analyzed all the proteins encoded by SARS-CoV-2 genes, compared them with proteins from other coronaviruses, predicted their structures, and built 19 structures that could be done by homology modeling. By performing target-based virtual ligand screening, a total of 21 targets (including two human targets) were screened against compound libraries including ZINC drug database and our own database of natural products. Structure and screening results of important targets such as 3-chymotrypsin-like protease (3CLpro), Spike, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), and papain like protease (PLpro) were discussed in detail. In addition, a database of 78 commonly u...","Abstract The pandemic outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is rapidly spreading all over the world. Reports from China showed that about 20% of patients developed severe disease, resulting in a fatality of 4%. In the past two months, we clinical immunologists participated in multi-rounds of MDT (multidiscipline team) discussion on the anti-inflammation management of critical COVID-19 patients, with our colleagues dispatched from Chinese leading PUMC Hospital to Wuhan to admit and treat the most severe patients. Here, from the perspective of clinical immunologists, we will discuss the clinical and immunological characteristics of severe patients, and summarize the current evidence and share our experience in anti-inflammation treatment, including glucocorticoids, IL-6 antagonist, JAK inhibitors and choloroquine/hydrocholoroquine, of patients with severe COVID-19 that may have an impaired immune system.","Abstract Aims A newly emerged Human Coronavirus (HCoV) is reported two months ago in Wuhan, China (COVID-19). Until today &gt;2700 deaths from the 80,000 confirmed cases reported mainly in China and 40 other countries. Human to human transmission is confirmed for COVID-19 by China a month ago. Based on the World Health Organization (WHO) reports, SARS HCoV is responsible for &gt;8000 cases with confirmed 774 deaths. Additionally, MERS HCoV is responsible for 858 deaths out of about 2500 reported cases. The current study aims to test anti-HCV drugs against COVID-19 RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). Materials and methods In this study, sequence analysis, modeling, and docking are used to build a model for Wuhan COVID-19 RdRp. Additionally, the newly emerged Wuhan HCoV RdRp model is targeted by anti-polymerase drugs, including the approved drugs Sofosbuvir and Ribavirin. Key findings The results suggest the effectiveness of Sofosbuvir, IDX-184, Ribavirin, and Remidisvir as potent drugs again...","A novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) originating in Wuhan, China presents a potential respiratory viral pandemic to the world population. Current efforts are focused on containment and quarantine of infected individuals. Ultimately, the outbreak could be controlled with a protective vaccine to prevent 2019-nCoV infection. While vaccine research should be pursued intensely, there exists today no therapy to treat 2019-nCoV upon infection, despite an urgent need to find options to help these patients and preclude potential death. Herein, I review the potential options to treat 2019-nCoV in patients, with an emphasis on the necessity for speed and timeliness in developing new and effective therapies in this outbreak. I consider the options of drug repurposing, developing neutralizing monoclonal antibody therapy, and an oligonucleotide strategy targeting the viral RNA genome, emphasizing the promise and pitfalls of these approaches. Finally, I advocate for the fastest strategy to develop a treat...","Abstract The latest advancements in drug development are structure-assisted and computer-aided identification, design, and synthesis of target-specific antiviral. Structural virology of animal viruses has made valuable contribution to our understanding of viruses in general, replication, evolution, and interaction with the host. Structure\u2013function relation studies are definitely the need of the hour for rational design of drugs and vaccines to effectively treat animal viral diseases. These studies are important for economical, veterinary, and human medical perspectives. X-ray crystallography, nuclear magnetic resonance and cryo-electron microscopy techniques elaborate the structure\u2013function relation studies by utilizing various computational approaches for structure-assisted designing of drug molecules and antiviral against viruses. Availability of protein three-dimensional structures, high-performance computing, data management software, and internet are enhancing the modern day drug ...","Abstract2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is a virus identified as the cause of the outbreak of pneumonia first detected in Wuhan, China. Investigations on the transmissibility, severity, and other features associated with this virus are ongoing. Currently, there is no vaccine or therapeutic antibody to prevent the infection, and more time is required to develop an effective immune strategy against the pathogen. In contrast, specific inhibitors targeting the key protease involved in replication and proliferation of the virus are the most effective means to alleviate the epidemic. The main protease of SARS-CoV is essential for the life cycle of the virus, which showed 96.1% of similarity with the main proteaseof 2019-nCoV, is considered to be an attractive target for drug development. In this study, we have identified 4 small molecular drugs with high binding capacity with SARS-CoV main protease by high-throughput screening based on the 8,000 clinical drug libraries, all these drugs ha...","The Eyrings rate process theory and free volume concept, two very popular theories in chemistry and physics fields, are employed to treat infectious disease transmissions. The susceptible individ- uals are assumed to move stochastically from one place to another. The virus particle transmission rate is assumed to obey the Eyring rate process theory and also controlled by how much free volume available in a system. The transmission process is considered to be a sequential chemical reaction, and the concentrations or fractions of four epidemiological compartments, the susceptible, the exposed, the infected, and the removed, can be derived and calculated. The obtained equations show that the basic reproduction number, R0, is not a constant, dependent on the volume frac- tion of virus particles, virus particle size, and virus particle packing structure, the energy barrier associated with susceptible individuals, and environment temperature. The developed models are applied to treat coronav...","Abstract2019-nCov has caused more than 80 deaths as of 27 January 2020 in China, and infection cases have been reported in more than 10 countries. However, there is no approved drug to treat the disease. 2019-nCov Mpro is a potential drug target to combat the virus. We built homology models based on SARS Mpro structures, and docked 1903 small molecule drugs to the models. Based on the docking score and the 3D similarity of the binding mode to the known Mpro ligands, 4 drugs were selected for binding free energy calculations. Both MM/GBSA and SIE methods voted for nelfinavir, with the binding free energy of \u221224.69\u00b10.52 kcal/mol and \u22129.42\u00b10.04 kcal/mol, respectively. Therefore, we suggested that nelfinavir might be a potential inhibitor against 2019-nCov Mpro.","AbstractWuhan coronavirus, called 2019-nCoV, is a newly emerged virus that infected more than 9692 people and leads to more than 213 fatalities by January 30, 2020. Currently, there is no effective treatment for this epidemic. However, the viral protease of a coronavirus is well-known to be essential for its replication and thus is an effective drug target. Fortunately, the sequence identity of the 2019-nCoV protease and that of severe-acute respiratory syndrome virus (SARS-CoV) is as high as 96.1%. We show that the protease inhibitor binding sites of 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV are almost identical, which means all potential anti-SARS-CoV chemotherapies are also potential 2019-nCoV drugs. Here, we report a family of potential 2019-nCoV drugs generated by a machine intelligence-based generative network complex (GNC). The potential effectiveness of treating 2019-nCoV by using some existing HIV drugs is also analyzed.","AbstractEmerging and re-emerging RNA viruses occasionally cause epidemics and pandemics worldwide, such as the on-going outbreak of coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. Existing direct-acting antiviral (DAA) drugs cannot be applied immediately to new viruses because of virus-specificity, and the development of new DAA drugs from the beginning is not timely for outbreaks. Thus, host-targeting antiviral (HTA) drugs have many advantages to fight against a broad spectrum of viruses, by blocking the viral replication and overcoming the potential viral mutagenesis simultaneously. Herein, we identified two potent inhibitors of DHODH, S312 and S416, with favorable drug-like and pharmacokinetic profiles, which all showed broad-spectrum antiviral effects against various RNA viruses, including influenza A virus (H1N1, H3N2, H9N2), Zika virus, Ebola virus, and particularly against the recent novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. Our results are the first to validate that DHODH is an attractive host target through high...","Traveller screening is being used to limit further spread of COVID-19 following its recent emergence, and symptom screening has become a ubiquitous tool in the global response. Previously, we developed a mathematical model to understand factors governing the effectiveness of traveller screening to prevent spread of emerging pathogens (Gostic et al., 2015). Here, we estimate the impact of different screening programs given current knowledge of key COVID-19 life history and epidemiological parameters. Even under best-case assumptions, we estimate that screening will miss more than half of infected people. Breaking down the factors leading to screening successes and failures, we find that most cases missed by screening are fundamentally undetectable, because they have not yet developed symptoms and are unaware they were exposed. Our work underscores the need for measures to limit transmission by individuals who become ill after being missed by a screening program. These findings can suppo...","As the number of novel coronavirus cases grows both inside and outside of China, public health authorities require evidence on the effectiveness of control measures such as thermal screening of arrivals at airports. We evaluated the effectiveness of exit and entry screening for 2019-nCoV infection. In our baseline scenario, we estimated that 46.5% (95%CI: 35.9 to 57.7) of infected travellers would not be detected, depending on the incubation period, sensitivity of exit and entry screening, and the proportion of cases which are asymptomatic. Airport screening is unlikely to detect a sufficient proportion of 2019-nCoV infected travellers to avoid entry of infected travellers. We developed an online tool so that results can be updated as new information becomes available.","AbstractThe infection of a novel coronavirus found in Wuhan of China (2019-nCoV) is rapidly spreading, and the incidence rate is increasing worldwide. Due to the lack of effective treatment options for 2019-nCoV, various strategies are being tested in China, including drug repurposing. In this study, we used our pretrained deep learning-based drug-target interaction model called Molecule Transformer-Drug Target Interaction (MT-DTI) to identify commercially available drugs that could act on viral proteins of 2019-nCoV. The result showed that atazanavir, an antiretroviral medication used to treat and prevent the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), is the best chemical compound, showing a inhibitory potency with Kd of 94.94 nM against the 2019-nCoV 3C-like proteinase, followed by efavirenz (199.17 nM), ritonavir (204.05 nM), and dolutegravir (336.91 nM). Interestingly, lopinavir, ritonavir, and darunavir are all designed to target viral proteinases. However, in our prediction, they may al...","Abstract The infection of a novel coronavirus found in Wuhan of China (SARS-CoV-2) is rapidly spreading, and the incidence rate is increasing worldwide.

Piperacillin-tazobactam is a frequently used therapy in critically ill patients with pulmonary infection. Antibiotic concentrations in the lung reflect target site antibiotic concentrations in patients with pneumonia. The aim of this study was to assess the plasma and intra-pulmonary pharmacokinetics (PK) of piperacillin-tazobactam in critically ill patients administered standard piperacillin-tazobactam regimens. A population PK model was developed to describe plasma and intra-pulmonary piperacillin and tazobactam concentrations. The probability of piperacillin exposures reaching pharmacodynamic endpoints and the impact of pulmonary permeability on piperacillin and tazobactam pulmonary penetration was explored. The median piperacillin and tazobactam pulmonary penetration ratio was 49.3% and 121.2%, respectively. Pulmonary piperacillin and tazobactam concentration were unpredicta...","The emergence of new pathogens, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and Ebola virus, poses serious challenges to global public health and highlights the urgent need for novel antiviral approaches. Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) have been successfully used to treat various diseases, particularly cancer and immunological disorders. Antigen-specific mAbs have been isolated using several different approaches, including hybridoma, transgenic mice, phage display, yeast display, and single B-cell isolation. Consequently, an increasing number of mAbs, which exhibit high potency against emerging viruses in vitro and in animal models of infection, have been developed. In this paper, we summarize historical trends and recent developments in mAb discovery, compare the advantages and disadvantages of various approaches to mAb production, and discuss the potential use of such strategies for the development of antivi...","BACKGROUND: Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is an emerging viral pathogen that causes severe morbidity and mortality. Up to date, there is no approved or licensed vaccine or antiviral medicines can be used to treat MERS-CoV-infected patients. Here, we analyzed the antiviral activities of resveratrol, a natural compound found in grape seeds and skin and in red wine, against MERS-CoV infection. METHODS: We performed MTT and neutral red uptake assays to assess the survival rates of MERS-infected Vero E6 cells. In addition, quantitative PCR, western blotting, and immunofluorescent assays determined the intracellular viral RNA and protein expression. For viral productivity, we utilized plaque assays to confirm the antiviral properties of resveratrol against MERS-CoV. RESULTS: Resveratrol significantly inhibited MERS-CoV infection and prolonged cellular survival after virus infection. We also found that the expression of nucleocapsid (N) protein essential for MERS-CoV...","Objective:To analyse the clinical features of COVID\u221219 parturients, and to compare anaesthetic regimen and clinical outcomes in parturients with or without COVID\u221219 undergoing cesarean delivery.Methods: Data were extracted from the electronic medical record of 3 medical institutions in Hubei Province, China, from June 1, 2019 to March 20, 2020 according to inclusion and exclusion criteria. After propensity score matching with demographics, the clinical and laboratory characteristics of parturients with or without COVID\u221219 were analysed. The anaesthetic regimen and clinical outcomes of themselves and their infants were compared in these two groups of parturients. Results: A total of 1,588 patients without SARS\u2212CoV\u22122 infection undergoing cesarean delivery were retrospectively included. After achieving a balanced cohort through propensity score matching, 89 patients (COVID\u221219 group), who were diagnosed with COVID\u221219 by SARS\u2212CoV\u22122 nucleic acid test and CT scan matched with 173 patients wit...","Abstract Bacterial pneumonia caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and Klebsiella pneumoniae represents a frequent cause of mortality worldwide. The increased incidence of pneumococcal diseases in both developed and developing countries is alarmingly high, affecting infants and aged adult populations. The growing rate of antibiotic resistance and biofilm formation on medical device surfaces poses a greater challenge for treating respiratory infections. Over recent years, a better understanding of bacterial growth, metabolism, and virulence has offered several potential targets for developing therapeutics against bacterial pneumonia. This chapter will discuss the current and developing trends in treating bacterial pneumonia.","AbstractAn epidemic can be characterized by its speed (i.e., the exponential growth rate r) and strength (i.e., the reproductive number \u211b). Disease modelers have historically placed much more emphasis on strength, in part because the effectiveness of an intervention strategy is typically evaluated on this scale. Here, we develop a mathematical framework for this classic, strength-based paradigm and show that there is a corresponding speed-based paradigm which can provide complementary insights. In particular, we note that r = 0 is a threshold for disease spread, just like \u211b = 1, and show that we can measure the speed and strength of an intervention on the same scale as the speed and strength of an epidemic, respectively. We argue that, just as the strength-based paradigm provides the clearest insight into certain questions, the speed-based paradigm provides the clearest view in other cases. As an example, we show that evaluating the prospects of \u201ctest-and-treat\u201d interventions against t...","Background: To control COVID\u221219 outbreak in Japan, sports and entertainment events were canceled in Japan for two weeks from 26 February to 11 March. It has been designated as voluntary event cancellation (VEC). Object: This study predicts the effectiveness of VEC enduring and after its implementation. Method: We applied a simple susceptible\u2212infected\u2212recovery model to data of patients with symptoms in Japan during 14 January to VEC introduction and after VEC introduction to 8 March. We adjusted the reporting delay in the latest few days. Results: Results suggest that the basic reproduction number, R0, before VEC introduced as 2.50 with a 95% confidence interval (CI) was [2.43, 2.55] and the effective reproduction number, Rv, after VEC introduced as 1. 88; its 95% CI was [1.68,2.02]. Discussion and Conclusion: Results demonstrated that VEC can reduce COVID\u221219 infectiousness by 35%, but R0 remains higher than one.","Background: To control COVID\u221219 outbreak in Japan, sports and entertainment events were canceled in Japan for two weeks from 26 February to 13 March.

There was also an intensive and very productive research effort to identify the aetiological agent, characterise the clinical and epidemiological features of the disease, understand the pathogenesis of the disease and the molecular biology of the virus, and design antiviral drugs and vaccines to treat and prevent the disease. In parallel with the SARS research effort there have been continuous improvements in our ability to detect and characterise other novel viruses. The SARS outbreak illustrates the importance of such detection tools in the response to public health threats. Studies since the SARS outbreak suggest that many novel viruses exist in animals and some, but probably not many, will present a risk to humans.","Abstract Introduction An epidemic of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) began in December 2019 in China leading to a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). Clinical, laboratory, and imaging features have been partially characterized in some observational studies. No systematic reviews on COVID-19 have been published to date. Methods We performed a systematic literature review with meta-analysis, using three databases to assess clinical, laboratory, imaging features, and outcomes of COVID-19 confirmed cases. Observational studies and also case reports, were included, and analyzed separately. We performed a random-effects model meta-analysis to calculate pooled prevalences and 95% confidence intervals (95%CI). Results 660 articles were retrieved for the time frame (1/1/2020-2/23/2020). After screening, 27 articles were selected for full-text assessment, 19 being finally included for qualitative and quantitative analyses. Additionally, 39 case report articles were incl...","ABSTRACT Treatment of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is experimental, and the effectiveness of ribavirin-steroid therapy is unclear. Forty SARS patients with progressive disease after ribavirin treatment and 1.5 g of pulsed methylprednisolone were given either convalescent plasma (n = 19) or further pulsed methylprednisolone (n = 21) in a retrospective non-randomised study. Good clinical outcome was defined as discharge by day 22 following the onset of symptoms. Convalescent plasma was obtained from recovered patients after informed consent. Patients in the plasma group had a shorter hospital stay (p 0.001) and lower mortality (p 0.049) than the comparator group. No immediate adverse effects were observed following plasma infusion.","The recent outbreak of a novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (also known as 2019-nCoV) threatens global health, given serious cause for concern. SARS-CoV-2 is a human-to-human pathogen that caused fever, severe respiratory disease and pneumonia (known as COVID-19). By press time, more than 70,000 infected people had been confirmed worldwide. SARS-CoV-2 is very similar to the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus broke out 17 years ago. However, it has increased transmissibility as compared with the SARS-CoV, e.g. very often infected individuals without any symptoms could still transfer the virus to others. It is thus urgent to develop a rapid, accurate and onsite diagnosis methods in order to effectively identify these early infects, treat them on time and control the disease spreading. Here we developed an isothermal LAMP based method-iLACO (isothermal LAMP based method for COVID-19) to amplify a fragment of the ORF1ab gene using 6 primers. We assured the species-specificity o...","The fourth outbreak of the Coronaviruses, known as the 2019-nCoV, has occurred in Wuhan city of Hubei province in China in December 2019. We propose a time-varying sparse vector autoregressive (VAR) model to retrospectively analyze and visualize the dyamic transmission routes of this outbreak in mainland China over January 31 - February 19, 2020. Our results demonstrate that the influential inter-province routes from Hubei have become unidentifiable since February 4, whereas the self-transmission in each province was accelerating over February 4-15. From February 16, all routes became less detectable, and no influential transmissions could be identified on February 18 and 19. Such evidence supports the effectiveness of government interventions, including the travel restrictions in Hubei. Implications of our results suggest that in addition to the origin of the outbreak, virus preventions are of crucial importance in provinces with the largest migrant workers percentages (e.g., Jiangxi,...","Objectives: To study the effectiveness of noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) in the treatment of acute respiratory failure (ARF) in severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), and the associated infection risk. Methods: All patients with the diagnosis of probable SARS admitted to a regional hospital in Hong Kong from March 9 to April 28, 2003, and who had SARS-related respiratory distress complications were recruited for NIPPV usage. The health status of all health-care workers working in the NIPPV wards was closely monitored, and consent was obtained to check serum for coronavirus serology. Patient outcomes and the risk of SARS transmission to health-care workers were assessed. Results: NIPPV was applied to 20 patients (11 male patients) with ARF secondary to SARS. Mean age was 51.4 years, and mean acute physiology and chronic health evaluation II score was 5.35. Coronavirus serology was positive in 95% (19 of 20 patients). NIPPV was started 9.6 days (mean) from symptom o...","The scientific community is focussed on developing antiviral therapies to mitigate the impacts of the ongoing novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak. This will be facilitated by improved understanding of viral dynamics within infected hosts. Here, using a mathematical model in combination with published viral load data collected from the same specimen (throat / nasal swabs or nasopharyngeal / sputum / tracheal aspirate), we compare within-host dynamics for patients infected in the current outbreak with analogous dynamics for MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV infections. Our quantitative analyses revealed that SARS-CoV-2 infection dynamics are more severe than those for mild cases of MERS-CoV, but are similar to severe cases, and that the viral dynamics of SARS-CoV infection are similar to those of MERS-CoV in mild cases but not in severe case. Consequently, SARS-CoV-2 generates infection dynamics that are more severe than SARS-CoV. Furthermore, we used our viral dynamics model to predict th...","Abstract Focused efforts by several international laboratories have resulted in the sequencing of the genome of the causative agent of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), novel coronavirus SARS-CoV, in record time. Using cumulative skew diagrams, I found that mutational patterns in the SARS-CoV genome were strikingly different from other coronaviruses in terms of mutation rates, although they were in general agreement with the model of the coronavirus lifecycle. These findings might be relevant for the development of sequence-based diagnostics and the design of agents to treat SARS.","We evaluated effectiveness of thermal passenger screening for 2019-nCoV infection at airport exit and entry to inform public health decision-making. In our baseline scenario, we estimated that 46% (95% confidence interval: 36 to 58) of infected travellers would not be detected, depending on incubation period, sensitivity of exit and entry screening, and proportion of asymptomatic cases. Airport screening is unlikely to detect a sufficient proportion of 2019-nCoV infected travellers to avoid entry of infected travellers.","Background The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was first reported in China, which caused a respiratory disease known as Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). Since its discovery, the virus has spread to over 100 countries and claimed more than 4000 deaths. This study aimed to assess the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of various response public health measures. Method The stochastic agent-based model was used to simulate the process of COVID-19 outbreak in scenario I (imported one case) and II (imported four cases) with a series of public health measures, involving the personal protection, isolation-and-quarantine, gathering restriction, and community containment. The virtual community was constructed following the susceptible-latent-infectious-recovered framework. The epidemiological and economic parameters derived from the previous literature and field investigation. The main outcomes included avoided infectors, cost-effectiveness ratios (CERs), and i...","Abstract On 10 January 2020, a new coronavirus causing a pneumonia outbreak in Wuhan City in central China was denoted as 2019-nCoV by the World Health Organization (WHO). As of 24 January 2020, there were 887 confirmed cases of 2019-nCoV infection, including 26 deaths, reported in China and other countries. Therefore, combating this new virus and stopping the epidemic is a matter of urgency. Here, we focus on advances in research and development of fast diagnosis methods, as well as potential prophylactics and therapeutics to prevent or treat 2019-nCoV infection.","The WHO has declared SARS-CoV-2 outbreak a public health emergency of international concern. However, to date, there was hardly any study in characterizing the immune responses, especially adaptive immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection. In this study, we collected blood from COVID-19 patients who have recently become virus-free and therefore were discharged, and analyzed their SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody and T cell responses. We observed SARS-CoV-2-specific humoral and cellular immunity in the patients. Both were detected in newly discharged patients, suggesting both participate in immune-mediated protection to viral infection. However, follow-up patients (2 weeks post discharge) exhibited high titers of IgG antibodies, but with low levels of virus-specific T cells, suggesting that they may enter a quiescent state. Our work has thus provided a basis for further analysis of protective immunity to SARS-CoV-2, and understanding the pathogenesis of COVID-19, especially in the severe ca..."],"title":["Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine in the treatment of COVID-19 with or without diabetes: A systematic search and a narrative review with a special reference to India and other developing countries","Role of interferons in the treatment of severe acute respiratory syndrome","Role of Chloroquine and Hydroxychloroquine in the Treatment of COVID-19 Infection- A Systematic Literature Review","First Clinical Study Using HCV Protease Inhibitor Danoprevir to Treat Naive and Experienced COVID-19 Patients","COVID-19 infection and rheumatoid arthritis: Faraway, so close!","Ribavirin, Remdesivir, Sofosbuvir, Galidesivir, and Tenofovir against SARS-CoV-2 RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp): A molecular docking study","The Effectiveness of Social Distancing in Mitigating COVID-19 Spread: a modelling analysis","Identification of antiviral drug candidates against SARS-CoV-2 from FDA-approved drugs","FDA approved drugs with broad anti-coronaviral activity inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro","Cross-reaction of sera from COVID-19 patients with SARS-CoV assays.","Genetic Profiles in Pharmacogenes Indicate Personalized Drug Therapy for COVID-19","Intervention strategies for emerging viruses: use of antivirals","Effectiveness and safety of antiviral or antibody treatments for coronavirus","H1N1 infection and acute respiratory failure: Can we give non-invasive ventilation a chance?","H1N1 infection and acute respiratory failure: can we give non-invasive ventilation a chance?","Analysis of therapeutic targets for SARS-CoV-2 and discovery of potential drugs by computational methods","The use of anti-inflammatory drugs in the treatment of people with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): The Perspectives of clinical immunologists from China","Anti-HCV, nucleotide inhibitors, repurposing against COVID-19","Therapeutic strategies in an outbreak scenario to treat the novel coronavirus originating in Wuhan, China","Chapter 19 Advances in structure-assisted antiviral discovery for animal viral diseases","Therapeutic Drugs Targeting 2019-nCoV Main Protease by High-Throughput Screening","Infection Dynamics of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (Covid-19) Modeled with the Integration of the Eyring Rate Process Theory and Free Volume Concept","Nelfinavir was predicted to be a potential inhibitor of 2019-nCov main protease by an integrative approach combining homology modelling, molecular docking and binding free energy calculation","Machine intelligence design of 2019-nCoV drugs","Novel and potent inhibitors targeting DHODH, a rate-limiting enzyme in de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis, are broad-spectrum antiviral against RNA viruses including newly emerged coronavirus SARS-CoV-2","Estimated effectiveness of symptom and risk screening to prevent the spread of COVID-19","Effectiveness of airport screening at detecting travellers infected with 2019-nCoV","Predicting commercially available antiviral drugs that may act on the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), Wuhan, China through a drug-target interaction deep learning model","Predicting commercially available antiviral drugs that may act on the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) through a drug-target interaction deep learning model","Pulmonary penetration of piperacillin and tazobactam in critically ill patients","Human monoclonal antibodies as candidate therapeutics against emerging viruses","Effective inhibition of MERS-CoV infection by resveratrol","Anaesthetic managment and clinical outcomes of parturients with COVID-19: a multicentre, retrospective, propensity score matched cohort study","Chapter 17 Current therapeutics and prophylactic approaches to treat pneumonia","Speed and strength of an epidemic intervention","Preliminary evaluation of voluntary event cancellation as a countermeasure against the COVID-19 outbreak in Japan as of 11 March, 2020","Insignificant effect of counter measure for coronavirus infectious disease -19 in Japan","Can early and high intravenous dose of vitamin C prevent and treat coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)?","Update on SARS research and other possibly zoonotic coronaviruses","Clinical, laboratory and imaging features of COVID-19: A systematic review and meta-analysis","Retrospective comparison of convalescent plasma with continuing high-dose methylprednisolone treatment in SARS patients","Rapid colorimetric detection of COVID-19 coronavirus using a reverse tran-scriptional loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) diagnostic plat-form: iLACO","How does the outbreak of 2019-nCoV spread in mainland China?
