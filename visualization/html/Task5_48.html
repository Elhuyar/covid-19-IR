Adequate understanding of the interplay between COVID-19 and CV disease is required for optimum management of these patients. Methods A literature search was done using PubMed and Google search engines to prepare a narrative review on this topic. Results Respiratory illness is the dominant clinical manifestation of COVID-19; CV involvement occurs much less commonly. Acute cardiac injury, defined as significant elevation of cardiac troponins, is the most commonly reported cardiac abnormality in COVID-19. It occurs in approximately 8-12% of all patients. Direct myocardial injury due to viral involvement of cardiomyocytes and the effect of systemic inflammation appear to be the most common mechanisms responsible for cardiac injury. The information about other CV manifestations in COVID-19 is very limited at...","Abstract Pneumonia appears to be the most manifestation of COVID 19, but some extra-pulmonary involvement such as gastrointestinal, cardiac and renal has been reported. According to limited clinical data about the virus behavior up to now, specially extra-pulmonary symptoms, we should be aware on possibility of initial cerebrovascular manifestations of COVID19.","Abstract Cardiac involvement has been reported in patients with COVID-19, which may be reflected by ECG changes. Two COVID-19 cases in our report exhibited different ECG manifestations as the disease caused deterioration. The first case presented temporary SIQIIITIII morphology followed by reversible nearly complete atrioventricular block, while the second demonstrated ST segment elevation accompanied by multifocal ventricular tachycardia. The underlying mechanisms of these electrocardiographic abnormalities in the severe stage of COVID-19 may be attributed to hypoxia and inflammatory damage incurred by the virus.","Background: Since the outbreak of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in China, respiratory manifestations of the disease have been observed. However, as a fatal comorbidity, acute myocardial injury (AMI) in COVID-19 patients has not been previously investigated in detail. We investigated the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients with AMI and determined the risk factors for AMI in them. Methods: We analyzed data from 53 consecutive laboratory-confirmed and hospitalized COVID-19 patients (28 men, 25 women; age, 19-81 years). We collected information on epidemiological and demographic characteristics, clinical features, routine laboratory tests (including cardiac injury biomarkers), echocardiography, electrocardiography, imaging findings, management methods, and clinical outcomes. Results: Cardiac complications were found in 42 of the 53 (79.25%) patients: tachycardia (n=15), electrocardiography abnormities (n=11), diastolic dysfunction (n=20), elevated myocardial enzymes (n=...","Abstract There was a major outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) affecting more than 300 patients occurring in a private housing estate in Hong Kong, in which an infected renal patient was suspected to be the primary source. It is unknown whether renal patients would represent a distinct group of patients who share some characteristics that could predispose them to have higher infectivity. In this context, we have encountered 4 dialysis patients contracting SARS in a minor outbreak, which involved 11 patients and 4 health care workers, in a medical ward of a regional hospital. Of these 4 dialysis patients, 1 patient was receiving hemodialysis while the other 3 patients were on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis. Fever and radiological changes were their dominant presenting features. All were having positive results for SARS-associated coronavirus ribonucleic acid by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction performed on their nasopharyngeal aspirates or stoo...","Abstract Objectives Following the public health emergency declared by the World Health Organization and the recent outbreak by 2019-nCoV in China and through other 29 countries, we aimed to summarize the clinical aspects of novel beta-coronavirus infection and its possible clinical presentations together with suggested therapeutic algorithms for patients who may require antibiotic treatment. Methods We reviewed the currently available literature of microbiologically confirmed infections by 2019-ConV (or COVID-19) occurred at the time of writing (13 February 2020). A literature search was performed using the PubMed database and the Cochrane library. Search terms included \"novel coronavirus\" or \"2019-nCoV\" or \u201cCOVID-19\u201d. Results Published cases occurred mostly in males (age ranged from 8 to 92). Cardiovascular, digestive and endocrine system diseases were commonly reported, except previous chronic pulmonary diseases (e.g., COPD, asthma, bronchiectasis) that were surprisingly underreporte...","Since December 2019, 62 medical staff of Zhongnan Hospital in Wuhan, China have been hospitalised with coronavirus disease 2019. During the post-discharge surveillance after clinical recovery, swabs were positive in two asymptomatic cases (3.23%). Case 1 had presented typical clinical and radiological manifestations on admission, while manifestation in Case 2 was very mild. In conclusion, a small proportion of recovered patients may test positive after discharge, and post-discharge surveillance and isolation need to be strengthened.","Tang JW, et al. and colleagues have written to this Journal describing the emergence of 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19).1 We have had an opportunity to examine in detail the chest computed tomography (CT) findings in cases with microbiologically confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, to familiarize radiologists and clinicians with the imaging manifestations of this new outbreak. Meanwhile, we also studied the clinical characteristics of the cases, combined with CT manifestations, to provide more clues for the correct diagnosis of the disease. Six female patients (P1-P6) aged from 27 to 63 years were referred to the fever clinic of our hospital. None of the patients had underlying diseases such as diabetes, malignant tumour or respiratory disease. Among the 6 cases, 5 (P1-P5) had a history of exposure to Wuhan or Hubei, and P6 had no clear epidemiological history. All the patients performed oropharyngeal swabs test and confirmed as CO...","Background A pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been spreading over the world. However, the viral dynamics, host serologic responses, and their associations with clinical manifestations, have not been well described in prospective cohort. Methods We conducted a prospective cohort and enrolled 67 COVID-19 patients admitting between Jan 26 and Feb 5, 2020. Clinical specimens including nasopharyngeal swab, sputum, blood, urine and stool were tested periodically according to standardized case report form with final follow-up on February 27. The routes and duration of viral shedding, antibody response, and their associations with disease severity and clinical manifestations were systematically evaluated. Coronaviral particles in clinical specimens were observed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Results The median duration of SARS-CoV-2 RNA shedding were 12 (3-38), 19 (5-37), and 18 (7-26) days i...","OBJECTIVE: To study the neurological manifestations of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). DESIGN: Retrospective case series SETTING: Three designated COVID-19 care hospitals of the Union Hospital of Huazhong University of Science and Technology in Wuhan, China.

Data were collected from 16 January 2020 to 19 February 2020. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Clinical data were extracted from electronic medical records and reviewed by a trained team of physicians. Neurological symptoms fall into three categories: central nervous system (CNS) symptoms or diseases (headache, dizziness, impaired consciousness, ataxia, acute cerebrovascular disease, and epilepsy), peripheral nervous system (PNS) symptoms (hypogeusia, hyposmia, hypopsia, and neuralgia), and skeletal muscular symptoms. Data of all neurological symptoms w...","Interstitial lung disease (ILD) comprises an array of heterogeneous parenchymal lung diseases that are associated with a spectrum of pathologic, radiologic, and clinical manifestations. There are ILDs with known causes and those that are idiopathic, making treatment strategies challenging. Prognosis can vary according to the type of ILD, but many exhibit gradual progression with an unpredictable clinical course in individual patients, as seen in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and the phenomenon of \u201cacute exacerbation\u201d(AE). Given the often poor prognosis of these patients, the search for a reversible cause of respiratory worsening remains paramount. Infections have been theorized to play a role in ILDs, both in the pathogenesis of ILD and as potential triggers of AE. Research efforts thus far have shown the highest association with viral pathogens; however, fungal and bacterial organisms have also been implicated. This review aims to summarize the current knowledge on the role of infecti...","Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), cause of the life-threatening atypical pneumonia, infects many organs, such as lung, liver and immune organ, and induces parenchyma cells apoptosis and necrosis. The genome of SARS-CoV, not closely related to any of the previously characterized coronavirus, encodes replicase and four major structural proteins and a number of non-structural proteins. Published studies suggest that some non-structural proteins may play important roles in the replication, virulence and pathogenesis of viruses. Among the potential SARS-CoV non-structural proteins, 3b protein (ORF4) is predicted encoding 154 amino acids, lacking significant similarities to any known proteins. Till now, there is no report about the function of 3b protein. In this study, 3b gene was linked with the EGFP tag at the C- terminus. Through cell cycle analysis, it was found that over-expression of 3b-EGFP protein in Vero, 293 and COS-7 cells could induce cell cycle arrest at...","The human coronavirus HCoV-19 infection can cause acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), hypercoagulability, hypertension, extrapulmonary multiorgan dysfunction. Effective antiviral and anti-coagulation agents with safe clinical profiles are urgently needed to improve the overall prognosis. We screened an FDA approved drug library and found that an anticoagulant agent dipyridamole (DIP) suppressed HCoV-19 replication at an EC50 of 100 nM in vitro. It also elicited potent type I interferon responses and ameliorated lung pathology in a viral pneumonia model. In analysis of twelve HCoV-19 infected patients with prophylactic anti-coagulation therapy, we found that DIP supplementation was associated with significantly increased platelet and lymphocyte counts and decreased D-dimer levels in comparison to control patients. Two weeks after initiation of DIP treatment, 3 of the 6 severe cases (60%) and all 4 of the mild cases (100%) were discharged from the hospital. One critically ill pat...","We investigated the clinical manifestations and course of all probable severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) patients in the Vietnam outbreak. Probable SARS cases were defined by using the revised World Health Organization criteria. We systematically reviewed medical records and undertook descriptive statistical analyses. All 62 patients were hospitalized. On admission, the most prominent symptoms were malaise (82.3%) and fever (79.0%). Cough, chest pain, and shortness of breath were present in approximately one quarter of the patients; 79.0% had lymphopenia; 40.3% had thrombocytopenia; 19.4% had leukopenia; and 75.8% showed changes on chest radiograph. Fever developed on the first day of illness onset, and both respiratory symptoms and radiographic changes occurred on day 4. On average, maximal radiographic changes were observed on day 10, and fevers subsided by day 13. Symptoms on admission were nonspecific, although fever, malaise, and lymphopenia were common. The complications o...","The COVID-19 pandemic demands assimilation of all available biomedical knowledge to decode its mechanisms of pathogenicity and transmission. Despite the recent renaissance in unsupervised neural networks for decoding unstructured natural languages, a platform for the real-time synthesis of the exponentially growing biomedical literature and its comprehensive triangulation with deep omic insights is not available. Here, we present the nferX platform for dynamic inference from over 45 quadrillion possible conceptual associations extracted from unstructured biomedical text, and their triangulation with Single Cell RNA-sequencing based insights from over 25 tissues (https://academia.nferx.com/). Using this platform, we identify intersections between the pathologic manifestations of COVID-19 and the comprehensive expression profile of the SARS-CoV-2 receptor ACE2. We find that tongue keratinocytes, airway club cells, and ciliated cells are likely under-appreciated targets of SARS-CoV-2 infe...","Background: The outbreaks of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) remain a huge threat to the public health worldwide. Clinical data is limited up to now regarding the risk factors in favor of severe conversion of non-severe case with COVID-19. Aims: This study analyzed a hospital staff data to figure out general clinical features of COVID-19 in terms of the association of cardiovascular manifestations (CVMs) with in-hospital outcomes of COVID-19 cases. Methods: Retrospective, single-center case series of 41 consecutive hospitalized health staff with confirmed COVID-19 were collected at the Central Hospital of Wuhan in Wuhan, China, from January 15 to January 24, 2020. Epidemiological, demographic, clinical, laboratory, radiological, treatment data and in-hospital adverse events were collected and analyzed. Final date of follow-up was March 3, 2020. A comparative study was applied between cases with CVMs an...","The capacity to injure infected cells is a widespread property of viruses. Usually, this cytopathic effect (CPE) is ascribed to viral hijacking of cellular resources to fulfill viral needs. However, evidence is accumulating that CPE is not necessarily directly coupled to viral reproduction but may largely be due to host defensive and viral antidefensive activities. A major part in this virus\u2013cell interaction appears to be played by a putative host-encoded program with multiple competing branches, leading to necrotic, apoptotic, and, possibly, other types of cell suicide. Manifestations of this program are controlled and modulated by host, viral, and environmental factors.","Summary The harrowing picture of emaciated terminally ill AIDS patients is a reminder of our lack of understanding of immunological mechanisms that normally control opportunistic infections. Many gastrointestinal pathogens in patients with AIDS are resistant to treatment and lead inexorably to weight loss and death. Although knowledge of the pathogenesis and clinical significance of weight loss has improved considerably, this has not yet led to a sustained effort to improve nutritional status during early stages of disease.","Summary Background Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) is a new human disease caused by a novel coronavirus (CoV). Clinical data on MERS-CoV infections are scarce. We report epidemiological, demographic, clinical, and laboratory characteristics of 47 cases of MERS-CoV infections, identify knowledge gaps, and define research priorities. Methods We abstracted and analysed epidemiological, demographic, clinical, and laboratory data from confirmed cases of sporadic, household, community, and health-care-associated MERS-CoV infections reported from Saudi Arabia between Sept 1, 2012, and June 15, 2013. Cases were confirmed as having MERS-CoV by real-time RT-PCR. Findings 47 individuals (46 adults, one child) with laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV disease were identified; 36 (77%) were male (male:female ratio 3\u00b73:1). 28 patients died, a 60% case-fatality rate. The case-fatality rate rose with increasing age. Only two of the 47 cases were previously healthy; most patients (45 [96%]) had underl...","Abstract To investigate the ocular manifestations of patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and to monitor the possible ocular complications arising from the treatment regimen with high-dose systemic corticosteroid drugs. Design Prospective, observational cohort case series. Methods Ninety eyes from 45 patients with the diagnosis of SARS during an epidemic outbreak in Hong Kong were analyzed. Relevant medical and ophthalmic histories were taken. Ophthalmic examinations, including best-corrected visual acuity, intraocular pressure, slit-lamp, and indirect ophthalmoscopy examination, were performed at baseline and at 2-month and 3-month follow-up. Setting Faculty practice in university hospital. Results Only two patients had mild elevated intraocular pressure at baseline and at subsequent follow-up. There was no loss of visual acuity, cataract progression, or increased cup\u2013disk ratio. Fundus examinations were unremarkable in all patients. Conclusions Our study did not dem...","","BACKGROUND: A novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) causing an outbreak of pneumonia in Wuhan, Hubei province of China was isolated in January 2020. This study aims to investigate its epidemiologic history, and analyzed the clinical characteristics, treatment regimens, and prognosis of patients infected with 2019-nCoV during this outbreak. METHODS: Clinical data from 137 2019-nCoV-infected patients admitted to the respiratory departments of nine tertiary hospitals in Hubei province from December 30, 2019 to January 24, 2020 were collected, including general status, clinical manifestations, laboratory test results, imaging characteristics, and treatment regimens. RESULTS: None of the 137 patients (61 males, 76 females, aged 20-83 years, mean age 55 \u00b1 16 years) had a definite history of exposure to Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market. Major initial symptoms included fever (112/137, 81.8%), coughing (66/137, 48.2%), and muscle pain or fatigue (44/137, 32.1%), with other, less typical initial symptoms...","BACKGROUND: The Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) is proposed to be a zoonotic disease. Dromedary camels have been implicated due to reports that some confirmed cases were exposed to camels. Risk factors for MERS coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infections in humans are incompletely understood. This study aimed to describe the demographic characteristics, mortality rate, clinical manifestations and comorbidities with confirmed cases of MERS-CoV. METHODS: Retrospective chart review were performed to identify all laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS-CoV in Saudi Arabia who reported to the Ministry of Health (MOH) of Saudi Arabia and WHO between April 23, 2014 and August 31, 2015. Patients\u2019 charts were also reviewed for demographic information, mortality, comorbidities, clinical presentations, health care facility and presented with descriptive and comparative statistics using non parametric binomial test and Chi-square test. RESULTS: Confirmed cases of male patients (61.1%) exceeded those of f...","Abstract In August 2015, the Corona outbreak caused by Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) was the 9th episode since June 2012 in Saudi Arabia. Little is known about the public awareness toward the nature or prevention of the disease. The aim of this work was to assess the knowledge of the adult population in Riyadh toward the MERS-CoV. In this cross-sectional survey, a self-administrated questionnaire was distributed to randomly selected participants visiting malls in Riyadh. The questionnaire contained measurable epidemiological and clinical MERS-CoV knowledge level variables and relevant source of information. The study included 676 participants. Mean age was 32.5 (\u00b1SD 8.6) years and 353 (47.8%) were males. Almost all participants heard about the corona disease and causative agent. The study showed a fair overall knowledge (66.0%), less knowledge on epidemiological features of the disease (58.3%), and good knowledge (90.7%) on the clinical manifestation of the ME...","Abstract We argue that enhanced Traffic Control Bundling (eTCB) can interrupt the community-hospital-community transmission cycle, thereby limiting COVID-19\u2019s impact. Enhanced TCB is an expansion of the traditional TCB that proved highly effective during Taiwan\u2019s 2003 SARS outbreak. TCB\u2019s success derived from ensuring that Health Care Workers (HCWs) and patients were protected from fomite, contact and droplet transmission within hospitals. Although TCB proved successful during SARS, achieving a similar level of success with the COVID-19 outbreak requires adapting TCB to the unique manifestations of this new disease. These manifestations include asymptomatic infection, a hyper-affinity to ACE2 receptors resulting in high transmissibility, false negatives, and an incubation period of up to 22 days. Enhanced TCB incorporates the necessary adaptations. In particular, eTCB includes expanding the TCB transition zone to incorporate a new sector \u2013 the quarantine ward. This ward houses patients...","Abstract Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is an acute respiratory disease with significant morbidity and mortality. While its clinical manifestations have been extensively studied, its pathogenesis is not yet fully understood. A limited number of autopsy studies have revealed that the lungs and the immune system are the organs that sustain the most severe damage. Other organs affected include the kidneys, brain, digestive tract, heart, liver, thyroid gland and urogenital tract. The primary target cells are pneumocytes and enterocytes, both cell types abundantly expressing angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 which is the main SARS-CoV receptor. Other cell types infected include the epithelial cells of renal tubules, cerebral neurons, and immune cells. The pathology of this disease results from both direct and indirect injury. Direct injury is caused by infection of the target cells by the virus. Indirect injury mainly results from immune responses, circulatory dysfunction, and hypox...","Abstract Purpose We aimed to compare chest HRCT lung signs identified in scans of differently aged patients with COVID-19 infections. Methods Case data of patients diagnosed with COVID-19 infection in Hangzhou City, Zhejiang Province in China were collected, and chest HRCT signs of infected patients in four age groups (&lt;18 years, 18\u201344 years, 45\u201359 years, \u226560 years) were compared. Results Small patchy, ground-glass opacity (GGO), and consolidations were the main HRCT signs in 98 patients with confirmed COVID-19 infections. Patients aged 45\u201359 years and aged \u226560 years had more bilateral lung, lung lobe, and lung field involvement, and greater lesion numbers than patients &lt;18 years. GGO accompanied with the interlobular septa thickening or a crazy-paving pattern, consolidation, and air bronchogram sign were more common in patients aged 45\u201359 years, and \u226560 years, than in those aged &lt;18 years, and aged 18\u201344 years. Conclusions Chest HRCT manifestations in patients with COVID-19 are relate...","Tang and colleagues, in this Journal, drew readers attention to emerging COVID19.1 We focused on the pregnant COVID19 patients. Given the maternal physiologic and immune function changes in pregnancy,2 pregnant individuals might face greater risk of getting infected by SARS-CoV-2 and might have more complicated clinical events. We described epidemiological, clinical characteristics, pregnancy and perinatal outcomes of all hospitalized pregnant patients diagnosed with COVID-19 in China. We identified all hospitalized pregnant patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection between December 8, 2019, and February 25, 2020 officially reported by the central government, in areas outside Wuhan, China. Information including age, geographic location, epidemiological history, prenatal course, maternal and newborn hospital course, discharge data and outcome were obtained by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and Local Health Commission. When necessary, we attempted to contact loc...","Abstract Multiple sclerosis is a chronic disease that begins in late adolescence or adulthood. It is highly variable in its expression and severity. It is believed to be autoimmune in nature. The cause is unknown; both genetic and environmental factors have been implicated in the pathogenesis. MS generally presents with the acute or subacute onset of neurologic abnormalities that may wax and wane over many years. Diagnosis is generally made by means of observation of the clinical course in conjunction with a neurologic examination and laboratory tests. These tests may include magnetic resonance imaging of the head and spine, lumbar puncture, and evoked potentials. Treatment is based on general supportive care, the use of corticosteroids for relapses, and symptomatic management of ongoing problems. The frequency of relapses can be reduced with interferon-\u03b2 (Betaseron). Copolymer 1 and interferon-\u03b2 la are being evaluated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for approval for use for r...","Abstract First reported in September 2012, the Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) has resulted in 206 laboratory-confirmed deaths, with a 42% mortality rate as of 27 March 2014. Closely related coronaviruses have been isolated in bats, but most evidence suggests that humans have become infected directly from camels in a number of separate transmission events, with limited human-to-human transmission reported thus far. The majority of cases originated in the Middle East (predominantly Saudi Arabia), including all the index cases. Clinical manifestations primarily involve fever, chills, and rapidly progressive respiratory failure, often resulting in an acute respiratory distress syndrome, with a minority of patients reporting gastrointestinal symptoms, as well. The majority of critically ill patients are older males with medical co-morbidities, and a large number of minimally symptomatic cases likely go undetected. Unfortunately, attempted therapies have all been ...","Abstract Background and Aims Multiple issues in management of COVID have emerged, but confusion persists regarding rational interpretation. Aim of this brief review is to review these issues based on current literature. Methods This is a narrative review with Pubmed and Google Scholar search till 23 March 2020. Search terms were, COVID-19, treatment of coronavirus, COVID 19 and following terms; chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, ibuprofen, ACE-inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers, cardiovascular disease, diarrhoea, liver, testis and gastrointestinal disease. Results We discuss evidence regarding role of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine in treatment and prophylaxis, use of inhibitors of the renin angiotensin system, safety of ibuprofen, unusual clinical features like gastrointestinal symptoms and interpretation of tests for cardiac enzymes and biomarkers. Conclusions While our conclusions on management of COVID-19 patients with co-morbidities are based on current evidence, howeve...","Abstract Purpose To report CT features of coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) in patients with various disease severity. Methods The CT manifestations and clinical data of 73 patients with COVID-19 were retrospectively collected in 6 hospitals from Jan 21 to Feb 3, 2020. We analyzed the initial and follow-up CT features of patients with disease severity, according to the Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Treatment of New Coronavirus Pneumonia. Results Six patients (8%) were diagnosed as mild type pneumonia; these patients had no obvious abnormal CT findings or manifested mild changes of lung infection. All 43 patients (59 %) with common type presented unique or multiple ground-glass opacities (GGO) in the periphery of the lungs, with or without interlobular septal thickening. In the 21 patients (29 %) with severe type, extensive GGO and pulmonary consolidation were found in 16 cases (16/21, 76 %) and 5 cases (24 %), respectively. An extensive \"white lung\", with atelectasis and pleural e...","Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is an emerging infectious viral disease characterized by severe clinical manifestations of the lower respiratory tract. The pathogenesis of SARS is highly complex, with multiple factors leading to severe injury in the lungs and dissemination of the virus to several other organs. The SARS coronavirus targets the epithelial cells of the respiratory tract, resulting in diffuse alveolar damage. Several organs/cell types may be infected in the course of the illness, including mucosal cells of the intestines, tubular epithelial cells of the kidneys, neurons of the brain, and several types of immune cells, and certain organs may suffer from indirect injury. Extensive studies have provided a basic understanding of the pathogenesis of this disease. In this review we describe the most significant pathological features of SARS, explore the etiological factors causing these pathological changes, and discuss the major pathogenetic mechanisms. The latter incl...","Systemic feline diseases (parasitic, bacterial, fungal, viral, neoplastic, metabolic, vascular, and immune-mediated) are often associated with ocular symptoms. An ocular examination is an important diagnostic tool and should be part of any physical examination. Conversely, cats afflicted with systemic disease require periodic ocular examinations for prognostic information and to prevent vision threatening complications. Typical feline systemic diseases encountered by the practicing clinician are presented with their commonly associated ocular signs.","Publisher Summary Kawasaki disease (KD) is an acute febrile systemic vasculitis usually occurring in children younger than five years, and rarely reported in neonates and adults. This chapter discusses the epidemiology, etiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and treatments of KD. The etiology still remains unknown, although epidemiological and clinical features strongly suggest an infectious cause. Immunological abnormalities in the acute phase of the disease reflect activation of immune system and marked production of cytokines by activated cells. KD has some similarities to toxin-mediated diseases, both from a clinical and an immunological point of view. The role of one or more superantigens competent of stimulating large numbers of T cells produced by certain strains of Staphylococcus or Streptococcus is discussed in the chapter, in the context of the etiology of KD. Atypical cases are those with fever, acute surgical symptoms, or neurological manifestations as presenting ...","Background We aimed to investigate the frequency of standard precautions (SPs) compliance and the factors affecting the compliance among nursing students (NSs). Methods A cross-sectional survey study guided by the health belief model was conducted in 2009. The study questionnaire is valid (content validity index, 0.81) and reliable (Cronbach \u03b1 range, 0.65-0.94). Results There were 678 questionnaires analyzed, with a response rate of 68.9%. The mean frequency score of SPs compliance was 4.38 \u00b1 0.40 out of 5. Tukey honest significant difference post hoc test indicated that year 2 and year 4 students had better SPs compliance than year 3 students. Further analysis using a univariate general linear model identified an interaction effect of perceived influence of nursing staff and year of study (F1,593 = 3.72; P &lt; .05). The 5 following predictors for SPs compliance were identified: knowledge of SPs, perceived barriers, adequacy of training, management support, and influence of nursing staff...","","Abstract SARS is a new infection in human. Patients recovering from SARS had palpitation in the form of sinus tachycardia. This study to identify the possible causes for the tachycardia excluded active disease, thyroid dysfunction, haematological, cardiac, autonomic and significant pulmonary defect at 2 months from onset of disease. The symptomatology was attributed to physical deconditioning and anxiety state. Physical and psychological fitness should be restored with rehabilitation.","","The COVID-19 epidemic in China has been effectively controlled. It is of great significance to study the law of cross-regional spread of the epidemic, for the prevention and control of the COVID-19 in the future in China and other countries or regions. In this study, the cross-regional connection intensity between cities was characterized based on the probability and the effective distance of the shortest path tree, and the empirical analysis was carried out based on the high-frequency data such as the cases of COVID 19 outbreaks. It is concluded that the higher the intensity of inter-city connection, the larger scale the cross-regional spread of the epidemic.","Purpose To investigate the epidemiology and clinical features of discharged adult patients with COIVD-19 in Yichang. Method The retrospective study recruited 197 cases of COIVD-19 discharged from Yichang Central People's Hospital and Yichang Third People's Hospital from Jan 17 to Feb 26, 2020. All cases were confirmed by real-time RT-PCR or chest computer tomography (CT).The survivors were followed up until March 4,2020. Clinical data, including demographic characteristic, presentation, exposure history, laboratory examination, radiology and prognosis were enrolled and analyzed by SPSS 19.0 software. Results There were 197 adult discharged patients with COIVD-19 in this study. Statistical analysis indicated that the average age was 55.94 years, and female patients were 50.3%. Those patients mainly resided in urban with exposure history in 2 weeks. Fever, cough and weakness were the common symptoms. Leucocytes were mainly normal or decreased in 185 patents, both lymphocytes and eosinoph...","More than 50 emerging and reemerging pathogens have been identified during the last 40 years. Until 1992 when the Institute of Medicine issued a report that defined emerging infectious diseases, medicine had been complacent about such infectious diseases despite the alarm bells of infections with human immunodeficiency virus. Molecular tools have proven useful in discovering and characterizing emerging viruses and bacteria such as Sin Nombre virus (hantaviral pulmonary syndrome), hepatitis C virus, Bartonella henselae (cat scratch disease, bacillary angiomatosis), and Anaplasma phagocytophilum (human granulocytotropic anaplasmosis). The feasibility of applying molecular diagnostics to dangerous, fastidious, and uncultivated agents for which conventional tests do not yield timely diagnoses has achieved proof of concept for many agents, but widespread use of cost-effective, validated commercial assays has yet to occur. This review presents representative emerging viral respiratory infect...","Abstract There is a current worldwide outbreak of the novel coronavirus Covid-19 (coronavirus disease 2019; the pathogen called SARS-CoV-2; previously 2019-nCoV), which originated from Wuhan in China and has now spread to 6 continents including 66 countries, as of 24:00 on March 2, 2020. Governments are under increased pressure to stop the outbreak spiraling into a global health emergency. At this stage, preparedness, transparency, and sharing of information are crucial to risk assessments and beginning outbreak control activities. This information should include reports from outbreak site and from laboratories supporting the investigation. This paper aggregates and consolidates the epidemiology, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, treatments and preventions of this new type of coronavirus.","Abstract Covid-19 is a global pandemic that is wreaking havoc with the health and economy of much of human civilization. Electrophysiologists have been impacted personally and professionally by this global catastrophe. In this joint document from representatives of the HRS, ACC and AHA we identify the potential risks of exposure to patients, allied health care staff, industry representatives and hospital administrators. We describe the impact of COVID-19 on cardiac arrhythmias and methods of triage based on acuity and patient comorbidities. We provide guidance for managing invasive and non-invasive electrophysiology procedures, clinic visits and cardiac device interrogations. We discuss resource conservation and the role of tele-medicine in remote patient care along with management strategies for affected patients.","Background: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a newly identified pathogen which mainly spreads by droplets. Most published studies focused on adult patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), but data concerning pediatric patients is limited. This study aimed to determine epidemiological characteristics and clinical features of pediatric patients with COVID-19. Methods: We reviewed and analyzed data on pediatric patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19, including basic information, epidemiological history, clinical manifestations, laboratory and radiologic findings, treatment, outcome and follow-up results. Results: From January 20th to February 27th of 2020, a total of 74 pediatric patients with COVID-19 were included in this study. Of the 68 cases whose epidemiological data were complete, 65 (65/68, 95.59%) cases were household contacts of adults whose symptoms developed earlier. Forty (59.46%) of the infected children were male, and the median...","Objective: To investigate the correlation between clinical characteristics and cardiac injury of COVID-2019 pneumonia. Methods: In this retrospective, single-center study, 41 consecutive corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-2019) patients (including 2 deaths) of COVID-2019 in Beijing Youan Hospital, China Jan 21 to Feb 03, 2020, were involved in this study. The high risk factors of cardiac injury in different COVID-2019 patients were analyzed. Computed tomographic (CT) imaging of epicardial adipose tissue (EAT) has been used to demonstrate the cardiac inflammation of COVID-2019. Results\uff1aOf the 41 COVID-2019 patients, 2 (4.88%), 32 (78.05%), 4 (9.75%) and 3 (7.32%) patients were clinically diagnosed as light, mild, severe and critical cases, according to the 6th guidance issued by the National Health Commission of China. 10 (24.4%) patients had underlying complications, such as hypertension, CAD, type 2 diabetes mellites and tumor. The peak value of TnI in critical patients is 40-fold more ...","The Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) is a new human disease caused by a novel coronavirus (CoV). The disease is reported mainly in adults. Data in children are scarce. The disease caused by MERS-CoV in children presents with a wide range of clinical manifestations, and it is associated with a lower mortality rate compared with adults. Poor outcome is observed mainly in admitted patients with medical comorbidities. We report a new case of MERS-CoV infection in a 9-month-old child complicated by severe respiratory symptoms, multi-organ dysfunction, and death. We reviewed the literature in an attempt to characterize the mode of presentation, the risk factors, and outcome of MERS-CoV infection in the pediatric population.","Abstract Background Little is known about COVID-19 outside Hubei. The aim of this paper was to describe the clinical characteristics and imaging manifestations of hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection in Wenzhou, Zhejiang, China. Methods In this retrospective cohort study, 149 RT-PCR confirmed positive patients were consecutively enrolled from January 17th to February 10th, 2020 in three tertiary hospitals of Wenzhou. Outcomes were followed up until Feb 15th, 2020. Findings A total of 85 patients had Hubei travel/residence history, while another 49 had contact with people from Hubei and 15 had no traceable exposure history to Hubei. Fever, cough and expectoration were the most common symptoms, 14 patients had decreased oxygen saturation, 33 had leukopenia, 53 had lymphopenia, and 82 had elevated C-reactive protein. On chest computed tomography (CT), lung segments 6 and 10 were mostly involved. A total of 287 segments presented ground glass opacity, 637 presented mixed...","For an emergent disease, such as Covid-19, with no past epidemiological data to guide models, modelers struggle to make predictions of the course of the epidemic (1). Policy decisions depend on such predictions but they vary widely. On the other hand much empirical information is already contained in the data of evolving epidemiological profiles. We show, both with evidence from data, and theoretically, how the ratio of daily infected and recovered cases can be used to track and predict the course of the epidemic. Ability to predict the turning points and the end of the epidemic is of crucial importance for fighting the epidemic and planning for a return to normalcy. The accuracy of the prediction of the peaks of the epidemic is validated using data in different regions in China showing the effects of different levels of quarantine. The validated tool can be applied to other countries where Covid-19 has spread, and generally to future epidemics. A preliminary prediction for South Korea...","AIM To investigate the characteristics and clinical value of chest computed tomography (CT) images of novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP). MATERIALS AND METHODS Clinical data and CT images of 80 cases of NCP were collected. The clinical manifestations and laboratory test results of the patients were analysed. The lesions in each lung segment of the patient's chest CT images were characterised. Lesions were scored according to length and diffusivity. RESULTS The main clinical manifestations were fever, dry cough, fatigue, a little white sputum, or diarrhoea. A total of 1,702 scored lesions were found in the first chest CT images of 80 patients. The lesions were located mainly in the subpleural area of the lungs (92.4%). Most of the lesions were ground-glass opacity, and subsequent fusions could increase in range and spread mainly in the subpleural area. Pulmonary consolidation accounted for 44.1% of all of the lesions. Of the 80 cases, 76 patients (95%) had bilateral lung disease, four (5..."],"title":["Cardiovascular disease and COVID-19","COVID 19 and Intra cerebral hemorrhage: Causative or

manifestations of viral infection are an important cause of morbidity, and range from seizures to cardiac arrest [141] [142] [143] .","Abstract: Pneumonia appears to be the most manifestation of COVID 19, but some extrapulmonary involvement such as gastrointestinal, cardiac and renal has been reported. According to limited clinical data about the virus behavior up to now, specially extra-pulmonary symptoms, we should be aware on possibility of initial cerebrovascular manifestations of COVID19.","In addition to upper and lower respiratory tract disease, extrapulmonary manifestations were also reported for SARS. These included liver and renal impairment (Chau et al., 2004; Chu et al., 2005c) , bradycardia and hypotension due to diastolic cardiac dysfunction , pulmonary arterial thrombosis , rhabdomyolysis (Wang et al., 2003b) , neuromuscular disorder (Tsai et al., 2004) , and an acute neurological syndrome with status epilepticus (Lau et al., 2004d) . Lymphopenia, leucopenia, thrombocytopenia were commonly observed .","ACE-2 receptor, the binding site for SARS CoV-2 is expressed in several extrapulmonary locations, the chief amongst them being the gastrointestinal epithelium, renal tubules and Leydig cells in testis 31 . This raises concerns about some of the extrapulmonary manifestations and possible complications.","The course and outcome in people with anorexia nervosa is variable. Some fully recover after a single episode (50% achieve normal weight); some have a fluctuating pattern of weight gain and relapse. However, others experience a chronically deteriorating illness over many years. The mortality rate is about 12 times higher than the population with normal weight -cardiac arrest, electrolyte imbalance, or suicide are the main causes. Bulimia Patients with bulimia have a poor prognosis, because of severe psychiatric disturbances. Complications include aspiration, oesophageal or gastric rupture, hypokalaemia, cardiac arrhythmias, pancreatitis and cardiomyopathy. About 40% of patients remain bulimic after treatment and recurrences are frequent. Bulimic patients have a high suicide rate.","Based on clinical reports of COVID-19, patients with severe ALI/ARDS may also have an increased risk of sepsis and cardiac arrest [2] . Published reports indicate that the application of melatonin may ameliorate the septic shock via the NLRP3 pathway [63] . Specifically, melatonin may a have preventive effect against sepsis-induced renal injury, septic cardiomyopathy and liver injury J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f [64] [65] [66] . It was also reported that melatonin had benefits in patients with myocardial infarction, cardiomyopathy, hypertensive heart diseases and pulmonary hypertension, and probably functions via the TLR4/survivor activating factor enhancement pathway [67] . Moreover, melatonin exerts neurological protection by reducing the cerebral inflammatory response, cerebral edema and brain-blood barrier permeability under a number of experimental conditions [68] . In the ICU, deep sedation is associated with increased long-term mortality, and the application of melatonin reduces sedation use and the frequency of pain, agitation, anxiety [69, 70] . Also, a recent meta-analysis showed that melatonin improves sleep quality in patients in the ICU [71] . Thus, the rationale for the use of melatonin in COVID-19","As clinic experiences increases, clinicians become conscious of cardiovascular comorbidities and manifestations of COVID-19. Two reports showed that patients with COVID-19 and hypertension or coronary artery disease had worse in-hospital outcomes [8, 9] . Cardiovascular manifestations (CVMs) could be the initial presentation or appear throughout the whole course of COVID-19. Liu et al analyzed 137 cases with COVID-19 and found that patients who complains palpitation as initial symptom accounted for 7.3% [10] . The first report of 41 cases with COVID-19 admitted from December 1, 2019 to January 2, 2020, revealed acute cardiac injury occurred in 12% of patients [11] . Wang et al reported in a single-center case series involving 138 patients with COVID-19, also found that cardiovascular complications of were not rare, among which arrhythmia and acute cardiac injury accounted for 16.7% and 7.2%, respectively. The level of hypersensitive troponin I on admission was significantly higher in those who had been admitted to intensive care unit (ICU) than those who had not [12] . Further, a comparative study was applied to explain whether concomitant CVMs had effect on the in-hospital outcomes of COVID-19 cases.","Health-care Development least 10 cm H 2 O; respiratory rate of 10-30 breaths per min) and conventional ventilatory support versus ECMO for severe adult respiratory failure (CESAR; 37 peak inspiratory pressure 20-25 cm H 2 O; positive end-expiratory pressure 10 cm H 2 O; respiratory rate of 10 breaths per min) could serve as useful guides pending further evidence on ventilation strategies for ECMO in patients with ARDS. Prone positioning could be considered during ECMO, although there are few data to support this practice. 38 The benefits of ECMO for ARDS largely stem from its ability to confer lung protection, which is associated with decreased adverse outcomes. It should be noted that although extracorporeal CO 2 removal for lung-protective ventilation is feasible, it is neither evidence-based nor is it universally available. 39 Occasionally, patients develop concomitant or discrete cardiac failure-mainly from myocarditis, myocardial infarction, or sepsis-related cardiomyopathy-and might need venoarterial ECMO. Provision of ECMO in the setting of both pulmonary and cardiac dysfunction is particularly complex and, where possible, requires close liaison with an expert extracorporeal life support centre before ECMO initiation. ECMO-assisted cardiopulmonary resuscitation (ECPR) can be considered in carefully selected patients who develop cardiac arrest. However, given the likelihood of poor outcomes and the considerable risk of infection to staff responding to these patients, ECPR should be undertaken with great caution.","Children have had much milder illness than adults and mortality rates progressively increase with age. Some patients, particularly those with progressive lower respiratory tract involvement have had a watery diarrhea. Other extrapulmonary manifestations included hepatic dysfunction and a marked lymphopenia involving both B, T (CD4 and CD8 subsets), and natural killer (NK) cells. High serum levels of chemokines (interleukin 8 (IL-8), CCL2, and CCl10) and pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1, IL-6, IL-12) have been observed.","In summary, COVID-19 patients present many challenges for cardiac anesthesiologists during cardiac surgery. Meticulous infection control practices must be observed and special attentions should be paid to COVID-19 specific cardiac and pulmonary manifestations.","While the mechanism of cardiac injury is not fully described, there are data documenting COVID-19 and its effects on the cardiovascular system. In two studies, cardiac injury (manifested as an increase in troponin levels) was found in 8% of admitted patients (Table 1) . While an uncommon finding overall, cardiac injury was more common in critically-ill patients (32) . Two studies of critically-ill patients demonstrated that 23% (n=12) of patients developed cardiac injury (29) and 33% (n=7) of patients developed a cardiomyopathy (34) . Another study documented that among a group of patients (n = 120) with COVID-19, elevations in troponin levels (n = 12, 10%) and N-terminal pro B-type natriuretic peptide levels (n = 33, 27.5%) were detected, signaling cardiovascular injury (35) .","For patients with indications of emergent cardiac surgery, COVID-19 status should be immediately evaluated from patient's recent epidemiological history, respiratory infection history, clinical manifestations, and laboratory and radiographic testing, including but not limited to temperature, respiratory pathogen testing, serum immunoglobulin G (IgG) level, complete blood count, C-reactive protein (CRP) and ","This review is aimed at providing overview of various CV manifestations in patients presenting with COVID-19. The impact of pre-existing CVD and new onset cardiac complications on clinical outcomes in these patients is also discussed. Since our understanding on this subject is only evolving at this stage, the information contained in the subsequent text is based mainly on the limited early experience with COVID-19 and learnings from the previous coronavirus illnesses, namely SARS and Middle-East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS).","The cardiac manifestations and prognostic factors of lateonset hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis with p.A97S variant remain to be clarified. To this end, Lai et al. 3 retrospectively collected 67 patients with ATTR p.A97S to study their clinical profiles, echocardiography, and ECG findings. Of these patients, 82% met the criteria for left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy. Reduced global longitudinal strain (GLS) was noted in 42.1% of them, and 14% had a relative apical sparing pattern. A low voltage pattern in the ECG was observed in 31.3%, while 64.2% presented with a pseudoinfarction pattern. End-systolic LV inner dimension (HR: 2.25 (95% CI: 1.01e5.01), p Z 0.048), reduced GLS (HR: 5.26 (1.08e25.0), p Z 0.039), relative apical longitudinal strain (RALS&gt;1, HR: 8.57 (1.69e43.3), p Z 0.009), increased E/A ratio (HR: 6.51 (1.17e36.4), p Z 0.033), and increased QRS duration (HR: 1.02 (1.00e1.04), p Z 0.05) were correlated with reduced survival in univariate analysis. Multivariate analysis revealed reduced RALS was significantly correlated with reduced survival (HR: 13.00 (1.81e93.45), p Z 0.011). Thus, ATTR p.A97S is a cardiomyopathy as well as a polyneuropathic syndrome. Contemporary echocardiographic techniques are useful for identifying cardiac amyloidosis and providing prognostic information.","Adenovirus is the one of the most common causes of upper respiratory tract infections in adults and children [67,68]. Clinical disease usually is a self-limited upper respiratory tract infection associated with conjunctivitis; however, severe lower respiratory disease can occur in both high-risk and healthy individuals [67,69-71]. The combination of pneumonia and ARDS develops in a minority of individuals and usually is associated with conjunctivitis and other extrapulmonary manifestations, such as gastrointestinal disease, hepatitis, meningitis, and hemorrhagic cystitis [68]. The extrapulmonary complications, along with ARDS, are more frequent in transplant recipients. Pneumonia and ARDS appear to be more common with subtype E type 4 and subgroups B type 7, but serogroup 35 also has been documented in mental health facilities [69-71]. Recent increases in respiratory diseases in adults have been noted over the past year with serotype 14 [72].","The risk factors and diseases were defined using Read clinical terminology systems in primary care diagnosis and the 10th version of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases (ICD-10) for hospital admissions as per previously validated CALIBER phenotypes (13, 14, (17) (18) (19) . Hypertension was defined based on recorded values in primary care according to the most recent guidelines: \u2265140 mmHg systolic blood pressure (or \u2265150 mmHg for people aged \u226560 years without diabetes and chronic kidney disease) and/or \u226590 mmHg diastolic blood pressure (17) . Diabetes was defined at baseline (including type 1, type 2, or uncertain type) on the basis of coded diagnoses recorded in CPRD or HES at or before study entry (18) . Severe obesity was defined as body mass index &gt;=40kg/m 2 . CVD was defined as the 12 most common symptomatic manifestations: chronic stable angina, unstable angina, myocardial infarction, unheralded death from coronary heart disease, heart failure, cardiac arrest/sudden coronary death, transient ischaemic attack, ischaemic stroke, intracerebral haemorrhage, subarachnoid haemorrhage, peripheral arterial disease, and abdominal aortic aneurysm, as .

Approximately 66% of the study participants had overall good knowledge regarding MERS-CoV (66.4%). This frequency is comparable to the reported knowledge score from a study conducted in Al Qaseem (73.2%) but higher than the knowledge score reported in a study conducted in Makah (32.4%) [15, 16] . However, these two studies enrolled only healthcare workers and had different sample sizes and respondent characteristics. More nurses were included in the study from Makah than in the study from Qaseem. Our study went further to explore the gap in knowledge among the general population regarding the characteristics of the disease and to determine related factors. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to comprehensively assess the necessary and required epidemiological and clinical knowledge aspects of the disease. The study highlights gaps in knowledge and the essential elements required to educate and encourage the Saudi public to play active roles in the prevention and treatment of the disease and possibly reverse the course of this rapidly growing, highly infectious and fatal disease. Additionally, our study adopted a unique approach of separately evaluating the epidemiological and clinical knowledge domains, which typically are combined together in similar studies. Combined assessment of these two domains might overstate the overall knowledge score and obscure the identification of areas with a significant lack of knowledge. Reliance mostly on the clinical manifestations of these types of diseases to assess public knowledge might produce biased results. Our approach allowed us to glean information concerning these areas and identify inadequate epidemiological knowledge and skills that need urgent educational interventions. This approach could be useful for similar studies evaluating public knowledge toward infectious diseases other than Mers-Cov, such SARS, H1N1, Zika, and Ebola.","Clinical manifestations of tuberculosis usually include fever, night sweats, cough, weight loss, anorexia, general malaise, and weakness. Massive hemoptysis can occur as a result of erosion into a pulmonary vessel in the wall of a tuberculin cavity. Other findings include wasting, rales, rhonchi, and clubbing of fingers because of hypoxia. On chest radiograph, the classic finding is that of an upper lobe infiltrate or cavity; however, the film may be normal or have other findings, such as nodules or diffuse infiltrates. Cavitation or mediastinal lymphadenopathy also may be seen. Although any organ system can be affected, the extrapulmonary sites that are involved most commonly in tuberculosis include lymph nodes, pleura, genitourinary tract, bones and joints, meninges, and peritoneum. Extrapulmonary tuberculosis is being seen more often because of HIV coinfection. Five to 10% percent of pregnant women who have tuberculosis have extrapulmonary disease.","is the (which was not peer-reviewed) The copyright holder for this preprint . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03. 19.20034124 doi: medRxiv preprint Thirdly, we diagnosed four cases of viral myocarditis clinically, without evidence of cardiac biopsy as the gold standard of diagnosis. The echocardiography and cardiac MRI were unavailable due to limited protective measures. However, we strictly excluded the interference of the patient's cardiac history, and made a clinical diagnosis based on the clinical manifestations of myocardial injury, high levels of cardiac enzymes and cTn I, as well as typical ECG changes, which were consistent with the most updated diagnostic criteria of viral myocarditis. 12,13","Definition Cardiac transplantation is the treatment for end-stage cardiac disease (idiopathic cardiomyopathy, coronary artery disease, or valvular disease) that cannot be corrected by other medical or surgical means. The heart usually comes from a brain-dead human organ donor, although porcine heart transplantation may become a more viable option in the future and address the issue of limited donor availability.","The mean incubation period of SARS is 6.4 days (2 to 10 days), and the clinical features are summarized in Table 1 . The key feature is the occurrence of rapidly progressive pneumonia, sometimes with dramatic overnight progression from a mild to bilateral pneumonia and then acute respiratory distress syndrome. The occurrence of upper respiratory tract symptoms is unusual. Patients with diarrhea could potentially be highly infectious. Physical signs are scarce in the first few days but become more prominent as patients develop extensive lung consolidation. Although SARS is predominantly a respiratory illness, extrapulmonary manifestations are not infrequently encountered ( Table 2) .","Among hospital admissions, a small percentage of children would require pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) support [13] [14] [15] [16] . Hon and colleagues [17] reported the clinical pattern and outcome of all children with a laboratory-proven diagnosis of respiratory virus infection admitted to the PICU of a teaching hospital. Three respiratory virus species, RSV (n \u00bc 17), influenza (n \u00bc 13), and parainfluenza (n \u00bc 12), accounted for 86% of cases. PICU admissions due to influenza A were more common than influenza B, whereas parainfluenza type 3 was the commonest subtype of parainfluenza infection. Comparing these 3 common viruses, the mean age of children admitted with RSV was lower than with influenza or parainfluenza. Preexisting conditions such as prematurity and chronic lung disease were only present in children with RSV infection. These respiratory viruses caused both upper (croup) and lower respiratory tract diseases (bronchiolitis, pneumonia). Extrapulmonary presentations were less prevalent and included encephalitis, seizures, cardiac arrest, coexisting diabetes ketoacidosis, and acute lymphoblastic leukemia. One patient with RSV and another with influenza A died during their PICU stay. Nearly half of these patients required ventilatory support or received systemic corticosteroids, and 88% received initial broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage. Approximately 1 in 5 of them had nebulized adrenaline, airway endoscopies, or bacterial coinfections. Adenovirus was isolated in 4 patients, and 2 (both with adenovirus type 3) died during the PICU stay. Similar findings in PICU were reported [14, 15] . In particular, influenza infection causes significant morbidity and mortality in young children [15] . Immunizations are recommended for all children aged 6 months to 18 years. Although severe forms of influenza are rare in children, the disease may be life-threatening and most occur in children with underlying disease [16] . During the 2003 influenza season there was an increased number of children with influenza A infection admitted to an Australian PICU, and an increased number of deaths compared with previous years [16] . The cost of influenza-related hospitalizations in children is high [13] . In a United States study, high-risk patients had higher mean total costs than low-risk patients, and cardiac, metabolic, and neurologic/neuromuscular diseases and age of 18 to 21 years were independently associated with the highest hospitalization costs [13] .","is the (which was not peer-reviewed) The copyright holder for this preprint . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03. 19.20034124 doi: medRxiv preprint nonsevere patients. Among all patients, a total of 36 patients had a high level of cardiac enzymes or cTnI. After excluding the history of cardiac diseases and combining the ECG and clinical manifestations, 4 patients were clinically diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 myocarditis according to most updated diagnostic criteria, 12, 13 of which 3 cases occurred in severe group and 1 in nonsevere group. However, the pathological mechanism by which the COVID-19 causes viral myocarditis is still uncertain. There are some limitations in our study. Firstly, the sample size in our study was relatively small, only 84 patients were included. The deadline of the collected data was March 2, 2020, with 16 patients still hospitalized. Secondly, we did not get exact viral load of patients as viral copy numbers due to the urgent outbreak of COVID-19 and limited conditions. We used Ct values as a substitute. Nevertheless, the results of multivariable logistic regress model demonstrated that the Ct value of SARS-CoV-2 is valid and reliable.","Patients with MERS often present themselves to a hospital with systemic and lower respiratory tract (LRT) signs and symptoms of disease which usually include fever, chills or rigors, dry or productive cough, shortness of breath (dyspnea) and one or more comorbidities including diabetes (prevalent in the KSA), chronic kidney disease including renal failure, chronic heart disease and heart failure, recent surgery, hypertension, chronic lung disease, asthma, obesity, smoking, malignant disease or steroid use (Arabi et al., 2014; Assiri et al., 2013a; Hijawi et al., 2013; Zaki et al., 2012) . MERS-CoV may be identified in patients with severe hypoxaemic respiratory failure and extrapulmonary organ dysfunction which can precede death in over a third of infections (Arabi et al., 2014; Assiri et al., 2013a; Hijawi et al., 2013; Zaki et al., 2012) . Extrapulmonary disease manifestations include circulatory, renal, hepatic and hematologic dysfunction. Gastrointestinal symptoms have been seen in 20-33% of cases (Assiri et al., 2013a; Mailles et al., 2013; Memish et al., 2013b; Zumla and Memish, 2014) , manifesting as diarrhea, vomiting and abdominal pain. Gastrointestinal symptoms were not seen at all in one family cluster (Omrani et al., 2013) nor among symptomatic children in another . On occasion, fever and gastrointestinal upset may form a prodrome, after which symptoms decline to be are later followed by more severe systemic and respiratory signs and symptoms (Kraaij-Dirkzwager et al., 2014; Mailles et al., 2013) . Rarely, MERS-CoV has been detected in a person with fever but no respiratory or gastrointestinal symptoms . The extent to which infection by other gastrointestinal pathogens affect this variability is unknown.","While the manifestations of MERS on chest CT are mainly subpleural distribution, accompanied by extensive GGO and consolidation [16] . In addition, influenza virus pneumonia have high frequency of occurrence in winter and spring, with the manifestations of cavity, GGO and lobular distribution on chest CT [12] .","Several factors were implicated in the resurgence of tuberculosis in the United States that occurred in the late 1980s and early 1990s. These included increased immigration from countries with a high prevalence of tuberculosis, HIV infection, emergence of resistant strains, poverty, homelessness, drug abuse, and a decline in tuberculosis-related health services [55] . This increase was accompanied by an increased frequency of tuberculosis in pregnant women. With appropriate therapy, pregnancy does not affect the course of tuberculosis adversely; however, tuberculosis may affect pregnancy outcome adversely. Low birth weight, preterm delivery, and increased perinatal mortality rates have been reported in the setting of incomplete treatment and advanced or extrapulmonary tuberculosis [56, 57] .","ACE2 levels have consistently been shown to alter in cardiovascular disease states. In light of the counterbalancing hypothesis it could be presumed that, since ACE is consistently reported to increase in damaged cardiac tissue [45\u201347], ACE2 levels would also increase as a homeostatic response to offset the rise in Ang II concentration. This hypothetical upregulation is supported by evidence from human nonischaemic cardiomyopathy, which has consistently shown increased ACE2 levels in the failing human heart compared to control patients [48\u201350]. However, in contrast, in ischaemic cardiomyopathy, there is currently conflicting evidence for the changes in expression levels of ACE2 [48, 49]. Where ACE2 upregulation has been seen in these studies, the mechanism of this damage-induced increase has been investigated using in vivo models of MI. ACE2 upregulation has been repeatedly shown in rat models of MI [38, 51, 52]. Discrepancies between the mRNA and protein levels seen in the infarct zone have suggested that the increase in ACE2 protein is mediated by a posttranscriptional mechanism [38]. However, time-course investigations reveal that the increases seen at eight weeks after MI were followed by a decrease in ACE2 expression in MI models compared to control after 28 weeks [52]. Although not entirely consistent these results on balance seem to indicate a compensatory role for ACE2 in conditions of myocardial injury.","Concurrent disease may be present and should be investigated, in particular: \u2022 Evidence of concurrent renal failure with increased creatinine and urea concentration may also be present. Urine specific gravity will also provide further information regarding renal function. \u2022 Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy secondary to hyperthyroidism (thyrotoxic cardiac disease) is frequently seen on echocardiography. This may be reversible with resolution of the hyperthyroid state but may progress to congestive cardiac failure.","Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy. With the growth of echocardiography, we have become increasingly aware of this congenital heart muscle disease that Maron confirmed to be a major cause of sudden cardiac death in the young athlete. 15 With echocardiography, we are able to identify those subjects with this disordered heart muscle morphology, although the obstructive nature of this disease had been described during cardiac catherizations before the widespread use of echocardiography.","Many features of the TO-2 dilated cardiomyopathy strain closely resemble those of human DCM so this strain is used commonly to characterize the pathophysiology and hemodynamic profiles of DCM in humans (Escobales and Crespo, 2006; Goineau et al., 2001) . TO-2 strain cardiomyopathy is progressive, beginning with myolysis, then developing fibrosis followed by hypertrophy and dilation, and culminating in congestive heart failure Escobales and Crespo, 2006) . These stages represent the majority of phases seen in humans with cardiomyopathy, including heart dilation, ventricular hypertrophy, fluid congestion, and death Escobales and Crespo, 2006) . Acute myocarditis is also observed in humans and hamsters (Escobales and Crespo, 2006) . The common hemodynamic features include low cardiac output, elevated left ventricular end-diastolic pressure, delayed left ventricular relaxation rate, increased peripheral resistance, and reduced renal blood flow.","Ischemic neuromyopathy is a relatively common condition in feline medicine, which tends to affect older male cats. It is frequently associated with cardiac disease (in particular, feline hypertrophic cardiomyopathy), which leads to thrombi formation and subsequent embolization of the caudal aorta or the bifurcation of the iliac arteries. Cats present with a peracute onset of paraparesis or plegia with absent or weak femoral pulses, cold and frequently cyanotic extremities, pain on muscle palpation and cardiac auscultation abnormalities.","Current medical treatment for human dilated and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is only palliative (Sakamoto et al., 1997) . Syrian hamster cardiomyopathic strains are used in research targeting prevention and treatment of the condition. The treatment of cardiomyopathic hamsters with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors improves left ventricular contractility and coronary flow, providing evidence that Syrian hamsters are useful models in studying drug treatment interventions. Coronary vasculature renin-angiotensin system (RAS) plays a role in generating increased coronary reactivity and resistance in young Syrian hamsters that have yet to develop cardiomyopathy. Early RAS blockade may prevent and improve the clinical signs of cardiomyopathy (Escobales and Crespo, 2008) . Finally, the administration of carvedilol, a non-selective \u03b2-blocker with \u03b1 1 -blocker properties, to 6-month-old TO-2 hamsters, improves cardiac function due to decreased peripheral resistance .","Based on the difference in protein sequences, CoVs are classified into four genera (alpha-CoV, beta-CoV, gamma-CoV and delta-CoV), among which the beta-CoV genera contains most HCoVs and is subdivided into four lineages (A, B, C and D) 2,4,5. Phylogenetic evidence has shown that bats and rodents serve as the gene source of most alpha-CoVs and beta-CoVs, while birds are the main reservoir of gamma-CoVs and delta-CoVs 2. For thousands of years, CoVs have constantly crossed species barriers and some have emerged as important human pathogens 2,4,6-8. To date, seven human CoVs (HCoVs) are known. Among them HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 are alpha-CoVs. The other five beta-CoVs include HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2 2,5,9. HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63 usually cause mild symptoms, like common cold and/or diarrhea 10,11. In contrast, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and the newly-identified SARS-CoV-2 are highly pathogenic, causing severe lower respiratory tract infection in relatively more patients with a higher chance to develop acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and extrapulmonary manifestations.","The normal CBP, ESR, LFT, LDH, CK, CRP, as well as results of clinical assessment, suggested that ongoing active disease is unlikely. Normal thyroid function tests excluded thyrotoxicosis. Although coronavirus infection had been demonstrated to cause an autoimmune myocar-ditis in rabbits that may progress to dilated cardiomyopathy [5] , normal troponin I, echocardiography and other negative cardiac investigations in our cohort excluded myocarditis and cardiomyopathy. Mild residual CXR changes, minor lung function impairment and normal blood gas makes pulmonary defect unlikely to be a significant cause of sinus tachycardia during normal activity.","The rapid spread of 2019-nCoV is reminiscent of the SARS outbreak in China in 2003. Although more widespread transmission of the SARS virus was successfully prevented, owing to inadequate experience with outbreaks of this nature at the time, SARS-CoV still caused more than 8000 infections leading to 774 deaths. [12] The typical clinical manifestations of SARS included sudden fever (usually &gt;38\u00b0C) accompanied by chills or headache, myalgia, fatigue, and coughing. Some patients also developed significant respiratory distress within a short period. Laboratory tests showed either a normal or decreased peripheral white blood cell count. Imaging showed focal or patch-like shadows or reticular exudates, although this did rapidly progress to diffuse consolidations in some patients. [13] In the present cohort of patients, the typical initial symptoms of NCP were primarily fever, most of which were high fevers that occurred within several days and were not alleviated by routine anti-infective drugs. However, some middle-aged and elderly patients with underlying comorbidities only developed a moderate, low, or no fever during the disease course. In addition, some patients suffered from fatigue and dry cough on disease onset. Nevertheless, these atypical initial symptoms deserve similar attention with the more common symptoms. For example, there have been reports of patients with NCP presenting with diarrhea as the initial symptom of disease onset. [14] Some patients presented with elevated troponin levels and myocarditis. [15] Others developed headache, myalgia, and other symptoms similar to those of influenza. [14] It should be emphasized that the author observed that some patients in the outpatient clinic even had no obvious symptoms, or came to see the doctor only with \"discomfort.\" Moreover, a previous study reported that one asymptomatic patient was diagnosed 2019-nCoV infection [16] ; therefore, the presence of asymptomatic carriers requires due attention, and relevant contacts should be tracked and isolated as soon as possible. In this study, routine peripheral blood tests showed either normal or decreased white blood cell counts and lymphocytopenia, as well as elevated C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rates, all of which are generally consistent with previous reports of patients with NCP. [3] In these patients, early-stage lung CT scans mostly showed multiple, small patch-like shadows, and interstitial changes, which were more obvious in the extrapulmonary region. These shadows subsequently progressed to multiple ground-glass opacities in both lungs, along with infiltration shadows with a \"large white lung\" observed in more severe cases. The median interval from the onset of initial symptoms to dyspnea was 7 days. In some severe cases, the disease rapidly progressed to acute respiratory distress syndrome, septic shock, refractory metabolic acidosis, and coagulation disorder, eventually leading to death.","In the TO-2 Syrian hamster, abnormal sarcoplasmic reticulum function results in calcium sequestration and overload, and high ATPase activity results in decreased contractility. These features are partially responsible for decreased cardiac function in this strain, and these abnormalities are hypothesized to be a pathogenic mechanism in human DCM (Goineau et al., 2001) . Deficiency of the \u03b4-sarcoglycan gene also affects peripheral and coronary vasculature, ultimately contributing to heart failure in cardiomyopathic hamster models Crespo, 2006, 2008; Lipskaia et al., 2007) . Angiotensin II promotes increased oxidative stress and decreased peripheral vasorelaxation, leading to high systemic blood pressure and increased cardiac work load in cardiomyopathic prone TO-2 hamsters (Escobales and Crespo, 2006) . Angiotensin-II-dependent oxidative stress influences coronary vasculature by causing endothelial dysfunction which predisposes hamsters to the development of ischemic heart disease and cardiomyopathy (Escobales and Crespo, 2008) . Based on the similarities between cardiomyopathic Syrian hamsters and humans, these results associate angiotensin II with the development of cardiomyopathy in humans with hereditary sarcoglycanopathies (Escobales and Crespo, 2008) .","Worldwide, M. tuberculosis is one of the most common causes of hepatic granulomas. The organisms may reach the liver hematogenously from the lungs (or less commonly an extrapulmonary site), through the portal circulation in the setting of gastrointestinal tuberculosis (TB), or via lymphatics. 170 The prevalence of hepatic involvement in patients with active TB has been estimated at approximately 1%. 171 TB can affect the liver in several forms. Most often (approximately 80% of cases of hepatic TB), the liver is affected in the setting of generalized miliary TB. 172, 173 Less often (approximately 20%), hepatic TB manifests as a localized mass lesion that mimics a neoplasm, causes obstructive jaundice from extrinsic compression of the hepatic duct, or causes portal hypertension from compression of the portal vein. 170, 174 Localized hepatic involvement can occur in primary infection, in which case there is no evidence of antecedent infection, or as reactivation TB. 175 Tuberculous cholangitis, in which the bacillus primarily infects the biliary tree, is extremely rare. 176 Hepatic TB is common among HIV-positive individuals: it was identified in 26% of untreated HIV-positive patients undergoing liver biopsy in one series from Brazil 177 and may be found in the liver at autopsy in approximately a third of HIV-positive patients. 171 HIV-positive patients tend to have more severe manifestations of hepatic TB.","In cats it is most commonly associated with hypertrophic, dilated and restrictive cardiomyopathy, with thrombus formation in the left atrium. It also occurs with thyrotoxic cardiac disease.","Nifurtimox; benzimidazole especially in early infections and consider therapy for all infections whether symptomatic or not; supportive measures or cardiac transplant for cardiomyopathy, surgery for megaesophagus or megacolon.","The most important determinant of risk for malignant arrhythmias in patients with LQTS 129 or in acquired QT-prolongation, is the use of one or more QTc prolonging drugs in the setting 130 of severe manifestations of COVID-19. Many drugs (either with cardiac or non-cardiac 131 indications) have the ability to block cardiac potassium currents, impairing ventricular 132 8 repolarisation with subsequent prolongation of the QT-interval and an increased risk for 133 malignant arrhythmias. 15 In addition, many drugs may alter drug metabolism, e.g. due to 134 inhibition of CYP3A4, which may further increase plasma levels of QT-prolonging drugs and 135 further increase risk. Of special interest in COVID-19 is that there are indications that 136 chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine might be of value. 17 137","ACE2 is expressed at substantial levels in cardiomyocytes in the heart. Gene deletion of ace2 resulted in impaired cardiac contractility in two different independent targeted mouse lines [16, 28] . The observed impaired heart function was associated with increased Ang II levels in heart and in the plasma. Indeed, double knock-out of ACE and ACE2 as well as treatment with AT 1 antagonists rescued the cardiac malfunctions of ACE2 knock-out animals [16, 28, 29] . Of note, in a third ACE2 deficient mouse line aberrant cardiac contractility could not be observed [25] , which turned out to be due to different mouse line backgrounds [30] . Importantly, in all mouse models generated, ACE2 protects from heart failure. In line with a beneficial effect of ACE2, treatment with Ang 1e7 has been shown to improve myocardial performance, cardiac remodeling, and survival in rodent heart failure models, including ischemia/reperfusion injury, myocardial infarction, or hypertension-induced cardiomyopathy [31, 32] . Of note, beside the beneficial effects of ACE2 in cardiovascular diseases, overexpression of ACE2 can have deleterious effects resulting in cardiac fibrosis and arrhythmia [33, 34] ; whether this is physiologically relevant needs to be examined in future experiments.","Vasovagal reactions may recur within the next several hours and so donors who have had one should be advised to use caution when driving or operating heavy machinery. Donors with severe or multiple reactions should be discouraged from attempting to give blood again in the near future. Even donors who have had severe vasovagal reactions tend to recover spontaneously. No reports of deaths caused by blood donation-related vasovagal reaction appear in the medical literature, although there are reports of cardiac arrest in patients after venipuncture for blood sample collection. 128, 129 The sudden drop in blood pressure caused by a vasovagal reaction may evoke an ischemic event in donors with occlusive atherosclerotic vascular disease. These reactions tend to be rare, likely due to successful donor screening techniques. 114 The risk, of course, is higher for individuals with pre-existing disease, so these donors should be accepted only if their disease is stable and even then with caution. Some degree of risk may be acceptable for autologous donation, which is commonplace for elective cardiac bypass surgery (if the patient does not have unstable angina). 30, 130 Taking chances with a routine allogeneic donor is unacceptable, and if there is any real uncertainty, the donor should be deferred.","The heart is a major organ, which abundantly expresses ACE2, and many literatures have shown its importance in heart failure. ACE2 null mice displayed impaired cardiac contractility which is associated with aging and/or cardiac pressure overload in several different ACE2 knockout mouse lines (Crackower et al., 2002; Yamamoto et al., 2006; Nakamura et al., 2008) . Heart contractility impairment was correlated with elevated cardiac and plasma Ang II levels, and double knockout mice of ACE and ACE2 genes or treatment with AT1 receptor blockers reversed the cardiac phenotype in ACE2 knockout mice (Crackower et al., 2002; Yamamoto et al., 2006; Nakamura et al., 2008) . Similarly, in myocardial infarction loss of ACE2 accelerates maladaptive left ventricular remodeling (Kassiri et al., 2009) . Mechanistically, the agedependent cardiomyopathy in ACE2 knockout mice is likely mediated by Ang II-induced oxidative stress and inflammation through AT1 receptor downstream PI3K (phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase) signaling . Of note, one study reported that their knockout mouse line did not show alterations in cardiac function, although these mice were not investigated under conditions of cardiac like pressure overload Gurley and Coffman, 2008) . However, these differences were resolved and appear to be dependent on modifier genes in different mouse background . Thus, ACE and ACE2 balance Ang II levels and contribute to maintaining heart functions through AT1 receptor.","3.5. Molecular epidemiology of adenovirus type 7 respiratory infections (Adriana E. Kajon, Lovelace Respiratory Research Institute, Albuquerque, NM) The adenoviruses constitute an important group of human pathogens with a capacity to cause a wide range of illnesses in man. Adenoviruses are responsible for 5-10% of the cases of pediatric acute respiratory infections (ARI) that require hospitalization. Nosocomial outbreaks of adenovirus respiratory infection are frequently reported. The adenovirus virion consists of a non-enveloped icosohedral capsid enclosing a double-stranded DNA genome of approximately 36,000 bp. The human adenovirus family currently comprises 51 serotypes that are classified into six species (formerly subgenera), A-F, based on their genomic characteristics, tropism, associated disease and other biological properties. Respiratory disease is mainly caused by adenovirus serotypes classified within subspecies B1 (Ad3, Ad7, Ad16, Ad21, Ad50), species C (Ad1, Ad2, Ad5, Ad6), and species E (Ad4). Among the most prevalent serotypes associated with human respiratory disease, adenovirus type 7 (Ad7) is a frequent cause of severe clinical presentations in children and young adults, in whom it causes epidemics of acute febrile respiratory illness among military recruits (Ryan et al., 2002) . Extrapulmonary manifestations, rare fatalities, and residual lung damage are observed in association with Ad7 infection (Becroft, 1967; Steen-Johnsen et al., 1969) . Affected patients surviving severe disease may have chronic sequelae in the form of bronchiectasis, bronchiolitis obliterans and hyperlucent lung (Murtagh and Kajon, 1997) .","Out of Hospital Cardiac Arrest (OHCA)","this type of inherited cardiomyopathy is warned against playing competitive sports as strenuous activity is associated with sudden cardiac death. Those with the disorder can have their heart rates monitored electronically, or have defibrillators implanted to instantly revert ventricular arrhythmias that arise.","Taking into account the possibility that the victim may carry COVID-19, rescuers should not listen or feel breathing by placing their ear and cheek close to the patient's mouth in order to recognize cardiac arrest.","During viral lung infections, the lungs histologically show diffuse alveolar damage, including interstitial lymphocyte infiltration, air-space hemorrhage, edema, fibrosis, type 2 cell hyperplasia, and hyaline tissue formation [19]. Diffuse alveolar damage is found in some kinds of viral pneumonia, but it is usually self-limited and radiologic abnormalities usually diminish within 3 weeks in immunocompetent patients [20]. In SARS-CoV-infected patients, intralobular and interlobular septal thickening, subpleural lines, and traction bronchiectasis were observed as late as 84 months after SARS infection in the present study. All these thin-section CT manifestations were also found at 3 and 6 months during the recovery phase of SARS, which may indicate lung fibrosis, as observed in previous studies [21,22]. To the best of our knowledge, the present study is the first to report abnormal imaging at up to 7 years after SARS-CoV pneumonia.","Concerning rescuers, because of the heightened awareness of the possibility that victim may have COVID-19, to recognize cardiac arrest they should not listen or feel breathing by placing their ear and cheek close to the patient's mouth.","The main CT manifestations of NCP in this group were pulmonary interstitial changes, whereas the CT manifestations of SARS were mostly interstitial changes with parenchymal lesions, 19 which may be related to the more aggressive virulence of the SARS virus."],"title":["Severe Childhood Respiratory Viral Infections","COVID 19 and Intra cerebral hemorrhage: Causative or Coincidental","Clinical management and infection control of SARS: Lessons learned","Contentious Issues and Evolving Concepts in the Clinical Presentation and Management of Patients with COVID-19 Infectionwith Reference to Use of Therapeutic and Other Drugs used in Co-morbid Diseases (Hypertension, Diabetes etc)","Chapter 3 SPECIFIC PROBLEM AREAS","COVID-19: Melatonin as a potential adjuvant treatment","Association of Cardiovascular Manifestations with In-hospital Outcomes in Patients with COVID-19: A Hospital Staff Data","Planning and provision of ECMO services for severe ARDS during the COVID-19 pandemic and other outbreaks of emerging infectious diseases","Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS)","Chinese Society of Anesthesiology Expert Consensus on Anesthetic Management of Cardiac Surgical Patients with Suspected or Confirmed Coronavirus Disease 2019","The cardiovascular burden of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) with a focus on congenital heart disease","Chinese Society of Anesthesiology Expert Consensus on Anesthetic Management of Cardiac Surgical Patients with Suspected or Confirmed Coronavirus Disease 2019","Cardiovascular disease and COVID-19","Highlights","Bench-to-bedside review: Rare and common viral infections in the intensive care unit \u2013 linking pathophysiology to clinical presentation","Estimating excess 1- year mortality from COVID-19 according to underlying conditions and age in England: a rapid analysis using NHS health records in 3.8 million adults","MERS-CoV infection: Mind the public knowledge gap","The Management of Respiratory Infections During Pregnancy","COVID-19 Myocarditis and Severity Factors\uff1a An Adult Cohort Study","Chapter 3 SPECIFIC PROBLEM AREAS","Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS)","Severe Childhood Respiratory Viral Infections","COVID-19 Myocarditis and Severity Factors\uff1a An Adult Cohort Study","Middle East respiratory syndrome: An emerging coronavirus infection tracked by the crowd","Early chest computed tomography to diagnose COVID-19 from suspected patients: A multicenter retrospective study","The Management of Respiratory Infections During Pregnancy","Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2: The First Decade","Chapter 18 The thin, inappetent cat","Chapter 6 Cardiopulmonary Conditions","Chapter 34 The Experimental Use of Syrian Hamsters","The paralyzed cat.
