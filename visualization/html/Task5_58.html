studies have detected respiratory viral infections (RVIs) in 17\u201353% of such patients. In addition, novel pathogens including zoonotic coronaviruses like the agents causing Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019 nCoV) are still being identified. Patients with severe RVIs requiring ICU care present typically with hypoxemic respiratory failure. Oseltamivir is the most widely used neuraminidase inhibitor for treatment of influenza; data suggest that early use is associated with reduced mortality in critically ill patients with influenza. At present, there are no antiviral therapies of proven efficacy for other severe RVIs. Several adjunctive pharmacologic interventions have been studied for their immunomodulatory effects, including macrol...","Summary Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a respiratory tract infection caused by a newly emergent coronavirus, that was first recognized in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. Currently, the World Health Organization (WHO) has defined the infection as a global pandemic and there is a health and social emergency for the management of this new infection. While most people with COVID-19 develop only mild or uncomplicated illness, approximately 14% develop severe disease that requires hospitalization and oxygen support, and 5% require admission to an intensive care unit (1). In severe cases, COVID-19 can be complicated by the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), sepsis and septic shock, and multiorgan failure. This consensus document has been prepared on evidence-informed guidelines developed by a multidisciplinary panel of health care providers from four spanish scientific societies (Spanish Society of Intensive Care Medicine [SEMICYUC], Spanish Society of Pulmonologists [SEPAR],...","The human coronavirus HCoV-19 infection can cause acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), hypercoagulability, hypertension, extrapulmonary multiorgan dysfunction. Effective antiviral and anti-coagulation agents with safe clinical profiles are urgently needed to improve the overall prognosis. We screened an FDA approved drug library and found that an anticoagulant agent dipyridamole (DIP) suppressed HCoV-19 replication at an EC50 of 100 nM in vitro. It also elicited potent type I interferon responses and ameliorated lung pathology in a viral pneumonia model. In analysis of twelve HCoV-19 infected patients with prophylactic anti-coagulation therapy, we found that DIP supplementation was associated with significantly increased platelet and lymphocyte counts and decreased D-dimer levels in comparison to control patients. Two weeks after initiation of DIP treatment, 3 of the 6 severe cases (60%) and all 4 of the mild cases (100%) were discharged from the hospital. One critically ill pat...","Effective treatments for Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak are urgently needed. While anti-viral approaches and vaccines are being considered immediate countermeasures are unavailable. The aim of this article is to outline a perspective on the pathophysiology of COVID-19 in the context of the currently available clinical data published in the literature. This article appreciates clinical data published on COVID-19 in the context of another respiratory illness - high altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE). Both conditions have significant similarities that portend pathophysiologic trajectories. Following this potential treatment options emerge. Both COVID-19 and HAPE exhibit a decreased ratio of arterial oxygen partial pressure to fractional inspired oxygen with concomitant hypoxia and tachypnea. There also appears to be a tendency for low carbon dioxide levels in both as well. Radiologic findings of ground glass opacities are present in up to 86% of patients with COVID-19 in additi...","Abstract The outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) has drawn enormous attention and caused fear worldwide since early 2003. The disease appears to be under control now; however, the possible return of SARS must be emphasized. Although many clinical experiments have been reported, the treatment of SARS is largely anecdotal, and so far no treatment consensus has been reached. We summarize 14 clinical reports and attempt to assess the effectiveness of various treatment regimens. A combination treatment of steroids and ribavirin was widely used empirically from the outset of the epidemic. In general, the use of steroids for SARS seemed beneficial, but the optimal timing, dosage, and duration of treatment have not yet been determined. On the other hand, ribavirin administration apparently reduced neither the rate of intratracheal intubation nor that of mortality. Moreover, significant toxicity, such as hemolytic anemia, has been attributed to ribavirin. A few preliminary tria...","Background: Data regarding critical care for patients with severe Covid-19 are limited. We aimed to describe the clinical course and critical care implemented for this patient population at the provincial level in Sichuan, China. Methods: In this population-based multicenter cohort study, conducted from January 16 to March 15, 2020, all microbiologically confirmed Covid-19 patients who met the national severe or critical criteria were included and followed-up until discharge, death, or the end of the study. Results: Out of 539 confirmed Covid-19 patients, 81 severe cases (15.0%) were identified. The median (IQR) age was 50 (39-65) years, 37% were female, and 53.1% had chronic comorbidities. Among the five predefined criteria for severe illness, low PaO2:FiO2 ratio (&lt;300 mmHg), low pulse oxygen saturation (\u226493%), and dyspnea were the most commonly reported, accounting for 87.7%, 66.7% and 27.2% of the severe cases, respectively. The median period from the onset of symptoms to the first ...","Background: To identify safe and effective medical countermeasures (e.g., antivirals/antibodies) to address the current outbreak of a novel coronavirus (COVID-19) Methods: Comprehensive literature searches were developed by an experienced librarian for MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, and biorxiv.org/medrxiv.org; additional searches for ongoing trials and unpublished studies were conducted in clinicaltrials.gov and the Global Infectious Diseases and Epidemiology Network (GIDEON). Title/abstract and full-text screening, data abstraction, and risk of bias appraisal were carried out by single reviewers. Results: 54 studies were included in the review: three controlled trials, 10 cohort studies, seven retrospective medical record/database studies, and 34 case reports or series. These studies included patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARs, n=33), middle east respiratory syndrome (MERS, n=16), COVID-19 (n=3), and unspecified coronavirus (n=2). The most common treatment ...","Abstract Bronchiolitis is the number one cause of hospitalization in infants during the first year of life. Clinical guidelines recommend primarily supportive care and discourage use of pharmacotherapies and diagnostics. However, there continues to be widespread use of non-recommended therapies and variation in the use of therapeutic interventions among hospitals in the United States. Here we review evidence-based management of this common disease in order to optimize resource utilization, decrease healthcare costs, and decrease unnecessary hospitalization. Current evidence does not support the routine use of chest radiographs, viral testing or laboratory evaluation in children with bronchiolitis. In addition, routine administration of bronchodilators, including albuterol and nebulized epinephrine, corticosteroids and hypertonic saline are not recommended for infants and children with bronchiolitis. Intravenous or nasogastric hydration and nutritional support, supplemental oxygen, and ...","Currently, there are no approved specific antiviral agents for 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19). In this study, ten severe patients confirmed by real-time viral RNA test were enrolled prospectively. One dose of 200 mL convalescent plasma (CP) derived from recently recovered donors with the neutralizing antibody titers above 1:640 was transfused to the patients as an addition to maximal supportive care and antiviral agents. The primary endpoint was the safety of CP transfusion. The second endpoints were the improvement of clinical symptoms and laboratory parameters within 3 days after CP transfusion. The median time from onset of illness to CP transfusion was 16.5 days. After CP transfusion, the level of neutralizing antibody increased rapidly up to 1:640 in five cases, while that of the other four cases maintained at a high level (1:640). The clinical symptoms were significantly improved along with increase of oxyhemoglobin saturation within 3 days. Several parameters tended t...","Background With evidence of sustained transmission in more than 190 countries, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been declared a global pandemic. As such, data are urgently needed about risk factors associated with clinical outcomes. Methods A retrospective chart review of 323 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in Wuhan was conducted. Patients were classified into three disease severity groups (non-severe, severe, and critical), based on their initial clinical presentation. Clinical outcomes were designated as favorable and unfavorable, based on disease progression and response to treatments. Logistic regression models were performed to identify factors associated with clinical outcomes, and logrank test was conducted for the association with clinical progression. Results Current standard treatments did not show significant improvement on patient outcomes in the study. By univariate logistic regression model, 27 risk factors were significantly associated with clinical outcomes. ...","Social distancing is an effective way to contain the spread of a contagious disease, particularly when pharmacological interventions are not available. Conventional wisdom suggests that social distancing measures should be introduced as soon as possible after the beginning of an outbreak. Using a simple epidemiological model we show, however, that there is in fact an optimal time to initiate a temporal social distancing intervention if the goal is to reduce the final epidemic size or flatten the epidemic curve. The optimal timing depends strongly on the effective reproduction number (R0) of the disease, such that as the R0 increases, the optimal time decreases non-linearly. Additionally, if pharmacological interventions (e.g., a vaccine) become available at some point during the epidemic, the sooner these interventions become available the sooner social distancing should be initiated to maximize its effectiveness. Although based on a simple model, we hope that these insights inspire fu...","Resumen La enfermedad por coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) es una infecci\u00f3n del tracto respiratorio causada por un nuevo coronavirus emergente, que se reconoci\u00f3 por primera vez en Wuhan, China, en diciembre de 2019.

Most of the critically ill patients received high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) oxygen therapy. However, the experience of HFNC in this population is lacking. METHODS: We retrospectively screened 318 confirmed patients with NCIP in two hospitals of Chongqing, China, from January 1st to March 4th, 2020. Among them, 27 (8.4%) patients experienced severe acute respiratory failure including 17 patients (63%) treated with HFNC as first-line therapy, 9 patients (33%) treated with noninvasive ventilation (NIV) and one patient (4%) treated with invasive ventilation. HFNC failure was defined by the need of NIV or intubation as rescue therapy. RESULTS: Of the 17 HFNC patients, 7 (41%) experienced HFNC failure. The HFNC failure rate was 0% (0/6) in patients with PaO(2)/FiO(2) &gt; 200 mm Hg vs. 63% (7/11) in those with PaO(2)/FiO(2) \u2264 200 mm Hg (p = 0.04). Compared with baseline data, the...","Abstract Medicine shortages have been spreading in European countries. In many cases, the unavailability of medicinal products has a substantial impact on the capability of National Healthcare Systems in ensuring the continuity of care. Shortages originate from multifactorial causes. In particular, they can be due to supply-related factors (e.g., manufacturing issues, regulatory issues, logistics, distribution) and demand-related ones (e.g., fluctuating drug demand, parallel market, tendering, price and reimbursement policies). However, some extraordinary geopolitical events (e.g., Brexit) may also affect medicines\u2019 availability. The capability of European Regulatory Authorities and other stakeholders, which are involved in the pharmaceutical distribution chain and the healthcare assistance services, to define suitable problem-solving strategies has been limited for years by the fragmentation of the European regulatory framework, starting from the lack of a univocal definition of a med...","The pathogenesis of highly pathogenic Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) remains poorly understood. In a previous study, we established an hDPP4-transgenic (hDPP4-Tg) mouse model in which MERS-CoV infection causes severe acute respiratory failure and high mortality accompanied by an elevated secretion of cytokines and chemokines. Since excessive complement activation is an important factor that contributes to acute lung injury after viral infection, in this study, we investigated the role of complement in MERS-CoV-induced lung damage. Our study showed that complement was excessively activated in MERS-CoV-infected hDPP4-Tg mice through observations of increased concentrations of the C5a and C5b-9 complement activation products in sera and lung tissues, respectively. Interestingly, blocking C5a production by targeting its receptor, C5aR, alleviated lung and spleen tissue damage and reduced inflammatory responses. More importantly, anti-C5aR antibody treatment led to ...","Objective:To analyse the clinical features of COVID\u221219 parturients, and to compare anaesthetic regimen and clinical outcomes in parturients with or without COVID\u221219 undergoing cesarean delivery.Methods: Data were extracted from the electronic medical record of 3 medical institutions in Hubei Province, China, from June 1, 2019 to March 20, 2020 according to inclusion and exclusion criteria. After propensity score matching with demographics, the clinical and laboratory characteristics of parturients with or without COVID\u221219 were analysed. The anaesthetic regimen and clinical outcomes of themselves and their infants were compared in these two groups of parturients. Results: A total of 1,588 patients without SARS\u2212CoV\u22122 infection undergoing cesarean delivery were retrospectively included. After achieving a balanced cohort through propensity score matching, 89 patients (COVID\u221219 group), who were diagnosed with COVID\u221219 by SARS\u2212CoV\u22122 nucleic acid test and CT scan matched with 173 patients wit...","Abstract Since its outbreak in December 2019, a series of clinical trials on Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) have been registered or carried out. However, the significant heterogeneity and less critical outcomes of such trials may be leading to a waste of research resources. This study aimed to develop a core outcome set (COS) for clinical trials on COVID-19 in order to tackle the outcome issues. The study was conducted according to the Core Outcome Measures in Effectiveness Trials (COMET) handbook (version 1.0), a guideline for COS development. A research group was set up that included experts in respiratory and critical medicine, traditional Chinese medicine, evidence-based medicine, clinical pharmacology, and statistics, in addition to medical journal editors. Clinical trial registry websites (chictr.org.cn and clinicaltrials.gov) were searched to retrieve clinical trial protocols and outcomes in order to form an outcome pool. A total of 78 clinical trial protocols on COVID-19 w...","The number of confirmed COVID-19 cases admitted in hospitals is continuously increasing in the Philippines. Frontline health care workers are faced with imminent risks of getting infected. In this study, we formulate a theoretical model to calculate the risk of being infected in health care facilities considering the following factors: the average number of encounters with a suspected COVID-19 patient per hour; interaction time for each encounter; work shift duration or exposure time; crowd density, which may depend on the amount of space available in a given location; and availability and effectiveness of protective gears and facilities provided for the frontline health care workers. Based on the simulation results, we recommend the following: (i) decrease the rate of patient encounter per frontline health care worker, e.g., maximum of three encounters per hour in a 12-hour work shift duration; (ii) decrease the interaction time between the frontline health care worker and the patient...","Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a newly emerged infection that is caused by a previously unrecognized virus\u2013a novel coronavirus designated as SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV). From November 2002 to July 2003 the cumulative number of worldwide cases was &gt;8000, with a mortality rate of close to 10%. The mortality has been higher in older patients and those with co-morbidities. SARS has been defined using clinical and epidemiological criteria and cases are considered laboratory-confirmed if SARS coronavirus is isolated, if antibody to SARS coronavirus is detected, or a polymerase chain reaction test by appropriate criteria is positive. At the time of writing (24 May 2004), no specific therapy has been recommended. A variety of treatments have been attempted, but there are no controlled data. Most patients have been treated throughout the illness with broad-spectrum antimicrobials, supplemental oxygen, intravenous fluids, and other supportive measures. Transmission of SAR...","Importance: WHO has made the assessment that coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) can be characterized as a pandemic. But there is no effective antiviral drug for COVID-19 so far. Objective: To compare the efficacy and safety of favipiravir and arbidol to treat COVID-19 patients on 7 day\u2032s clinical recovery rate. Design: Prospective, multicenter, open-label, randomized superiority trial in February, 2020. Setting: Multicenter study. Participants: Patients with confirmed COVID-19 admitted to 3 hospitals from Feb 20, 2020 to Mar 12, 2020. Interventions: Conventional therapy + favipiravir or arbidol. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was 7 day\u2032s clinical recovery rate. Duration of fever, cough relief time and auxiliary oxygen therapy or noninvasive mechanical ventilation rate were the secondary outcomes. The patients with chest CT imaging and laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 infection, aged 18 years or older were randomly assigned to receive favipiravir or arbidol. Safety data w...","Given the rapidly progressing COVID-19 pandemic, this report on a US cohort of 54 COVID-19 patients from Stanford Hospital and data regarding risk factors for severe disease obtained at initial clinical presentation is of high importance and is immediately clinically relevant. We identified low presenting oxygen saturation as predictive of severe disease outcomes, such as diagnosis of pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and admission to the ICU, and also replicated data from China suggesting a link between hypertension and disease severity. Clinicians will benefit by tools to rapidly risk stratify patients at presentation by likelihood of progression to severe disease.","OBJECTIVE: When faced with an emergent epidemic with high mortality and morbidity potential, policy makers must decide what public health interventions to deploy at different stages of the outbreak. However, almost nothing is known about how the public view these interventions or how they trade off risks (of disease) with inconvenience (of interventions). In this paper, we aim to understand public perceptions on pandemic interventions, as well as to identify if there are any distinct respondent preference classes. DESIGN: A discrete choice experiment. SETTING: This study was fielded in Singapore between November 2012 and February 2013. PARTICIPANTS: A random sample of 500 Singapore residents aged 21 and over, including 271 women and 229 men, was analysed. OUTCOME MEASURES: Demographic information was collected from each participant. Participants were also shown a series of pairs of alternatives, each combining interventions and morbidity, mortality and cost outcomes and declared a pref...","Abstract Objectives were to determine effects of lactation and pregnancy on endometrial gene expression on d 17 of the estrous cycle and pregnancy. Heifers (n=33) were assigned randomly after parturition to lactating (L, n=17) or nonlactating (NL, n=16) groups. Cows were subjected to an ovulation synchronization program for a timed artificial insemination (TAI); 10 cows in L and 12 in NL were inseminated. Slaughter occurred 17 d after the day equivalent to TAI, and intercaruncular endometrial tissues were collected. Gene expression was determined by DNA microarray analysis for pregnant (L, n=8; NL, n=6) and noninseminated cyclic (L, n=7; NL, n=4) cows. Differentially expressed genes were selected with a P-value &lt;0.01 and absolute expression &gt;40. In addition, a fold effect &gt;1.5 was used as a criterion for genes affected by pregnancy. In total, 210 genes were differentially regulated by lactation (136 downregulated and 74 upregulated), and 702 genes were differentially regulated by pregn...","Three leading infectious disease experts in China were invited to share their bedside observations in the management of COVID-19 patients. Professor Taisheng Li was sent to Wuhan to provide frontline medical care. He depicts the clinical course of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Furthermore, he observes the significant abnormality of coagulation function and proposes that the early intravenous immunoglobulin and low molecular weight heparin anticoagulation therapy are very important. Professor Hongzhou Lu, a leader in China to try various anti-viral drugs, expresses concern on the quality of the ongoing clinical trials as most trials are small in scale and repetitive in nature, and emphasizes the importance of the quick publication of clinical trial results. Regarding the traditional Chinese medicine, Professor Lu suggests to develop a creative evaluation system because of the complicated chemical compositions. Professor Wenhong Zhang is responsible for Shanghai's overall clinical management of ...","The 2009 influenza A (H1N1) pandemic highlighted the importance of quality hospital care of the severely ill, yet there is evidence that the impact of the 2009 pandemic was highest in low\u2010 and middle\u2010income countries with fewer resources. Recent data indicate that death and suffering from seasonal influenza and severe illness in general are increased in resource\u2010limited settings. However, there are limited clinical data and guidelines for the management of influenza and other severe illness in these settings. Life\u2010saving supportive care through syndromic case management is used successfully in high\u2010resource intensive care units and in global programs such as the Integrated Management of Childhood Illness (IMCI). While there are a variety of challenges to the management of the severely ill in resource\u2010limited settings, several new international initiatives have begun to develop syndromic management strategies for these environments, including the World Health Organization's Integrated M...","Abstract There are many diseases for which a microbial aetiology is suspected. The hypothesis that a disease has an infectious cause is supported by: clinical features (similar to those of known infectious diseases, e.g. fever, leucocytosis), epidemiology (case clustering in time or location), histology (inflammation of affected tissues, e.g. granulomata) or characteristic microbial structures, treatment (clinical response to antimicrobial treatment), and prevention of disease by vaccines targeting microbial antigens. Proof that a microbe causes a disease requires more rigorous evidence. Future attempts to identify novel microbes associated with human disease may use sequence-based approaches. High-throughput sequencing may allow identification of unique microbial nucleic acid sequences in a background of host DNA. The complete sequencing of the human genome and multiple microbial genomes make this approach more feasible. DNA microarrays are also likely to be used in the search for nov...","Abstract On the Internet, there is a lot of open access information related to infectious diseases, e.g., official announcement, media news, bulletin boards, blogs, and other social media. If proper data retrieval and screening methods were applied on these Internet-based data, it would be very useful to improve the timeliness of early detection for infectious diseases. In China, we practice early warning using Internet-based data with routine intelligence screening assessment every day, and respond to any unusual event in a timely manner. Through this mechanism, the surveillance and early warning of Internet-based data for infectious disease and public health emergency plays an important supplemental role to the traditional surveillance systems.","Since COVID-19 emerged in early December, 2019 in Wuhan and swept across China Mainland, a series of large-scale public health interventions, especially Wuhan lock-down combined with nationwide traffic restrictions and Stay At Home Movement, have been taken by the government to control the epidemic. Based on Baidu Migration data and the confirmed cases data, we identified two key factors affecting the later (e.g February 27, 2020) cumulative confirmed cases in non-Wuhan region (y). One is the sum travelers from Wuhan during January 20 to January 26 (x1), which had higher infected probability but lower transmission ability because the human-to-human transmission risk of COVID-19 was confirmed and announced on January 20. The other is the seed cases from Wuhan before January 19, which had higher transmission ability and could be represented with the confirmed cases before January 29 (x2) due to a mean 10-day delay between infection and detection. A simple yet effective regression model t...","Summary Hong Kong has been severely affected by severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). Contact in households and healthcare settings is thought to be important for transmission, putting children at particular risk. Most data so far, however, have been for adults. We prospectively followed up the first ten children with SARS managed during the early phase of the epidemic in Hong Kong. All the children had been in close contact with infected adults. Persistent fever, cough, progressive radiographic changes of chest and lymphopenia were noted in all patients. The children were treated with high-dose ribavirin, oral prednisolone, or intravenous methylprednisolone, with no short-term adverse effects. Four teenagers required oxygen therapy and two needed assisted ventilation. None of the younger children required oxygen supplementation. Compared with adults and teenagers, SARS seems to have a less aggressive clinical course in younger children.","Objective: To determine the predictive value of CT and clinical characteristics for short-term disease progression in patients with 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP). Materials and Methods: 224 patients with confirmed 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) infection outside Wuhan who had chest CT examinations were retrospectively screened. Clinical data were obtained from electronic medical records. CT images were reviewed and scored for lesion distribution, lobe and segment involvement, ground-glass opacities, consolidation, and interstitial thickening. All included patients with moderate NCP were observed for at least 14 days from admission to determine whether they exacerbated to severe NCP (progressive group) or not (stable group). CT and clinical characteristics between the two groups were compared, and multivariate logistic regression and sensitivity analyses were performed to identify the risk factors for developing severe NCP. Results: A total of 141 patients with moderate NCP ...","Objectives: To examine heterogeneity of outcomes in protocols of clinical trials of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) and to identify outcomes for prioritization in developing a core outcome set (COS) in this field. Design: This study is a review. Data sources: Databases of ICMJE-accepted clinical trial registry platform were searched on February 14, 2020. Eligibility Criteria: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and non-RCTs of COVID-19 were considered.Conditions of patients include common type, severe type or critical type. Interventions include traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) and Western medicine. We excluded trials that for discharged patients, psychological intervention and complications of COVID-19. Data extraction and synthesis: The general information and outcomes, outcome measurement instruments and measurement times were extracted. The results were analysed by descriptive analysis. Results: 19 registry platforms were searched. A total of 97 protocols were included from 1...","","An outbreak of novel betacoronavirus, SARS-CoV-2 (formerly named 2019-nCoV), began in Wuhan, China in December 2019 and the COVID-19 disease associated with infection has since spread rapidly to multiple countries. Here we report the development of SARS-CoV-2 DETECTR, a rapid (~30 min), low-cost, and accurate CRISPR-Cas12 based lateral flow assay for detection of SARS-CoV-2. We validated this method using contrived reference samples and clinical samples from infected US patients and demonstrated comparable performance to the US CDC SARS-CoV-2 real-time RT-PCR assay.","COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) is the most recent pandemic disease the world is currently managing. It started in China at the end of 2019, and it is diffusing throughout Italy, one of the most affected countries, and it is currently spreading through European countries and USA. Patients affected by COVID-19 are identified employing medical swabs applied mainly to (i) citizens with COVID-19 symptoms such as flu or high temperature, or (ii) citizens that had contacts with COVID-19 patients. A percentage of COVID-19 affected patients needs hospitalisation, whereas a portion needs to be treated in Intensive Care Units (ICUs). Nevertheless, it is a matter of current intuition that COVID-19 infected citizens are more than those detected, and sometime the infection is detected too late. Thus there are many efforts in both tracking people activities as well as diffusing low cost reliable COVID-19 tests for early detection. Starting from mortality rates of diseases caused by viruses in the same family ...","Summary Acute respiratory distress syndrome presents as hypoxia and bilateral pulmonary infiltrates on chest imaging in the absence of heart failure sufficient to account for this clinical state. Management is largely supportive, and is focused on protective mechanical ventilation and the avoidance of fluid overload. Patients with severe hypoxaemia can be managed with early short-term use of neuromuscular blockade, prone position ventilation, or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. The use of inhaled nitric oxide is rarely indicated and both \u03b22 agonists and late corticosteroids should be avoided. Mortality remains at approximately 30%.","Estimating the key epidemiological features of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) epidemic proves to be challenging, given incompleteness and delays in early data reporting, in particular, the severe under-reporting bias in the epicenter, Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. As a result, the current literature reports widely varying estimates. We developed an alternative geo-stratified debiasing estimation framework by incorporating human mobility with case reporting data in three stratified zones, i.e., Wuhan, Hubei Province excluding Wuhan, and mainland China excluding Hubei. We estimated the latent infection ratio to be around 0.12% (18,556 people) and the basic reproduction number to be 3.24 in Wuhan before the city's lockdown on January 23, 2020. The findings based on this debiasing framework have important implications to prioritization of control and prevention efforts.","Abstract Background The safety of performing spinal anaesthesia for both patients and anaesthetists alike in the presence of active infection with the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is unclear. Here, we report the clinical characteristics and outcomes for both patients with COVID-19 and the anaesthetists who provided their spinal anaesthesia. Methods Forty-nine patients with radiologically confirmed COVID-19 for Caesarean section or lower-limb surgery undergoing spinal anaesthesia in Zhongnan Hospital, Wuhan, China participated in this retrospective study. Clinical characteristics and perioperative outcomes were recorded. For anaesthesiologists exposed to patients with COVID-19 by providing spinal anaesthesia, the level of personal protective equipment (PPE) used, clinical outcomes (pulmonary CT scans), and confirmed COVID-19 transmission rates (polymerase chain reaction [PCR]) were reviewed. Results Forty-nine patients with COVID-19 requiring supplementary oxygen before sur...","Advanced age often is associated with functional and immunologic decline and chronic cardiopulmonary diseases that predispose to pneumonia when viral infection occurs. Influenza virus remains the primary viral pathogen in the elderly, although the impact of the other respiratory viruses remains to be defined. The clinical syndromes associated with respiratory viruses frequently are indistinguishable from one another or bacterial pathogens; often, viral illness in older adults exacerbates underlying conditions, complicating diagnosis. Antiviral therapy is available for influenza A and B; specific viral diagnosis, particularly with the use of rapid antigen detection, may be useful for clinical management. Treatment for other viruses primarily is supportive.","BACKGROUND: SARS-CoV-2 has caused a series of COVID-19 globally. SARS-CoV-2 binds angiotensin I converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) of renin-angiotensin system (RAS) and causes prevalent hypokalemia METHODS: The patients with COVID-19 were classified into severe hypokalemia, hypokalemia, and normokalemia group. The study aimed to determine the relationship between hypokalemia and clinical features, the underlying causes and clinical implications of hypokalemia. RESULTS: By Feb 15, 2020, 175 patients with COVID-19 (92 women and 83 men; median age, 46 [IQR, 34-54] years) were admitted to hospital in Wenzhou, China, consisting 39 severe hypokalemia-, 69 hypokalemia-, and 67 normokalemia patients. Gastrointestinal symptoms were not associated with hypokalemia among 108 hypokalemia patients (P&gt;0.05). Body temperature, CK, CK-MB, LDH, and CRP were significantly associated with the severity of hypokalemia (P&lt;0.01). 93% of severe and critically ill patients had hypokalemia which was most common among e...","Abstract As of March 24, 2020, novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been responsible for 379,661 infection cases with 16,428 deaths globally and the number is still increasing rapidly. Herein, we presented four critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection who received supportive care and convalescent plasma. Although all the four patients (including a pregnant woman) recovered from SARS-CoV-2 infection eventually, randomized trials are needed to eliminate the effect of other treatments and investigate the safety and efficacy of convalescent plasma therapy.","Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a recently recognized febrile respiratory illness that first appeared in southern China in November 2002, has since spread to several countries, and has resulted in more than 8000 cases and more than 750 deaths. The disease has been etiologically linked to a novel coronavirus that has been named the SARS-associated coronavirus. It appears to be spread primarily by large droplet transmission. There is no specific therapy, and management consists of supportive care. This article summarizes currently available information regarding the epidemiology, clinical features, etiologic agent, and modes of transmission of the disease, as well as infection control measures appropriate to contain SARS.","BACKGROUND: Rapid triaging, as in the current COVID-19 pandemic, focuses on age and pre-existing medical conditions. In contrast, preoperative assessments use cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) to categorise patients to higher and lower risk independent of diagnostic labels. Since CPET is not feasible in population-based settings, our aims included evaluation of a triage/screening tool for cardiorespiratory risk. METHODS: CPET-derived anaerobic thresholds were evaluated retrospectively in 26 patients with pulmonary arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) who represent a challenging group to risk-categorise. Pulmonary AVM-induced hypoxaemia secondary to intrapulmonary right-to-left shunts, anaemia from underlying hereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasia and metabolic equivalents derived from the 13-point Veterans Specific Activity Questionnaire (VSAQ) were evaluated as part of routine clinical care. Pre-planned analyses evaluated associations and modelling of the anaerobic threshold and p...","Background The illness progress of partial patient of COVID-19 is rapid and the mortality rate is high.we aim to describe the clinical features in death cases with COVID-19. Methods In this single center, observational study, We recruited all Death Cases with COVID-19 from Dec 30, 2019 to Feb 16, 2020 in Intensive care unit of Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital.Demographics, basic diseases, X-ray/CT results, possible therapy strategies and test results when their entrance into admission, ICU and 48 h before death were collected and analyzed. Results This study involved 101 COVID-19 dead cases in Intensive care unit of Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital.47 patients went directly to the ICU because of critical condition, and 54 patients were transferred to ICU with aggravated condition.57 (56.44%) were laboratory confirmed by RT-PCR, and 44 (43.6%) were consistent with clinical diagnostic criteria.The cases included 64 males and 37 females with average age of 65.46 years (SD 9.74). The blood type distributi...","","Viral infections of the newborn result in significant morbidity and mortality each year. The fetus and newborn are particularly wlnerable to viral infection. The range of expression may vary from no clinical disease to devastating illness and infection occurring before, during, or after birth. Nursing management is determined by the specific viral infection, the severity of the illness, and the unique conditions of the newborn and his/her family. Promising new therapies are on the horizon that may lessen the severity of viral disease. Until such time, the major thrusts of management of neonatal viral disease are prevention of infection and supportive care for the acutely ill newborn.","Abstract First reported in September 2012, the Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) has resulted in 206 laboratory-confirmed deaths, with a 42% mortality rate as of 27 March 2014. Closely related coronaviruses have been isolated in bats, but most evidence suggests that humans have become infected directly from camels in a number of separate transmission events, with limited human-to-human transmission reported thus far. The majority of cases originated in the Middle East (predominantly Saudi Arabia), including all the index cases. Clinical manifestations primarily involve fever, chills, and rapidly progressive respiratory failure, often resulting in an acute respiratory distress syndrome, with a minority of patients reporting gastrointestinal symptoms, as well. The majority of critically ill patients are older males with medical co-morbidities, and a large number of minimally symptomatic cases likely go undetected. Unfortunately, attempted therapies have all been ...","Abstract Antibodies to SARS-Coronavirus (SARS-CoV)-specific B cell epitopes might recognize the pathogen and interrupt its adherence to and penetration of host cells. Hence, these epitopes could be useful for diagnosis and as vaccine constituents. Using the phage-displayed peptide library screening method and purified Fab fragments of immunoglobulin G (IgG Fab) from normal human sera and convalescent sera from SARS-CoV-infected patients as targets, 11 B cell epitopes of SARS-CoV spike glycoprotein (S protein) and membrane protein (M protein) were screened. After a bioinformatics tool was used to analyze these epitopes, four epitope-based S protein dodecapeptides corresponding to the predominant epitopes were chosen for synthesis. Their antigenic specificities and immunogenicities were studied in vitro and in vivo. Flow cytometry and ELISPOT analysis of lymphocytes as well as a serologic analysis of antibody showed that these peptides could trigger a rapid, highly effective, and relativ...","Abstract Purpose The aim of the study was to identify characteristic clinical features and outcomes of critically ill patients with confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). Materials and Methods This retrospective study enrolled all patients admitted to a 12-bed SARS intensive care unit (ICU) in a tertiary care medical center in Taipei between May 15 and July 17, 2003. Patients with positive results of either reverse transcriptase\u2013polymerase chain reaction or antibody to SARS coronavirus were defined as SARS cases and others with negative results as control cases. Results Of the 50 patients, 14 had confirmed SARS. Demographics were similar between the 2 groups. The highest leukocyte and neutrophil counts, lactate dehydrogenase, and creatine kinase; positive end-expiratory pressure; and use of corticosteroids, ribavirin, and intravenous immunoglobulin were higher in the SARS group. In contrast, the lowest lymphocyte count and the ratio of Pao 2 to the fraction of inspired oxy...","Abstract H7N9 viruses quickly spread between mammalian hosts and carry the risk of human-to-human transmission, as shown by the 2013 outbreak. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), lung failure, and fulminant pneumonia are major lung diseases in H7N9 patients. Transplantation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) is a promising choice for treating virus-induced pneumonia, and was used to treat H7N9-induced ARDS in 2013. The transplant of MSCs into patients with H7N9-induced ARDS was conducted at a single center through an open-label clinical trial. Based on the principles of voluntariness and informed consent, 44 patients with H7N9-induced ARDS were included as a control group, while 17 patients with H7N9-induced ARDS acted as an experimental group with allogeneic menstrual-blood-derived MSCs. It was notable that MSC transplantation significantly lowered the mortality of the experimental group, compared with the control group (17.6% died in the experimental group while 54.5% died in t...","Background: Excessive monocyte/macrophage activation with the development of a cytokine storm and subsequent acute lung injury, leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a feared consequence of infection with COVID-19. The ability to recognize and potentially intervene early in those patients at greatest risk of developing this complication could be of great clinical utility. Methods: We performed detailed flow cytometric analysis of peripheral blood samples from 28 COVID-19 patients treated at Xian No.8 Hospital and the First Affiliated Hospital of Xian Jiaotong University in early 2020 in an attempt to identify factors that could help predict severity of disease and patient outcome. Findings: While we did not detect significant differences in the number of monocytes between patients with COVID-19 and normal healthy individuals,we did identify significant morphological and functional differences, which are more pronounced in patients requiring prolonged hospitalization ..."],"title":["Critical care management of adults with community-acquired severe respiratory viral

However, when that is not available, there may be a need to consider treatment regimens from analogous disease patterns. Matching clinical dispositions can be considered in efforts to develop therapeutic interventions. Moreover, dire outcomes of illness may be overcome with adjunctive measures that do not necessarily cure underlying disease. Rather, supportive care as well as adjunctive countermeasures may assist patients in surviving viral illness.","Given the practical constraints on substantially increasing the global availability of ECMO services in the next few months, it is important to emphasise the other evidence-based treatment options that can be provided for patients with severe ARDS from COVID-19 (figure). 2 Before endotracheal intubation, it is important to consider a trial of high-flow nasal oxygen for patients with moderately severe hypoxaemia. This procedure might avoid the need for intubation and mechanical ventilation because it provides high concentrations of humidified oxygen, low levels of positive endexpiratory pressure, and can facilitate the elimination of carbon dioxide. 4 WHO guidelines support the use of high-flow nasal oxygen in some patients, but they urge close monitoring for clinical deterioration that could result in the need for emergent intubations because such procedures might increase the risk of infection to health-care workers. 5 For patients with COVID-19 who require endotracheal intubation, use of low tidal volume (6 mL/kg per predicted bodyweight) with a plateau airway pressure of less than 30 cm H 2 O, and increasing the respiratory rate to 35 breaths per min as needed, is the mainstay of lungprotective ventilation. If the hypoxaemia progresses to a PaO 2 :FiO 2 ratio of less than 100-150 mm Hg, there are several therapeutic options. The level of positive endexpiratory pressure can be increased by 2-3 cm H 2 O every 15-30 min to improve oxygen saturation to 88-90%, with the goal of maintaining a plateau airway pressure of less than 30 cm H 2 O. Lower driving pressures (plateau airway pressure minus positive end-expiratory pressure) with a target of 13-15 cm H 2 O can also be used. If the patient is not responding to adjustment of the level of positive end-expiratory pressure, additional strategies might stabilise them. Recruitment manoeuvres probably have little value, 6 prone positioning should be instituted, unless there is a specific contraindication, and can be initiated along with the interventions already described. For persistent refractory hypoxaemia even with prone positioning, neuromuscular blockade, and efforts to optimise positive end-expiratory pressure therapy, there are additional options. Inhaled 5-20 ppm NO might improve oxygenation. Insertion of an oesophageal balloon to measure transpulmonary pressures to set an optimal positive end-expiratory pressure can be considered in patients with moderate-to-severe obesity, although a 2019 trial in patients with ARDS did not show the benefit of this procedure in most patients. 7 Fluid management is important to consider as a measure to reduce pulmonary oedema. 8 In the absence of shock, fluid conservative therapy is recommended to achieve a negative fluid balance of 0\u00b75 to 1\u00b70 L per day. In the presence of shock, fluid balance might be achieved with renal replacement therapy, especially if there is associated acute kidney injury and oliguria. Antibiotics should be considered since secondary bacterial infections have been reported in patients with COVID-19. 9 Glucocorticoids should be avoided in view of the evidence that they can be harmful in cases of viral pneumonia and ARDS from influenza. 10 Rescue therapy with high-dose vitamin C can also be considered. 11 Finally, ECMO should be considered using the inclusion and exclusion criteria of the EOLIA trial. 3 Since treatment of severe ARDS from COVID-19 is an ongoing challenge, it is important to learn from the patients who have been treated to gain an understanding of the disease's epidemiology, biological mechanisms, and the effects of new pharmacological interventions. Currently, there are some research groups working to coordinate and disseminate key information, including information on patients who have been treated with ECMO for COVID-19, although an accurate estimate of the number of such patients is not currently available. The Extracorporeal Life Support Organization is an international non-profit consortium that plans to maintain a registry of patients to facilitate an improved understanding of how ECMO is being used for patients with COVID-19.","This study was a randomized, double-blinded, controlled, phase 3 trial comparing high-titer anti-influenza plasma (HAI antibody titers of \u22651:80) to low titer plasma (HAI \u2264 1:10) in hospitalized children and adults with severe influenza A. 43% of participants enrolled were in the ICU and 70% of the non-ICU patients required oxygen. The study was terminated in July 2018 when independent efficacy analysis revealed low conditional power to show an effect of high-titer plasma even if full accrual was achieved. The proportional odds ratio for improved clinical status by 6-point ordinal scale on Day 7 was 1.22 (95% CI [0.65, 2.29], p = 0.54). Despite encouraging results from prior studies, this study and the INSIGHT IVIG study (above) suggest that polyclonal antibody therapies may not significantly improve outcomes in severe influenza A. 14.7. Examining clinical data on potential adjunctive therapies in influenza Nelson Lee, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Canada. The meeting was closed with a review of prior works on adjunctive therapies in influenza. As previously noted, the high mortality rates in emerging diseases such as novel coronavirus infectious (MERS and SARS) and novel avian influenza strains (influenza A(H5N1) and A(H7N9)) have raised questions about the possible role of pro-inflammatory responses in the pathogenesis. Prior studies demonstrated cytokine hyperactivation associated with uncontrolled viral replication; and a sustained inflammatory state correlates with disease progression leading to respiratory failure and ARDS. Therapeutics targeting the pathogen alone have thus far largely unsuccessful in reversing such processes.","Up to now, no antiviral treatment has been recommended for coronavirus treatment except supportive care and organ support [5, 20] . In current clinical practice, arbidol was used as an antiviral treatment for SARS-CoV-2 infected patients, but the efficacy remains to be proved. Other antiviral medications including remdesivir, lopinavir and traditional Chinese medicine are still being verified in clinical trials. Furthermore, application of intravenous immunoglobulin is recommended to enhance the ability of anti-infection for critically ill patients and steroids are recommended for patients with ARDS, for as short duration of treatment as possible [21] . In this study, 96.04% patients received antiviral therapy, 98.02% received antibacterial therapy. Application of glucocorticoid mainly depended on the severity of inflammatory response. In the early outbreak of COVID-19, all the non-survivors received oxygen inhalation therapy including high flow oxygen inhalation (77.23%), but quite a low proportion of patients received machine ventilation partly due to limited medical resources against the steeply increasing number of patients at early outbreak.

Existing knowledge highlights the need for data regarding supportive care and adjunctive pharmacologic therapy that is specific for critically ill patients with severe RVI. Data on supportive management in resource-restricted settings are severely lacking. There is a need for more pragmatic and efficient designs to test antiviral therapeutics, individually and in combination in patients with severe RVI who are at increased risk for complications from both the disease and treatments. Adaptive randomized-controlled trial that tests several treatments, such as the REMAP-CAP trial (NCT02735707), may represent an efficient approach.","In addition to supportive care, patients with severe adenovirus pneumonia and ARDS may benefit from antiviral therapy. Cidofovir, a mononucleotide analog of cytosine, reduces viral load and improves clinical symptoms in patients with hematopoietic stem cell transplant and invasive adenoviral disease compared with historical controls. 169 In a case series of 7 immunocompetent adults with adenovirus pneumonia who were administered cidofovir within 48 hours of diagnosis, all survived and had radiographic resolution of pneumonia by 21 days. 170 Brincidofovir, a lipid-linked derivative of cidofovir, is currently under phase III clinical trials in hematopoietic stem cell transplant patients. 171 Pooled human IVIG has high levels of neutralizing antibodies against adenoviruses and can be used as adjunctive therapy. 169 In a retrospective review, the use of corticosteroids in immunocompetent patients with adenovirus pneumonia did not show any benefit. 172 SUMMARY Respiratory viruses are a common cause of severe pneumonia and ARDS in adults. The advent of new diagnostic technologies, particularly multiplex reaction-PCR, have increased the recognition of viral respiratory infections in critically ill adults. Supportive care for adults with ARDS caused by respiratory viruses is similar to the care of patients with ARDS from other causes. Although antiviral therapy is available for some respiratory viral infections, further research is needed to determine which groups of patients would benefit. ","As a novel disease, COVID-19 has just started to manifest its full clinical course throughout thousands of patients. In most cases, patients can recover gradually without sequelae. However, similar to SARS and MERS, COVID-19 is also associated with high morbidity and mortality in patients with severe cases. Therefore, building a prognosis model for the disease is essential for health-care agencies to prioritize their services, especially in resource-constrained areas. Based on clinical studies reported thus far, the following factors may affect or be associated with the prognosis of COVID-19 patients (Table 3):Age: Age was the most important factor for the prognosis of SARS 99, which is also true for COVID-19. COVID-19 mainly happened at the age of 30-65 with 47.7% of those patients being over 50 in a study of 8,866 cases as described above 37. Patients who required intensive care were more likely to have underlying comorbidities and complications and were significantly older than those who did not (at the median age of 66 versus 51) 34, suggesting age as a prognostic factor for the outcome of COVID-19 patients.Sex: SARS-CoV-2 has infected more men than women (0.31/100,000 versus 0.27/100,000), as described above 37.Comorbidities and complications: Patients with COVID-19 who require intensive care are more likely to suffer from acute cardiac injury and arrhythmia 34. Cardiac events were also the main reason for death in SARS patients 55,65,99. It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 can also bind to ACE2-positive cholangiocytes, which might lead to liver dysfunctions in COVID-19 patients 100. It is worth noting that age and underlying disease are strongly correlated and might interfere with each other 55.Abnormal laboratory findings: The C-reactive protein (CRP) level in blood reflects the severity of inflammation or tissue injury and has been proposed to be a potential prognostic factor for disease, response to therapy, and ultimate recovery 101. The correlation of CRP level to the severity and prognosis of COVID-19 has also been proposed 101. In addition, elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and creatine kinase (CK) may also help predict the outcome. These enzymes are expressed extensively in multiple organs, especially in the heart and liver, and are released during tissue damage 102,103. Thus, they are traditional markers for heart or liver dysfunctions.Major clinical symptoms: Chest radiography and temporal progression of clinical symptoms should be considered together with the other issues for the prediction of outcomes and complications of COVID-19.Use of steroids: As described above, steroids are immunosuppressant commonly used as an adjunctive therapy for infectious diseases to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage 104. Since a high dosage of corticosteroids was widely used in severe SARS patients, many survivors suffered from avascular osteonecrosis with life-long disability and poor life quality 105. Thus, if needed, steroids should be used at low dosage and for a short time in COVID-19 patients.Mental stress: As described above, during the COVID-19 outbreak many patients have suffered from extraordinary stress as they often endured long periods of quarantine and extreme uncertainty and witnessed the death of close family members and fellow patients. It is imperative to provide psychological counseling and long-term support to help these patients recover from the stress and return to normal life 66.","Adjunctive therapies were used in both groups. Ribavirin was used significantly more often in the ECMO group compared to the control group (82 vs. 24%, P = 0.001), interferon was also used more in the ECMO cohort compared to controls (65 vs. 24%, P = 0.016), and the use of steroids was similar in both groups (53 vs. 72%, P = 0.24). At day one of eligibility to ECMO, more patients in the control group required hemodynamic support with norepinephrine compared to ECMO group; however, both groups had similar use of epinephrine and dobutamine, continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT), modes of ventilation, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), and neuromuscular blocking agents (Tables 2 and 3). Alveolar recruitment maneuver was used in one patient in the ECMO group. None of the patients received prone ventilation. Throughout days 1\u201314, more patients in the control group developed renal impairment and had significantly lower PaO2/FiO2 ratio (Table 3). Other laboratory values were similar between both groups (Table 4). However, due to the small sample size, it was not feasible to adjust for all confounding factors.   ","Treatment principle: treat the patients to improve the symptoms and underlying diseases, actively prevent potential complications and secondary infection; provide timely measures to support organ function. Hypoxic respiratory failure and severe ARDS. Give oxygen therapy immediately to patients with ARDS, and closely monitor them for signs of clinical deterioration, such as rapidly progressive respiratory failure. Consider severe hypoxemic respiratory failure when standard oxygen therapy fails. When patients have increased frequency of breathing (&gt; 30 times/min) and hypoxemia (SpO2 &lt; 90% or PaO2 &lt; 60 mmHg) even with oxygen delivered via a face mask and reservoir bag (gas flow of 10~15 L/min, FiO2 0.60\u20130.95), it may be considered as hypoxic respiratory failure.ARDS is a status of severe acute hypoxic respiratory failure caused by increased pulmonary capillary permeability and alveolar epithelial cell damage. It can be divided into mild, moderate and severe conditions according to the Berlin definition [38] (Table 6). HFNO. Under the support of standard oxygen therapy, to maintain SpO2 above 93% stills hard, and the breathing rate increases rapidly, then HFNO should be considered. HFNO can deliver 60 L/min of gas flow and FiO2 up to 1.0. Generally, gas flow is initially set as 30\u201340 L/min and oxygen concentration 50%\u201360%, which is well tolerated and coordinated. Then settings can be adjusted according to the oxygenation status of patients. Compared with standard oxygen therapy, HFNO is able to reduce the chance of tracheal intubation. Patients with hypercapnia (like exacerbation of obstructive lung disease, cardiogenic pulmonary edema), hemodynamic instability, multi-organ failure, or abnormal mental status should not be given HFNO. HFNO may be safe in patients with mild-moderate and non-worsening hypercapnia. However, if the respiratory distress still exists or even worsens dramatically under HFNO (FiO2 &gt; 70%, gas flow &gt; 50 L/min for 1 hour), the respiratory supporting strategy should be changed.NIV. NIV provides a certain positive pressure ventilation effect through the positive pressure formed by the closed mask. HFNO combined with intermittent short-term NIV (1\u20132 h) support may be useful to reduce respiratory power consumption and improve oxygenation. But NIV guidelines recommend the use of respiratory support therapy in hypoxemic respiratory failure or pandemic viral illness. Limited data showed a high failure rate of NIV in MERS patients. Invasive mechanical ventilation should be considered in case the ARDS still exists and even acutely deteriorates in NIV process (about 1 h). Patients with hemodynamic instability, multiple organ failure, or abnormal mental status should not receive NIV.Invasive mechanical ventilation. Under the support of HFNO (the demand for FiO2 &gt; 70% and gas flow &gt; 50 L/min) or NIV, ARDS still exists and even acutely deteriorates, invasive mechanical ventilation should be implemented as soon as possible.Endotracheal intubation should be carried out by trained and experienced provider using airborne precautions, since endotracheal intubation is an operation that may produce a large number of contagious aerosols.The strategy of protective lung ventilation should be implemented in invasive mechanical ventilation: lower tidal volume (4\u20136 ml/kg), lower plateau pressure (&lt; 30 cmH2O), and appropriate PEEP. For patients with moderate-severe ARDS (PaO2/FiO2 &lt; 150), it is recommended to use higher PEEP, apply prone ventilation for more than 12 h per day and adopt deep sedation and analgesia muscle relaxation strategy within the first 48 h of mechanical ventilation. For patients with severe acute hypoxic respiratory failure, we should pay attention to and prevent ventilator-associated lung injury after mechanical ventilation.Extracorporeal Life Support (ECLS). In the process of invasive mechanical ventilation when the patient is still in the state of hypoxia, combined with increased partial pressure of carbon dioxide (excluding ventilation dysfunction, PaCO2 &gt; 60 mmHg), especially after muscle relaxation and prone ventilation, it is necessary to consider to implement ECLS. However, it is suggested that ECLS treatment should only be carried out under the condition that the professional center is with access to expertise. Currently the ECLS in ICU includes VV-ECMO (blood is pumped from femoral vein, and returns to right atrium through internal jugular vein after oxygenation through membrane oxygenator) and VA-ECMO (blood is pumped from femoral vein and directly enters aortic system through femoral artery after oxygenation through membrane oxygenator). For patients with severe refractory hypoxemia, neuromuscular blockade can improve oxygen supply, especially if there is still evidence of ventilator-patient dyssynchrony after the use of sedatives. However, neuromuscular blockade through continuous infusion should not be routinely used in patients with moderate-severe ARDS; Where available, ECMO in conjunction with low tidal-volume mechanical ventilation can be considered in the treatment of patients with severe refractory hypoxemia in whom standard therapy are failing; Routine use of high-frequency oscillatory ventilation (HFOV) in patients with moderate-severe ARDS is not beneficial, but may be harmful. However, HFOV may still be regarded as a rescue therapy for patients with severe ARDS and refractory hypoxemia. ECMO can be used in some severe ARDS patients (lung injury score &gt; 3 or pH &lt; 7.2 due to uncompensated hypercapnia), but it is not recommended for all ARDS patients. It can be considered to use extracorporeal carbon dioxide removal for ARDS patients, if there is more supportive research evidence in the future.","No available data support parenteral over oral antibiotic therapy, nor has one antibiotic agent has been found to be superior to others. Some evidence suggests that including rifampin (combined with at least one other anti-staphylococcal antibiotic) improves outcome; clindamycin and b-lactam agents are also frequently used. No adjunctive treatment (e.g., hyperbaric oxygen, granulocyte colony stimulating factor, larval biotherapy) has been proven beneficial. When treatment of osteomyelitis fails, surgeons should opt for the most minor amputation compatible with good residual foot function. Clinicians should monitor patients for at least a year to ensure that they have achieved apparent resolution of infection.","The use of high-dose steroids has been anecdotally reported to contribute to decrease in fever and need for oxygen supplementation. 14 A study from Guangzhou, China has suggested that the early administration of high-dose steroids together with CPAP ventilation is associated with a lower mortality. 15 However, these findings are not based on adequately controlled data and there remain concerns regarding the use of high-dose steroids. The use of CPAP is certainly no longer recommended (see Section 2.5.2). In a retrospective analysis of Hong Kong patients who had received ribavirin in combination with different steroid regimens, patients who received initial high dose pulsed methylprednisolone intravenously had less oxygen requirement, better radiological improvement and less likelihood to require rescue pulse steroid use than patients who received non-pulse steroid therapy. However, the overall mortality rate, and requirement for mechanical ventilation or admission to the intensive care unit was the same for both regimens. 16 Recommendation The current recommendation is to consider moderate doses of steroid (prednisolone 30 -40 mg/day or iv equivalent) in severely ill patients with SARS with increasing oxygen requirements who have a PaO 2 , 10 kPa or O 2 sats , 90% on air.","Supportive treatment is aimed at suppressing the inflammatory and detrimental immune response, usually with cortico steroids. However, there are no controlled studies to prove any beneficial effect of cortico steroids, only anecdotal reports [EBM grade III]. a g n o s t i c a p p r o a c h t o F ","There are increasing data to suggest that adjunctive treatment with corticosteroids may be beneficial in many patients with severe pneumonia. However, the practice has not been uniformly adopted, and some data suggest that patients with pulmonary infection due to influenza or Aspergillus may have worse outcomes if corticosteroids are used.","Of note, as documented in a series of randomized clinical trials (RCT), low or physiologic dose of corticosteroids treatment did not reduce mortality from septic shock caused by primary lung infections, but it could bring clinical benefits to secondary outcomes, such as earlier reversal of shock, shorter duration to exit from ICU and mechanical ventilation9,10. Besides, salvage corticosteroids treatment for severe patients with advanced ARDS could alleviate the pulmonary fibrosis and prevent progressive pathological deterioration11, which provides a good framework for explaining why some critical patients with SARS infection benefit from rescue corticosteroids therapy. More importantly, mortality benefit favored the severe HIN1-illness in the adjunctive treatment group with low dose of corticosteroids12. Evidently, all these results strongly suggest that proper use of low-dose corticosteroids may bring survival advantages for critically ill patients with 2019-nCoV, but this treatment should be strictly performed on NCP patients with definite clinical indications (such as refractory ARDS, sepsis or septic shock) according to the recommended guidelines.","Currently there are no immunomodulatory agents that have been conclusively proven to be of benefit in severe influenza. Corticosteroids are associated with increased risk of superinfection, prolonged viral replication, and increased risk of death, and should not be used (Rodrigo et al., 2016) . For most other adjunctive therapies, the data is less clear. The areas where adjunctive therapies have some supporting data and may be worth further studies were then reviewed. The combination of oseltamivir and azithromycin had been shown to downregulate the proinflammatory cytokines, without impairing viral clearance in one small RCT . The triple combination of oseltamivir, clarithromycin, and naproxen was demonstrated to reduce adverse outcomes in another study (Hung et al., 2017) , but these findings, though intriguing, should be confirmed. Sirolimus has been used with apparent benefit in critically ill influenza patients in the context of an RCT (Wang et al., 2014) , confirmatory studies of this approach without concomitant corticosteroid therapy can be explored. The efficacy of other agents with potential immunomodulating effects, including N-acetylcysteine (NAC), statins, nitazoxanide (NTZ), IFNs, Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPAR) agonists, cyclooxygenase (COX 2) inhibitors, recombinant angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), diltiazem, and herbal medicine, all have some supporting preclinical or clinical data, but these need to be studied more intensely, preferably by RCTs .","Some relatively inexpensive and simple critical care interventions dramatically improve patient outcomes, including the introduction of oxygen concentrators, oximetry monitoring, and supplemental oxygen in Papua New Guinea, which decreased pediatric pneumonia case fatality by 35% (64). Development of low-cost intensive care equipment, such as inexpensive ventilators (65, 66), and relocation of ICU equipment production into low- or low\u2013middle-income countries to avoid expensive import from North America and Europe may help drive down the cost (67). Further evaluation of cost-effective interventions is needed to understand which ones are appropriate, feasible, and sustainable. In resource-limited settings, cost analyses would not only guide decision-making around resource allocation in the ICU, but also help determine health infrastructure and systems needs to address the long-term morbidity of ICU survivors (68).","The treatment of ARDS has significantly evolved over the past several decades. Perhaps the greatest improvement in management developed from studies involving lung-protective ventilation (9). Other interventions such as inhaled nitric oxide (112), fluid management (113), use of steroids (114), and prone positioning (115) are being further investigated and validated. However, specific treatment for RSV infection remains lacking. Despite the substantial short and long-term morbidity and mortality associated with RSV disease in children, the current management for RSV infection consists of supportive care, in the form of oxygen supplementation, adequate hydration, and mechanical ventilation for those who develop respiratory failure. Multiple therapeutic strategies have been explored with very limited success, and a vital need remains for an effective disease treatment.","In additional antiviral therapy, special attention should be paid to ventilator management and other supportive care. Similar to ARDS of any other cause, patients who require invasive mechanical ventilation should be treated with a low-tidalvolume strategy targeting 6 mL/kg of ideal body weight. [39] [40] [41] In cases of severe ARDS, consideration should be given to salvage therapies, including prone positioning and paralytic therapy for the first 48 hours following intubation. [42] [43] [44] Although noninvasive positive pressure ventilation has been tried in patients with ARDS, 45,46 reports from the 2009 H1N1 pandemic suggest that this strategy is not effective in patients with ARDS caused by influenza. 47 Patients with severe viral infection are at risk for secondary bacterial pneumonia, because of both the effects of the virus alone and the risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia from prolonged mechanical ventilation. 48, 49 Invasive tests, such as bronchoscopy, may be helpful to differentiate bacterial coinfection from viral pneumonia alone. 5, 50 In general, the empiric use of antibiotic therapy in patients with viral pneumonia should be avoided and may increase the risk of antibiotic resistance and subsequent nosocomial infection. 51,52 The use of intravenous corticosteroids in the treatment of ARDS has generally not improved outcomes. 53,54 In patients with ARDS related to influenza and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), adjunctive corticosteroids have not improved outcomes and may increase the risk subsequent nosocomial infection. 55, 56 Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) gained attention during the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic after several studies reported low mortality in patients with viral ARDS treated with this modality. 57, 58 The only randomized clinical trial that compared ARDS treatment with ECMO with conventional care, the CESAR trial, enrolled a significant proportion of patients with influenza. 59 However, this trial had several significant methodological limitations; in particular, more patients in the ECMO arm were treated with a low-tidalvolume ventilation strategy compared with patients in the conventional arm. In a retrospective matched cohort study of patients with influenza A (H1N1) and ARDS, the mortality in patients treated with ECMO was similar to propensity score-matched controls not treated with ECMO. 60 ","Patients presenting severe respiratory conditions related to SARS-CoV-2 infection and/or to its complications. Adjunctive goals of clinical management at this stage are:","Because of the putative anti-inflammatory effects, statins have been proposed as adjunctive therapy in influenza (NCT02056340), although large clinical trials in patients in ARDS have not demonstrated clinical benefit [35]. A secondary analysis of data from RCTs using latent class analysis suggested that patients with ARDS may be classified into hyper-inflammatory and hypo-inflammatory subphenotypes, and treatment with simvastatin compared to placebo was associated with improved survival in the hyper-inflammatory but not in the hypo-inflammatory subphenotype [36]. Further studies are needed to examine whether adjunctive pharmacologic interventions would be beneficial in targeted subphenotypes of severe RVI.","Supportive therapy includes bedrest, adequate nutrition, monitoring vital signs and oxygen saturation, prevention of dehydration and maintaining water, electrolyte, and acid-base balance. For severe cases, it may be necessary to proactively prevent complications and secondary Y. Yang, et al. Journal of Autoimmunity xxx (xxxx) xxxx infections, treat underlying diseases and provide organ function support according to the patients' condition such as that reported by Chen et all that involved the administration of intravenous immunoglobulin therapy to 27 of such patients [37] . Supplemental oxygen should be administered to patients with decreased oxygen saturation. In Huang's study [26] , four (10%) patients needed invasive mechanical ventilation, and two received extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). In Chen's study [37] , 75 of 99 patients received oxygen therapy, 13 patients required non-invasive mechanical ventilation, four patients needed an invasive ventilator to assist ventilation, and three patients were treated with ECMO. In Wang's study [83] , of the 36 patients in the ICU, four patients received high-flow oxygen therapy, 15 patients received non-invasive ventilation, and 17 patients received invasive ventilation (four patients switched to ECMO). In Guan's study, 418 of 1099 patients received oxygen therapy, 67 patients received mechanical ventilation, and ECMO was adopted in 5 severe cases [85] .","The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.05.20031591 doi: medRxiv preprint Table 3 shows the main management strategies, comorbid conditions, and clinical outcomes of all the COVID-19 patients. In the AMI group, in addition to antiviral and antibiotic therapies, cardioprotective medications such as amiodarone and cedilla were used by four patients to improve the cardiac function. However, the non-definite AMI patients with and without cardiac markers abnormalities did not use cardioprotective medication. All the 53 patients were administered nasal cannula oxygen therapy during admission for respiratory support; non-invasive ventilation or high-flow nasal cannula oxygen therapy was performed for five AMI and three non-definite AMI patients with cardiac marker abnormalities. Notably, in the AMI group, invasive mechanical ventilation was used in three patients and ECMO in one patient due to extremely severe ARDS.","The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is During the study period, two (9.5%) patients in the LPV/r group, 2 (12.5%) in the arbidol group and 1 (14.3%) in the control group used gamma globulin (10 g, once a day, for 2-3 days). Moreover, 6 (28.6%) patients in the LPV/r group, 2 (12.5%) patients in the arbidol group, and 2 (28.6%) patients in the control group used glucocorticoids (methylprednisolone 40 mg, once a day, for 3-5 days) without statistical difference among 3 groups (P=0.547). Eighteen (85.7%) patients (13 patients using low flow supply, 5 using high flow oxygen supply) in the LPV/r group, 11 (68.8%) patients (9 patients using low flow, 2 high flow oxygen supply) in the arbidol group and 6 (85.7%) patients (all using low flow oxygen supply) in the control group received oxygen therapy, which did not show statistical difference (P =0.466) (table 1).","To provide useful insight, Table 1 compares the Wuhan report with our experience with the first ICU admissions caused by influenza A (H1N1)pdm2009 [2] . Among 37 ventilated patients in the Wuhan cohort [1] , only 4 (10.8%) were alive and free of mechanical ventilation 28-days after ICU admission. In contrast, a first look suggests that 28-day survival rate in the European influenza cohort was more than doubled. This can be due to the delayed intubation (patients admitted in ICU when already under mechanical ventilation or requiring a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) 60%) associated with the extreme working conditions and the limited resources in Wuhan. Indeed, data from a detailed surveillance study from the China CDC indicates that mortality rates in critically ill patients from other Chinese provinces were lower than 50% [3] . This analysis reports that overall, 80% of confirmed cases were mild, 15% of severe cases required hospitalisation and 5% were critically ill. However, as many patients can remain asymptomatic or with very low symptomatology and because criteria of hospital admission were not standardised, the proportion of patients requiring supportive techniques for hypoxemia is probably lower. COVID-19 is showing respiratory deterioration 7-9 days after onset, which is double the 3-5 days period documented in influenza pandemic, suggesting that it cannot be related to the viral load. This interpretation may justify the high rate of use of steroids in the Wuhan report [1] . Despite some controversies, steroids, alpha-interferon and macrolides are not beneficial [4] . Prior experience with viral pneumonia, including influenza and MERS-coronavirus, suggest that steroids can contribute to higher mortality, increase viral replication with longer periods of viral clearance and more superinfections (including invasive pulmonary aspergillosis, as already reported in the Wuhan cohort) [5, 6] .","SARS was characterised by a rapidly progressive atypical pneumonia refractory to conventional antibiotic therapy. Next efforts to treat SARS patients mainly were based on the use of ribavirin and corticosteroids. Ribavirin, which targets IMP dehydrogenase, has been known a long time as a broad-spectrum antiviral agent. However, it is efficacy in SARS patients remains questionable and in vitro studies also did not show significant antiviral activity (Cinatl et al., 2003a) . More recent studies demonstrated that ribavirin even enhanced the infectivity of SARS-CoV in mice (Barnard et al., 2006) . Collectively these data do not support the use of ribavirin for treating SARS in humans. The use of steroids in SARS patients was mainly based on the observation that a clinical deterioration was observed in most patients late during the disease when SARS-CoV became undetectable. In most cases the concomitant use of other drugs confounded the results and the fact that most studies did not contain a control group made it quite difficult to determine whether steroids exerted a beneficial effect. Although efforts were made to control the infection through use of antivirals and corticosteroids, isolation and quarantine measures eventually proved instrumental in control of the epidemic at that time.","We then examined the two critically ill patients who received DIP adjunctive therapy. A 70-year-old 298 man with very low oxygen saturation and has suffered from hypoxia and multiorgan dysfunction at All patients had chest CT scans and showed typical multiple patchy ground-glass shadows in the 310 lungs before the treatment. In the DIP treated patients, the lesions had varied degree of absorption."," The patient should rest in bed, being monitored for vital signs (heart rate, pulse oxygen saturation, respiratory rate, blood pressure) and given supportive treatment to ensure sufficient energy intake and balance for water, electrolytes, acid-base levels and other internal environment factors (Strong recommendation).The patient should be monitored for blood routine, CRP, PCT, organ function (liver enzyme, bilirubin, myocardial enzyme, creatinine, urea nitrogen, Urine volume, etc.), coagulation function, arterial blood gas analysis and chest imaging (Strong recommendation).The patient should be given effective oxygen therapy, including nasal catheter, mask oxygen, high flow nasal oxygen therapy (HFNO), non-invasive ventilation (NIV) or invasive mechanical ventilation (Strong recommendation). ","Infection is confirmed by positive test to SARS-CoV-2 by realtime RT-PCR, isolation in cell culture of SARS-CoV-2 from clinical specimens, or rising serum antibody concentrations. If laboratory confirmatory tests are not available, clinical and epidemiological criteria such as those advocated by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) may be used (https://www.cdc.gov/ coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/clinical-criteria.html?CDC_AA_ refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fcoronavirus%2F2019-ncov%2Fclinical-criteria.html). Based on current best evidence, supportive treatment and organ support remain the focus of ICU care. Specific treatments such as the use of corticosteroids to control the inflammatory response, and antivirals, particularly the combination of lopinavir/ritonavir and ribavirin have been used, but are unproven to improve outcomes [1] . The cautionary experience of SARS-CoV provided a lesson of the desperate pursuit to find effective treatment. During this outbreak, the use of highdose corticosteroids (&gt; 3 g methylprednisolone in the acute phase of disease) used to modulate the immune response was not conclusively shown to improve outcomes, but resulted in devastating steroid induced complications [14] .","Unfortunately, to date, there are no vaccines against SARS-CoV-2, and there is the awareness that several months may be required to undergo extensive testing, and determine vaccine safety and efficacy before a potential wide use. Similarly, there is no single specific antiviral therapy; COVID-19 and the main treatments are supportive care (e.g., supportive therapy and monitoring-oxygen therapy and fluid management). In the last days, recombinant interferon (IFN) with ribavirin and infusions of blood plasma from people who have recovered from the COVID-19 are under evaluation, to treat infected subjects with encouraging results [14] .","The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.26.20041426 doi: medRxiv preprint for coronavirus infections except for supportive treatment [17] . Immunoglobulin may enhance the ability of anti-infection in severely ill patient, and steroids are considered in those patients with ARDS. Oxygen inhalation was important to avoid to ARDS for the COVID-19 paitents with hypoxemia. In this study, 76.6% patients receivd oxygen by nasal cathete, and 90% received antiviral therapy, and 38.1% received glucocorticoids. CDC reported that the case-fatality rate (CFR) of COVID-19 the overall case--fatality rate (CFR) of COVID-19 was 2.3% in confirmed cases, and CFR among critical cases may reach 49.0% [11] . Nevertheless, most of patients were still treated in the hospital. Anoter retrospective study suggest the CFR was about 11% [13] . Statistical analysis of this study found that the CFR was 14.2%, and most of them were over 70 year-old patients accompanying with chronic illness.In the past one month, numerous effective measures, including blocking cities and roads, closing supermaket, monitoring temperature, building a new hosptial and seting up medical assistance team, have been carried out to controlling infection source, preventting transmission and reducing death.Until now, there was no new confirmed patients for 13 days,and hospitalized patients decreased sharply.","He was immediately admitted to the isolation ward and received supplemental oxygen through a face mask. He was given interferon alfa-2b (5 million units twice daily, atomisation inhalation) and lopinavir plus ritonavir (500 mg twice daily, orally) as antiviral therapy, and moxifloxacin (0\u00b74 g once daily, intravenously) to prevent secondary infection. Given the serious short ness of breath and hypoxaemia, methylprednisolone (80 mg twice Case Report daily, intravenously) was administered to attenuate lung inflammation. Laboratory tests results are listed in the appendix (p 4). After receiving medication, his body temperature reduced from 39\u00b70 to 36\u00b74 \u00b0C. However, his cough, dyspnoea, and fatigue did not improve. On day 12 of illness, after initial presentation, chest x-ray showed progressive infiltrate and diffuse gridding shadow in both lungs. He refused ventilator support in the intensive care unit repeatedly because he suffered from claustrophobia; there fore, he received high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) oxygen therapy (60% concentration, flow rate 40 L/min). On day 13 of illness, the patient's symptoms had still not improved, but oxygen saturation remained above 95%. In the afternoon of day 14 of illness, his hypoxaemia and shortness of breath worsened. Despite receiving HFNC oxygen therapy (100% concentration, flow rate 40 L/min), oxygen saturation values decreased to 60%, and the patient had sudden cardiac arrest. He was immediately given invasive ventilation, chest compression, and adrenaline injection. Unfortunately, the rescue was not successful, and he died at 18:31 (Beijing time).","In 1967, Ashbaugh and colleagues 1 first described a syndrome of acute respiratory distress in adults that closely resembled respiratory distress in infants. These authors detailed the clinical course of 12 patients treated in Denver for respiratory failure who did not respond to usual therapeutic modalities of respiratory support. The patients had an acute onset of tachypnea, hypoxemia, panlobular infiltration on chest X-ray, and loss of lung compliance. The investigators thought the syndrome resulted from surfactant deficiency, and found positive end-expiratory pressure helpful in treating the atelectasis and hypoxemia. They also thought that corticosteroids were helpful for patients in whom the syndrome resulted from fat embolism. In 1971, the same investigators coined the name adult respiratory distress syndrome. 2 Since its initial description in 1967, ARDS has been the focus of intense scrutiny and attempts to improve outcomes. The European-American Consensus Conference on ARDS developed a uniform definition for ARDS to aid clinical trial design. 3 The conference attendees agreed that ARDS was a severe form of ALI, and recommended that the syndrome be called \"acute\", rather than \"adult\", respiratory distress syndrome. They defined ALI and ARDS as being characterized by an acute onset, bilateral infiltration on chest X-ray, hypoxemia, and no evidence of left atrial hypertension (pulmonary artery occlusion pressure 18 mmHg). The degree of hypoxemia is more severe in ARDS (partial arterial oxygen pressure [PaO 2 ]:fractional inspired oxygen [FIO 2 ] ratio 200 mmHg) than ALI (PaO 2 / FIO 2 300 mmHg). The severity of ARDS can be scored (Murray lung injury score) using several easily measured clinical variables. 4 ARDS occurs in various clinical settings with direct or indirect respiratory insults (e.g. acute pneumonia or pneumonitis, aspiration of gastric content, near-drowning, acute pancreatitis, sepsis syndrome, massive emergency transfusions, environmental toxin exposure), severe multiple trauma (e.g. pulmonary contusion, multiple long bone fracture with fat embolism syndrome), or extensive tissue injury or destruction during major surgical interventions (e.g. cardiac surgery with prolonged extracorporeal bypass). The mortality rate from ARDS remains high (45-92%), but outcomes have improved over the last decade. [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] How did the term SARS originate? Before the mid-1990s, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and public authorities stipulated that sentinel hospitals or clinicians should report suspected or definitively diagnosed cases of respiratory illness in which there were associated public health concerns. However, public authorities derived important information from a rodent-borne hantavirus infection in 1993: an outbreak of an unexplained respiratory illness with high mortality occurred in the US southwest, and the cause was unexpectedly proved to be hantavirus. This contradicted the previous belief that human hantavirus infection only caused the hemorrhagic-fever renal syndrome described in Asia and Europe. Hence, the US outbreak led to the first description of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS), identified as a seemingly new human infectious disease caused by hantavirus variants including Sin Nombre and Black Creek Canal viruses; HPS has an influenzalike prodromal stage, but can progress to catastrophic hemodynamic failure and pulmonary edema. [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] Thus, public health authorities understood that the casereporting system was inadequate in this setting. In May 1995, the World Health Assembly amended international infectious disease regulations, and in 1998, the World Health Organization (WHO) arranged for 21 countries to conduct a clinical trial of a new case-reporting system for acute hemorrhagic fever syndrome, acute diarrhea syndrome, acute neurologic syndrome, acute respiratory syndrome, acute jaundice syndrome, and other notifiable syndromes.","Engraftment syndrome is a clinical entity that occurs more often after autologous HSCT but can also follow allogeneic HSCT. A characteristic feature is the development of the syndrome within 96 hours of engraftment. The etiology is unclear but may be attributed to increased cytokine release and neutrophil degranulation during engraftment. The main clinical manifestations of engraftment syndrome include fever, erythrodermal rash, and noncardiogenic pulmonary edema. Patients may also present with hepatic dysfunction, renal insufficiency, weight gain, and transient encephalopathy. Treatment includes supportive care and steroids. For mild cases, steroids may not be warranted.","In summary, our study demonstrated that MERS-CoV infection can result in a dysregulated host immune response, which then contributes to the severe outcomes observed after infection. However, blockade of the C5a\u2013C5aR interaction could alleviate tissue damage induced by MERS-CoV infection through the regulation of the host immune response, especially the apoptosis and regeneration of T cells in spleens. Our study suggests a new effective clinical intervention and adjunctive treatment for MERS-CoV infection.","To the best of our knowledge, this is the largest retrospective cohort study among patients with COVID-19 who have experienced a definite outcome. We found that older age, higher SOFA score, and elevated d-dimer at admission were risk factors for death of adult patients with COVID-19. The prolonged viral shedding provides the rationale for testing novel coronavirus antiviral interventions in efforts to improve outcomes."," Bed rest, strengthen supportive treatment, ensure sufficient energy; pay attention to water-electrolytes balance and maintain the stability of the internal environment; closely monitor vital signs and finger oxygen saturation, and so on.Monitor the blood routine, urine routine, C-reactive protein (CRP) and health indications (liver enzyme, myocardial enzyme, renal function, etc.), coagulation function, arterial blood gas analysis if necessary, and recheck chest imaging.According to the change of oxygen saturation, give effective oxygen therapy in time, including oxygen given by nasal catheter or mask. If necessary, apply high flow oxygen therapy via the nose, noninvasive or invasive mechanical ventilation, and so on.Antiviral treatment: no effective antiviral drug at present. Treat with IFN-\u03b1 aerosol inhalation (five million U per time for adults, two times per day), and/or Lopinavir/Ritonavir oral administration (two tablets per time, two times per day).Antibiotic treatment: avoid blind and improper use of antibiotics, especially the combination use of broad-spectrum antibiotics. Strengthen bacteriological monitoring. Antibiotics should be used in time in secondary bacterial infection. ","This is a recommended therapy for hypoxia associated with COVID-19, as long as staff are wearing optimal airborne PPE. 12 At flow rates 40 to 60 l/min, high-flow nasal oxygen does carry a small risk of aerosol generation. The risk of airborne transmission to staff is low when optimal PPE and other infection control precautions are being used. 23 Negative pressure rooms are preferable for patients receiving high-flow nasal oxygen. 12 Respiratory support via high-flow nasal oxygen should be restricted to patients in airborne isolation rooms only. Limiting the flow rate to no more than 30 l/min might reduce potential viral transmission.","The global pandemic caused by COVID-19 is just beginning and the number of people infected by the virus is increasing at an exponential rate. While there are no studies currently documenting COVID-19 infections in patients with congenital heart disease, it is highly likely that with over 300,000 cases diagnosed world-wide (as of 3/22/2020) there have already been a number of congenital heart disease patients infected by SARS-CoV-2. It is imperative that individual programs, in concert with regional, national, and global organizations, work together to ensure data are gathered on the number of patients tested, those diagnosed with the infection, and their outcomes. Congenital cardiology programs need to be ready to enroll these patients in study registries and trials. In the words of Winston Churchill, \"never 'worry' about action, but only about inaction.\" We need to be meticulous in our study of this disease, voracious in our appetite to learn its secrets, and tireless in our efforts to combat its spread.

However, in order to reduce the risk of aerosol generation and hence spread of infection, high flow oxygen is not recommended, i.e. avoid oxygen flow rates of . 6 l/min. It should be possible to provide 30 -40% oxygen supplementation using a standard low flow oxygen system and an air-entrainer together with a Ventimask.","Treatment is supportive, although there has been reported success with steroids and ribavirin. It is up to the emergency physician to suspect SARS in patients with URI symptoms from high-risk regions or potential exposures.","High-flow nasal cannula has emerged as an alternative to NIV to prevent intubation in patients with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure. In one trial (n = 310, 72% community-acquired pneumonia), treatment with high-flow oxygen, standard oxygen, or NIV did not result in significantly different intubation rates; however, there was a significant difference in favor of high-flow nasal cannula in 90-day mortality [49]. A small cohort of patients with severe RVI with influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 (n = 25) showed that high-flow nasal cannula was associated with avoidance of intubation in 45% of patients, although almost all patients with higher severity of illness and shock were eventually intubated [50].","All patients were monitored for vital signs (body temperature, heart rate, pulse oxygen saturation, respiratory rate and blood pressure). Initial investigations included a complete blood count, coagulation profile, and serum biochemical test (including liver and renal function, creatine kinase, lactate dehydrogenase and electrolytes). All patients were monitored by chest x-rays or CT. Respiratory specimens, including pharyngeal swabs, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, sputum or bronchial aspirates were tested for other respiratory viruses including influenza A virus (H1N1, H7N9), influenza B virus, respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza virus, adenovirus, and other atypical pathogens such as mycoplasma, chlamydia and legionella pneumophila, which were also examined with realtime RT-PCR. Routine bacterial and fungal examinations were also performed by conventional microbial culture techniques. Treatment strategies included: (1) effective oxygen therapy according to the severity of hypoxemia (nasal catheter/mask oxygen inhalation, high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) and non-invasive ventilation (NIV)), (2) supportive treatment to ensure sufficient energy intake and balance for electrolytes and acid-base levels, (3) antiviral treatment (including All rights reserved.

Interferon-\u03b1, Lopinavir/Ritonavir and Arbidol were used according to previous experience, however, there's a lack of evidence of unified treatment plan. A significant higher rate of glucocorticoid application in patients with abnormal imaging than that the counterpart. A former study showed proper use of corticosteroid in critical SARS reduced the mortality (Chen et al., 2006) . Thus, patients with multiple lobes involvement may be considered for corticosteroid to control the progression. Oxygen J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f therapy plays a key role in supportive care of patients. Generally, patients with hypoxemia (PaO2 &lt;60mmHg or SaO2&lt;90% under the condition of air) or with symptom of dyspnea may be considered for it by nasal cannula or mask. When the symptom or hypoxemia is improved (SaO2&gt;90% or the level of PaO2 reach to 60-70mmHg), the flow of oxygen can be gradually reduced and even stopped.","A number of antiviral treatments for WNV show promise in vitro, including nucleoside analogues (eg, ribavirin), interferon-a, and human immunoglobulin, but no clinical data support their use in patients [198, [208] [209] [210] . For the moment, supportive management with ventilatory support and treatment for cerebral edema is the key measure; the benefits of prophylactic steroids or osmotic agents remain unknown.

Because SARS was highly contagious, more than one-third of our subjects had one or more family members infected with SARS. Nine subjects (10%) had one or more of their family members died of SARS infection. Table 4 depicts the rate of psychiatric disorders after the SARS outbreak: (1) post-SARS cumulative incidence, (2) current prevalence 30 months post-SARS and (3) recovery rate, which is defined as having fulfilled the DSM-IV criteria for the psychiatric disorder in the post-SARS period and no longer fulfilling those diagnostic criteria in the last month.","The outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which originated in Wuhan, China, has become a major concern all over the world. The pneumonia induced by the SARS-CoV-2 is named coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). By Feb 22, 2020, this virus has affected more than 77 700 people worldwide and caused more than 2300 deaths. To date, no specific treatment has been proven to be effective for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Apart from supportive care, such as oxygen supply in mild cases and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for the critically ill patients, specific drugs for this disease are still being researched. In the USA, the first patient infected with SARS-CoV-2 was treated by supportive care and intravenous remdesivir, before the patient recovered and was discharged. 1 However, randomised clinical trials are needed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of remdesivir in the treatment of COVID-19. Convalescent plasma or immunoglobulins have been used as a last resort to improve the survival rate of patients with SARS whose condition continued to deteriorate despite treatment with pulsed methylprednisolone. Moreover, several studies showed a shorter hospital stay and lower mortality in patients treated with convalescent plasma than those who were not treated with convalescent plasma. [2] [3] [4] In 2014, the use of convalescent plasma collected from patients who had recovered from Ebola virus disease was recommended by WHO as an empirical treatment during outbreaks. 5 A protocol for the use of convalescent plasma in the treatment of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus was established in 2015. 6 In terms of patients with pandemic 2009 influenza A H1N1 (H1N1pdm09) virus infection, a prospective cohort study by Hung and colleagues showed a significant reduction in the relative risk of mortality (odds ratio 0\u00b720 [95% CI 0\u00b706-0\u00b769], p=0\u00b701) for patients treated with convalescent plasma. 7 Additionally, in a subgroup analysis, viral load after convalescent plasma treatment was significantly lower on days 3, 5, and 7 after intensive care unit admission. No adverse events were observed. A multicentre, prospective, double-blind, randomised controlled trial by Hung and colleagues showed that using convalescent plasma from patients who recovered from the influenza A H1N1pdm09 virus infection to treat patients with severe influenza A H1N1 infection was associated with a lower viral load and reduced mortality within 5 days of symptom onset. 8 A meta-analysis by Mair-Jenkins and colleagues showed that the mortality was reduced after receiving various doses of convalescent plasma in patients with severe acute respiratory infections, with no adverse events or complications after treatment. 9 Another meta-analysis by Luke and colleagues identified eight studies involving 1703 patients with 1918 influenzapneumonia from 1918 to 1925 who received an infusion of influenza-convalescent human blood products, which showed a pooled absolute reduction of 21% (95% CI 15-27; p&lt;0\u00b7001) in the overall crude casefatality rate at low risk of bias. 10 One possible explanation for the efficacy of convalescent plasma therapy is that the antibodies from convalescent plasma might suppress viraemia. Schoofs and colleagues reported that 3BNC117-mediated immuno therapy, which is a broad neutralising antibody to HIV-1, enhances host humoral immunity to HIV-1. 11 An in vivo trial also showed that the effects of this antibody were not only limited to free viral clearance and blocking new infection, but also included acceleration of infected cell clearance. 12 Viraemia peaks in the first week of infection in most viral illnesses. The patient usually develops a primary immune response by days 10-14, which is followed by virus clearance. 4 Therefore, theoretically, it should be more effective to administer the convalescent plasma at the early stage of disease. 4 However, other treatments might have an effect on the relationship between convalescent plasma and antibody level, including antiviral drugs, steroids, and intravenous immunoglobulin. 10 According to WHO, 13 management of COVID-19 has mainly focused on infection prevention, case detection and monitoring, and supportive care. However, no specific anti-SARS-CoV-2 treatment is recommended because of the absence of evidence. Most importantly, the current guidelines emphasise that systematic corticosteroids should not be given routinely for the treatment of COVID-19, which was also the recommendation in a a Commnt in The Lancet. 14 Evidence shows that convalescent plasma from patients who have recovered from viral infections can be used as a treatment without the occurrence of severe adverse events. Therefore, it might be worthwhile to test the"],"title":["Acetazolamide, Nifedipine and Phosphodiesterase Inhibitors: Rationale for Their Utilization as Adjunctive Countermeasures in the Treatment of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)","Treatment for severe acute respiratory distress syndrome from COVID-19","Advances in respiratory virus therapeutics \u2013 A meeting report from the 6th isirv Antiviral Group conference","Clinical characteristics of 101 non-surviving hospitalized patients with COVID-19: A single center, retrospective study","Chapter 18 The thin, inappetent cat","Critical care management of adults with community-acquired severe respiratory viral infection","Viral Pneumonia and Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome","COVID-19: what has been learned and to be learned about the novel coronavirus disease","Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for severe Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus","A rapid advice guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infected pneumonia (standard version)","Oral presentations","Hospital management of adults with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) if SARS re-emerges\u2014updated 10 February 2004","Feline infectious peritonitis.
