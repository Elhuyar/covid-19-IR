The clinical features include fever, coughing, shortness of breath, and inflammatory lung infiltration. China rapidly listed SARS-CoV-2-related pneumonia as a statutory infectious disease. To standardize the diagnosis and treatment of this new infectious disease, an operational recommendation for the diagnosis and management of SARS-CoV-2 infection is developed by Peking Union Medical College Hospital.","Summary Respiratory viruses that emerge in the human population may cause high morbidity and mortality, as well as concern about pandemic spread. Examples are severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and novel variants of influenza A virus, such as H5N1 and pandemic H1N1. Different animal models are used to develop therapeutic and preventive measures against such viruses, but it is not clear which are most suitable. Therefore, this review compares animal models of SARS and influenza, with an emphasis on non-human primates, ferrets and cats. Firstly, the pathology and pathogenesis of SARS and influenza are compared. Both diseases are similar in that they affect mainly the respiratory tract and cause inflammation and necrosis centred on the pulmonary alveoli and bronchioles. Important differences are the presence of multinucleated giant cells and intra-alveolar fibrosis in SARS and more fulminant necrotizing and haemorrhagic pneumonia in H5N1 influenza. Secondly, the path...","The outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003 was controlled by public health measures at a time when specific interventions such as antiviral drugs, vaccines and immunotherapy were not available. Since then, several animal models have been developed for the study of SARS and, although no model replicates the human disease in all aspects, the use of animal models for SARS has led to the establishment of several important principles for vaccine and immunotherapy. Consistency and reproducibility of findings in a given model must be demonstrated to establish the superiority of one model over others. Here, we suggest aspects of an ideal animal model for studies of SARS pathogenesis and vaccine development and present our assessment of the strengths and limitations of the current animal models for SARS.","Objective: To review and critically appraise published and preprint reports of models that aim to predict either (i) presence of existing COVID-19 infection, or (ii) future complications in individuals already diagnosed with COVID-19. Any models to identify subjects at risk for COVID-19 in the general population were also included. Design: Rapid systematic review and critical appraisal of prediction models for diagnosis or prognosis of COVID-19 infection. Data sources: PubMed, EMBASE via Ovid, Arxiv, medRxiv and bioRxiv until 13th March 2020. Study selection: Studies that developed or validated a multivariable COVID-19 related prediction model. Two authors independently screened titles and abstracts. Data extraction: Data from included studies were extracted independently by at least two authors based on the CHARMS checklist, and risk of bias was assessed using PROBAST. Data were extracted on various domains including the participants, predictors, outcomes, data analysis, and predictio...","Exotic and emerging viral pathogens associated with high morbidity and mortality in humans are being identified annually with recent examples including Lujo virus in southern Africa, Severe Fever with Thrombocytopenia Syndrome virus in China and a SARS-like coronavirus in the Middle East. The sporadic nature of these infections hampers our understanding of these diseases and limits the opportunities to design appropriate medical countermeasures against them. Because of this, animal models are utilized to gain insight into the pathogenesis of disease with the overall goal of identifying potential targets for intervention and evaluating specific therapeutics and vaccines. For these reasons it is imperative that animal models of disease recapitulate the human condition as closely as possible in order to provide the best predictive data with respect to the potential efficacy in humans. In this article we review the current status of disease models for highly pathogenic and emerging viral p...","Abstract Two novel coronaviruses have emerged to cause severe disease in humans. While bats may be the primary reservoir for both viruses, SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) likely crossed into humans from civets in China, and MERS coronavirus (MERS-CoV) has been transmitted from camels in the Middle East. Unlike SARS-CoV that resolved within a year, continued introductions of MERS-CoV present an on-going public health threat. Animal models are needed to evaluate countermeasures against emerging viruses. With SARS-CoV, several animal species were permissive to infection. In contrast, most laboratory animals are refractory or only semi-permissive to infection with MERS-CoV. This host-range restriction is largely determined by sequence heterogeneity in the MERS-CoV receptor. We describe animal models developed to study coronaviruses, with a focus on host-range restriction at the level of the viral receptor and discuss approaches to consider in developing a model to evaluate countermeasures agai...","The novel coronavirus infection (COVID-19 or Coronavirus disease 2019) that emerged from Wuhan, Hubei province of China has spread to many countries worldwide. Efforts have been made to develop vaccines against human coronavirus (CoV) infections such as MERS and SARS in the past decades. However, to date, no licensed antiviral treatment or vaccine exists for MERS and SARS. Most of the efforts for developing CoV vaccines and drugs target the spike glycoprotein or S protein, the major inducer of neutralizing antibodies. Although a few candidates have shown efficacy in in vitro studies, not many have progressed to randomized animal or human trials, hence may have limited use to counter COVID-19 infection. This article highlights ongoing advances in designing vaccines and therapeutics to counter COVID-19 while also focusing on such experiences and advances as made with earlier SARS- and MERS-CoVs, which together could enable efforts to halt this emerging virus infection.","Respiratory virus infection is one of the major sources of exacerbation of chronic airway inflammatory diseases. These exacerbations are associated with high morbidity and even mortality worldwide. The current understanding on viral-induced exacerbations is that viral infection increases airway inflammation which aggravates disease symptoms. Recent advances in in vitro air-liquid interface 3D cultures, organoid cultures and the use of novel human and animal challenge models have evoked new understandings as to the mechanisms of viral exacerbations. In this review, we will focus on recent novel findings that elucidate how respiratory viral infections alter the epithelial barrier in the airways, the upper airway microbial environment, epigenetic modifications including miRNA modulation, and other changes in immune responses throughout the upper and lower airways. First, we reviewed the prevalence of different respiratory viral infections in causing exacerbations in chronic airway inflamm...","Abstract The aim of this chapter is to describe the animal models generated by transgenic technology for the functional analysis of the protective axis of the renin\u2013angiotensin system, consisting of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), angiotensin (Ang)-(1-7), and Mas. Transgenic overexpression of the components of this axis in general led to an ameliorated cardiac and vascular damage in disease states and to an improved metabolic profile. Knockout models for ACE2 and Mas, however, show aggravated cardiovascular pathologies and a metabolic syndrome-like state. In particular, the local production of Ang-(1-7) in the vascular wall, in the heart, and in the brain was found to be of high physiological relevance by the use of transgenic animals overexpressing ACE2 or Ang-(1-7) in these tissues.","Coronaviruses (CoVs) have formerly been regarded as relatively harmless respiratory pathogens to humans. However, two outbreaks of severe respiratory tract infection, caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), as a result of zoonotic CoVs crossing the species barrier, caused high pathogenicity and mortality rates in human populations. This brought CoVs global attention and highlighted the importance of controlling infectious pathogens at international borders. In this review, we focus on our current understanding of the epidemiology, pathogenesis, prevention, and treatment of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, as well as provides details on the pivotal structure and function of the spike proteins (S proteins) on the surface of each of these viruses. For building up more suitable animal models, we compare the current animal models recapitulating pathogenesis and summarize the potential role of host receptor...","Abstract Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) has emerged as a coronavirus infection of humans in the past 5 years. Though confined to certain geographical regions of the world, infection has been associated with a case fatality rate of 35%, and this mortality may be higher in ventilated patients. As there are few readily available animal models that accurately mimic human disease, it has been a challenge to ethically determine what optimum treatment strategies can be used for this disease. We used in-vitro and human ex-vivo explant cultures to investigate the effect of two immunomodulatory agents, interferon alpha and cyclosporine, singly and in combination, on MERS-CoV replication. In both culture systems the combined treatment was more effective than either agent used alone in reducing MERS-CoV replication. PCR SuperArray analysis showed that the reduction of virus replication was associated with a greater induction of interferon stimulated genes. As these therape...","Abstract We summarize findings of SARS-CoV infections in several animal models each of which support viral replication in lungs accompanied by histopathological changes and/or clinical signs of illness to varying degrees. New findings are reported on SARS-CoV replication and associated pathology in two additional strains (C57BL/6 and 129S6) of aged mice. We also provide new comparative data on viral replication and associated pathology following infection of golden Syrian hamsters with various SARS-CoV strains and report the levels of neutralizing antibody titers following these infections and the cross-protective efficacy of infection with these strains in protecting against heterologous challenge. Finally, we summarize findings of a variety of vaccine approaches and discuss the available in vitro and in vivo data addressing the potential for disease enhancement following re-infection in animals previously vaccinated against or infected with SARS-CoV.","Protein structures are crucial for understanding their biological activities. Since the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), there is an urgent need to understand the biological behavior of the virus and provide a basis for developing effective therapies. Since the proteome of the virus was determined, some of the protein structures could be determined experimentally, and others were predicted via template-based modeling approaches. However, tertiary structures for several proteins are still not available from experiment nor they could be accurately predicted by template-based modeling because of lack of close homolog structures. Previous efforts to predict structures for these proteins include efforts by DeepMind and the Zhang group via machine learning-based structure prediction methods, i.e. AlphaFold and C-I-TASSER. However, the predicted models vary greatly and have not yet been subjected to refinement. Here, we are reporting new predictions fr...","SARS-CoV-2 emerged by the end of 2019 to rapidly spread in 2020. At present, it is of utmost importance to understand the virus biology and to rapidly assess the potential of existing drugs and develop new active compounds. While some animal models for such studies are under development, most of the research is carried out in the Vero E6 cells. Here, we propose fully differentiated human airway epithelium cultures as a model for studies on the SARS-CoV-2. Further, we also provide basic characteristics of the system.","Summary Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a new infectious disease that first emerged in Guangdong province, China, in November, 2002. A novel coronavirus was later identified in patients with SARS. The detection of the virus in these patients, its absence in healthy controls or other patients with atypical pneumonia, and the reproduction of a similar disease in a relevant animal model fulfilled Koch's postulates for implicating this coronavirus as the causal agent of SARS. The full genome sequence was determined within weeks of the virus's identification. The rapid progress in the aetiology, the development of laboratory diagnostic tests, and the defining of routes of viral transmission were facilitated through a unique WHO-coordinated virtual network of laboratories, which shared information on a real-time basis through daily teleconferences. Subsequent studies have indicated that the SARS coronavirus is of animal origin, that its precursor is still present in animal popula...","Summary The causative agent of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), which affected over 8000 individuals worldwide and was responsible for over 700 deaths in the 2002\u20132003 outbreak, is a coronavirus that was unknown before the outbreak. Although many different treatments were used during the outbreak, none were implemented in a controlled fashion. Thus, the optimal treatment for SARS is unknown. Since the outbreak, much work has been done testing new agents against SARS using in-vitro methods and animal models. In addition, global research efforts have focused on the development of vaccines against SARS. Efforts should be made to evaluate the most promising treatments and vaccines in controlled clinical trials, should another SARS outbreak occur.","The emergence of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), two strains of animal coronaviruses that crossed the species barrier to infect and cause severe respiratory infections in humans within the last 12 years, have taught us that coronaviruses represent a global threat that does not recognize international borders. We can expect to see other novel coronaviruses emerge in the future. An ideal animal model should reflect the clinical signs, viral replication and pathology seen in humans. In this review, we present factors to consider in establishing an animal model for the study of novel coronaviruses and compare the different animal models that have been employed to study SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.","Viral infections, such as Ebola, severe acute respiratory syndrome/Middle East respiratory syndrome and West Nile virus have emerged as a serious health threat with no effective therapies. These infections have little commercial potential and are not a high priority for the pharmaceutical industry. However, the academic community has been active in this area for many years. The challenge is how to take this academic virology knowledge into a drug discovery and development domain. One approach is the use of consortia and public\u2013private partnerships \u2013 this article highlights ongoing efforts in the USA. Public funds, such as those from government sources, can support research efforts that do not to appear to have commercial value. The key to success is finding a way to combine the different cultural and operational values and reward systems into a productive collaboration to identify new antivirals.","Abstract The latest advancements in drug development are structure-assisted and computer-aided identification, design, and synthesis of target-specific antiviral. Structural virology of animal viruses has made valuable contribution to our understanding of viruses in general, replication, evolution, and interaction with the host. Structure\u2013function relation studies are definitely the need of the hour for rational design of drugs and vaccines to effectively treat animal viral diseases. These studies are important for economical, veterinary, and human medical perspectives. X-ray crystallography, nuclear magnetic resonance and cryo-electron microscopy techniques elaborate the structure\u2013function relation studies by utilizing various computational approaches for structure-assisted designing of drug molecules and antiviral against viruses. Availability of protein three-dimensional structures, high-performance computing, data management software, and internet are enhancing the modern day drug ...","Abstract Molecular analysis of respiratory viruses and the host response to both infection and vaccination have transformed our understanding of these ubiquitous pathogens. Polymerase chain reaction for the rapid and accurate diagnosis of viral infections has led to a better understanding of the epidemiology and impact of many common respiratory viruses and resulted in better patient care. Over the past decade a number of new respiratory viruses including human metapneumovirus and new coronaviruses have been discovered using molecular techniques such as random primer amplification, pan-viral array and next generation sequencing. Analysis of the host transcriptional response during respiratory viral infection using in-vitro, animal models and natural and experimental human challenge have furthered the understanding of the mechanisms and predictors of severe disease and may identify potential therapeutic targets to prevent and ameliorate illness.","Abstract The causative agent of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) was identified as a coronavirus (CoV) following the outbreak of 2002\u20132003. There are currently no licensed vaccines or treatments for SARS-CoV infections. Potential prevention and control strategies that show promise in vitro must be evaluated in animal models. The aged BALB/c mouse model for SARS supports a high level of viral replication in association with clinical illness and disease that mimics SARS in the elderly. We tested two preventive strategies, vaccination and passive transfer of serum antibody, to determine the extent of protection achieved against SARS-CoV challenge in this model. These approaches were able to achieve or induce antibody titers sufficient to reduce viral load, protect from weight loss and reduce or eliminate histopathologic changes in the lungs of aged mice. This study validates the utility of the aged BALB/c mouse model for evaluation of the efficacy of vaccines and immunoprophylaxis...","Abstract To overcome the limitations of the state-of-the-art influenza surveillance systems in Europe, we established in 2008 a European-wide consortium aimed at introducing an innovative information and communication technology approach for a web-based surveillance system across different European countries, called Influenzanet. The system, based on earlier efforts in The Netherlands and Portugal, works with the participation of the population in each country to collect real-time information on the distribution of influenza-like illness cases through web surveys administered to volunteers reporting their symptoms (or lack of symptoms) every week during the influenza season. Such a large European-wide web-based monitoring infrastructure is intended to rapidly identify public health emergencies, contribute to understanding global trends, inform data-driven forecast models to assess the impact on the population, optimize the allocation of resources, and help in devising mitigation and co...","Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causes the infectious disease COVID-19, which was first reported in Wuhan, China in December, 2019. Despite the tremendous efforts to control the disease, COVID-19 has now spread to over 100 countries and caused a global pandemic. SARS-CoV-2 is thought to have originated in bats; however, the intermediate animal sources of the virus are completely unknown. Here, we investigated the susceptibility of ferrets and animals in close contact with humans to SARS-CoV-2. We found that SARS-CoV-2 replicates poorly in dogs, pigs, chickens, and ducks, but efficiently in ferrets and cats. We found that the virus transmits in cats via respiratory droplets. Our study provides important insights into the animal reservoirs of SARS-CoV-2 and animal management for COVID-19 control.","Abstract Background The Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) was first described in 2012 and attracted a great international attention due to multiple healthcare associated outbreaks. The disease carries a high case fatality rate of 34.5%, and there is no internationally or nationally recommended therapy. Method We searched MEDLINE, Science Direct, Embase and Scopus databases for relevant papers published till March 2019 describing in vitro, in vivo or human therapy of MERS. Results Initial search identified 62 articles: 52 articles were from Medline, 6 from Embase, and 4 from Science Direct. Based on the inclusions and exclusions criteria, 30 articles were included in the final review and comprised: 22 in vitro studies, 8 studies utilizing animal models, 13 studies in humans, and one study included both in vitro and animal model. There are a few promising therapeutic agents on the horizon. The combination of lopinavir/ritonavir and interferon-beta- 1b showed excelle...","Resumen Introducci\u00f3n El uso de modelos experimentales en animales permite aumentar el conocimiento sobre la patolog\u00eda del sistema nervioso central.

There is an imminent need to better understand this new virus and to develop ways to control its spread. In this study, we sought to gain insights for vaccine design against SARS-CoV-2 by considering the high genetic similarity between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, which caused the outbreak in 2003, and leveraging existing immunological studies of SARS-CoV. By screening the experimentally-determined SARS-CoV-derived B cell and T cell epitopes in the immunogenic structural proteins of SARS-CoV, we identified a set of B cell and T cell epitopes derived from the spike (S) and nucleocapsid (N) proteins that map identically to SARS-CoV-2 proteins. As no mutation has been observed in these identified epitopes among the available SARS-CoV-2 sequences (as of 9 February 2020), immune targeting of these epitopes may potentially offer pr...","ABSTRACTSevere Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 is rapidly spreading around the world. There is no existing vaccine or proven drug to prevent infections and stop virus proliferation. Although this virus is similar to human and animal SARS- and MERS-CoVs the detailed information about SARS-CoV-2 proteins structures and functions is urgently needed to rapidly develop effective vaccines, antibodies and antivirals. We applied high-throughput protein production and structure determination pipeline at the Center for Structural Genomics of Infectious Diseases to produce SARS-CoV-2 proteins and structures. Here we report the high-resolution crystal structure of endoribonuclease Nsp15/NendoU from SARS-CoV-2 \u2013 a virus causing current world-wide epidemics. We compare this structure with previously reported models of Nsp15 from SARS and MERS coronaviruses.","The beginning of 2020 has seen the emergence of COVID-19 outbreak caused by a novel coronavirus, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).

Emergence and reemergence are accelerated by rapid human development, including numerous changes in demographics, populations, and the environment. This has also led to zoonoses in the changing human-animal ecosystem, which are impacted by a growing globalized society where pathogens do not recognize geopolitical borders. Within this context, neglected tropical infectious diseases have historically lacked adequate attention in international public health efforts, leading to insufficient prevention and treatment options. This subset of 17 infectious tropical diseases disproportionately impacts the world's poorest, represents a significant and underappreciated global disease burden, and is a major barrier to development efforts to alleviate poverty and improve human health. Neglected tropical diseases that are also categorized as...","The beginning of 2020 brought us information about the novel coronavirus emerging in China. Rapid research resulted in the characterization of the pathogen, which appeared to be a member of the SARS-like cluster, commonly seen in bats. Despite the global and local efforts, the virus escaped the healthcare measures and rapidly spread in China and later globally, officially causing a pandemic and global crisis in March 2020. At present, different scenarios are being written to contain the virus, but the development of novel anticoronavirals for all highly pathogenic coronaviruses remains the major challenge. Here, we describe the antiviral activity of previously developed by us HTCC compound (N-(2-hydroxypropyl)-3-trimethylammonium chitosan chloride), which may be used as potential inhibitor of currently circulating highly pathogenic coronaviruses - SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV.","Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) is a newly emerging infectious disease caused by a novel coronavirus, MERS-coronavirus (MERS-CoV), a new member in the lineage C of \u03b2-coronavirus (\u03b2-CoV). The increased human cases and high mortality rate of MERS-CoV infection make it essential to develop safe and effective vaccines. In this review, the current advancements and potential strategies in the development of MERS vaccines, particularly subunit vaccines based on MERS-CoV spike (S) protein and its receptor-binding domain (RBD), are discussed. How to improve the efficacy of subunit vaccines through novel adjuvant formulations and routes of administration as well as currently available animal models for evaluating the in vivo efficacy of MERS-CoV vaccines are also addressed. Overall, these strategies may have important implications for the development of effective and safe vaccines for MERS-CoV in the future.","Abstract The epidemic of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) first broke out in Wuhan in December 2019, and reached its peak in Wuhan in February 2020. It became a major public health challenge for China, and evolved into a global pandemic in March 2020. For radiation oncology departments, the COVID-19 pandemic presents a unique challenge for disease protection and prevention for both patients and staff, owing to the weakened immune systems of cancer patients and the need to deliver timely and uninterrupted radiotherapy. At the Hubei Cancer Hospital, the only hospital in Wuhan that specializes in oncology, we organized an emergency infection control team to lead special efforts to combat COVID-19 during this challenging time. Under its lead, the following measures were implemented in the radiation oncology department: the radiotherapy clinic was divided into different infection control zones with varying levels of protection; special staff and patient infection control training session...","Abstract The contribution of cell-mediated immunity to protective immunity against virulent transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) infection conferred by primary porcine respiratry coronavirus (PRCV) or TGEV exposure was assessed in pigs that were challenged with TGEV 24 days after a primary oronasal inoculation with PRCV or TGEV when 11 days old. PRCV exposure induced partial protection against TGEV challenge in suckling pigs based upon a decreased number of diarrhea cases (42% vs. 90% in age-matched control pigs), limited virus shedding in feces, and increases in virus-neutralizing serum antibody titers; in contrast, all 11-day-old pigs inoculated with TGEV were completely protected after challenge. Weaned pigs were also studied to eliminate any possibility that lactogenic immunity from contact PRCV-exposed sows contributed to protection against TGEV. Once weaned, none of the PRCV-exposed or age-matched control pigs had diarrhea after TGEV challenge; moreover, both groups exhibit...","Animal coronaviruses, such as infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), and arteriviruses, such as porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), are able to manifest highly contagious infections in their specific native hosts, thereby arising in critical economic damage to animal industries. This review discusses recent progress in studies of virus-host interactions during animal and human coronavirus and arterivirus infections, with emphasis on IBV-host cell interactions. These interactions may be directly involved in viral replication or lead to the alteration of certain signaling pathways, such as cell stress response and innate immunity, to facilitate viral replication and pathogenesis.","Widespread, non-stop, and often sensational coverage of the coronavirus (COVID-19) has caught many governments flat-footed in efforts to protect the health and safety of their citizens. In response to the current global health event, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic. Mass gatherings present a historic challenge in protecting the health and safety of attendees. The majority of the prominent mass gatherings are religious in nature. Global sporting events, such as the Olympics and the World Cup, pose unique health risks to attendees and host nations. Deferment or cancellation of such mass gatherings may exert an extraordinary economic loss to the host nation. Universal adoption of best practices for infection control is the surest way for governments to prepare for mass gatherings. In these uncertain times, it is up to intergovernmental organizations to be the voice of reason.","Abstract An important effort has been performed after the emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic in 2003 to diagnose and prevent virus spreading. Several types of vaccines have been developed including inactivated viruses, subunit vaccines, virus-like particles (VLPs), DNA vaccines, heterologous expression systems, and vaccines derived from SARS-CoV genome by reverse genetics. This review describes several aspects essential to develop SARS-CoV vaccines, such as the correlates of protection, virus serotypes, vaccination side effects, and bio-safeguards that can be engineered into recombinant vaccine approaches based on the SARS-CoV genome. The production of effective and safe vaccines to prevent SARS has led to the development of promising vaccine candidates, in contrast to the design of vaccines for other coronaviruses, that in general has been less successful. After preclinical trials in animal models, efficacy and safety evaluation of the most promising vaccin...","Publisher Summary Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is caused by a coronavirus (CoV), SARSCoV. SARS-CoV belongs to the family Coronaviridae, which are enveloped RNA viruses in the order Nidovirales. Global research efforts are continuing to increase the understanding of the virus, the pathogenesis of the disease it causes (SARS), and the \u201cheterogeneity of individual infectiousness\u201d as well as shedding light on how to prepare for other emerging viral diseases. Promising drugs and vaccines have been identified. The milestones achieved have resulted from a truly international effort. Molecular studies dissected the adaptation of this virus as it jumped from an intermediary animal, the civet, to humans, thus providing valuable insights into processes of molecular emergence.","ABSTRACTNovel Coronavirus (nCoV) outbreak in the city of Wuhan, China during December 2019, has now spread to various countries across the globe triggering a heightened containment effort. This human pathogen is a member of betacoronavirus genus carrying 30 kilobase of single positive-sense RNA genome. Understanding the evolution, zoonotic transmission, and source of this novel virus would help accelerating containment and prevention efforts. The present study reported detailed analysis of 2019-nCoV genome evolution and potential candidate peptides for vaccine development. This nCoV genotype might have been evolved from a bat-CoV by accumulating non-synonymous mutations, indels, and recombination events. Structural proteins Spike (S), and Membrane (M) had extensive mutational changes, whereas Envelope (E) and Nucleocapsid (N) proteins were very conserved suggesting differential selection pressures exerted on 2019-nCoV during evolution. Interestingly, 2019-nCoV Spike protein contains a ...","Abstract Due to serotype variations among different avian infectious bronchitis viruses isolated in Tunisia since 2000, protection of chicks, especially broiler flocks, with Mass H120 vaccine often fails. Therefore, association of CR88 (793B type) with H120 vaccines was used for better response. Challenge experiments were then conducted to evaluate tracheal and renal cross-protection in chickens immunized via nasal and eye drops. Conferred protection was measured by clinical signs and macroscopic lesions observed, based on scores attributed according to their severities. The results showed a low protection conferred by H120 alone, as vaccination did not reduce tracheal and kidney lesions (70% scored as 3) after TN20/00 virus challenge, which also led to 10% mortality. Conversely, the challenge results indicated that the combination of the 2 strains (H120/CR88) allow high protection. Based on the results of the challenge experiments, a vaccination protocol coupling CR88 to H120 was appl...","Human coronaviruses (HCoVs) are large RNA viruses that infect the human respiratory tract. The emergence of both Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome and Middle East Respiratory syndrome CoVs as well as the yearly circulation of four common CoVs highlights the importance of elucidating the different mechanisms employed by these viruses to evade the host immune response, determine their tropism and identify antiviral compounds. Various animal models have been established to investigate HCoV infection, including mice and non-human primates. To establish a link between the research conducted in animal models and humans, an organotypic human airway culture system, that recapitulates the human airway epithelium, has been developed. Currently, different cell culture systems are available to recapitulate the human airways, including the Air-Liquid Interface (ALI) human airway epithelium (HAE) model. Tracheobronchial HAE cultures recapitulate the primary entry point of human respiratory viruses w...","Summary In the USA, infectious diseases continue to exact a substantial toll on health and health-care resources. Endemic diseases such as chronic hepatitis, HIV, and other sexually transmitted infections affect millions of individuals and widen health disparities. Additional concerns include health-care-associated and foodborne infections\u2014both of which have been targets of broad prevention efforts, with success in some areas, yet major challenges remain. Although substantial progress in reduction of the burden of vaccine-preventable diseases has been made, continued cases and outbreaks of these diseases persist, driven by various contributing factors. Worldwide, emerging and reemerging infections continue to challenge prevention and control strategies while the growing problem of antimicrobial resistance needs urgent action. An important priority for control of infectious disease is to ensure that scientific and technological advances in molecular diagnostics and bioinformatics are we...","Summary The Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) has infected over 1600 individuals with nearly 600 deaths since it was first identified in human populations in 2012. No antiviral therapies or vaccines are available for its treatment or prophylaxis. Approaches to the development of MERS vaccines are discussed herein, including a summary of previous efforts to develop vaccines useful against human and non-human coronaviruses. A striking feature of MERS is the important role that camels have in transmission. Camel vaccination may be a novel approach to preventing human infection.","BACKGROUND: Strategies are urgently needed to mitigate the risk of zoonotic disease emergence in southern China, where pathogens with zoonotic potential are known to circulate in wild animal populations. However, the risk factors leading to emergence are poorly understood, which presents a challenge in developing appropriate mitigation strategies for local communities. METHODS: Residents in rural communities of Yunnan, Guangxi and Guangdong provinces were recruited and enrolled in this study. Data were collected through ethnographic interviews and field observations, and thematically coded and analysed to identify both risk and protective factors for zoonotic disease emergence at the individual, community and policy levels. RESULTS: Eighty-eight ethnographic interviews and 55 field observations were conducted at nine selected sites. Frequent human\u2013animal interactions and low levels of environmental biosecurity in local communities were identified as risks for zoonotic disease emergence...","AbstractDuring its first month, the recently emerged 2019 Wuhan novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) has already infected many thousands of people in mainland China and worldwide and took hundreds of lives. However, the swiftly spreading virus also caused an unprecedentedly rapid response from the research community facing the unknown health challenge of potentially enormous proportions. Unfortunately, the experimental research to understand the molecular mechanisms behind the viral infection and to design a vaccine or antivirals is costly and takes months to develop. To expedite the advancement of our knowledge we leverage the data about the related coronaviruses that is readily available in public databases, and integrate these data into a single computational pipeline. As a result, we provide a comprehensive structural genomics and interactomics road-maps of 2019-nCoV and use these information to infer the possible functional differences and similarities with the related SARS coronavirus. ...","Summary Emerging infectious diseases arising from livestock and wildlife pose serious threats to global human health, as shown by a series of continuous outbreaks involving highly pathogenic influenza, SARS, Ebola and MERS. The risk of pandemics and bioterrorism threats is ever present and growing, but our ability to combat them is limited by the lack of available vaccines, therapeutics and rapid diagnostics. The use of high bio-containment facilities, such as the CSIRO Australian Animal Health Laboratory, plays a key role studying these dangerous pathogens and facilitates the development of countermeasures. To combat diseases like MERS, we must take a holistic approach that involves the development of early biomarkers of infection, a suite of treatment options (vaccines, anti-viral drugs and antibody therapeutics) and appropriate animal models to test the safety and efficacy of candidate treatments.","BACKGROUND: The ongoing outbreak of the recently emerged novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) poses a challenge for public health laboratories as virus isolates are unavailable while there is growing evidence that the outbreak is more widespread than initially thought, and international spread through travellers does already occur. AIM: We aimed to develop and deploy robust diagnostic methodology for use in public health laboratory settings without having virus material available. METHODS: Here we present a validated diagnostic workflow for 2019-nCoV, its design relying on close genetic relatedness of 2019-nCoV with SARS coronavirus, making use of synthetic nucleic acid technology. RESULTS: The workflow reliably detects 2019-nCoV, and further discriminates 2019-nCoV from SARS-CoV. Through coordination between academic and public laboratories, we confirmed assay exclusivity based on 297 original clinical specimens containing a full spectrum of human respiratory viruses. Control material is mad...","DNA microarrays have emerged as a viable platform for detection of pathogenic organisms in clinical and environmental samples. These microbial detection arrays occupy a middle ground between low cost, narrowly focused assays such as multiplex PCR and more expensive, broad-spectrum technologies like high-throughput sequencing. While pathogen detection arrays have been used primarily in a research context, several groups are aggressively working to develop arrays for clinical diagnostics, food safety testing, environmental monitoring and biodefense. Statistical algorithms that can analyze data from microbial detection arrays and provide easily interpretable results are absolutely required in order for these efforts to succeed. In this article, we will review the most promising array designs and analysis algorithms that have been developed to date, comparing their strengths and weaknesses for pathogen detection and discovery.","The initial cluster of severe pneumonia cases that triggered the COVID-19 epidemic was identified in Wuhan, China in December 2019. While early cases of the disease were linked to a wet market, human-to-human transmission has driven the rapid spread of the virus throughout China. The Chinese government has implemented containment strategies of city-wide lockdowns, screening at airports and train stations, and isolation of suspected patients; however, the cumulative case count keeps growing every day. The ongoing outbreak presents a challenge for modelers, as limited data are available on the early growth trajectory, and the epidemiological characteristics of the novel coronavirus are yet to be fully elucidated. We use phenomenological models that have been validated during previous outbreaks to generate and assess short-term forecasts of the cumulative number of confirmed reported cases in Hubei province, the epicenter of the epidemic, and for the overall trajectory in China, excluding...","Abstract Objectives To develop and test machine learning-based CT radiomics models for predicting hospital stay in patients with pneumonia associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Design Cross-sectional Setting Multicenter Participants A total of 52 patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and their initial CT images were enrolled from 5 designated hospitals in Ankang, Lishui, Zhenjiang, Lanzhou, and Linxia between January 23, 2020 and February 8, 2020. As of February 20, patients remained in hospital or with non-findings in CT were excluded. Therefore, 31 patients with 72 lesion segments were included in the final analysis. Intervention CT radiomics models based on logistic regression (LR) and random forest (RF) were developed on features extracted from pneumonia lesions in training and inter-validation datasets. The predictive performance was further evaluated in test dataset on lung lobe- and patients-level. Main outcomes Short-term hospital stay (\u226410 days) and long-term...","Direct RNA sequencing using an Oxford Nanopore MinION characterised the transcriptome of SARS-CoV-2 grown in Vero E6 cells. This cell line is being widely used to propagate the novel coronavirus. The viral transcriptome was analysed using a recently developed ORF-centric pipeline. This revealed the pattern of viral transcripts, (i.e. subgenomic mRNAs), generally fitted the predicted replication and transcription model for coronaviruses. A 24 nt in-frame deletion was detected in subgenomic mRNAs encoding the spike (S) glycoprotein. This feature was identified in over half of the mapped transcripts and was predicted to remove a proposed furin cleavage site from the S glycoprotein. This motif directs cleavage of the S glycoprotein into functional subunits during virus entry or exit. Cleavage of the S glycoprotein can be a barrier to zoonotic coronavirus transmission and affect viral pathogenicity. Allied to this transcriptome analysis, tandem mass spectrometry was used to identify over 50..."],"title":["Diagnosis and clinical management of severe acute respiratory syndrome Coronavirus 2

Furthermore, RNA synthesis inhibitors (like 3TC, TDF), remdesivir, neuraminidase inhibitors, peptide (EK1), anti-inflammatory drugs, abidol, Chinese traditional medicine, such as Lianhuaqingwen and ShuFengJieDu Capsules, could be the promising COVID-19 treatments.2 However, further clinical trials are required for confirming safety and efficacy for COVID-19. A major limiting factor in the quest for identifying an ideal vaccine or therapeutic agent is time. It may take months to even several years for researchers to develop, produce, standardize, evaluate, approve, and commercialize therapeutic agents for COVID-19. Hence, current efforts should be directed toward identifying and evaluating drugs and immunotherapeutics that have proven efficacy against viruses similar to COVID-19.","Effective vaccines are essential for interrupting the chain of transmission from animal reservoirs and infected humans to susceptible hosts and are often complementary to antiviral treatment in the control of epidemics caused by emerging viruses. Efforts have been made to develop S protein-based vaccines to generate long-term and potent neutralizing antibodies and/or protective immunity against SARS-CoV 81,91. Live-attenuated vaccines have been evaluated in animal models for SARS 92. However, the in vivo efficacy of these vaccine candidates in elderly individuals and lethal-challenge models and their protection against zoonotic virus infection have yet to be determined before a clinical study is initiated. This is probably because SARS died down 17 years ago and no new case has been reported since.","Animal testing is often the only available option, but many diseases lack even good animal models, and animal studies are technically difficult to conduct and typically limited in size. Consequently, regulatory science is needed to develop and validate improved predictive models. Regulatory science can also support the identification and validation of surrogate measures of product efficacy. Biomarkers that predict efficacy are not yet available for most terrorism threats, emerging pathogens or major global infectious diseases. Efforts to develop, refine, and validate new biomarkers may lower development costs and improve and speed the development of safe and effective products for unmet public health needs.","As human SARS has disappeared, the role of an exuberant (but perhaps appropriate for the titre of the virus) immune response will need to be addressed using animal models of SARS. Mice, cats, ferrets, macaques and civet cats are all susceptible to SARS-CoV, but none, with the exception of aged mice, develop severe disease (reviewed in Ref. 129). In efforts to develop models that closely mimic human disease, mice that are transgenic for the expression of human ACE2 were developed and infected with SARS-CoV130,131. Although these mice develop more severe pulmonary disease than non-transgenic mice, they also develop an overwhelming neuronal infection, accompanied by high cytokine and/or chemokine expression and minimal cellular infiltration in the brain132. Although the severity of the brain infection observed in human ACE2 transgenic mice is greater than that seen in human patients, infection of this organ has been detected in some studies and patients who survived SARS had a greater incidence of neurological and psychiatric sequelae than anticipated63,133,134. The high susceptibility of these mice to infection with SARS-CoV makes them useful for vaccine and therapeutic trials. Another approach to developing an animal model for SARS was to adapt the virus by passage 10\u201315 times through the lungs of BALB/c mice or rats103,135,136. Three to six mutations were detected in the adapted viruses, with changes most commonly observed in the S protein and in nsp5 (3CLpro). The adapted virus caused extensive pulmonary infection and disease was most severe in aged animals. These viruses will be useful for studies of pathogenesis and for vaccine and therapeutic trials.","The international cooperation and coordination that led to the rapid identification of SARS-CoV and the control of the SARS outbreak were exemplary. Efforts to develop animal models were undertaken in several laboratories around the world and experimental infection in these different animal models has proven to be invaluable in establishing the basis for prevention and control strategies for SARS. However, published reports from laboratories that have used different animal models have led to some controversial opinions and misunderstandings about animal models for SARS. It is essential that the findings in a given model are consistent and reproducible and that these features are well documented.","Although both flu and anti-HIV drugs are used currently in China for treatment of COVID-19, and chloroquine phosphate, an old drug for treatment of malaria, has recently found to have apparent efficacy and acceptable safety against 79] ; nevertheless more studies are required to standardize these therapies. In addition, there has been some success in the development of mouse models of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV infection, and candidate vaccines where the envelope (E) protein is mutated or deleted have been described [80] [81] [82] [83] [84] [85] [86] . To best of our knowledge, this is the first study to identify certain peptides in envelope (E) protein as candidates for COVID-19. Accordingly, these epitopes were strongly recommended as promising epitopes vaccine candidate against T cell.","A variety of protocols has been used, including giving xylose to assess malabsorption, lactulose to assess orocecal transit, and a test meal to assess SI bacterial fermentation. A number of studies have attempted to standardize the techniques for companion animals, and use of substrates labeled with stable isotopes has increased. However, these techniques are not widely used, even in referral centers, because of technical difficulties, and lack of specificity.","The use of different animal models can be tailored to the goals of each study. Consistency, reproducibility and the relevance of the outcome measures to the scientific question (such as immunogenicity and efficacy of vaccines or pathogenesis of disease) must be considered before one can conclude that a given model is superior to other available models and is the preferred or appropriate model. Clearly, the pathogenesis of disease can only be studied in animal models that replicate key aspects of the disease. But animal models do not need to replicate all aspects of disease to provide useful information in evaluation of vaccines and immunoprophylaxis. For example, an animal model can be useful in vaccine efficacy studies if the following two criteria are met: (i) virus titer correlates with disease severity; and (ii) the virus replicates in the animal model to a sufficiently high titer so that differences in the level of replication between immunized and mock-immunized control groups can be meaningfully distinguished. Under these conditions, demonstration that a vaccine or antibody can prevent or significantly reduce the level of replication of challenge virus would be convincing evidence of efficacy. There is ample precedence for this approach in the development of vaccines against other respiratory viruses.","Methods: The followings are the methods we used to improve the infection rate. 1st, develop the protocol for the use of Managing Rental Equipment in the Operation Room. 2nd, standardize the protocol for the process of surgical instrument cleaning and sterilization. 1. Develop the processing protocol of surgical instruments which includes: itemization, decontamination, soaking, cleaning, inspection, packaging, and sterilization. 2. Conduct the educational training program for the personnel who are responsible for equipment cleaning and sterilization. 3. Use of 3M\u2122 Clean-Trace\u2122 ATP Surface Test and 3M\u2122 Clean-Trace\u2122 NG Luminometer as the testing tools, and randomly test the operation equipment after cleaning. The passing value is &lt;150RLU, and the passing rate was calculated as the number of qualified items divided by the total number of testing items (%), to make sure that the extent of cleanliness has reached our goal of effective sterilization. Results: The passing rate of ATP randomized testing was increased from 72.5% (50/13, 2015/01) to 72.9% (140/192, 2015/20-2015/12) and continued to increase to 92.8% (205/221, 2016/01-2016/12). The infection rate of SSI decreased from 1.43\u2030 (25/17468, 2014) to 1. 07\u2030 (20/18628, 2015) and kept improving to 0.82\u2030 (15/18203, 2016) . Conclusion: This study used ATP bioluminescence assay as an objective and rapid tool to determine the environmental cleanliness and effectively demonstrated a decrease in the rate of surgical site infection caused by the surgical instruments. Therefore, we now include this protocol in our standard operating procedure.","Reduced the ventilatorassociated pneumonia in the surgical intensive care unit: upgrade the integrated care Pei-Yu Taeng, Fang-Yu Shih. Nursing, Buddhist Tzu Chi Medical Foundation, Taipei Tzu Chi Hospital Background: The incidence of ventilator -associated pneumonia in the surgical intensive care ward in 2015 was 2.22\u2030, which was higher than that of others(1.26\u2030). In 2016, integrated care was carried out. However, it was found that was poorly practiced. The program is not familiar with the lack of relevant education and training, in April 2016, the incidence of respiratory-related pneumonia was as high as 6.33\u2030. Resulting in the nursing care quality has a great challenge. Methods: The intensive care unit physician, nurse and respiratory therapist composed of special committee in July 2016. Using of innovative methods to produce VAP Bundle Care posters. To standardize elevating the bed 30 degrees, modify the oral care and daily Teamwork hand over document. Sustained training on the job to enhance colleagues' realizes the integrated care. Results: After 10-month later, the unit-integrated care increased from 58% to 98%. The improved cognitive test increased from 62 points to 95 points. The ventilator-associated pneumonia rate decreased from 4.16\u2030 to 2.87\u2030. Conclusion: The implementation of integrated care in the respiratory cause of the relevant pneumonia, can reduce the infection caused by the ventilator. Also reduce the number of days the patient to use respirators,and shorten the length of patient stay and mortality in the intensive care unit.","It is very difficult and often impossible to test the efficacy of new treatments for highly lethal infections in human clinical trials. Animal models for human EIDs can play a key role in the development and testing of candidate vaccines and therapeutics and can be used to facilitate their regulatory approval. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has developed The Animal Rule to assist in the regulatory approval process [4] . The rule states that when it would not be ethical to perform human challenge studies to measure the efficacy of vaccines and drugs developed to prevent or treat highly pathogens, the FDA may grant approval based on appropriate animal efficacy studies when the results of those studies establish that the drug is reasonably likely to produce a clinical benefit in humans. The Animal Rule states that the FDA will only rely on evidence from animal studies to provide substantial evidence of effectiveness when strict criteria are met.","Phylogenetic species restriction of susceptibility to MERS-CoV infection has severely limited development of animal models of disease. Primates, including rhesus macaques and marmosets, transgenic mice expressing human DPP4, camelids, and rabbits have been assessed as potential animal models,35 however, each model system has limitations. Rhesus macaques develop transient pulmonary infection and illness.36,37 Whereas marmosets develop more severe illness following MERS-CoV infection,38 some have questioned whether the observed pathology is related to experimental manipulation of this small mammal versus the effects of viral infection.39 Transgenic mice that constitutively express human DPP4 develop lethal systemic infection, including central nervous system disease40-42 whereas transgenic mice expressing human DPP4 driven from surfactant promoters43 or transduced with adenoviral-associated vectors that express human DPP444 develop mild, transient disease. While camels and alpacas are natural hosts for MERS-CoV infection and have been used as disease models,45 they develop a self-limited upper respiratory infection different from human infection.32 Moreover, there is considerable expense and difficulty of experimental models using large animals.","The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.18.20038059 doi: medRxiv preprint Overall, the assays developed and validated in this study could be instrumental for patient contact tracing, serosurveillance studies, as well as vaccine evaluation studies. However, since various studies will be carried out in different labs, it is crucial to calibrate and standardize assays developed by different labs using well defined standard references as a part of diagnostic assay validation. This is not only needed to reduce interassay variability, but to also harmonize the results obtained from different labs using various assays (14) . This is crucial for better comparison and interpertaion of results from different studies as well as evaluation of vaccine trials, allowing for uniform assessment of immunogenicity, efficacy and better understanding of correlates of immune protection (15) . Thus, setting up reference panels is a vital element in our preparedness approaches to emerging viruses. All rights reserved.

In addition, two compartments, the respiratory epithelium and blood can be sampled in human studies and interrogated using different viruses or viral strains to develop gene signatures for prognosis, as indicators of severity and to identify potential therapeutic targets.","The CFR and AABB Standards provide some specific guidelines with which blood collections facilities must adhere, but it is impossible to attempt to provide specific guidance for all situations. This most often becomes an issue when evaluating donors with underlying health care problems. Not only might a particular condition require medical director consideration, but often the degree of clinical severity of that condition must also be considered. 72 For example, an active case of rheumatoid arthritis may require deferral, whereas a history of rheumatoid arthritis may not. In these instances, a collection center must develop its own procedures and criteria. Although not every circumstance can be dealt with in a comprehensive manner, some centers have developed comprehensive procedures to standardize this as best as possible. 73 It is occasionally necessary, however, particularly for autologous donations, to have a properly credentialed medical director review ambiguous situations and make informed decisions on a case-by-case basis. The medical director may also be needed to resolve issues about medications, potential risk factors, and any other circumstance where a medical doctor's decision is needed.","NHP models have also figured prominently in efforts to develop an Ebola virus vaccine (Sullivan et al., 2000; Sullivan et al., 2003) . Passive immunization of cynomolgus macaques with hyperimmune globulin alone, or in combination with recombinant interferon-\u03b1, was not protective (Geisbert et al., 2002; Jaax et al., 1996; Jahrling et al., 1996; Jahrling et al., 1999) . Similarly, cynomolgus macaques, immunized with liposome-encapsulated irradiated Ebola virus, produced virus-neutralizing antibodies but were not protected against lethal challenge, suggesting that both humoral and cell-mediated immunity are required for protection (Rao et al., 2002) . Newer approaches to vaccine development have focused on the induction of both cellular and humoral immune responses, incorporating the use of DNA vaccines. A \"prime-boost\" protocol combining DNA immunization, followed by a boost with a recombinant adenoviral vector expressing Ebola viral proteins, induced both cellular and humoral immune responses in cynomolgus macaques. Immunized animals were completely protected from lethal challenge with Ebola-Zaire, indicating that a preventive vaccine against Ebola virus is feasible (Sullivan et al., 2000) . This prime-boost protocol, while effective as a preventive vaccine regimen, required more than 6 months to complete, precluding its use in controlling an acute epidemic (Sullivan et al., 2003) . Recent studies have demonstrated that immunization of cynomolgus macaques, with recombinant adenovirus vectors encoding Ebola virus glycoprotein and nucleoprotein, in the absence of DNA priming, resulted in earlier antibody production and induction of Ebola virus-specific CD8+ T-cell responses. Monkeys immunized with only a single dose of this construct and challenged 28 days later were completely protected against both high and low-dose viral challenge (Sullivan et al., 2003) .","The wildlife trade has clearly played a role in the emergence of 2019-nCoV, as well as previous diseases in China (SARS) and across the world (e.g. monkeypox in the USA, Ebola in Africa, salmonellosis in the USA and Europe). China's response in the current outbreak was swift and broad: The index market was closed down immediately and once the virus spread, the wildlife trade was banned temporarily in certain provinces, then nationally. Our recent behavioral risk investigations in China identified low levels of environmental biosecurity and high levels of human-animal contact as key risk factors for zoonotic disease emergence, particularly in local wet and animal markets [23] . While the current wildlife trade bans may help disease control at this moment, to prevent future disease emergence, market biosecurity needs to be improved regarding the hygiene and sanitation facilities and regulations, and the source of animals traded at the market. From a viral emergence perspective, farmed animals are likely a lower risk than wild-caught animals. However, given the size of the wildlife farming industry in China, routine disease surveillance and veterinary care at farms and in transport to markets would need to be improved. The connection between this outbreak and wildlife trade have triggered a strong public opinion against wildlife consumption, and scientists have jointly called for an urgent amendment of the Wildlife Protection Law to standardize and manage wildlife trade as a public health and security issue. It requires collaboration among the State Forestry and Grassland Administration, Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs, State Administration for Market Regulation and public health authorities to tackle this issue as a long-term goal.","The wildlife trade has clearly played a role in the emergence of 2019-nCoV, as well as previous diseases in China (SARS) and across the world (e.g. monkeypox in the USA, Ebola in Africa, salmonellosis in the USA and Europe).

The first is that, while native speakers were consulted wherever possible, there is the possibility of transliteration errors occurring when extracting data from native language into English-script analogues. This is most likely to happen when looking at point data. We have provided sources consulted so that users may cross-reference the original source wherever this is may be an issue. While administrative units are supplied with shapefiles sources and unique identifiers with these files so that users can understand the corresponding geographic scale which the row represents, with points, different settlements cover different spatial extents. Should users wish to incorporate this information into spatially-dependent models, they should exercise caution in possible misrepresentation of geographic specificity. We recommend that sensitivity of results could be evaluated by using buffers around point latitude and longitudes, or cross-referencing city-gazettes.","Since room temperature storage techniques are easier to accomplish in most locations and since PCR techniques are widely available to the military, the techniques used in this study should expand the ability to provide respiratory pathogen surveillance. Several subsequent studies are currently under way to standardize the methodology and equipment for the military and to provide information on yield of molecular techniques over time after collection of specimens (6-12 months after collection).","Future studies on enveloped viruses should seek to carefully characterize and even standardize the conditions under which measurements are conducted. Media composition, the purity of virus stock, and when possible, virus concentrations in both gene copies and infective units, should be described. When studying oxidants, the demand of the solution and change in oxidant concentration through the experiment should be provided. When studying radiation (UVC and/or sunlight), attenuation through the experimental solution should be well-characterized incorporated into reported doses. Researchers should include a well-studied surrogate virus in their experiments in addition to the enveloped virus of interest to facilitate cross-study comparisons. We recommend using the nonenveloped bacteriophage MS2 for this purpose, as it is one of the most studied viruses in environmental systems.","Other SARS-CoV animal models. Syrian golden and Chinese hamsters have also been evaluated as models of SARS-CoV disease72,73,74,75. Infected animals develop pneumonitis, inflammation and immune cell infiltration, although signs of clinical illness do not necessarily accompany the lung pathology. In contrast to mice, hamsters experience transient (1\u20132-day) viraemia and become less active. In addition, the virus can be detected in the spleen and liver, although it is not associated with inflammation in these organs. Similarly to mice, hamsters also develop a protective neutralizing antibody response to subsequent SARS-CoV challenge. Reagents for measuring immune responses in the hamster are improving, but there is still limited availability of genetically defined animals and refined immunological and cellular markers for hamster models. TALEN-mediated mutagenesis and CRISPR\u2013Cas-mediated mutagenesis of zygotes might enable the development of genetically defined hamsters and other atypical model species for pathogenesis research.","Two preclinical studies have been published investigating PMOs as a treatment for EBOV infection, with both showing efficacy in animal models. PMOs were designed to inhibit translation of EBOV VP35, VP24, and L transcripts . All three PMOs showed activity using an in vitro translation assay and reduced viral titer in cell culture. In a similar study, a different VP35-specific PMO also reduced virus yield in cell culture (Enterlein et al., 2006) . This PMO targeting VP35 was conjugated to an arginine-rich peptide (P-PMO), or left unconjugated, and tested in a mouse model of EBOV infection. Five hundred micrograms of VP35 PMO or P-PMO was delivered to mice by intraperitoneal injection (i.p.) 24 h and 4 h before EBOV challenge. With this treatment regimen, VP35 PMO protected 75% of the mice from lethal infection, while 100% of the P-PMO-treated mice survived. Similarly, 100% of mice survived when treated with VP35 P-PMO 24 h after EBOV challenge. A more comprehensive investigation of VP35, VP24, and L PMOs utilized three animal models to test for efficacy . In mice, VP35 and VP24 unconjugated PMOs provided complete, and near complete, protection, respectively, when delivered by i.p. injection twice before EBOV infection. Importantly, a combination treatment of all three PMOs, given 24 h after EBOV infection, provided complete protection. Surviving mice developed an immune response to EBOV and were protected from subsequent challenge. In guinea pigs, maximum efficacy was seen when the combination treatment was given 96 h postchallenge, compared to treatment with a single PMO given closer to challenge; probably due to differences in pharmacokinetics and bioavailability between treatment regimens. Finally, anti-EBOV PMO treatment was investigated in rhesus macaques . Monkeys were administered a single PMO (VP35) or a combination of three PMOs (VP35, VP24 and L) from 2 days before, through 9 days after EBOV challenge by a combination of parenteral routes. No monkeys treated with the single VP35-targeting PMO survived EBOV infection, but two of four monkeys receiving the combination PMO treatment survived lethal EBOV challenge. A third monkey in this treatment group remained aviremic, but succumbed to a secondary bacterial infection.","We have learned much about correlates of immunity using the current animal models for SARS research. Experiments in mice with targeted defects in the immune system suggest that innate immunity has an important role in clearance of SARS-CoV [10, 11] . Additional studies have shown that intranasally administered SARS-CoV replicates in the respiratory tract of several animal species and protects animals from re-infection with SARS-CoV [8, 24, 35] . In addition to primary infection, active immunization with inactivated whole virus vaccines, DNA vaccines, subunit vaccines and live, vectored vaccines expressing the SARS-CoV spike protein also elicit neutralizing antibodies to SARS-CoV that provide protection from subsequent challenge (Table 2) . Furthermore, passive transfer of post-infection or post-immunization sera or monoclonal antibodies against the spike protein can also protect mice, ferrets and hamsters from infection, and modulate disease (Table 2) . Moreover, depletion of T-cells in mice immunized with a DNA vaccine encoding the spike protein gene did not abrogate protection from SARS-CoV challenge, and adoptive transfer of T-cells from immunized mice to na\u00efve mice did not confer protection from SARS-CoV challenge. These findings strongly suggest that vaccines that elicit humoral immunity to SARS-CoV spike protein or immunotherapy that targets the spike protein will be sufficient to protect from SARS infection and associated disease. Research in animal models has led to the identification of correlates of immunity such as the protective ability of actively induced neutralizing antibodies [8, 13, 14, 16, 17, 23, 35, 36] or passively transferred neutralizing antibodies [8, 15, 21, 22] . These principles will provide the basis for prevention and intervention strategies in the event that SARS-CoV reappears in humans.","The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is Another critical parameter in infectious disease is the basic reproduction number, R 0 , which can be computed with Eq. 29. With the parameters obtained from the infected data provided by CCDC, the calculated R 0 is plotted against time in Figure 6 . Initially, R 0 is really high, but decays rapidly and approaches a steady value. However, our method is straightforward and can potentially be used to standardize R 0 calculation.","As activated CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes are among the most crucial components of antiviral effectors, those cell subsets in the PBMC of the vaccinated mice were assessed (Fig. 5). Flow cytometry analysis of unstimulated cells was used to standardize the background responses and there was little variation in non-immunized mice. pcDNA-N and pcDNA-N plus pcDNA-IL2 vaccinations significantly increased the percentages of activated CD4+ and CD8+ cells compared to the control groups (P &lt; 0.01). The number of CD4+ and CD8+ activated cells increased in all the immunized groups. CD8+/CD4+ ratio in pcDNA-N plus pcDNA-IL2 groups was higher than that in pcDNA-N group. ","There are some limitations in our analysis. First, as an important Chinese herb preparation, GLED was mainly applied in China or other Asian countries, which may bring the unavoidable regional bias and subsequently influence the clinical application of GLED worldwide. Second, the duration of treatment ranged from 7 to 28 days among the included studies. All of the trials assessed the efficacy immediately after the termination of the treatment period. Therefore, the long-term effect of GLED for CCP still needs methodologically rigorous trials to verify. Third, the main pathological features of CCP are pulmonary artery pressure, progressive of right ventricular hypertrophy and cardiopulmonary functional insufficiency. Many key variables, such as number of exacerbation, heart and lung function, quality of life, which closely related to survival, are not evaluated in these studies. Therefore, it is not yet possible to draw a conclusion on important outcomes. Moreover, GLED is a mixture that consists of more than one effective component, in this case, the mechanism of GLED may be complex and has multiple targets, and also this limits the usage of it. Fourthly, the administration conditions (extract/distill methods, storage conditions, dripping speed, GLED dosages and manufacturer, et al.) might be related with the efficacy of GLED mediated therapy [61,62]. In order to achieve the clinical therapeutic effect and reduce the incidence of adverse reactions of GLED mediated therapy to the greatest extent, it is necessary to strengthen the supervision of clinical medication to standardize the rational medication. The GLED in all included trials was approved by Chinese State Food and Drug Administration (SFDA), and granted the Manufacturing Approve Number issued by Chinese SFDA (Supplementary Table S2). Based on currently available literatures, we have conducted subgroup analysis according to different GLED dosages and manufacturer. However, there are insufficient data to perform a statistical analysis to evaluate the impacts of other variable factors (extract/distill methods, storage conditions and dripping speed, et al.) on the treatment effect of GLED. We will keep following up with upcoming clinical trials to obtain relevant data when available. Finally, allocation concealment and blind method were not clear in most included studies, which may results in exaggerated estimates of treatment effect. Given the limitations mentioned above, all the findings from our study should be dealt with some caution.","Occupational exposure to camels would seem a particularly strong risk factor for infection, but its relative importance and relative risk of different exposures are not well documented (Hemida et al. 2015). As camels are widely used in the region for a variety of purposes, many people have contact with camels, and exposure is often invoked in nonoccupational primary cases. Assessment of camel exposure is further complicated by the varying and sometimes vague definitions used to classify camel exposure, and the multiple types of possible exposures. Even so, it has been hypothesized that camel exposure is commonly underreported (Gossner et al. 2016). There is a critical need for clearer definitions and measurements of \u201ccamel exposure,\u201d and to standardize methodology.","Clinicians should be trained about how to prevent and treat respiratory infectious diseases. Due to the lack of protective equipment and awareness at the beginning of the epidemic, doctors were accidentally infected in Wuhan at the outset of the epidemic. Medical institutions should standardize the process of disinfection, isolation, and protection, reserve qualified and sufficient protective materials, such as disinfection products, medical surgical masks, medical protective masks, isolation gowns, and eye masks, to ensure the personal protection of medical personnel. Based on the strict implementation of standard prevention, medical institutions should strengthen measures to prevent and control viral transmission through contact, infected droplets, and airborne transmission. Wearing of masks and hand hygiene are key measures for infection prevention and control. 21","The hamster zona-free oocyte penetration assay is used to examine human male fertility (Aitken, 2006) . This assay was first described in 1980 and involves the incubation of human sperm with hamster eggs that have undergone zona removal (Overstreet et al., 1980) . The assay can be utilized both clinically and experimentally to determine human sperm fertility and it analyzes the ability of sperm to capacitate eggs, udergo the acrosome reaction, and fuse with the oocyte. Limitations of the assay are that it is labor-intensive, and difficult to standardize. Despite these limitations, results obtained in the hamster assay correlate well with human in vitro fertilization. Since intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) is replacing standard IVF in many settings the utility of the zona-free hamster assay from a clinical perspective may be waning.","The use of the 6-hour window to implicate a blood-product transfusion in TRALI is not an arbitrary designation. The multitude of case reports in the medical literature confirms a close temporal association with the transfusion of blood products. In fact, it is common for TRALI to develop during the first 30 to 60 minutes of a transfusion [8] . Experimental evidence from animal models supports this temporal association. In at least four different animal models of TRALI using anti-neutrophil antibodies, anti-major histocompatibility class (MHC) I antibodies, and the plasma and lipid fractions from day 42 PRBCs and day 5 platelets, lung injury develops within 6 hours of challenge with these experimental agents [9] . In fact, in the MHC I antibody model, lung injury develops within 2 hours and often within 15 to 30 minutes [10] . The speed with which lung injury develops in a given patient is probably a complex interplay of host susceptibility and dose or titer of the injurious blood product.","The following characteristics are associated with a favorable prognosis: (1) female sex, (2) early age at onset, (3) onset of symptoms referable to a single neurologic system, (4) substantial recovery from relapses, (5) early symptoms of numbness rather than corticospinal or cerebellar symptoms. Unfavorable prognosis is associated with chronic progressive disease (either primary or secondary), older age at onset, and male sex.g6-g8 DLAGNOSTIC CRITERIA Because of the difficulties involved in the diagnosis of MS, several criteria have been published to standardize the terms used to describe the certainty of the diagnosis. The two primary sets of criteria are those of Poser et a1.6g and Shumacher et a1. 83 The Poser criteria are more recent and are summarized in Table 5 . It is important to remember that no abnormality should be used as a criterion if it can be explained by another medical problem.","Depending on features of the virus structure, transmission dynamics, entry requirements, tropism, and replication strategy, a vaccine approach should be proposed, designed, and evaluated in small animals for immunogenicity and protection against challenge. Manufacturing a candidate vaccine for which there is no immediate market poses a significant dilemma because most stages of advanced vaccine development are carried out by large pharmaceutical companies that need to make profit to stay in business. While emerging infectious diseases pose a public health threat, they rarely present a compelling commercial opportunity. Vaccines require a large investment and historically have a relatively low probability of being successful without an extensive iterative process of evaluation and redesign. Therefore, in addition to new biological tools, there needs to be political will to prioritize public funding of advanced vaccine development and new business models for managing this process. 3 In this review, we describe the vaccine development efforts for three distinct viruses that collectively capture many of the challenges faced when developing vaccines for emerging viral threats. Ebola, a member of the Filoviridae family, is spread by body fluids and secretions with a relatively low attack rate but causes a systemic disease with high mortality. Chikungunya, an alphavirus in FIGURE 28.1 Time from identification of a viral pathogen to vaccine availability. Vaccine development is a lengthy process often measured in decades. Many steps are required even for a traditional empirical approach including identification of target antigen; assay development; defining seroprevalence and incidence in relevant populations; understanding transmission dynamics and whether there is an intermediate animal host; developing animal models; exploring pathogenesis and defining immune mechanisms of protection; designing vaccine antigens; determining formulation, delivery route and method; preclinical evaluation for safety and immunogenicity; manufacturing; and several years of clinical evaluation and clearing regulatory hurdles. Vaccines can fail at any of these steps, and it is rare for the first attempted concept to become the final product.","Multiple non-human primates (NHPs) are susceptible to SARS-CoV infection, including rhesus macaques, cynomolgus macaques, marmosets and African green monkeys82,83,84,85. Clinical symptoms and pathology vary by species but all NHPs that support infection show evidence of SARS-CoV replication in the lungs (with 105\u2013106 TCID50 titres in the lungs) and shedding in respiratory secretions. Most primate models develop histopathological changes and show evidence of pneumocyte infection and some degree of diffuse alveolar damage. Disease outcomes seem to be more severe in aged macaques86, which reflects human disease outcomes. As in humans, increased virus replication and increased lung pathology are noted in primates that are infected with wild-type SARS-CoV compared to most other animal models, except for mice that have been infected with mouse-adapted SARS-CoV. Few vaccine candidates have been evaluated in NHPs, probably owing to the cost and the challenge of achieving statistically significant sample sizes in NHP studies.","Methods: Several strategies were launched in our hospital to achieve the assignment. First, the medical technologists and information technicians participated in the training courses on LOINC (Logical Observation Identifies Names and Codes) and RELMA (Regenstrief LOINC Mapping Assistant). Then, we mapped and organized all laboratory raw data from laboratory information system database. The information technicians developed the automatic data exchange programs based on LOINC to standardize laboratory report information. The data were analysed and audited by medical technologists before uploading daily. In addition, the uploading data were sampling investigated by CDC during testing period to confirm the accuracy. Results: We could successfully transfer twenty kinds of regulated organisms such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Hepatitis C virus, and Streptococcus agalactiae and so on. We totally submitted 2892 designated items from August to November to CDC. More than 10% increases in overall uploading pathogens were observed compared with baseline in 2015.","Results: Followed from February, 2017 to June, 2017, in medical ward and ICU, the utilization of urinary catheter rate is 28.4%, the catheter related UTI rate is 0.46\u2030. Although the utilization rate is not differed from previous rate, the UTI incidence is reduced significantly after implementation of current UTI bundle care. Because health care providers strictly follow the strategy in all aspects, the incidence of UTI reduced significantly. At the same time, nursing department adjust and standardize the urinary catheter placement procedure and urinary catheter care manual. Conclusion: During this UTI bundle care strategy, reusable urinary catheter package is replaced by disposable urinary catheter package supported by hospital authority. All health care providers strengthen to implement all aspect of UTI bundle care, keep awareness of catheter care knowledge, keep proper disinfection before urinary catheterization, and assess daily for catheterization requirement, avoid unnecessary urinary catheterization. Therefore, catheter related UTI rate can be reduced significantly.","Policy Data Policies in administrative units were coded as binary variables, where the policy is coded as either 1 (after the date that the policy was implemented, and before it is removed) or 0 otherwise, for the affected administrative units. There were instances when a policy implementation only affected a portion of the administrative units (e.g. half of the counties within the state). In an attempt to accurately represent the locality and impact of policy implementation, policy variables were weighted by the percentage of population within the administrative unit that was treated by the policy. The most recent estimates available of population data for countries' administrative units were used (see the Population Data section in the Appendix). Additionally, in order to standardize policy types across countries, we mapped country-specific policies to one of our broader policy categories used as variables in our analysis. In this exercise, we collected 130 policies for China, 37 for South Korea, 195 for Italy, 26 for Iran, 59 for France, and 498 for the United States (see Appendix Table A1 ).","Partially purified (PP) virus particles, purified SS particles, DS particles, and recombinant OSU VP4 (P7) or Gottfried VP4 (P6 ) expressed by a baculovirus vector (supplied as baculovirus infected cell lysates by Dr. M. Gorziglia, NIAID, NIH, Bethesda, MD) were diluted in 50 mM carbonate-bicarbonate buffer (pH 9.6)) and 0.1 ml per well was added to 96-well plates (Dynatech Laboratories Inc., Chantilly, VA). The coated plates were incubated for 30 min at 37 \"C, then for 16 h at 4\u00b0C or 4 h at 25 \"C prior to being used. Additionally, 0.1 ml per well of goat anti-mouse-IgG ( 1 .O pg ml-' ) or -1gM (0.8 lug ml-' ) (Boehringer Mannheim, Indianapolis, IN) was used to coat plates for comparison with the viral antigen-coated plates to standardize the specificity and sensitivity of the ELIS-POT assay. The optimal coating concentration of each antigen we used in the ELISPOT assay was determined by using the hybridoma cells in the standardization ELISPOT assay with serially diluted antigen coatings and selecting those antigen coating concentrations which gave the highest numbers of ASC.","Rising multidrug resistance also imperils the control of gonococcal infections worldwide. Since 2009, Euro-GASP monitors emerging resistance in Neisseria gonorrhoeae to therapeutic antimicrobials. The program is using a standardized methodology across the EU/EEA which integrates epidemiological and microbiological data to understand the risk factors associated with resistance and thereby inform intervention strategies (39). For AST, the Euro-GASP uses a hybrid approach of EU centralized and decentralized national testing (39). EQA and training activities helped standardize surveillance across Europe: between 2009 and 2014, the number of EU/EEA countries participating in Euro-GASP increased from 17 to 23 countries while the number of countries providing quality-assured (decentralized) testing increased from 3 to 17. In addition, Euro-GASP also piloted molecular typing to unravel associations between clonal type and antimicrobial resistance profiles that could aid understanding of the dissemination of resistance within at risk populations (46). Euro-GASP results have revealed rapidly changing patterns of N. gonorrhoeae resistance to drugs of choice across Europe, leading to the revision of European and national gonorrhea treatment guidelines and development by ECDC of the \u201cResponse plan to control and manage the threat of multidrug-resistant gonorrhoea in Europe\u201d (47).","These findings suggest that the hospital environment could potentially be a source of virus spread, including among HCWs, patients, and visitors. It is noteworthy that the hospital surface samples were collected from February 7 to February 27, 2020, which was after human-to-human spread of SARS-CoV-2 was identified. It is plausible to assume that the hospital surface contamination would have been more severe before the sampling period, when environmental cleaning protocols were not as extensive and isolation practices that should be implemented rapidly. In addition, pregnant women and neonates are highly susceptible populations. They are more sensitive to the chemicals released by the internal infection control processes. It is, therefore, a standardize procedure to lessen the intensity and to reduce frequency of the internal infection control processes in the department, which may have led to the high positive detection rates discovered from our study. It was not surprising that the Fever Clinic had a low positive detection rate for SARS-CoV-2 (6.5%). Early on, the Fever Clinic was relocated to a semi-open area, .

Such persons working with animals include veterinarians, slaughterers/butchers, farmers, researchers, pet owners (e.g., through bites and/or scratches of owners of indoor pet-animals), and animal feeders in animal companies using animal products, via animals used for food (e.g., meat, dairy, eggs, birds, infected domestic poultry, and other birds). Furthermore, transmission can also occur through animal vectors (e.g., tick bite, and insects like mosquitoes or flea) [4,14,15]. In addition, in the transmission of bacteria in comparison with viruses, the role of contaminated food and water, the importance of international travels as well as changes in land use and agriculture, are important [4,9]. According to recent WHO data, more than 75% of the different zoonotic diseases that may cause illnesses in humans are transmitted through animals and/or animal products [16]. Nevertheless, several zoonotic pathogens may be transmitted from various animals to man via several direct and/or indirect pathways such as close contact with the infected animals that might be shedding the infectious pathogen, when humans use contaminated sources of food or water, and/or by outdoor or indoor animal scratches or bites [17,18,19,20,21]. The prevention and control strategies against zoonotic pathogens are considered important issues and a global challenge requiring efforts of all veterinarian and medical staff [22].","While vaccine-mediated cellular immunity has been demonstrated to play a role in protection in preclinical models of NiV infection,61 the most advanced vaccine modalities demonstrating clear efficacy across multiple animal models have primarily induced humoral immunity. A soluble glycoprotein (sG) subunit vaccine from the related henipavirus Hendra virus (HeV) is an extensively studied vaccine that can protect ferrets and AGM from experimental challenge with NiV or HeV. Prime-boost regimens with adjuvanted HeV-sG subunit proteins are efficacious in stringent NiV challenge models, across a range of doses (4\u2013100ug), and with pre-challenge neutralising antibody titres as low as 1:28.62,63 The HeV sG vaccine (Equivac\u00ae HeV) has been licensed to vaccinate horses in Australia against HeV.64 A number of viral vectored vaccines have also been tested and show promising immunogenicity and/or efficacy against NiV-mediated disease. These include poxvirus (canarypoxvirus ALVAC strain), vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), rabies virus (RABV), adeno-associated virus (AAV), Newcastle disease virus (NDV) and Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV); this topic has recently been comprehensively reviewed.56,65","Background: In Taiwan, most end-stage renal failure patient received hemodialysis replacement treatment. Health-care associated bloodstream infection may result in elevated morbidity, mortality, prolonged admission, and higher cost. We conducted previous evidence-based procedures identified as having the great effect on the rate of bloodstream infection as \"bundles care\" to the hemodialysis units. Finally, we compared hemodialysis associated bloodstream infection rate before and after the interventions. Methods: This project was conducted step-by-step. Staff education was performed before June of 2016. And we used double-lumen hemodialysis catheter insertion checking list, double-lumen/ hickman hemodialysis catheter care checking list, and arteriovenous fistula care checking list to standardize the procedures since 2016, June, 1st. We calculated and analyzed compliance and correct rate, and gave feedback to the hemodialysis units every month. Finally, we analyzed hemodialysis associated bloodstream infection rate before and after the interventions. Results: After education and coarse, we conducted the evidencedbased procedures identified as lowering the rate of bloodstream infections as checking lists. After intervention, compliance and correct rate improved gradually. And hemodialysis associated bloodstream infection also improved (January \u223c May of 2016: 0.692\u2030; June \u223c October of 2016: 0.32\u2030). Conclusion: An evidence-based bundle care intervention of hemodialysis units may resulted in improved compliance and correct rates of medical staff, and reduced hemodialysis associated bloodstream infection rate.","As of 26 January 2020, 30 provinces have initiated a level-1 public health response to control COVID-19 [22]. A level-1 response means that during the occurrence of a particularly serious public health emergency, the provincial headquarters shall organize and coordinate the emergency response work within its administrative area according to the decision deployment and unified command of the State Council [22]. Fever observation rooms shall be set up at stations, airports, ports, and so on to detect the body temperature of passengers entering and leaving the area and implement observation/registration for the suspicious patients. The government under its jurisdiction shall, in accordance with the law, take compulsory measures to restrict all kinds of the congregation, and ensure the supply of living resources. They will also ensure the sufficient supply of masks, disinfectants, and other protective articles on the market, and standardize the market order. The strengthening of public health surveillance, hygiene knowledge publicity, and monitoring of public places and key groups is required. Comprehensive medical institutions and some specialized hospitals should be prepared to accept COVID-19 patients to ensure that severe and critical cases can be differentiated, diagnosed, and effectively treated in time. The health administration departments, public health departments, and medical institutions at all (province, city, county, district, township, and street) levels, and social organizations shall function in epidemic prevention and control and provide guidance for patients and close contact families for disease prevention [23].","It is not known whether HCoV-EMC is going to be fully established in humans. Extensive efforts have been made and will continue to be needed to fight against this possible epidemic. If we are \u201clucky\u201d enough to control this novel disease, more resources should be allocated to different areas of coronavirus studies. Currently, we know some animal coronaviruses in wildlife only at the nucleotide level. In fact, the number of bat species tested for coronaviruses is only a fraction of the total number (&gt;1,200) of bat species. In addition, there is a lack of biological/biochemical characterization of these animal viruses. Ideally, we should develop an effective universal strategy to treat and prevent human infections caused by animal coronaviruses. The phylogenetic relationships of coronaviruses (Fig. 1) suggest that there have been a number of introductions of animal coronaviruses (e.g., SARS-CoV and 229E) into humans in the past. The great diversity of coronavirus in bats will surely increase the odds of yet another zoonotic event occurring in the future.","In order to characterize the viral pathogenesis and evaluate therapeutic options for MERS-CoV, researchers rely on an animal model mimicking the clinical course and pathology observed in humans. In contrast to the SARS animal model, where aged mice displayed pathological changes post-infection [52], mice infected with MERS-CoV did not show any clinical signs of infections, such as weight loss [53]. In addition, Syrian hamsters and ferrets, which are known to be susceptible to SARS-CoV, failed to be infected by MERS-CoV [22, 54]. Non-human primates (NHP) and common marmoset models have been tested for their suitability as MERS-CoV models. Upon a combination of various inoculation routes (intratracheal, ocular, oral, and intranasal) using an infectious dose of MERS-CoV, rhesus macaques developed a transient lower respiratory tract infection and mild clinical disease without mortality [55]. On the other hand, MERS-CoV infected common marmosets developed progressive, severe pneumonia [56]. Although NHPs are sufficiently good models to study MERS at different severity, working with NHPs is costly. Hence, establishing transgenic rodent animal models is crucial to move forward in the development of vaccines and therapeutic methods against MERS-CoV. By comparing small animal cell lines transfected with human and hamster dpp4 genes, it was observed that only humanized cell lines enabled MERS-CoV replication [57]. Therefore, researchers have now developed a hDPP4 transgenic mouse model [58\u2022, 59]. Agrawal et al. cloned hCD26/DPP4 in an expression vector with the ubiquitous cytomegalovirus immediate early enhancer and chicken beta-actin promoter and microinjected the DNA into mice zygotes. After lineage screening, hDPP4 transgenic mice that expressed hCD26/DPP4 were fully permissive to MERS-CoV infection, resulting in weight loss and an acute inflammatory response within the lungs and brains of the animal [58\u2022]. When these hCD26/DPP4 transgenic mice were immunized with MF59-adjuvanted RBD fragment (S377-588), fused to the Fc fragment, they were protected after challenge with a high dose (100\u00d7 LD50) of the virus [60]. Another hDPP4 transgenic mouse was recently created using an expression vector with either cytokeratin 18 (K18) or surfactant protein C (SPC) promoters, with the SPC-DPP4 transgenic mice exhibiting a milder disease phenotype [59].","This novel virus decoy cellular vaccine is designed to initiate NK cell-driven immune activation with the ultimate goal of inducing protective adaptive host immunity. NK cell-induced I-cell death should result in cytokine release, recruitment of antigen presenting cells (APCs), and maturation of elicited dendritic cells (DCs) at the site of vaccination. Presentation of SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein-derived peptides by recruited APCs will drive adaptive host immune responses against SARS-CoV-2. Interleukin 12 secreted from mature DCs in combination with NK-secreted GM-CSF and interferon-\uf067 (IFN\uf067\uf029 can combine to recruit T lymphocytes and may induce Th1 cell polarization, thereby inducing development of a potent cytotoxic T cell response and clearance of SARS-CoV-2-infected cells. Confirmation of Th1 polarization vs. a mixed Th1/Th2 or predominantly Th2 response is currently underway in preclinical immunization models. Previous efforts to develop respiratory virus vaccines to protect against Respiratory Syncytial J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Virus (RSV) and SARS-related disease have demonstrated the potential clinical benefits of eliciting a Th1 adaptive immune response over the disease-exacerbating effects of a Th2 polarized response (3, 4) . Immunization studies in mice with four candidate SARS vaccines (VLP, whole virus, and an rDNAproduced Spike protein) led to pulmonary immunopathology upon challenge with SARS virus, an effect that was signified by Th2 polarization in mice immunized with each candidate vaccine (4). The decoy cell vaccine can drive the host cellular immune response toward Th1, generating both potent cytotoxic T cell immunity against the major determinant of SARS-CoV-2 cellular entry and pathogenesis (Figure 2 ). Utilizing pathogen-derived cellular immunogens (virus-encoded antigens) as initiators of NK-mediated immune responses might provide an exciting method to produce novel vaccine candidates. It is important to highlight the flexibility of the decoy cell vaccination strategy as additional cell vaccines can be generated in an expeditious manner once new antigens of interest have been identified. Thus, successful demonstration of the efficacy of this current anti-SARS-CoV-2 approach in clinical trials would pave the way for use of the decoy cell platform to address a large number of unmet medical needs in the clinic as we seek to protect populations from viral, parasitic, fungal and bacterial diseases.","Animal models play a vital role to uncover the mechanisms of viral pathogenicity from the entrance to the transmission and designing therapeutic strategies. Previously, to examine the replication of SARS-CoV, various animal models were used which showed the symptoms of severe infection [43] . In contrast to SARS-CoV, no MERS-CoV pathogenesis was observed in small animals. Mice are not vulnerable to infection by MERS-coronavirus due to the non-compatibility of the DPP4 receptor [44] . As the entire genome of the 2019-novel coronavirus is more than 80% similar to the previous human SARS-like bat CoV, previously used animal models for SARS-CoV can be utilized to study the infectious pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2. The human ACE2 cell receptor is recognized by both SARS and Novel coronaviruses. Conclusively, TALEN or CRISPR-mediated genetically modified hamsters or other small animals can be utilized for the study of the pathogenicity of novel coronaviruses. SARS-CoV has been reported to replicate and cause severe disease in Rats (F344), where the sequence analysis revealed a mutation at spike glycoprotein [45] . Thus, it could be another suitable option to develop spike glycoprotein targeting therapeutics against novel coronaviruses. Recently, mice models and clinical isolates were used to develop any therapeutic strategy against SARS-CoV-2 induced COVID-19 [46, 47] . In a similar study, artificial intelligence prediction was used to investigate the inhibitory role of the drug against SARS-CoV-2 [48] . SARS-CoV-2 infected patients were also used to conduct randomized clinical trials [46, 49, 50] . It is now important that the scientists worldwide collaborate the design a suitable model and investigate the in vivo mechanisms associated with pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2.","Because of the economic importance of CoV infection to livestock and domestic animals, a variety of live-attenuated and killed CoV vaccines have been tested in animals. Vaccines have been developed against IBV, TGEV, CCoV, and FIPV. However, these vaccines do not seem to provide complete protection from wild-type virus infection. In some cases, the wild-type CoV rapidly evolves to escape neutralization by vaccine-induced antibodies. In studies of vaccinated chickens, a live-attenuated IBV vaccine has been shown to undergo RNA recombination with wild-type virus to generate vaccine escape mutants. Killed virus vaccines may also be problematic for some CoV infections. Vaccination of cats with a killed FIPV vaccine has been shown to exacerbate disease when cats are challenged with wild-type virus. Therefore, extensive studies will be required to carefully evaluate candidate vaccines for SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV. A variety of approaches are currently under investigation for developing CoV vaccines, including analysis of killed virus vaccines, live-attenuated virus vaccines, and viral vector vaccines (such as modified vaccine virus Ankara, canarypox, alphavirus, and adenovirus vectors). Studies have shown that removing the envelope (E) protein from either SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV is an effective approach for generating a live attenuated virus vaccine. In the absence of this structural protein, the virus replicates to lower titers in the lungs of mice, but still induces an immune response that is protective from challenge with wild type virus. The development of improved animal models for human coronaviruses will be essential for evaluating any candidate vaccines. Transgenic mice expressing human ACE-2 (for SARS-CoV) can be used as a model system for SARS, however the pathogenesis in ACE-2 expressing transgenic mice does not fully mimic the pathogenesis seen during SARS-CoV infection in humans. CoVs can be adapted for replication in small animal models. Passaging SARS-CoV in mice led to the generation of a mouse-adapted strain, SARS CoV-MA15, which induces a lethal respiratory tract infection of mice. CoV vaccine studies will benefit from an improved understanding of conserved viral epitopes that can be targeted for vaccine development.","In November 2002, several hundred cases of severe, atypical pneumonia were reported from the Guangdong province in southern China. An infected medical doctor from Guangdong carried the virus to Hong Kong, where he stayed for one night on the 9th floor of the Hotel Metropole. Subsequently, at least 16 guests and visitors to the 9th floor of the hotel became infected and spread the illness to Vietnam, Singapore, and Canada. Hospitals became new epicenters of infection as health care workers and family members became infected. In March 2003, the World Health Organization (WHO) recognized that SARS had become a worldwide health threat, and released a global alert on travel to screen air passengers departing from affected areas. Cases of suspected SARS continued to be reported in new areas including Thailand, Europe, the United Kingdom, and the U.S., but the most heavily affected areas were in China and Hong Kong. In early April, the virus was isolated and identified as a novel coronavirus, SARS-associated coronavirus, or SARS-CoV. The numbers of cases increased at a staggering pace with over 5,000 cases on April 28, 6,000 cases on May 2, and 7,000 cases on May 8 from over 30 countries on six continents. 42 Travel warnings were issued for Toronto, Canada, where an imported case of SARS established an outbreak in a hospital with over 100 cases, which subsequently spilled over into the community. Travel restrictions also applied to Beijing and Guangdong, China and Hong Kong. Although transmission was assumed to be primarily from secreted virus in respiratory fluids, another mode of transmission was found in an outbreak in a Hong Kong apartment building. Improper plumbing in the Amoy Gardens apartment complex probably allowed virus-contaminated sewage to be introduced into the water supply, resulting in almost 300 cases from one building. Epidemiologists began to link a few individuals as sources responsible for infecting a large number of people. These \"super spreaders'' are individuals who for unknown reasons were capable of transmitting infection to over 100 people. In Singapore, one individual traveling from the Hotel Metropole was credited for infecting 103 out of 203 cases. Despite these few instances, transmission was primarily due to close contact with infected individuals and remained in the hospital epicenters where import cases had harbored the virus. Rarely, secondary outbreaks in the community occurred. This required containment measures to be enacted. Local authorities began voluntary and mandatory quarantine procedures and eventually, the number of new cases began declining. Officials declared regions to be free of SARS when no new cases were identified after 20 days, twice the time of an incubation period. By early July 2003, there were no new cases of SARS reported. As of September 2003, WHO reported an estimated 8,098 cases and 774 deaths from the SARS-CoV. 43 The rapid identification of a virus as the etiologic agent of SARS allowed public health officials to address the public on how to kill the virus, any treatment options, and use knowledge of other animal coronaviruses to form hypotheses regarding origin and transmission. The virus was isolated by inoculation of Vero E6 and NCI-H292 cells from an oropharyngeal specimen obtained from a fatally infected SARS patient. 44 The cells showed CPE with cell rounding in focal areas that were refractile to light. The infected cell cultures were treated for thin-section and negative-stain electron microscopy, where the particles were detected with the distinctive halo of the Coronaviri dae (Figure 4.3) . Investigators were extremely fortunate to have an isolate propagating and causing an obvious cytopathic effect in cell culture. Coronaviruses are notorious for being difficult to culture, requiring specific cell lines with supplements, organ culture, or animals. The characteristic particles identified using electron microscopy enabled researchers to swiftly focus on a specific virus group. Coronaviridae have three serological groups. Using infected Vero cells as a source of SARS-CoV antigen, antibodies specific for each coronavirus group were tested. Only antibodies from group I recognized SARS-CoV-infected cells. Antibodies from groups I, II, and III all failed to detect virus antigen in autopsy samples despite the presence of syncytial cells and other signs of pathology. Infected Vero cells were again used as antigen to detect the presence of SARS-CoV antibodies from patient samples. Patient sera with high titers of SARS-CoV-specific antibodies were used to develop an ELISA. SARS-CoV antibodies were later raised in animals injected with virus infected cell culture. Random samples from the population did not have detectable IgG antibodies, implying that SARS-CoV had not previously been circulating and instead was a newly emerged virus. 44 The SARS-CoV was also identified using RT-PCR with a broadly reactive primer set designed based on the polymerase gene. The entire genome was sequenced and phylogenetically compared to other coronaviruses. SARS-CoV was placed equidistant from all other animal and human coronaviruses in all gene regions. This implied that the SARS-CoV did not arise from recombination from any known coronavirus, nor did it help identify the host. To verify SARS-CoV as the actual agent responsible for disease, two cynomolgus macaques were inoculated with a Vero cell culture infected with serum from a fatal SARS case. SARS-CoV was detected in nasal secretions and fecal material by RT-PCR and immunofluorescence. The virus sequence was identical to the inoculated virus. 45 Histopathology showed cell damage in the lungs, and both macaques seroconverted, proving Koch' s postulate for SARS-CoV as the causative agent. 46 With SARS worldwide, the number of samples requiring diagnostics grew. Designation of SARS-CoV as a biosafety level 3 virus required specialized laboratories, so the WHO coordinated diagnostic labs from nine countries to work together to standardize diagnostic assays, supply similar reagents, ensure proper equipment availability, and analyze results in a comparable manner. Communication was vital with daily teleconferences, secure web sites, and exchange of patient samples and autopsy materials. 43 The SARS epidemic demonstrates how a delay in reporting and an incorrect diagnosis can allow an epidemic to spread. Initially, the Chinese government misdiagnosed the infectious agent as Chlamydia and underestimated the ease of transmission and potential dispersal throughout the region. Epidemiologists from the WHO were not permitted into the Guangdong province until May 2003, but by then the virus had spread all over the globe. Investigators were distracted by reports of fatalities from a virulent strain of avian influenza, which had resurfaced in Hong Kong in late February 2003. Also, the human metapneumovirus, which also causes respiratory illness, had been identified in cell cultures inoculated with some samples from SARS patients. It was later concluded that the newly identified coronavirus was responsible for SARS, and the metapneumovirus was simply circulating concurrently in some populations."],"title":["COVID-19, an emerging coronavirus infection: advances and prospects in designing and developing vaccines, immunotherapeutics, and therapeutics","COVID-19: what has been learned and to be learned about the novel coronavirus disease","79 Regulation and Testing of Vaccines","Coronaviruses post-SARS: Update on replication and pathogenesis","Is there an ideal animal model for SARS?","Design of multi epitope-based peptide vaccine against E protein of human COVID-19: An immunoinformatics approach","Chapter 57 Small Intestine","Is there an ideal animal model for SARS?","Poster Sessions","Poster Sessions","Overview of the CSIRO Australian Animal Health Laboratory","Vaccines for emerging infectious diseases: Lessons from MERS coronavirus and Zika virus","SARS-CoV-2 specific antibody responses in COVID-19 patients","Chapter 9 Respiratory viral infections","Chapter 11 Blood Donation and Collection","CHAPTER 34 Virology Research","A strategy to prevent future pandemics similar to the 2019-nCoV outbreak","A strategy to prevent future pandemics similar to the 2019-nCoV outbreak","Epidemiological data from the COVID-19 outbreak, real-time case information","Current research on respiratory viral infections: Fifth International Symposium","Environmental Engineers and Scientists Have Important Roles to Play in Stemming Outbreaks and Pandemics Caused by Enveloped Viruses","A decade after SARS: Strategies to control emerging coronaviruses","Oligonucleotide antiviral therapeutics: Antisense and RNA interference for highly pathogenic RNA viruses","Is there an ideal animal model for SARS?","Infection Dynamics of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (Covid-19) Modeled with the Integration of the Eyring Rate Process Theory and Free Volume Concept","Enhancing immune responses against SARS-CoV nucleocapsid DNA vaccine by co-inoculating interleukin-2 expressing vector in mice","Ginkgo leaf extract and dipyridamole injection for chronic cor pulmonale: a PRISMA-compliant meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials","What Have We Learned About Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus Emergence in Humans?
