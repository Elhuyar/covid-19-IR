This virus rapidly spreads to 56 countries worldwide. Thus, in order to effectively block its transmission, it is urgent to uncover all the possible transmission routes of SARS-CoV-2. Methods: From January 28 to February 18, 2020, 35 female patients diagnosed with COVID-19 in Tongji Hospital were included in this descriptive study. The gynecologic history, clinical characteristics, laboratory findings and chest computed tomography (CT) of all patients were recorded in detail. To examine whether there is sexual transmission through vaginal from female to her partner, we employed real-time polymerase chain reaction testing (RT-PCR) to detect SARS-CoV-2 in vaginal environment (including vaginal discharge, cervical or vaginal residual exfoliated cells) and anal swab samples, and inquired recent sexual behaviors from the patients. Findings: The age range of the 35 patients with C...","Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is one of the major threats to the healthcare systems in some countries, especially in the Arabian Peninsula. MERS-CoV is considered an ideal example of the One Health concept. This is due to the animals, especially dromedary camels, play important roles in the transmission and sustainability of the virus, and the virus can be transmitted through aerosols of infected patients into the environment. However, there is some debate regarding the origin of MERS-CoV either from bats or other unknown reservoirs. The dromedary camel is the only identified animal reservoir to date. These animals play important roles in sustaining the virus in certain communities and may act as an amplifier of the virus by secreting it in their body fluids, especially in nasal and rectal discharges. MERS-CoV has been detected in the nasal and rectal secretions of infected camels, and MERS-CoV of this origin has full capacity to infect human airway epithelium...","Lack of evidence on SARS-CoV-2 transmission dynamics has led to shifting isolation guidelines between airborne and droplet isolation precautions. During the initial isolation of 13 individuals confirmed positive with COVID-19 infection, air and surface samples were collected in eleven isolation rooms to examine viral shedding from isolated individuals. While all individuals were confirmed positive for SARS-CoV-2, symptoms and viral shedding to the environment varied considerably. Many commonly used items, toilet facilities, and air samples had evidence of viral contamination, indicating that SARS-CoV-2 is shed to the environment as expired particles, during toileting, and through contact with fomites. Disease spread through both direct (droplet and person-to-person) as well as indirect contact (contaminated objects and airborne transmission) are indicated, supporting the use of airborne isolation precautions.","Laboratory researchers and students may expose to hazardous and toxic chemicals. Implementation of the Occupational Health, Safety, and Environment Management System (OHSEMS) has become a critical aspect in higher education. This study presents an overview of the evaluation of the implementation of the OHSEMS in higher education laboratories. The implementation of the OHSEMS is to prevent occupational accidents in the laboratory. The study design is a semiquantitative descriptive study. The aim of the study is to evaluate the implementation of the OHSEMS in higher education institution laboratories by evaluating the percentages of OHSEMS compliance in higher education laboratories. Five aspects are evaluated: occupational health, safety, and environment (OHSE) policy and commitment, planning, implementation, evaluation, and management review. The result shows that the average compliance with the OHSE policy and commitment aspect is 59.4% and for the planning, implementation, evaluation...","The main route of transmission of SARS CoV infection is presumed to be respiratory droplets. However the virus is also detectable in other body fluids and excreta. The stability of the virus at different temperatures and relative humidity on smooth surfaces were studied. The dried virus on smooth surfaces retained its viability for over 5 days at temperatures of 22\u201325\u00b0C and relative humidity of 40\u201350%, that is, typical air-conditioned environments. However, virus viability was rapidly lost (&gt;3 log(10)) at higher temperatures and higher relative humidity (e.g., 38\u00b0C, and relative humidity of &gt;95%). The better stability of SARS coronavirus at low temperature and low humidity environment may facilitate its transmission in community in subtropical area (such as Hong Kong) during the spring and in air-conditioned environments. It may also explain why some Asian countries in tropical area (such as Malaysia, Indonesia or Thailand) with high temperature and high relative humidity environment d...","The Eyrings rate process theory and free volume concept, two very popular theories in chemistry and physics fields, are employed to treat infectious disease transmissions. The susceptible individ- uals are assumed to move stochastically from one place to another. The virus particle transmission rate is assumed to obey the Eyring rate process theory and also controlled by how much free volume available in a system. The transmission process is considered to be a sequential chemical reaction, and the concentrations or fractions of four epidemiological compartments, the susceptible, the exposed, the infected, and the removed, can be derived and calculated. The obtained equations show that the basic reproduction number, R0, is not a constant, dependent on the volume frac- tion of virus particles, virus particle size, and virus particle packing structure, the energy barrier associated with susceptible individuals, and environment temperature. The developed models are applied to treat coronav...","SUMMARY: In global health, critical challenges have arisen from infectious diseases, including the emergence and reemergence of old and new infectious diseases. Emergence and reemergence are accelerated by rapid human development, including numerous changes in demographics, populations, and the environment. This has also led to zoonoses in the changing human-animal ecosystem, which are impacted by a growing globalized society where pathogens do not recognize geopolitical borders. Within this context, neglected tropical infectious diseases have historically lacked adequate attention in international public health efforts, leading to insufficient prevention and treatment options. This subset of 17 infectious tropical diseases disproportionately impacts the world's poorest, represents a significant and underappreciated global disease burden, and is a major barrier to development efforts to alleviate poverty and improve human health.

We previously described an unusual three-stemmed pseudoknot from the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus (CoV) that stimulated -1 PRF. The conserved existence of a third stem\u2013loop suggested an important hitherto unknown function. Here we present new information describing structure and function of the third stem of the SARS pseudoknot. We uncovered RNA dimerization through a palindromic sequence embedded in the SARS-CoV Stem 3. Further in vitro analysis revealed that SARS-CoV RNA dimers assemble through \u2018kissing\u2019 loop\u2013loop interactions. We also show that loop\u2013loop kissing complex formation becomes more efficient at physiological temperature and in the presence of magnesium. When the palindromic sequence was mutated, in vitro RNA dimerization was abolished, and frameshifting was reduced from 15 to 5.7%. Furthermo...","Extrapolation from recent disease history suggests that changes in the global environment, including virus, vector and human behavior, will continue to influence the spectrum of viruses to which humans are exposed. In this article, these environmental changes will be enumerated, and their potential impact on target-focused, nucleic acid-based diagnostic tests will be considered, followed by a presentation of some emerging technological responses.","Respiratory virus infection is one of the major sources of exacerbation of chronic airway inflammatory diseases. These exacerbations are associated with high morbidity and even mortality worldwide. The current understanding on viral-induced exacerbations is that viral infection increases airway inflammation which aggravates disease symptoms. Recent advances in in vitro air-liquid interface 3D cultures, organoid cultures and the use of novel human and animal challenge models have evoked new understandings as to the mechanisms of viral exacerbations. In this review, we will focus on recent novel findings that elucidate how respiratory viral infections alter the epithelial barrier in the airways, the upper airway microbial environment, epigenetic modifications including miRNA modulation, and other changes in immune responses throughout the upper and lower airways. First, we reviewed the prevalence of different respiratory viral infections in causing exacerbations in chronic airway inflamm...","","Pathogenic human coronavirus infections, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV), cause high morbidity and mortality 1,2. Recently, a severe pneumonia-associated respiratory syndrome caused by a new coronavirus was reported at December 2019 (2019-nCoV) in the city Wuhan, Hubei province, China3\u20135, which was also named as pneumonia-associated respiratory syndrome (PARS)6. Up to 9th of February 2020, at least 37, 251 cases have been reported with 812 fatal cases according to the report from China CDC. However, the immune mechanism that potential orchestrated acute mortality from patients of 2019-nCoV is still unknown. Here we show that after the 2019-nCoV infection, CD4+T lymphocytes are rapidly activated to become pathogenic T helper (Th) 1 cells and generate GM-CSF etc. The cytokines environment induces inflammatory CD14+CD16+ monocytes with high expression of IL-6 and accelerates the inflammation. These aberrant and e...","We explore here how variation in the SARS-CoV-2 virus tropism could influence epidemic spread. We use a compartmental model fit to the existing data. The model indicates that Wuhan quarantine measures were effective but that alternative virus forms (gut tropism) and a second propagation route (through environment) was present. For Singapore and Shenzhen region the secondary route does not seem to be active yet. Adequate prevention measures taking into account both routes should be implemented.","Abstract Background The novel coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19), which was first detected in Wuhan City, has now became a pandemic that affecting patients around the world. Particularly, the community patient population are at high risk of infection and are facing potential failure of proper medication use during the pandemic. Objective To discuss community pharmacists\u2019 role and the content of pharmaceutical care (PC) during the novel coronavirus pandemic to promote effective prevention and control and safe drug use of the community patient population. Method Collect and summarize the experience Chinese community pharmacies gained from providing pharmacy services during the COVID-19 outbreak, and taking the PC needs into consideration, analyze and discuss the methods and strategies that community pharmacies and pharmacists shall use to provide PC during the pandemic. Results Community pharmacy management teams shall support PC services by providing adequate supply of COVID-19 related me...","A novel coronavirus (COVID-19) was identified in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, in December 2019 and has caused over 40,000 cases worldwide to date. Previous studies have supported an epidemiological hypothesis that cold and dry (low absolute humidity) environments facilitate the survival and spread of droplet-mediated viral diseases, and warm and humid (high absolute humidity) environments see attenuated viral transmission (i.e., influenza). However, the role of absolute humidity in transmission of COVID-19 has not yet been established. Here, we examine province-level variability of the basic reproductive numbers of COVID-19 across China and find that changes in weather alone (i.e., increase of temperature and humidity as spring and summer months arrive in the North Hemisphere) will not necessarily lead to declines in COVID-19 case counts without the implementation of extensive public health interventions.","R\u00e9sum\u00e9 Un grand nombre d\u2019infections humaines d\u2019origine hydrique sont caus\u00e9es par des micro-organismes qu\u2019il s\u2019agisse de virus, de bact\u00e9ries ou encore de protozoaires.

In previous studies, the level of social contact permitted in individual housing has been auditory, visual, or physical contact. It is unclear how these various levels of social contact compare with each other and to pair housing, when their effects on behavior and health are considered, and whether the timing of pair housing has an effect. To investigate this, 110 Holstein calves (50 males, 60 females) in 11 blocks were paired according to birth date. Within 60h of birth, each pair of calves was allocated to 1 of 5 treatments: individual housing with auditory contact (I), individual housing with auditory and visual contact (V), individual housing with auditory, visual, and tactile contact (T), pair housing (P), or...","Abstract Certification programs have been developed to provide plant material that meets a predetermined level of plant health. The primary objectives of these programs are to limit pathogen incidence in plant material in order to minimize losses by growers and prevent movement of harmful pests and pathogens that may harm the environment. For many fruit and nut crops, orchards are expected to remain productive for years or decades; thus, starting with plants of high health status is essential. The components of certification programs in terms of plant health will be outlined, along with the benefits of harmonizing these programs where possible to facilitate plant movement without increasing trade in plant pathogens.","Summary Globalisation and its effect on human development has rendered an environment that is conducive for the rapid international spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), and other new infectious diseases yet to emerge. After the unprecedented multi-country outbreak of avian influenza with human cases in the winter of 2003\u20132004, an influenza pandemic is a current threat. A critical review of problems and solutions encountered during the 2003\u20132004 SARS epidemics will serve as the basis for considering national preparedness steps that can be taken to facilitate the early detection of avian influenza, and a rapid response to an influenza pandemic should it occur.","Abstract Timeliness is a critical issue in preventing the spread of emerging/notifiable infectious diseases, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) or avian influenza (bird flu). Current computerized surveillance systems in many countries have demonstrated their usefulness in detecting specified communicable-diseases. However, the off-line, daily or weekly data reporting mode induces a time lag in data collection, transmission, processing, and responses. This paper proposes an on-line real-time mechanism, named EDICTS, for emerging/notifiable infectious diseases control, tracking and surveillance. It is based on the on-line health IC card system and works at the registration process of primary care practices and emergency departments. Hence, should a disease defined by CDC (Center for disease control) be detected at the registration station, EDICTS responds in real time. Note that EDICTS is a mechanism; it is CDC that determines the policy and activates it. A prototype is des...","Abstract Propagation of new human respiratory virus pathogens in established cell lines is hampered by a lack of predictability regarding cell line permissivity and by availability of suitable antibody reagents to detect infection in cell lines that do not exhibit significant cytopathic effect. Recently, molecular methods have been used to amplify and identify novel nucleic acid sequences directly from clinical samples, but these methods may be hampered by the quantity of virus present in respiratory secretions at different time points following the onset of infection. Human airway epithelial (HAE) cultures, which effectively mimic the human bronchial environment, allow for cultivation of a wide variety of human respiratory viral pathogens. The goal of the experiments described here was to determine if propagation and identification of a human respiratory virus may be achieved through inoculation of HAE cultures followed by whole transcriptome amplification (WTA) and sequence analysis....","AbstractThe present outbreak of lower respiratory tract infections, including respiratory distress syndrome, is the third spillover, in only two decades, of an animal coronavirus to humans resulting in a major epidemic. Here, the Coronavirus Study Group (CSG) of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses, which is responsible for developing the official classification of viruses and taxa naming (taxonomy) of the Coronaviridae family, assessed the novelty of the human pathogen tentatively named 2019-nCoV. Based on phylogeny, taxonomy and established practice, the CSG formally recognizes this virus as a sister to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronaviruses (SARS-CoVs) of the species Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus and designates it as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). To facilitate communication, the CSG further proposes to use the following naming convention for individual isolates: SARS-CoV-2/Isolate/Host/Date/Location. The ...","Abstract Viruses manipulate cellular machinery and functions to subvert intracellular environment conducive for viral proliferation. They strategically alter functions of the multitasking mitochondria to influence energy production, metabolism, survival, and immune signaling. Mitochondria either occur as heterogeneous population of individual organelles or large interconnected tubular network. The mitochondrial network is highly susceptible to physiological and environmental insults, including viral infections, and is dynamically maintained by mitochondrial fission and fusion. Mitochondrial dynamics in tandem with mitochondria-selective autophagy \u2018mitophagy\u2019 coordinates mitochondrial quality control and homeostasis. Mitochondrial dynamics impacts cellular homeostasis, metabolism, and innate-immune signaling, and thus can be major determinant of the outcome of viral infections. Herein, we review how mitochondrial dynamics is affected during viral infections and how this complex interpla...","The present outbreak of a coronavirus-associated acute respiratory disease called coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) is the third documented spillover of an animal coronavirus to humans in only two decades that has resulted in a major epidemic. The Coronaviridae Study Group (CSG) of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses, which is responsible for developing the classification of viruses and taxon nomenclature of the family Coronaviridae, has assessed the placement of the human pathogen, tentatively named 2019-nCoV, within the Coronaviridae. Based on phylogeny, taxonomy and established practice, the CSG recognizes this virus as forming a sister clade to the prototype human and bat severe acute respiratory syndrome coronaviruses (SARS-CoVs) of the species Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus, and designates it as SARS-CoV-2. In order to facilitate communication, the CSG proposes to use the following naming convention for individual isolates: SARS-CoV-2/host/lo...","Using a sensitive research-grade infrared camera, we find that common facial cosmetics and lotions mask skin temperature in assays of the human forehead. We test a family of 10 commonly-used cosmetic products and find that volatile liquids and creams lower thermal skin temperature by at least 2 C for up to 5-10 min and at least 1 C for up to 20 min, respectively. Powder and cream that contains brightening agent lower indefinitely the skin temperature sensed by infrared camera. With the qualification that these experiments were performed in a controlled laboratory setting rather than the mass crowd screening environment where infrared temperature sensing of humans sees widespread use, our tests suggest that for human subjects whose face was treated with certain cosmetics and lotions, infrared-based screening for elevated facial temperature (fever) can be unreliable.","Objective The purpose of this study was to summarize 3 recent high-profile infectious disease threats that have affected the United States: severe acute respiratory syndrome, West Nile virus, and anthrax. Study design A systematic review was conducted with the use of Medline searches, searches of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website, and review by experts at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Results The 3 emerging infectious diseases pose very different threats: Severe acute respiratory syndrome is a newly identified pathogen that caused an international pandemic; the West Nile virus investigation involved an old pathogen that was identified in a new location; and the anthrax attacks involved the intentional introduction of a pathogen. Conclusion All 3 outbreaks highlight the importance of obstetrician-gynecologists keeping current with new information as it emerges. In this global environment, it is likely that novel disease threats will continue to eme...","AbstractThe novel coronavirus disease first identified in 2019 in Wuhan, China (COVID-19) has become a serious global public health concern. One current issue is the ability to adequately screen for the virus causing COVID-2 (SARS-CoV-2). Here we demonstrate the feasibility of shotgun proteomics as a SARS-CoV-2 screening method, through the detection of viral peptides in proteolytically digested body fluids. Using in silico methods, we generated trypsin-based shotgun proteomics methods optimized for LCMS systems from 5 commercial instrument vendors (Thermo, SCIEX, Waters, Shimadzu, and Agilent). First, we generated protein FASTA files and their protein digest maps. Second, the FASTA files were used to generate spectral libraries based on experimental data. Third, transition lists were derived from the spectral libraries using the vendor neutral and open Skyline software environment. Finally, we identified 17 post-translational modifications using linear motif modeling.Abstract Figure","Abstract Lipid rafts often serve as an entry site for certain viruses. Here, we report that lipid rafts in Vero E6 cells are involved in the entry of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV). Infectivity assay showed the integrity of lipid rafts was required for productive infection of pseudotyped SARS-CoV. Depletion of plasma membrane cholesterol with M\u03b2CD relocalized raft-resident marker caveolin-1 as well as SARS-CoV receptor ACE2 to a nonraft environment, but did not significantly change the surface expression of ACE2. M\u03b2CD-treatment inhibited infectivity of pseudotyped SARS-CoV by 90%. Biochemical fractionation and confocal imaging confirmed that ACE2 colocalized with raft-resident markers. Furthermore, an ectodomain of SARS-CoV S protein (S1188HA) could associate with lipid rafts after binding to its receptor, and colocalize with raft-resident marker ganglioside GM1. The binding of S1188HA was not affected by depleting plasma membrane cholesterol. Taken together, ...","SUMMARY The French public health institute is responsible for promoting and coordinating threats the detection and assessment of health risks, and for suggesting possible responses. Transmissible diseases affecting both human and animal health are the focus of surveillance networks. Early detection of potential infectious threats is based on the screening of \u201c alert signals \u201c identified through routine surveillance networks and other systems. The quality and accuracy of these signals is first verified, before assessing, through a multidisciplinary approach, the risk of introduction and dissemination. This article examines specific cases illustrating the process of detection, risk analysis and response, with respect to infectious threats that are endemic in tropical regions and have the potential to be imported into metropolitan France. For both novel pathogens and exotic diseases \u2014 which, not being endemic in France, are less well known \u2014 the analysis and response process must regularl...","BACKGROUND: Strategies are urgently needed to mitigate the risk of zoonotic disease emergence in southern China, where pathogens with zoonotic potential are known to circulate in wild animal populations. However, the risk factors leading to emergence are poorly understood, which presents a challenge in developing appropriate mitigation strategies for local communities. METHODS: Residents in rural communities of Yunnan, Guangxi and Guangdong provinces were recruited and enrolled in this study. Data were collected through ethnographic interviews and field observations, and thematically coded and analysed to identify both risk and protective factors for zoonotic disease emergence at the individual, community and policy levels. RESULTS: Eighty-eight ethnographic interviews and 55 field observations were conducted at nine selected sites. Frequent human\u2013animal interactions and low levels of environmental biosecurity in local communities were identified as risks for zoonotic disease emergence...","COVID-19 is now widely spreading around the world as a global pandemic, whereas it had been effecitvely under control in China by March 15. In this report, we estimate the global tendency of COVID-19 and analyze the associated global epidemic risk, given that the status quo is continued without further measures being taken. The results show that the global R_0, excluding China, is estimated to be 2.63 (95% CI: 1.67 - 4.69). Seven countries, including Italy and Republic of Korea, have peak values over 10,000. And the peak arrival time of all these countries is after May 12, 2020 (95 % CI: April 1, 2020 - June 24, 2020). We predict that there are four regional clusters of the outbreak: Southeast Asia extending southward to Oceania, the Middle East, Western Europe and North America. Among them, Western Europe will become the major center of the outbreak. The peak values in Spain and Italy are estimated to be 232,661 and 108,062, respectively. The total number of peak values in Europe will...","In this contribution, the classification of protein binding sites using the physicochemical properties exposed to their pockets is presented. We recently introduced Cavbase, a method for describing and comparing protein binding pockets on the basis of the geometrical and physicochemical properties of their active sites. Here, we present algorithmic and methodological enhancements in the Cavbase property description and in the cavity comparison step. We give examples of the Cavbase similarity analysis detecting pronounced similarities in the binding sites of proteins unrelated in sequence. A similarity search using SARS Mpro protease subpockets as queries retrieved ligands and ligand fragments accommodated in a physicochemical environment similar to that of the query. This allowed the characterization of the protease recognition pockets and the identification of molecular building blocks that can be incorporated into novel antiviral compounds. A cluster analysis procedure for the functi...","Background: Coronavirus pandemic is currently a global public health emergency. At present, no pharmacological treatment is known to treat this condition, and there is a need to review the available treatments. Objective: While there have been studies to describe the role of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine in various viral conditions, there is limited information about the use of them in COVID-19. This systematic review aims to summarize the available evidence regarding the role of chloroquine in treating coronavirus infection. Methods: The preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines were used for this review. A literature search was performed using PUBMED &amp; Google Scholar to find articles about the role of CQ in COVID-19 patients. Results: We included 19 publications (Five published articles, three letters/correspondence, one commentary, five pre-proofs of accepted articles, one abstract of yet to be published article, and four were pre-pr...","R\u00e9sum\u00e9 \u00c0 la fin des ann\u00e9es 1970 on a parl\u00e9 \u00ab de la fin des maladies infectieuses \u00bb.

While most FCoV-infected cats are healthy or display only a mild enteritis, some go on to develop feline infectious peritonitis, a disease that is especially common in young cats and multi-cat environments. Up to 12% of FCoV-infected cats may succumb to FIP, with stress predisposing to the development of disease. Disease signs The \u2018wet\u2019 or effusive form, characterised by polyserositis (abdominal and/or thoracic effusion) and vasculitis, and the \u2018dry\u2019 or non-effusive form (pyogranulomatous lesions in organs) reflect clinical extremes of a continuum. The clinical picture of FIP is highly variable, depending on the distribution of the vasculitis and pyogranulomatous lesions. Fever refractory to antibiotics, lethargy, anorexia and weight loss are common non-specific signs. Ascites is the most obvious manifestation of the effusive form. Diagnosis The aetiological di...","This paper examines the role of various socioeconomic factors in mediating the local and cross-city transmissions of the novel coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) in China. We implement a machine learning approach to select instrumental variables that strongly predict virus transmission among the rich exogenous weather characteristics. Our 2SLS estimates show that the stringent quarantine, massive lockdown and other public health measures imposed in late January significantly reduced the transmission rate of COVID-19. By early February, the virus spread had been contained. While many socioeconomic factors mediate the virus spread, a robust government response since late January played a determinant role in the containment of the virus. We also demonstrate that the actual population flow from the outbreak source poses a higher risk to the destination than other factors such as geographic proximity and similarity in economic conditions. The results have rich implications for ongoing global effor...","The first known cases of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), associated with infection by a novel coronavirus (CoV), occurred in 2012 in Jordan but were reported retrospectively. The case first to be publicly reported was from Jeddah, in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA). Since then, MERS-CoV sequences have been found in a bat and in many dromedary camels (DC). MERS-CoV is enzootic in DC across the Arabian Peninsula and in parts of Africa, causing mild upper respiratory tract illness in its camel reservoir and sporadic, but relatively rare human infections. Precisely how virus transmits to humans remains unknown but close and lengthy exposure appears to be a requirement. The KSA is the focal point of MERS, with the majority of human cases. In humans, MERS is mostly known as a lower respiratory tract (LRT) disease involving fever, cough, breathing difficulties and pneumonia that may progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome, multiorgan failure and death in 20 % to 40 % of tho...","Abstract Mass gathering (MG) medicine emerged against the backdrop of the 2009 pandemic H1N1 Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) when the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) hosted the largest annual mass gathering of over 3 million pilgrims from 180 plus countries. However, the events surrounding the latest threat to global health, the PHEIC COVID-19, may be sufficient to highlight the role of mass gatherings, mass migration, and other forms of dense gatherings of people on the emergence, sustenance, and transmission of novel pathogens. The COVID-19 spread illustrates the role of MGs in exacerbation of the scope of pandemics. Cancellation or suspension of MGs would be critical to pandemic mitigation. It is unlikely that medical countermeasures are available during the early phase of pandemics. Therefore, mitigation of its impact, rather than containment and control becomes a priority during pandemics. As the most systematically studied MG-related respiratory disease dat...","Overview Avian influenza is a disease of birds, caused by a type A influenza virus. The subtype H5N1 avian influenza occurs primarily in birds and infection varies from mild disease with little or no mortality to a highly fatal, rapidly spreading epidemic (highly pathogenic avian influenza). It is extremely rare for cats to be infected and there are only very few confirmed reports of the disease in cats in Europe. Infection Cats can be infected via the respiratory and oral routes (eg, by eating infected birds). The key precondition for infection is that the cat lives in an area where H5N1 virus infection has been confirmed in birds. Additionally, the cat should have had outdoor access to an environment where waterfowl is present, or contact with poultry or uncooked poultry meat, or close contact with an H5N1-infected, sick cat during the first week of infection. Clinical suspicion Clinical signs in cats may include fever, lethargy, dyspnoea, conjunctivitis and rapid death. Neurological...","Nearly every country is now combating the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19). It has been hypothesized that if COVID-19 exhibits seasonality, changing temperatures in the coming months will shift transmission patterns around the world. Such projections, however, require an estimate of the relationship between COVID-19 and temperature at a global scale, and one that isolates the role of temperature from confounding factors, such as public health capacity. This paper provides the first plausibly causal estimates of the relationship between COVID-19 transmission and local temperature using a global sample comprising of 166,686 confirmed new COVID-19 cases from 134 countries from January 22, 2020 to March 15, 2020. We find robust statistical evidence that a 1\u00b0C increase in local temperature reduces transmission by 13% [-21%, -4%, 95%CI]. In contrast, we do not find that specific humidity or precipitation influence transmission. Our statistical approach separates effects of climate variation...","Background:Patients with the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) have different degrees of psychological pain, such as anxiety and depression, which may related to their prognosis. Psychological intervention can be conducted in different ways to improve psychological pain and improve the treatment effect. Objective:The present study aimed to investigate and analyze the psychological status of patients with COVID-19 during the course of illness, and to evaluate the effect and influencing factors of psychological crisis intervention, so as to explore the effective mode of clinical psychological intervention in acute patients under isolation environment. Methods:A total of 143 persons participated in the study, including 26 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 in the isolation ward (COVID-19 group), 87 patients with general pneumonia in the observation ward (General Pneumonia group) and 30 healthy volunteers (Normal group). All the patients in the ward received comprehensive psychological int...","Summary Objective To review the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic in Beijing using basic epidemiological principles omitted from the original analysis. Study design Analysis of Prospective surveillance data for Beijing collected during the outbreak. Methods Surveillance data were reclassified according to World Health Organization criteria. Cases previously excluded without date of onset of illness were included in the epidemic curve from estimates using the average time between date of onset and date of hospitalization for cases with both dates. Cases who failed to give a contact history were now included; 7% ( n = 5 ) of cases during the import phase and 61% ( n = 365 ) during the peak phase. Previously excluded cases were included for plotting on an epidemic curve, and basic spot mapping for distribution of cases was used from attack rates recalculated for age, gender, occupation, residential location, date of onset of illness and demographics. Results The spot map e...","Objectives: The novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) originating from Wuhan has rapidly spread throughout China. While the origin of the outbreak remains uncertain, accumulating evidence links a wet market in Wuhan for the early spread of 2019-nCoV. Similarly, the influence of the marketplace on the early transmission dynamics is yet to be investigated. Methods: Using the daily series of COVID-19 incidenceincluding contact history with the market, we have conducted quantitative modeling analyses to estimate the reproduction numbers (R) for the market-to-human and human-to-human transmission together with the reporting probability and the early effects of public health interventions. Results: Our mean R estimates for China in 2019-2020 are estimated at 0.37 (95%CrI: 0.02-1.78) for market-to-human transmission, and 3.87 (95%CrI: 3.18-4.78) for human-to-human transmission, respectively. Moreover we estimated that the reporting rate cases stemming from market-to-human transmission was 3-31 fold h...","Abstract The 2015 Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) outbreak in the Republic of Korea has provided an opportunity to improve our understanding of the spread of MERS linked to healthcare settings. Here we designed a dynamic transmission model to analyze the MERS outbreak in the Republic of Korea based on confirmed cases reported during the period May 20\u2013July 4, 2015. Our model explicitly incorporates superspreading events and time-dependent transmission and isolation rates. Our model was able to provide a good fit to the trajectory of the outbreak and was useful to analyze the role of hypothetical control scenarios. Specifically, we assessed the impact of the timing of control measures, especially associated with a reduction of the transmission rate and diagnostic delays on outbreak size and duration. Early interventions within 1week after the epidemic onset, for instance, including the initial government announcement to the public about the list of hospitals exposed to MERS coron...","The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) plays a key role in maintaining blood pressure homeostasis, as well as fluid and salt balance. Angiotensin II, a key effector peptide of the system, causes vasoconstriction and exerts multiple biological functions. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) plays a central role in generating angiotensin II from angiotensin I, and capillary blood vessels in the lung are one of the major sites of ACE expression and angiotensin II production in the human body. The RAS has been implicated in the pathogenesis of pulmonary hypertension and pulmonary fibrosis, both commonly seen in chronic lung diseases such as chronic obstructive lung disease. Recent studies indicate that the RAS also plays a critical role in acute lung diseases, especially acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). ACE2, a close homologue of ACE, functions as a negative regulator of the angiotensin system and was identified as a key receptor for SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) coronavir...","Governments around the world must rapidly mobilize and make difficult policy decisions to mitigate the COVID-19 pandemic. Because deaths have been concentrated at older ages, we highlight the important role of demography, particularly how the age structure of a population may help explain differences in fatality rates across countries and how transmission unfolds. We examine the role of age structure in deaths thus far in Italy and South Korea and illustrate how the pandemic could unfold in populations with similar population sizes but different age structures, showing a dramatically higher burden of mortality in countries with older versus younger populations. This powerful interaction of demography and current age-specific mortality for COVID-19 suggests that social distancing and other policies to slow transmission should consider both the age composition of local and national contexts as well as the social connectedness of older and younger generations. We also call for countries t...","BACKGROUND: Since its identification on the 7th of January 2020, SARS-CoV-2 has spread to more than 180 countries worldwide, causing &gt;11,000 deaths. At present, viral disease and transmission amongst children is incompletely understood. Specifically, there is concern that children could be an important source of SARS-CoV-2 in household transmission clusters. METHODS: We performed an observational study analysing literature published between December 2019 and March 2020 of the clinical features of SARS-CoV-2 in children and descriptions of household transmission clusters of SARS-CoV-2. In these studies the index case of each cluster defined as the individual in the household cluster who first developed symptoms. FINDINGS: Drawing on studies from China, Singapore, South Korea, Japan, and Iran a broad range of clinical symptoms were observed in children. These ranged from asymptomatic to severe disease. Of the 31 household transmission clusters that were identified, 9.7% (3/31) were ident...","Background: To assess the viability of isolation and contact tracing to control onwards transmission from imported cases of 2019-nCoV. Methods: We developed a stochastic transmission model, parameterised to the 2019-nCoV outbreak. We used the model to quantify the potential effectiveness of contact tracing and isolation of cases at controlling a 2019 nCoV-like pathogen. We considered scenarios that varied in: the number of initial cases; the basic reproduction number R0; the delay from symptom onset to isolation; the probability contacts were traced; the proportion of transmission that occurred before symptom onset, and the proportion of subclinical infections. We assumed isolation prevented all further transmission in the model. Outbreaks were deemed controlled if transmission ended within 12 weeks or before 5000 cases in total. We measured the success of controlling outbreaks using isolation and contact tracing, and quantified the weekly maximum number of cases traced to measure feas...","Interstitial lung disease (ILD) comprises an array of heterogeneous parenchymal lung diseases that are associated with a spectrum of pathologic, radiologic, and clinical manifestations. There are ILDs with known causes and those that are idiopathic, making treatment strategies challenging. Prognosis can vary according to the type of ILD, but many exhibit gradual progression with an unpredictable clinical course in individual patients, as seen in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and the phenomenon of \u201cacute exacerbation\u201d(AE). Given the often poor prognosis of these patients, the search for a reversible cause of respiratory worsening remains paramount. Infections have been theorized to play a role in ILDs, both in the pathogenesis of ILD and as potential triggers of AE. Research efforts thus far have shown the highest association with viral pathogens; however, fungal and bacterial organisms have also been implicated. This review aims to summarize the current knowledge on the role of infecti..."],"title":["Clinical features and sexual transmission potential of SARS-CoV-2 infected female patients: a descriptive study in Wuhan, China","Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus and the One Health concept","Transmission Potential of SARS-CoV-2 in Viral Shedding Observed at the University of Nebraska Medical Center","Evaluation of the implementation of occupational health, safety, and environment management systems in higher education laboratories","The Effects of Temperature and Relative Humidity on the Viability of the SARS Coronavirus","Infection Dynamics of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (Covid-19) Modeled with the Integration of the Eyring Rate Process Theory and Free Volume Concept","Emerging and Reemerging Neglected Tropical Diseases: a Review of Key Characteristics, Risk Factors, and the Policy and Innovation Environment","RNA dimerization plays a role in ribosomal frameshifting of the SARS coronavirus","Expecting the unexpected: nucleic acid-based diagnosis and discovery of emerging viruses","Respiratory Viral Infections in Exacerbation of Chronic Airway Inflammatory Diseases: Novel Mechanisms and Insights From the Upper Airway Epithelium","Chapter 46 Aircraft Cabin Environment","Aberrant pathogenic GM-CSF+ T cells and inflammatory CD14+CD16+ monocytes in severe pulmonary syndrome patients of a new coronavirus","A new transmission route for the propagation of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus","Recommendations and guidance for providing pharmaceutical care services during COVID-19 pandemic: A China perspective","The role of absolute humidity on transmission rates of the COVID-19 outbreak","Sources et devenir des micro-organismes pathog\u00e8nes dans les environnements aquatiques","Effects of level of social contact on dairy calf behavior and health","Pathogen-Tested Planting Material","Preparing to prevent severe acute respiratory syndrome and other respiratory infections","Design and prototype of a mechanism for active on-line emerging/notifiable infectious diseases control, tracking and surveillance, based on a national healthcare card system","Human airway epithelial cell culture to identify new respiratory viruses: Coronavirus NL63 as a model","Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus: The species and its viruses \u2013 a statement of the Coronavirus Study Group","Mitochondrial dynamics and viral infections: A close nexus","The species Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus: classifying 2019-nCoV and naming it SARS-CoV-2","Infrared assessment of human facial temperature in the presence and absence of common cosmetics","Emerging infectious disease outbreaks: Old lessons and new challenges for obstetrician-gynecologists","In silico approach to accelerate the development of mass spectrometry-based proteomics methods for detection of viral proteins: Application to COVID-19","Lipid rafts are involved in SARS-CoV entry into Vero E6 cells","Risques d\u2019importation des maladies infectieuses exotiques en France m\u00e9tropolitaine : d\u00e9tection, alerte et r\u00e9ponse","A qualitative study of zoonotic risk factors among rural communities in southern China","Assessing the Global Tendency of COVID-19 Outbreak","From the Similarity Analysis of Protein Cavities to the Functional Classification of Protein Families Using Cavbase","Role of Chloroquine and Hydroxychloroquine in the Treatment of COVID-19 Infection- A Systematic Literature Review","Les maladies infectieuses \u00e9mergentes : importance en sant\u00e9 publique, aspects \u00e9pid\u00e9miologiques, d\u00e9terminants et pr\u00e9vention","Comment \u00e9valuer, orienter et suivre un patient ayant une pneumonie aigu\u00eb communautaire ?

Some enveloped viruses, however, are released to the environment by the host and persist on surfaces (i.e., fomites), in the air, or in water, long enough to come into contact with another host for further onward transmission (i.e., indirect transmission). This includes viruses responsible for influenza and measles. The primary transmission routes for SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19) are believed to be person-to-person contact and by exposure to large droplets produced from sneezing, coughing or talking, but indirect transmission routes may also play a role.1 This potential role of the environment in the spread of COVID-19 highlights the multitude of applied research needs that must be addressed to effectively control outbreaks and pandemics as novel enveloped viruses emerge. Environmental engineers and scientists are well positioned to apply their unique skill sets and experience with interdisciplinary research to address these needs.","Any agent or microorganism is of epidemiologic importance if it can be transmitted through the environment, cause infection in a host (either human or animal), and produce clinical disease. These agents, regardless of their classification as bacterial, viral, protozoal, helminthic, or fungal, are considered the first necessary component in the chain of infection. Three characteristics of agents must be considered in terms of their epidemiologic importance: (1) those that are involved in spread or transport of the agent through the environment, (2) those that are involved in the production of infection, and (3) those that are involved in the production of disease. 94 The characteristics of agents involved in spread through the environment vary with the method of transmission, but in any case, it is necessary for a minimum number of organisms to survive transport through the environment to reach and enter a susceptible host. Agents that are transmitted by direct person-to-person contact tend to have minimal ability to survive stressful environmental conditions (such as changes in temperature, humidity, or pH). In contrast, agents that are capable of multiplication within the environment (i.e., in food products, water, soil, and plants) have a unique advantage for survival. Some agents, such as Legionella pneumophila or Bacillus anthracis, do not necessarily multiply within the environment but can survive for months to many years in relatively hostile conditions, including distilled water or soil. 95, 96 For those agents for which humans are the only known reservoir, the longer the time that is likely to elapse before contact with another susceptible host, the greater the resistance the agent must have to environmental conditions, such as heat, drying, ultraviolet light, or dilution by airflow. Finally, some agents have the capacity to infect nonhuman hosts, such as animals, birds, or an insect vector. Such nonhuman hosts may play an important role in maintenance of the agent in the environment.","Nonenveloped viruses are typically more resistant to environmental conditions and the action of antimicrobials than enveloped viruses (Watanabe et al. 1989; Barker et al. 2001). Feline calicivirus has been found to persist for up to 28 days in a dry environment at room temperature (Doultree et al. 1999). Also, in a study by Smid et al. (1991), rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus (also a calicivirus) survived for at least 105 days in a dried state at room temperature. Viruses that cause symptoms such as vomiting or diarrhea are likely to contaminate the environment. In one study, 607 of 680 (89%) norovirus outbreaks were linked to person-to-person transmission (Evans et al. 1998) that included poor hand hygiene as well as surface-to-surface transmission (Barker et al. 2001). Also, successive outbreaks of norovirus infections in passengers on cruise ships on separate trips have strongly implicated environmental contamination (Barker et al. 2001). Enveloped viruses are typically less stable in the environment, yet the SCoV is able to survive on fomites for up to 96 h (Duan et al. 2003). The transmission of SCoV is believed to be multifactorial, with evidence from previous outbreaks suggestive of at least some role for contaminated fomites in the transmission of the virus (Dowell et al. 2004; Chu et al. 2005).","Since both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 have intermediate respiratory transmission potentials, how do we account for the greater contagiousness of the latter? We need to understand that the respiratory transmission potential of a single viral particle is just one of several factors that might contribute to the contagiousness of the virus. Other factors include how many particles are released by the host and how long does the particle remain in the environment. We mentioned that our model has detected something odd about SARS-COV-2: this virus has one of the hardest outer shell within the family as seen in Figure 1 and Table 1 (M PID = 6 %). Since the outer shell plays the greater role in protecting the virion in comparison to the inner shell, the harder outer shell provides virus greater resilience to outside the body environment and to the presence of digestive enzymes found in the saliva, mucus, and other bodily fluids 20,22,42-46 . As a result, the virus with the harder outer shell is able to remain active for a longer time and, therefore a lesser number of viral particles is required for a chance to infect someone. Furthermore, because the virus is more resistant to the digestive enzymes in the bodily fluids, an infected body is likely to discharged more infectious particles.","The spread of an infectious disease is an instance of spatiotemporal diffusion processes at work, in which the emergence of the disease moves across space and changes in extent over time [25]. Geographic information systems (GIS) offer a means to visualize, analyze and understand the distribution of infectious diseases over space and time, thereby revealing spatiotemporal trends, patterns and associations between the pathological factors and the geographic environments of the disease [26,27]. Exploiting the analytical, modelling and simulation features of GIS has improved epidemiological outbreak investigation and response, in which recognizing the spatial spread and transmission dynamics of an emerging infectious disease is essential for advising on efficient disease control and prevention measures [28]. However, since the first reported case of MERS-CoV in 2012, there has been a paucity of studies addressing the spatial dimension of the distribution of this disease. With the use of ecological modelling in a GIS environment [29], a preliminary transmission risk map of MERS-CoV was produced across the Middle East by analyzing the spatial distribution of MERS-CoV cases and environmental transmission risk factors (bioclimatic variables). This suggests that the transmission route of the disease via camel exposure plays a major role. However, the effects of environmental risk factors on disease transmission were not explicitly determined. A geo-additive regression model was also utilized to examine the risk factor levels of individuals for MERS-CoV mortality in the Arabian Peninsula between 2012 and 2015 [30], and significant spatial variation and clustering with a lower risk were found in Riyadh, Arar, Aljouf and Jizan, whereas a higher risk was observed in Qassim province. However, the spatial analysis lacked detail at the governorate and city levels. The application of an iterative empirical process in a GIS environment revealed that high-camel-density areas, camel convergence points (camel markets, barns, breeding sites and slaughterhouses), former MERS-CoV cases and high seroprevalence rates were the potential risk factors for spatial MERS-CoV hotspots in Kenya [31]. Considering the space and time dimensions of the MERS-CoV, one study highlighted that higher heterogeneity was more prominent in zoonotic than in human-to-human transmission in the Middle East region; this result emphasizes the importance of the environmental component of the epidemic [32].","Although various studies of HAIs have been carried out, the exact mechanism of pathogen transmission is still not fully understood. In the case of MRSA, the most likely mode of spread is by indirect transmission via a health-care worker acting as a 'transient carrier' and indirect acquisition by contact with a contaminated environment [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] . Several studies provide evidence that S. aureus is present in the environment or in the surrounding air and, as a result, both vehicle-borne and airborne transmission might also happen [9] [10] [11] [12] .","The quarantine has substantially altered the transmission pattern of the virus in Wuhan. While our model predicts that public transmission accounts for the majority of transmission prior to the quarantine, household transmission is the dominant route of transmission during the quarantine. This is intuitively reasonable as the quarantine has significantly reduced the public contacts of the residents and increased their contacts with family members in a closed household environment. In cases where the epidemic is able to be contained without a second outbreak, the dominant route of transmission would switch back to the public transmission after lifting the quarantine ( Figure S4a ). In cases where the epidemic results in a second major outbreak (Figure 4b) , the second outbreak would be predominantly driven by household transmission. Our estimate that ~70% of all infected cases was due to household transmission is also in a broad park agreement with a recent report of WHO (78-85% 16 ). Further, we estimated 5% hospital-acquired infections in (patients, 1.1%; medical staff 3.8%), which is consistent with a recent clinical report 17 .","In the present study, we have demonstrated that SARS CoV can survive at least two weeks after drying at temperature and humidity conditions found in an air-conditioned environment. The virus is stable for 3 weeks at room temperature in a liquid environment but it is easily killed by heat at 56\u00b0C for 15 minutes [9]. This indicates that SARS CoV is a stable virus that may potentially be transmitted by indirect contact or fomites. These results may indicate that contaminated surfaces may play a major role in transmission of infection in the hospital and the community. ","In addition to mediating attachment to host cells, the delivery system also plays a crucial role in determining the mode of transmission between hosts. Viruses containing lipid envelopes are sensitive to desiccation in the environment and, for the most part, are transmitted by the respiratory, parenteral, and sexual routes. Nonenveloped viruses are stable to harsh environmental conditions and are often transmitted by the fecal-oral route.","It has been postulated that infection is a major risk factor in the development of ONJ. Studies have attempted to define the role of microorganisms and the host response to infection as potential mechanisms for disease development and progression. Pushalkar and colleagues 137 compared microbial diversity in a small set of patients who took bisphosphonates and did or did not have osteonecrosis, as well as in normal control subjects. These investigators found less bacterial diversity in the bisphosphonate-related ONJ (BRONJ) group compared with the others, but with a predominant presence of Firmicutes. They also found lower levels of myeloperoxidase but higher levels of the proinflammatory cytokines IL-6 and TNF in the BRONJ cohort compared with control subjects. Furthermore, polymerase chain reaction analysis revealed downregulation of nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-containing protein 2 (NOD-2) and cathepsin G and upregulation of secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor, proteinase 3, and conserved helix-loop-helix ubiquitous kinase. The respective roles of the microorganism environment itself versus the host innate immune response to this environment are still to be elucidated. 137 In yet another study investigating the microbacterial environment in patients with BRONJ, Wei and colleagues 138 found that the predominant species in osteonecrosis lesions in patients with BRONJ included Stretococcus (29%), Eubacterium (9%), and Pseudoramibacter (8%) compared with the control group, in whom the most common species found were Parvamonas (17%), Streptococcus (15%), and Fusobacterium (15%). Wei and colleagues 138 also found that in patients with BRONJ, hematoxylin-eosin staining revealed that the bacteria were layered and packed into the scalloped edges of BRONJ bone, suggesting the role of biofilms as a potential risk factor for the development of BRONJ. 138 osteonecrosis. The relationship between osteonecrosis and oxidative injury leads one to wonder if corticosteroidinduced osteonecrosis can be prevented or lessened in severity by simultaneous or prophylactic administration of antioxidants.","The One Health concept is an interesting concept outlining the close interaction among humans, animals and the environment (Destoumieux-Garzon et al., 2018). Currently, there are two coronaviruses candidates representing the One Health concept, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. Animals play important roles in the transmission cycle of both viruses (Alshukairi et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2005). Both viruses were proven to be of zoonotic origin (Gao et al., 2016). The palm civet cat played important role in the transmission cycle of SARS-CoV (Wang et al., 2005). Some patients proved to visit one restaurant serving the civet cats as a meal (Wang et al., 2005). Culling of the civet cats resulted in marked decline in the reported SARS-CoV cases and now become extinct. Many studies made a direct link between the exposure to camel and its meat and milk products and MERS-CoV human cases (Reusken et al., 2014). Several studies reported the presence of MERS-CoV specific antibodies in sera of human came in close contact with camels (Reusken et al., 2014; Reusken et al., 2016). Meanwhile, MERS-CoV was isolated from air pf positive dromedary camel herds in Saudi Arabia (Azhar et al., 2014).","Investigation and treatment of abnormal increase of MDROs in surgical intensive care unit of a medical center Chi-Fen Tsou 1 , Ying-Ling Chen 1 , Hung jen Tang Results: These control measures were successful and no further cases of VRE colonization were identified. VRE was isolated from the environment (surfaces of bed rails, ambu bag, on a patient bucket urinal, and curtain). All isolates were sent to a reference laboratory for typing and confirmed that the environmental samples were the same strain as the 2 patients who isolated VRE on the first occasion. Conclusions: Although VRE is known to persist in the environment, we were concerned that VRE persisted despite cleaning of the ICU. Further investigation revealed that ward cleaner is responsible for cleaning the bed and that nursing staff are responsible for cleaning the medical instruments. But as the cot sides of a bed may be moved, it was unclear whose role it was to clean the cot sides. Transmission to patients is however more likely to occur in \"near-patient\" areas such as the hospital bed and patient equipment. While cleaning of soiled linens room and floors is usually done by the ward cleaner, which cleans these \"nearpatient\" areas is greyer and may be carried out by nursing staff, ward cleaner or healthcare assistants; depending on the nature of equipment to be cleaned. Most importantly on \"near-patient\" areas, this can be an important niche for transmission of multidrug resistant organisms.","The emerging Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) was found to cause sporadic cases of severe acute respiratory infection. Between April 2012 and 26 April 2014, a total of 261 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV were reported, including 93 deaths, in nine different countries.1 To date, the viral transmission route is still not elucidated, although recent studies showed that tomb bats and camels may play a role as reservoirs or intermediate hosts.2,3 Coronaviruses are enveloped viruses, usually known to be fragile in the environment. However, enveloped viruses can persist in the environment for extended periods of time, even at 35\u00b0C.4 Understanding the potential effect of heat inactivation of the novel coronavirus is of significant value to elaborate proper public intervention measures.","A key focus of this article is to review the transmission routes of new and emerging infectious agents. Preventing disease acquisition via person-to-person transmission or contact with the contaminated environment depends on rapid and appropriate institution of isolation precautions, appropriate hand hygiene, and appropriate disinfection of medical equipment, devices, and the surface environment. Importantly, once the nature of the emerging disease is known (ie, enveloped virus, bacteria, fungi, nonenveloped virus, mycobacteria), it is possible to determine the proper antiseptics and disinfectants, even in the absence of studies of the exact infectious agent. 21 For example, an enveloped virus (eg, Ebola, MERS-CoV) or vegetative bacterium (eg, CRE) would be inactivated by any agent active against nonenveloped viruses or mycobacteria. It is important to remember that alcohol has reduced activity against nonenveloped viruses (eg, norovirus) and no activity against spores (eg, Clostridioides difficile).","There is a general misconception that airplane cabins provide a unique environment for transmission of air-borne infectious agents: however, human factors rather than strictly environmental factors promote transmission of infectious diseases during long airplane flights (Chapter 4). Disease transmission of respiratory pathogens occurs whenever a susceptible person is in close proximity to an infectious person, and wherever large groups of people are crowded together in confined spaces, be that in classrooms, offices, movie theaters, shopping malls, convention halls, train stations, airports, etc. Direct inoculation from contaminated fingers to mucosal surfaces of the mouth, nose, and eyes is probably as significant as droplet inhalation in transmission of respiratory viruses.","The viability of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV under various conditions and their prolonged presence in the environment suggest the potential for coronaviruses to be transmitted via contact or fomites. SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are both viable in conditions with low temperatures and humidity. [12] [13] [14] Although direct droplet transmission is an important route of transmission, faecal excretion, environmental contamination, and fomites might contribute to viral transmission. Considering the evidence of faecal excretion for both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, and their ability to remain viable in conditions that could facilitate faecal-oral transmission, it is possible that SARS-CoV-2 could also be transmitted via this route.","The ward environment cleaning monitoring took 13 months, the results showed even cleaning and disinfection have been implemented, MDRO still exists in the ward environment. Thus, we provided sanitary unit these data for educational training and ask them to improve their practice on environment cleaning. Besides, Table 1 also showed non-high-risk ward sections was free from MDRO, indicating high-risk ward sections should be regularly monitored, and supervised implementation of environment cleaning and disinfection to ensure better cleanliness in hospital environment and better healthcare quality.","The survival time of the etiologic agent of SARS in the environment is critical in interpreting the epidemiology of SARS. Coronaviruses have lipid envelopes and, thus, are susceptible to inactivation by heat, desiccation, oxidizing agents, lipid solvents, nonionic detergents, and ultraviolet irradiation. Survival time depends on the viral genotype, the composition of carrier and substrate, and the particular situation. Respiratory viruses transmitted in droplets or aerosols generally have a limited duration and range of infectivity, whereas other routes of transmission may be more protective (e.g. feces), and so would lead to contamination of the environment for longer periods.","As most cases had visited a common seafood market within limited time period, an animal originated outbreak has been suspected. The main symptoms in patients have been fever and respiratory related symptoms, therefore, the mode of transmission needs to be respiratory, quite unlikely oral via food. Those infected initially were mostly elderly men, possibly reflecting age and gender structure of the market workers, smoking may also have played a role. Additionally, some cases have reported visiting a different seafood market, but not Huanan market. Coronavirus positive environmental samples (33/585) have been reported in the media in the wildlife end of the market environment, yet no findings have been reported from market animals this far (Cohen, 2020) . There were also some earlier media rumors of the positive environmental samples from the seafood section of the market, but these have not been confirmed. A snake coronavirus has been suspected to be similar to SARS-CoV-2 sequence (Ji et al., 2020) , however, this has been criticized later (Sciencenews, 2020) . Most recent sequence similarity has been from pangolins (Nature, 2020).","Environmental transmission: transmission via contamination, and specifically in a way that would not typically be attributable to contact with the source in a contact survey (i.e., this does not include transmission pairs who were in extended close contact, but for whom in reality the infectious dose passed via the environment instead of more directly). These could be identified in an analysis of spatial movements.","Aerosol-generating procedures may also contribute to the transmission of SARS. Infection occurred in a healthcare worker who assisted patients ventilated by a bag-valve-mask for 10 to 15 min before the intubation procedure during cardiopulmonary resuscitation, despite having worn an N95 respirator (Christian et al., 2004) . The mechanism of transmission remains to be elucidated. However, transmission of SARS-CoV by indirect contact with contaminated environment might be one of the possibilities, as SARS-CoV can survive in the environment for 72-120 h (Chan et al., 2011; Duan et al., 2003) , while infectivity is retained for up to 6 days on a dried surface (Rabenau et al., 2005) .","Livestock production in China has expanded at an unprecedented rate over the past three decades. The consumption of pigs increased 3.7-fold from 160 million in 1978 to 610 million in 2008, of cattle increased 1.5-fold from 70 million to 106 million, of sheep and goats increased 1.65-fold from 170 million to 281 million, and of poultry increased 7.3-fold from 170 million to 9700 million. 57 Large-scale farms and scattered small-scale individual farms coexist in China, and the latter account for the majority. 58 Almost every household in rural areas is engaged in livestock production, including pigs, chickens, bovines, sheep, ducks, etc. Different domestic animals live in the same environment, which provides a dynamic micro-environment that contributes to interspecies transmission, even from animals to humans. 59, 60 Another example is human echinococcosis in Tibetan pastoral communities in western China, in which dogs, domestic animals (yaks, sheep, and goats), and wild animals living in the same environment are involved in the transmission cycle of Echinococcus granulosus and Echinococcus multilocularis, contributing to the high prevalence of human echinococcosis. 61 Due to the practice of scattered small-scale individual farming and the lack of meat inspection at such small operations, farmers often slaughter their animals for their own consumption. Compared with professionals in modern abattoirs, the local farmers do not wear protective clothing or gloves, resulting in high incidences of brucellosis infection in this population and other livestock-related occupations, such as herdsmen, coat and leatherworkers, and veterinarians. 37 On the other hand, the largescale farms, also termed concentrated animal feeding operations (CAFO), are increasing at an unprecedented rate in China, which will increase the risk of disease transmission.","From the very first events of the MERS-CoV epidemic, the virus showed its health careeassociated dynamic. 6 Apart of sporadic community cases and family clusters, health careeassociated transmission has been reported on several occasions during the last 2 years, indicating human-to-human, although inconsistent, transmission (Table 1) . 2, 3, 6, 8, [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] Gaps in infection control were the common denominator in the events of health care associatede transmission. 2, 3, 6, 8, 22, 24 During the largest so farepublished outbreak of MERS-CoV that occurred in Al-Hasa, Saudi Arabia, in 2013, 4 health care facilities were affected through transfer of patients but also possibly because of repeated introductions of cases from the community. 3 The outbreak extended for almost 2 months and involved 34 cases, including 2 HCWs. Most cases were confined in the hemodialysis unit with rapid transmission and high attack rates. 3 This outbreak gave the opportunity to elucidate several epidemiologic parameters of secondary MERS-CoV infection, such as the incubation period (5.2 days; 95% confidence interval, 1.92-14.7 days), serial interval (7.6 days; 95% confidence interval, 2.5-23.1 days), and heterogeneity in transmission, with many infected patients not transmitting the infection at all and 1 infected patient transmitting the infection to 7 others. 3 Moreover, this outbreak raised the possibility of transmission through direct or indirect contact and between rooms in the same ward. 3 A recent study showed that MERS-CoV remained viable for up to 48 hours under specific environmental conditions, which mimic the hospital environment (20 C with 40% relative humidity), whereas its stability was not reduced during aerosolization. 28 These data show that MERS-CoV has the potential to spread through contact or fomites caused by prolonged survival. A model-based study found that the virus structural characteristics render it very likely to remain viable in the environment for a long period and support fecal-oral transmission. 29 Vomiting and diarrhea are common in patients with MERS-CoV 1,22,27 and may contribute to transmission. The MERS-CoV case imported in France shared his bathroom with the secondary hospital-acquired case, which raises the possibility of spread through stools. 22 MERS-CoV is predominantly shed through respiratory secretions during cough. MERS-CoV has been detected through polymerase chain reaction for up to 16 days in respiratory specimens and stools and up to 13 days in urine. 22, 30, 31 Our knowledge about virus shedding and viral load kinetics throughout the clinical course of ill patients is scarce and therefore can provide limited guidance about the duration of implementation of infection control measures. 31 The possibility of prolonged shedding under an immunocompromised status should also be investigated and considered for infection control purposes.","The latest guidelines from Chinese health authorities [23, 43] described three main transmission routes for the COVID-19: 1) droplets transmission, 2) contact transmission, and 3) aerosol transmission. Droplets transmission was reported to occur when respiratory droplets (as produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes) are ingested or inhaled by individuals nearby in close proximity; contact transmission may occur when a subject touches a surface or object contaminated with the virus and subsequently touch their mouth, nose, or eyes; and aerosol transmission may occur when respiratory droplets mix into the air, forming aerosols and may cause infection when inhaled high dose of aerosols into the lungs in a relatively closed environment [23, 43]. In addition to these three routes, one study also indicated the digestive system as a potential transmission route for COVID-19 infection. Since patients had abdominal discomfort and diarrhea symptoms, researchers analyzed four datasets with single-cell transcriptomes of digestive systems and found that ACE2 was highly expressed in absorptive enterocytes from ileum and colon [44].","The transmission of influenza can be mathematically modeled to help predicting how the virus will spread in a population [27, 28] . People who contract influenza are most infectious between the second and third days after infection, and infectivity lasts for around 10 days [27] . Children are much more infectious than adults, and shed virus from just before they develop symptoms until 2 weeks after infection [27, 29] . For influenza control it is very important to investigate viral shedding and resistant viruses [29] . According to Mitamura and colleagues [29] , viral loads are decreased after the start of antiviral agents, but resistant viruses are detected in some patients. Influenza can be spread by direct transmission when an infected person sneezes mucus into the eyes, nose, or mouth of another person; through people inhaling the aerosols produced by infected people with coughing, sneezing, and spitting; and through hand-to-mouth transmission from contaminated surfaces or direct personal contact [30, 31] . The relative importance of airborne, droplet, and contact transmission of influenza A virus and the efficiency of control measures depends on the inactivation of viruses in different environmental media. Weber and colleagues [31] systematically reviewed information on the environmental inactivation of influenza A viruses and modes of transmission. The airborne route is a potentially important transmission pathway for influenza in indoor environments. The importance of droplet transmission has to be reassessed. Contact transmission can be limited by fast inactivation of influenza virus on hands, and is more dependent on behavioral parameters than airborne transmission. However, the potentially large inocula deposited in the environment through sneezing and the protective effect of nasal mucus on virus survival could make contact transmission a key transmission mode. In the airborne route, it has been demonstrated that the inhalation of just one inhalable droplet (0.5-5 lm in diameter) might be enough to cause an infection [31] . Although a single sneeze releases up to 40,000 droplets [32] , most of these droplets are large and will quickly settle out of the air [31] . The influenza virus can also be transmitted by contaminated surfaces. Successful control of a viral disease requires knowledge of the different vectors that could promote its transmission among hosts. Thomas and colleagues [33] assessed the survival of human influenza viruses on banknotes, given that billions of these notes are exchanged daily worldwide. Banknotes were experimentally contaminated with representative influenza virus subtypes at various concentrations, and survival was tested after different time periods. Influenza A viruses tested by cell culture survived up to 3 days when they were inoculated at high concentrations. The same inoculum in the presence of respiratory mucus showed a striking increase in survival time (up to 17 days). B/Hong Kong/335/2001 virus was still infectious after 1 day when it was mixed with respiratory mucus. When nasopharyngeal secretions of naturally infected children were used, influenza virus survived for at least 48 h in one-third of the cases. The investigators concluded that unexpected stability of influenza virus in this nonbiological environment suggests that unusual environmental contamination should be considered in the setting of pandemic preparedness [33] . Bean and colleagues investigated the transmission of influenza viruses via hands and environmental surfaces; the survival of laboratory-grown influenza A and influenza B viruses on various surfaces was studied. Both influenza A and B viruses survived for 24 to 48 hours on hard, nonporous surfaces such as stainless steel and plastic, but survived for less than 8 to 12 hours on cloth, paper, and tissues. Measurable quantities of influenza A virus were transferred from stainless steel surfaces to hands for 24 hours and from tissues to hands for up to 15 minutes. Virus survived on hands for up to 5 minutes after transfer from the environmental surfaces. Their observations suggest that the transmission of virus from donors who are shedding large amounts could occur for 2 to 8 hours via stainless steel surfaces and for a few minutes via paper tissues. The investigators concluded that the transmission of influenza virus via fomites may be possible under conditions of heavy environmental contamination [34] . However, if the virus is present in mucus, the virus can survive for longer periods [31] .","Our knowledge about the epidemiologic characteristics of MERS-CoV that impact health care transmission is very limited. To interrupt in-hospital transmission, routes of efficient exposure and virus shedding should be well studied. The contribution of primary cases to the so-called hospital-acquired cases in the recent upsurge of detected cases in the Arabian Peninsula is still unclear, and further epidemiologic data and analyses are necessary. In 1 analysis, 60 of 95 (63.2%) cases with evidence of secondary transmission acquired the infection in the hospital environment; nevertheless, 49 of them had additionally reported exposure to animals, therefore not eliminating an alternative source of infection. 21 The stability of the proportion of asymptomatic versus symptomatic cases is an argument against increasing testing as a possible explanation for either primary or secondary cases. 10 On the other hand, a reverse scenario could be that additional cases are missed because cases at the early incubation period or with low viral loads may be missed with molecular testing. A transmission event under similar circumstances has been described in the community for the first imported MERS-CoV case in the United States that tested negative by molecular assays but subsequently tested positive by serology. 25, 40 Research for the future Active surveillance and testing are of outmost importance to provide answers about the epidemiology of MERS-CoV and evolution of the current epidemic. Case-control, serologic studies in exposed HCWs are needed to better define the effectiveness of infection control measures. Transmission of the virus via asymptomatic shedding in feces or other routes (eg, fomites, environment) is another topic for investigation. Studies of viral kinetics in affected patients with molecular analyses of samples from various body sites will provide answers for infection control as well.","Investigation of outbreak caused by Elizabethkingia meningoseptica at a respiratory care center in Taiwan Guan-Jhou Chen 1 , Ning Ting 2 , I-Chen Hung 2 , Jann-Tay Wang 1,2 , Wang-Huei Sheng 1,2 *, Yee-Chun Chen 1 , Shan-Chwen Chang 1 . Background: Elizabethkingia meningoseptica is a ubiquitous pathogen that could be found in clinical environment and equipment surfaces. E. meningoseptica had the nature characteristics of resistant to various antimicrobial agents, such as carbapenem. Increasing frequency of human infection, especially from healthcare associated infections, had been reported in recent decade. However, efforts of infection control of outbreak caused by E. meningoseptica remains less reported. Methods: The Respiratory Care Center (RCC) at the National Taiwan University Hospital is a 15-bed unit which provides care for ventilator-dependent patients. During October 2016 to November 2016, 3 patients developed bacteremia due to E. meningoseptica during the stay at RCC, which was significantly higher comparing to background incidence. All three isolates had identical antimicrobial susceptibility pattern. An environmental investigation and infection control measures of outbreak, such as strict hand hygiene, contact isolation and environmental cleaning were conducted. Molecular typing by using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) was used to investigate the relatedness of isolates and isolates with more than 90% of similarity were considered the same cluster. Results: In the investigation of outbreak, eight clinical isolates were cultured from six patients, including 6 isolates from blood and two isolate from sputum. Two additional isolates were cultured from the hospital environment. PFGE of the 10 isolates revealed three different clusters, including three, three and two isolates in each cluster. A blood isolate from one patient was identical to one of the isolates from the medical environment (Cluster 3, Figure 1 ). There was no linkage to the environmental isolates of the other two clusters indicate the possibility of cross transmission by healthcare personnel (Cluster 1 and 2, Figure 1 ). After use of strict cohort nursing, hand hygiene and environmental cleaning, the outbreak was controlled. Conclusion: We reported the investigation of an E. meningoseptica outbreak at the RCC of a medical center in Taiwan. Our results demonstrate potential transmission of E. meningoseptica via medical environment and person-to-person contact. Vigorous infection control measures should be applied to prevent spreading of E. meningoseptica at hospitals.","Phylogenetic analysis of the Greek MERS-CoV strain showed close similarity with circulating patient viral strains from the recent Jeddah outbreak as well as with a strain isolated from a dromedary camel in Qatar. This is in accordance with previous genetic studies that have shown identical viral strains between infected humans and dromedary camels and generated the hypothesis that dromedary camels are among the reservoirs of the virus in nature [10, 26] . Also, the presence of MERS-CoV-specific antibodies in camels across a wide geographic area in Africa and the Arabian Peninsula signifies the possibility for zoonotic transmission between camels and humans [27] [28] [29] . The potential for transmission across different individual strains should be further explored. In this patient, the most likely source of exposure was the hospital environment in an endemic area, as his wife was hospitalised in a local hospital in Jeddah [6] . It appears that healthcare-associated outbreaks are playing a pivotal role in the evolution of the MERS-CoV epidemic in the recent upsurge [30] .","The observed results infer that current antimicrobial use can lead to levels in the environment which may increase resistance formation. The legislation of new antimicrobials should consider metabolism, as it will greatly influence levels emitted into the environment. The in-depth understanding of antimicrobial presence in the environment is lacking; specifically, with regard to lower limits of minimum inhibitory concentrations acting as selectors for resistance formation. The use of ECOSAR \u00ae for antimicrobial toxicity reference values is limited as the bacteria targeted by antimicrobials are phylogenetically distinct from the cyanobacteria used to calculate the EC/LCsub50 values. The results and limitations presented here accentuate the need for further research into antimicrobials in the environment and the development of antimicrobial resistant strains.","In our RL framework, the chemical environment receives action at from the agent and emits scalar reward rt and state s ' 3 to the agent as Figure 2A shows. Note that the definition of the environment state is different from the general approach that the environment state is only the environment's private representation invisible to the agent.","Reducing HAI by implementation of environment clean separation management measures using 4 different color disposable wipes Swee Siang Wong 1 *, Chiu Chu Yang 2 , Yi Pei Hsieh 2 , Chen Ni Kuo 2 , Yi Ru Chen 2 , Li Ching Chen 1 , Ko chung Tsui 1,3,4 , Cheng Hua Huang 1 . Background: Environmental cleaning is a fundamental principle of infection control in healthcare settings. However, the comparative application methods and contamination assessment techniques is unknown, and no consensus exists around benchmarks for cleanliness. We sought to determine whether implement environment clean separation management measures in a medical intensive care unit (MICU) could reduce the density of healthcare associated infection. Methods: We performed a 4-month prospective cohort intervention study, August \u223c December 2013, at medical intensive care unit in a 700-bed tertiary care hospital. Following one month of preintervention phase, implementing education and training for all cleaning staff and related personnel to use environment clean separation management measures by using 4 different color disposable wipes to clean high tough surfaces. The cleaning staff was asked to use red wipe to clean the toilet door knobs, isolation room and waste room, yellow wipe to clean the patient's bedside, green wipe to clean the nursing station and meeting room, blue wipe to clean the procedure tables, refrigerator handle and water dispenser button. The cleaning effect of the MICU environment was measured by using ATP bioluminescence. Then the density of health-care associated infection of the MICU was monitored every month. Results: The ATP bioluminescence value &lt;100 is determined as pass and &gt;200 is determined as fail. Within the study period, the value of pass increase from 13% to 53%, the value of fail decrease from 47% to 20%; numerical difference trend of the pass value increase from \u22127% to 20% and fail value decrease from 13% to \u221220%, showing the use of different color disposable wipes and the correct wiping method or wiping process can improve the environment cleanliness. The density of health-care associated infection one month before the intervention phase is 12.8\u2030 and one month after the intervention phase is 12.6\u2030. Conclusion: Using environment clean separation management measures is effective in cleanliness of MICU environment. However, there is no decline of the density of health-care associated infection.","Within the respiratory epithelium the innate immune system has a major protective role as the first line of defense against respiratory pathogens. In particular, the interferon (IFN) system orchestrates hundreds of different cellular effector proteins that (i) protect the epithelial barrier by altering the physiological and cellular environment, (ii) impair virus propagation, spread and transmission, and (iii) shape the host\u2019s adaptive immune response. Recent publications have demonstrated that the innate immune system is functional in the HAE cell culture system and that most pathogen recognition receptors are expressed and up-regulated upon treatment with exogenous stimuli [57, 81].","Results: A total of 30 cultures were obtained from January to November in year 2016. 8/30 (26.7%) cultures were positive; 7 (87.5%) were from endoscopes. The fishbone diagram showed that the root causes of the positive cultures may be job rotation and old equipment. The reprocessing procedure was altered, with improvement. However, 6 (60.0%) positive cultures were obtained from endoscopes processed with the EW-30. The fact was found that the joints of the water/air channel and the instrument/suction channel in the AER were damaged and could not allow the circulation of the fluid under pressure through the channels. There are different methods used for monitoring environment clean in hospital, include: direct observation, bacterial culture, and ATP (adenosine triphosphate bioluminescence assay). The purpose of terminal disinfection after patient discharged is to ensure environment clean of ward to keep next patient from infections caused by polluted environment. Thus, a regional teaching hospital apply ATP to evaluate efficacy of monitoring environment cleaning after terminal disinfection.","Conclusion: Some environmental surfaces in the monitoring showed unqualified cleanliness, which means clean work have not been thoroughly implemented. We provided sanitary unit these data for educational training and ask them to improve their practice to these high-RLU environmental surfaces, which help making environment clean better. Clean environment is associated with better healthcare quality. In general, regularly monitoring environment clean is necessary, either method is used.","Biological species, including viruses, change through generations and over time in the process known as evolution. These changes are first fixed in the genome of successful individuals that give rise to genetic lineages. Due to either limited fidelity of the replication apparatus copying the genome or physico-chemical activity of the environment, nucleotides may be changed, inserted, or deleted. Genomes of other origin may also be a source of innovation for a genome through the use of specially evolved mechanisms of genetic exchange (recombination). Accepted changes, known as mutations, may be neutral, advantageous, or deleterious, and depending on the population size and environment, the mutant lineage may proliferate or go extinct. Overall, advantageous mutations and large population size increase the chances for a lineage to succeed. The lineage fit is constantly reassessed in the ever-changing environment and lineages that, due to mutation, became a success in the past could be unfit in the new environment. Due to the growing number of mutations accumulating in the genomes, lineages diverge over time, although occasionally, due to stochastic reasons or under similar selection pressure, they may converge.","These environmental isolates also showed clustering with azole resistant clinical isolates. Conclusion: Azole-resistant AF is present in the environment. Since azole-resistant AF was cultured only from the environment that had been manipulated by humans, a link with exposure to azole fungicides seems plausible. Molecular analysis of the azole resistant environmental isolates may suggest that patients acquire azole resistant aspergillus disease by inhaling resistant conidia from their environment.","As aforementioned, the model predicting the mode of viral transmission was built before the 2012 MERS-CoV outbreak . This model was based on the analysis of mainly the PIDs found for N proteins, the viruses were clustered into three groups according to their transmission mode, while the M PIDs provide an indicator of resilience of the virus in the harsh environment. The three groups are represented in the Furthermore, a higher inner shell disorder is often associated with the greater infectivity, especially with regard to respiratory transmission potential since disorder allows greater promiscuity of binding 6,7 . Table 1 shows that SARS-CoV is grouped into category B along with other viruses that have intermediate respiratory and fecal-oral transmission potentials. MERS-CoV falls into category C (lower respiratory potential but higher fecal-oral transmission capabilities). These are consistent with what we know about transmission behaviour of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV 5-8, 35 . It should be noted that category A are viruses with N PID above 53%, whereas category C comprises of those with N PID below 47%. Since SARS-CoV-2 has an N PID of 48%, which is above 46% but below 54%, it must be considered as being in category B.","In this study, we showed that high temperature at high relative humidity has a synergistic effect on inactivation of SARS CoV viability while lower temperatures and low humidity support prolonged survival of virus on contaminated surfaces. The environmental conditions of countries such as Malaysia, Indonesia, and Thailand are thus not conducive to the prolonged survival of the virus. In countries such as Singapore and Hong Kong where there is a intensive use of air-conditioning, transmission largely occurred in well-air-conditioned environments such as hospitals or hotels. Further, a separate study has shown that during the epidemic, the risk of increased daily incidence of SARS was 18.18-fold higher in days with a lower air temperature than in days with a higher temperature in Hong Kong [24] and other regions [15\u201317]. Taken together, these observations may explain why some Asian countries in tropical area (with high temperature at high relative humidity) such as Malaysia, Indonesia, and Thailand did not have nosocomial outbreaks of SARS (Tables 1 and 2(a)\u20132(c)). It may also explain why Singapore, which is also in tropical area (Table 2(d)), had most of its SARS outbreaks in hospitals (air-conditioned environment). Interestingly, during the outbreak of SARS in Guangzhou, clinicians kept the windows of patient rooms open and well ventilated and these may well have reduced virus survival and this reduced nosocomial transmission. SARS CoV can retain its infectivity up to 2 weeks at low temperature and low humidity environment, which might facilitate the virus transmission in community as in Hong Kong which locates in subtropical area (Table 2(e)). Other environmental factors including wind velocity, daily sunlight, and air pressure, had shown to be associated with SARS epidemic, should also be considered [16, 17]. The dynamics of SARS epidemic involves multiple factors including physical property of virus, outdoor and indoor environments, hygiene, space, and genetic predispositions [10, 15\u201317, 24, 25]. Understanding the stability of viruses in different temperature and humidity conditions is important in understanding transmission of novel infectious agent including that of the recent influenza Apandemic H1N12009. ","The exact mechanism of transmission from camels to human remains uncertain. 10 Sustained close contact is most probably necessary for transmission by aerosolized droplets, as MERS-CoV viral RNA has been detected in air samples from a barn housing infected DCs in Qatar, and the virus may remain viable in aerosol for up to 45 minutes. 10, [27] [28] [29] The potential public health risk resulting from aerosol-generating activities ranges from contamination of a room occupied by a symptomatic patient to slaughter practices. 8, 24, 30 Aerosolized transmission of MERS-CoV has been attributed to hospital outbreaks in KSA and South Korea. 26, 27, 29 MERS-CoV spreads inefficiently from human to human, but transmission is effective in a hospital environment, where susceptible individuals are concentrated and the risks are amplified by poor infection prevention and control (IPC) protocols. 8 In some reported cases of MERS, direct contact with camels was not apparent. 27, 29 Camel-to-human transmission through other routes is, however, possible owing to the consumption of unpasteurized camel milk or raw camel meat and in traditional medicine, when camel urine is consumed as a natural remedy for a variety of ailments. 3, 10 A recent survey has found that infected camels may shed MERS-CoV virus in milk and urine, and the virus has been shown to remain infectious for 3 days in milk stored at 4\u00b0C. 3, 10 The transmission risks associated with the handling of camel products, raw milk, urine, and meat during animal slaughter are yet to be fully elucidated. Further studies are needed to demonstrate the potential of camel-to-human transmission. 8","GMOs may be accidentally released into the environment during contained use in normal operating conditions, e.g. in waste or as air-borne emissions, or in abnormal operating conditions, where release into the environment results from the process getting out of control. In some cases such releases will pose risks to man or the environment. Therefore the assessment should identify these hazards, working practices and containment measures to minimize the risk of accidental release should be adopted and emergency plans to limit the consequences of accidents drawn up.","SARS-CoV-2, like other emerging high-threat pathogens, has infected health-care workers in China 4,5 and several other countries. To date, however, in China, where infection prevention and control was taken seriously, nosocomial transmission has not been a major amplifier of transmission in this epidemic. Epidemiological records in China suggest that up to 85% of human-to-human transmission has occurred in family clusters 4 and that 2055 health-care workers have become infected, with an absence of major nosocomial outbreaks and some supporting evidence that some health-care workers acquired infection in their families. 4, 5 These findings suggest that close and unprotected exposure is required for transmission by direct contact or by contact with fomites in the immediate environment of those with infection. Continuing reports from outside China suggest the same means of transmission to close contacts and persons who attended the same social events or were in circumscribed areas such as office spaces or cruise ships. 6, 7 Intensified case finding and contact tracing are considered crucial by most countries and are being undertaken to attempt to locate cases and to stop onward transmission. Confirmation of infection at present consists of PCR for acute infection, and although many serological tests to identify antibodies are being developed they require validation with well characterised sera before they are reliable for general use.","Human-to-human transmission of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV occurs mainly through nosocomial transmission; 43.5\u2013100% of MERS cases in individual outbreaks were linked to hospitals, and very similar observations were made for some of the SARS clusters35,36. Transmission between family members occurred in only 13\u201321% of MERS cases and 22\u201339% of SARS cases. Transmission of MERS-CoV between patients was the most common route of infection (62\u201379% of cases), whereas for SARS-CoV, infection of health care workers by infected patients was very frequent (33\u201342%)35. The predominance of nosocomial transmission is probably due to the fact that substantial virus shedding occurs only after the onset of symptoms37,38, when most patients are already seeking medical care39. An analysis of hospital surfaces after the treatment of patients with MERS showed the ubiquitous presence of viral RNA in the environment for several days after patients no longer tested positive40. Moreover, many patients with SARS or MERS were infected through super spreaders14,35,37,41,42,43.","Prevention of giardiasis involves boiling or filtering of water collected from the environment prior to drinking and disinfection of premises contaminated with infected feces with steam cleaning or quaternary ammonium compounds (1 minute contact time). Paratenic hosts should be controlled and treatment and bathing of all animals in the environment should be considered. Feces from infected animals should be removed from the environment promptly. The previously licensed Giardia spp. vaccines for dogs and cats were classified by American Animal Hospital Association (AAHA) and AAFP as generally not recommended as preventatives. Both products have been discontinued by their manufacturers.","The effectiveness of environmental cleansing to improve infection control of upper respiratory infection in a psychiatric center Yu-Ping Liu 1 , Shiun-Yin Jeng 1 , Huei-Lan Lu 1 , Tso-Jen Wang 1 , Chung-Shin Liao 2 . 1 Jianan Psychiatric Center, 2 Chang Hua hospital Background: Environmental cleansing was a key point in the prevention of medical care, psychiatric patients generally had poor personal hygiene and habits, therefore while infectious disease occurred, indirect easy to make the environment contaminated by bacteria, when cleaning staff cannot effectively clean the disinfection environment, and contact with the patient with a infectious disease, would increase the medical care-related infections, in order to put an end to the breeding of infectious diseases, environmental cleansing to improve intervention is very important. Methods: Retrospective monitoring data found that the average upper respiratory tract infection rates were 2.5\u2030, 1.9\u2030 and 2.8\u2030 in a psychiatric center in 2013-2015. A investigating of the cleaners' cleanliness status in acute and rehabilitation ward in 2016, the result showed that the cleaner was not familiar with the process of cleaning, the bleach concentration is not correct, the cleaning equipment is not used separately. Environment cleaning intervention was provided for improving, the content included: (1) Education and training: through the video, to strengthen the priority of the clean process, from clean area to the contaminated area, the correct bleach concentration of the way and reply to the effectiveness of teaching acceptance. (2) The provisions of unified cleaning appliances: measuring cups, bucket clearly marked. (3) Clean appliances management: planning area and mop to the red tape clearly identified to use the division of cloth wiping. (4) Conducting internal and external audits: audit by the ward staffs and infection control division to understand the cleanliness and implementation of the cleaners' environment. Results: After the improvement of environmental cleanliness, the incidence of upper respiratory tract infection from 2.8\u2030 down to 2.24\u2030, cleaning staff also expressed that through the in-service education, unified cleaning appliances and management, can more clearly implement the environmental clean disinfection of the operating process. Conclusion: Environmental improvement can effectively reduce the upper respiratory infection, the in-service education will be included in the cleaning staff in future, to develop cleaners on the environment clean operation process familiarity, and continue to audit the implementation of the situation in order to maintain the best hospital environment clean quality.","Transmission of Middle East respiratory syndrome-coronavirus (MERS-CoV) among health care workers (HCWs) and patients in hospitals within Saudi Arabia has been documented. 1 Of the HCWs who have acquired this infection, more than 63% acquired the infection within Saudi Arabia, where the majority of MERS-CoV cases have been reported. 2 As of June 20, 2015, 1,338 cases have occurred worldwide, and of these 77.5% (n = 1,038) were identified within Saudi Arabia. 3, 4 The main contributing factor for health care-associated transmission and causality of outbreaks among Saudi hospitals is due to emergency department (ED) overcrowding and poor ventilation. 5 In turn, this can be a reflection of institutional overcrowding, inpatient bed occupancy reaching or exceeding full capacity, and/or a lack of compliance to and understanding of the importance of implementing infection control and prevention (ICP) measures. This belief is supported by internationally recognized agencies, including the World Health Organization (WHO) and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The organizations support the practice of adhering to ICP measures. Basic infection control measures (B-IC), defined as standard and transmissionbased precautions, play a major role in preventing and controlling pathogen spread, including adherence to hand hygiene, environment and equipment cleanliness, use of personal protective equipment (PPE) such as high-efficiency particulate respirators (eg, N-95 or R-95), and adhering to respiratory/cough etiquette. 6 We propose that the spread of MERS-CoV among HCWs is preventable when B-IC are used in combination with institution-specific advanced infection control measures (A-IC). In this article, A-IC implemented in a tertiary care hospital during a time of epidemic is described.","The degree to which genetics and the environment play a role in the pathogenesis of osteonecrosis is the subject of an ongoing investigation. Certainly, single nucleotide polymorphisms have been noted in a number of genes that may be associated with osteonecrosis. It has been argued that eNOS is an important player in the development of osteonecrosis. Nitric oxide may have beneficial effects on three systems involved in osteonecrosis-namely skeletal, vascular, and thrombotic. Each of these systems may be targets for proposed mechanisms of pathogenesis of osteonecrosis. A comparative analysis of the 26-base pair repeat polymorphism in intron 4 and the Glu298Asp polymorphism in exon 7 of the eNOS gene in patients with idiopathic, steroid-induced, and alcohol-induced osteonecrosis and normal control subjects was performed. 141 The frequency of the homozygous 4a allele was found to be higher in patients with idiopathic osteonecrosis compared with control subjects. The frequency of the 4a/b allele was found to be higher in all types of osteonecrosis when compared with control subjects. The 4a allele is known to be associated with reduced synthesis of eNOS, suggesting that nitric oxide may play a protective role with regard to the development of osteonecrosis.","Although no specific tests have been performed to determine the stability of CRCoV in the environment, other coronaviruses have been reported to remain infectious in respiratory secretions for more than 7 days [31] . Thorough cleaning and disinfection of kennels after outbreaks of respiratory disease are therefore required. Coronaviruses are inactivated by disinfectants commonly used for surface disinfection in kennels and veterinary practices. The role of fecal shedding and the potential transmission of CRCoV among dogs sharing common facilities, such as outdoor runs, have yet to be resolved. Other generally recommended measures, such as washing one's hands after handling animals with respiratory disease should also help to reduce the spread of the virus. CRCoV has been detected in dogs up to 4 weeks after entry into a kennel. Because the time of infection in those naturally occurring cases is not known, it is unclear how long CRCoV is being shed. After experimental infection of dogs with BCoV, the virus was detected in a rectal swab after 11 days [29] . Quarantine of newly arriving dogs, if feasible in training kennels or shelters, should therefore last for at least 2 weeks.","IBV is highly infectious and only a few virus particles may initiate an infection. After a short incubation period of 1-3 days, bird-to-bird transmission occurs rapidly and signs are seen in most birds in a susceptible fl ock. Virus is shed via both the respiratory tract and the faeces and a high standard of biosecurity is essential to minimize both entry of infection to a fl ock and spread between fl ocks. Th e virus may be shed for several weeks after clinical recovery and can persist in the intestinal tract for several months. Th e virus is rapidly killed by common disinfectants but its survival in the environment has not been adequately studied. Direct airborne transmission of virus from the respiratory tract to susceptible birds is probably the most common method of spread, particularly when respiratory signs are present. However, transmission through infected faeces is also important and spread by fomites certainly occurs. Th e greatest source of infection is birds in which virus is rapidly replicating. While true egg transmission is not believed to be signifi cant, surface contamination of eggs is likely to occur. Because the virus may persist in the bird for many weeks, carrier birds may exist. Th ere is no evidence for the involvement of vectors in IBV transmission.","The facultative intracellular pathogen Brucella is the causative agent of brucellosis, a worldwide zoonosis that affects mammals, including humans. Essential to Brucella virulence is its ability to survive and replicate inside host macrophages. Understanding the molecular interactions between Brucella and its replication niche may lead to new tools useful for vaccine design. We have shown in a model of Brucella abortus infection of murine bone marrow derived macrophages that a fraction of the bacteria that survive an initial host cell killing proceed to replicate in a compartment segregated from the endocytic pathway. The maturation of the Brucella-containing vacuole involves sustained interactions and fusion with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), which creates a replicative compartment with ER-like properties. The acquisition of ER membranes by replicating Brucella is independent of ER-Golgi COPI vesicular transport, but depend-ent of the COPII molecular system. A mutant of the VirB type IV secretion system, which is necessary for intracellular survival, was unable to sustain interactions and fuse with the ER, and was killed via eventual fusion with lysosomes. Thus, we demonstrate that live intracellular Brucella evade macrophage killing through VirB-dependent sustained interactions with the ER. This leads to hypothesis that Brucella effector molecules secreted by the type IV secretion system may be target for future vaccine. Osmoregulated periplasmic glucans (OPGs) are general constituents of the envelopes of gram-negative bacteria with glucose as the sole constitutive. These molecules play a critical biological role as shown by the fact that mutants unable to synthesize them are avirulent in their plant or animal hosts. OPG in Brucella genus is constituted by a cyclic b-1,2-glucan (CG) glucose backbone. Results suggest an important role of CbG in Brucella virulence as addition of this periplasmic sugar to liposomes extracted cholesterol, caused haemolysis in erythrocytes and perturbed lipid rafts in peritoneal macrophages. In addition, mutants defective in periplasmic glucan production partially recovered intracellular replication when CbG was added to bacterial culture media prior to macrophages infection. These data suggest that CbG plays an important role in Brucella virulence at the onset of infection and that drugs able to modulate the vacuolar environment may lead to circumvent Brucella infection.","cats, and is probably equally common in goats. In dogs, the pathogenesis is complex, while in cats and goats, the ear mite is by far the major initiating factor. Otitis externa in dogs is most prevalent in breeds with pendulous ears or with abundant hair within the ear canal, which implies that inadequate circulation of air and entrapment of moisture are important predispositions to the disease. Foreign bodies, usually foxtail or grass awns, may be important mechanical irritants, creating a breach for microbial infection, but since otitis is common in city dogs, other factors apparently are involved. The role of microorganisms in the pathogenesis of otitis externa is, as elsewhere, intimately linked to environmental circumstances that permit their uncontrolled proliferation. The bacteria and fungi cultured from diseased ears almost invariably are members of the normal aural flora. Staphylococcus spp., Pseudomonas spp., Proteus spp., and the yeast Malassezia pachydermatis (syn. Pityrosporum canis) are cultured much more frequently or in greater numbers from ears with otitis than from normal ears, but this may relate as much to their resistance to antibiotic treatment as to their causative role. The lipid-rich environment of the ear canal favors the lipophilic Malassezia, which is the best candidate for a primary pathogen in the causation of canine otitis externa, inasmuch as it frequently is the only pathogen isolated, and affected ears improve dramatically with antifungal therapy."],"title":["Environmental Engineers and Scientists Have Important Roles to Play in Stemming Outbreaks and
