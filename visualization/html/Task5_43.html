Title/abstract and full-text screening, data abstraction, and quality appraisal (AGREE-II) were carried out by single reviewers. Results: A total of 17 relevant CPGs were identified, published in the USA (n=8), Canada (n=6), Australia (n=2), and the United Kingdom (n=1). All of the CPGs dealt with infection control in long-term care facilities (LTCF) and addressed various types of viral respiratory infections (e.g., influenza, COVID-19, severe acute respiratory syndrome). Ten or more CPGs recommended the following infection control measures in LTCF: hand hygiene (n=13), wearing personal protective equipment...","Abstract Epidemic outbreaks are a special case of supply chain (SC) risks which is distinctively characterized by a long-term disruption existence, disruption propagations (i.e., the ripple effect), and high uncertainty. We present the results of a simulation study that opens some new research tensions on the impact of COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) on the global SCs. First, we articulate the specific features that frame epidemic outbreaks as a unique type of SC disruption risks. Second, we demonstrate how simulation-based methodology can be used to examine and predict the impacts of epidemic outbreaks on the SC performance using the example of coronavirus COVID-19 and anyLogistix simulation and optimization software. We offer an analysis for observing and predicting both short-term and long-term impacts of epidemic outbreaks on the SCs along with managerial insights. A set of sensitivity experiments for different scenarios allows illustrating the model\u2019s behavior and its value for decision-mak...","Summary The spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has already taken on pandemic proportions, affecting over 100 countries in a matter of weeks. A global response to prepare health systems worldwide is imperative. Although containment measures in China have reduced new cases by more than 90%, this reduction is not the case elsewhere, and Italy has been particularly affected. There is now grave concern regarding the Italian national health system's capacity to effectively respond to the needs of patients who are infected and require intensive care for SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia. The percentage of patients in intensive care reported daily in Italy between March 1 and March 11, 2020, has consistently been between 9% and 11% of patients who are actively infected. The number of patients infected since Feb 21 in Italy closely follows an exponential trend. If this trend continues for 1 more week, there will be 30 000 infected patients. Intensive care units will then ...","","The number of confirmed COVID-19 cases admitted in hospitals is continuously increasing in the Philippines. Frontline health care workers are faced with imminent risks of getting infected. In this study, we formulate a theoretical model to calculate the risk of being infected in health care facilities considering the following factors: the average number of encounters with a suspected COVID-19 patient per hour; interaction time for each encounter; work shift duration or exposure time; crowd density, which may depend on the amount of space available in a given location; and availability and effectiveness of protective gears and facilities provided for the frontline health care workers. Based on the simulation results, we recommend the following: (i) decrease the rate of patient encounter per frontline health care worker, e.g., maximum of three encounters per hour in a 12-hour work shift duration; (ii) decrease the interaction time between the frontline health care worker and the patient...","Abstract Background The novel coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19), which was first detected in Wuhan City, has now became a pandemic that affecting patients around the world. Particularly, the community patient population are at high risk of infection and are facing potential failure of proper medication use during the pandemic. Objective To discuss community pharmacists\u2019 role and the content of pharmaceutical care (PC) during the novel coronavirus pandemic to promote effective prevention and control and safe drug use of the community patient population. Method Collect and summarize the experience Chinese community pharmacies gained from providing pharmacy services during the COVID-19 outbreak, and taking the PC needs into consideration, analyze and discuss the methods and strategies that community pharmacies and pharmacists shall use to provide PC during the pandemic. Results Community pharmacy management teams shall support PC services by providing adequate supply of COVID-19 related me...","Abstract The severe 2019 outbreak of novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), which was first reported in Wuhan, would be expected to impact the mental health of local medical and nursing staff and thus lead them to seek help. However, those outcomes have yet to be established using epidemiological data. To explore the mental health status of medical and nursing staff and the efficacy, or lack thereof, of critically connecting psychological needs to receiving psychological care, we conducted a quantitative study. This is the first paper on the mental health of medical and nursing staff in Wuhan. Notably, among 994 medical and nursing staff working in Wuhan, 36.9% had subthreshold mental health disturbances (mean PHQ-9: 2.4), 34.4% had mild disturbances (mean PHQ-9: 5.4), 22.4% had moderate disturbances (mean PHQ-9: 9.0), and 6.2% had severe disturbance (mean PHQ-9: 15.1) in the immediate wake of the viral epidemic. The noted burden fell particularly heavily on young women. Of all particip...","COVID-19 is now a pandemic and many of the affected countries face severe shortages of hospital resources. In Brazil, the first case was reported on February 26. As the number of cases grows in the country, there is a concern that the health system may become overwhelmed, resulting in shortages of hospital beds, intensive care unit beds, and mechanical ventilators. The timing of shortage is likely to vary geographically depending on the observed onset and pace of transmission observed, on the availability of resources, and on the actions implemented. Here we consider the daily number of cases reported in municipalities in Brazil to simulate twelve alternative scenarios of the likely timing of shortage, based on parameters consistently reported for China and Italy, on rates of hospital occupancy for other health conditions observed in Brazil in 2019, and on assumptions of allocation of patients in public and private facilities. Results show that hospital services could start to experien...","Hospital-acquired infections (HAIs) are serious problems for healthcare systems, especially in developing countries where public health infrastructure and technology for infection preventions remain undeveloped. Here, we characterized how strategy and technology could be mobilized to improve the effectiveness of infection prevention and control in hospitals during the outbreaks of Ebola, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in Asia and West Africa. Published literature on the hospital-borne outbreaks of SARS, Ebola, and MERS in Asia and West Africa was comprehensively reviewed. The results showed that healthcare systems and hospital management in affected healthcare facilities had poor strategies and inadequate technologies and human resources for the prevention and control of HAIs, which led to increased morbidity, mortality, and unnecessary costs. We recommend that governments worldwide enforce disaster risk management, even when no ou...","Abstract Introduction An epidemic of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) began in December 2019 in China leading to a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). Clinical, laboratory, and imaging features have been partially characterized in some observational studies. No systematic reviews on COVID-19 have been published to date. Methods We performed a systematic literature review with meta-analysis, using three databases to assess clinical, laboratory, imaging features, and outcomes of COVID-19 confirmed cases. Observational studies and also case reports, were included, and analyzed separately. We performed a random-effects model meta-analysis to calculate pooled prevalences and 95% confidence intervals (95%CI). Results 660 articles were retrieved for the time frame (1/1/2020-2/23/2020). After screening, 27 articles were selected for full-text assessment, 19 being finally included for qualitative and quantitative analyses.

In spite of our efforts on practicing Failure Mode Effect Analysis for MERS-CoV infection management we ended up having an outbreak with MERS-CoV. Based on our experience, we actively implemented policies, procedures &amp; practices on early identification &amp; appropriate isolation practices along with supplemental infection prevention &amp; control measures for preventing future outbreaks at our healthcare facility. Methods Retrospectively we analyzed our failure in preventing the outbreak of MERS-CoV infection among our hospitalized patients by identifying the outbreak &amp; actively intervening as a team to control the outbreak with the support of Hospital Higher management, Administr...","Background We aimed to investigate the frequency of standard precautions (SPs) compliance and the factors affecting the compliance among nursing students (NSs). Methods A cross-sectional survey study guided by the health belief model was conducted in 2009. The study questionnaire is valid (content validity index, 0.81) and reliable (Cronbach \u03b1 range, 0.65-0.94). Results There were 678 questionnaires analyzed, with a response rate of 68.9%. The mean frequency score of SPs compliance was 4.38 \u00b1 0.40 out of 5. Tukey honest significant difference post hoc test indicated that year 2 and year 4 students had better SPs compliance than year 3 students. Further analysis using a univariate general linear model identified an interaction effect of perceived influence of nursing staff and year of study (F1,593 = 3.72; P &lt; .05). The 5 following predictors for SPs compliance were identified: knowledge of SPs, perceived barriers, adequacy of training, management support, and influence of nursing staff...","Background Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is a novel coronavirus that causes a severe respiratory disease with high case fatality rate. Starting in March 2014, a dramatic increase of cases has occurred in the Arabian Peninsula, many of which were acquired in health care settings. As of May 9, 2014, 536 laboratory-confirmed cases and 145 deaths have been reported globally. Methods Review of publicly available data about MERS-CoV health care\u2013associated transmission. Results We identified 11 events of possible or confirmed health care\u2013associated transmission with high morbidity and mortality, mainly among patients with comorbidities. Health care workers are also frequently affected; however, they tend to have milder symptoms and better prognosis. Gaps in infection control were noted in all events. Currently, health care\u2013associated outbreaks are playing a pivotal role in the evolution of the MERS-CoV epidemic in countries in the Arabian Peninsula. Conclusion There ...","Abstract The world is currently suffering through a pandemic outbreak of severe respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) known as Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). The United States (US) Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) currently advises medical facilities to \u201creschedule non-urgent outpatient visits as necessary\u201d (1). The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, the United Kingdom National Health Service and several other international agencies covering Asia, North America and most regions of the world have recommended similar \u201csocial distancing\u201d measures(2, 3). The Society of Cardiovascular Computed Tomography (SCCT) offers guidance for cardiac CT (CCT) practitioners to help implement these international recommendations in order to decrease the risk of COVID-19 transmission in their facilities while deciding on the timing of outpatient and inpatient CCT exams. This document also emphasizes SCCT\u2019s commitment to the health and well-being of CCT techn...","BACKGROUND: The Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus is a serious and emerging issue in Saudi Arabia and the world. A response was required to reduce possible disease transmission between the hospital and university. College of Nursing academic staff developed a programme in response to the educational and emotional needs of participants. METHODS: A MERS-CoV Task Force responded to the rapidly unfolding epidemic. The aim was to find out what nursing staff and nursing students in the college knew about MERS- CoV. While most gaps in knowledge were addressed after an intense information seminar, other learning needs were identified and responded to. The Task Force developed mandatory information sessions for all nursing faculty, students and staff. All staff were informed by email, letters and posters. There are 28 faculty staff, 84 support staff and 480 students in the College of Nursing. The information settings all took place within the College of Nursing, Princess Nourah Un...","Background Despite available recommendations on infection control for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), information is limited on actual practices in Asian hospitals during the epidemic. We describe practices observed by mobile SARS containment teams (mobile teams) during outbreak investigations. Methods We retrospectively summarized infection control practices observed in hospitals visited by mobile teams in the Lao People's Democratic Republic (PDR), Taiwan, and Thailand, during March and April 2003. Results Mobile teams investigated 22 reports of SARS in 20 hospitals (1, 5, and 14 hospitals in Lao PDR, Taiwan, and Thailand, respectively). Facilities ranged from urban hospitals with negative-pressure isolation rooms and high-efficiency particulate air filtration to rural hospitals with patient rooms open to outside air circulation and intermittent running water. At the time of mobile team visits, 5 (25%) hospitals implemented infection control practices consistent with World ...","ABSTRACT THE CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL and Prevention has published updated guidelines for isolation precautions that outline how health care workers can prevent the transmission of infectious agents to their patients and to themselves. THE GUIDELINES RE-EMPHASIZE standard precautions, which guide clinicians in the use of appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE), depending on the expected type of exposure. Respiratory hygiene/cough etiquette is incorporated into infection control practices as a new component of standard precautions. THE ARTICLE PROVIDES information on the new guidelines as well as information on newly emerging patho gens and methods to prevent disease transmission in health care settings.","INTRODUCTION: There is little research on emergency care delivery in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). To facilitate future research, we aimed to assess the set of key metrics currently used by researchers in these settings and to propose a set of standard metrics to facilitate future research. METHODS: Systematic literature review of 43,109 published reports on general emergency care from 139 LMICs. Studies describing care for subsets of emergency conditions, subsets of populations, and data aggregated across multiple facilities were excluded. All facility- and patient-level statistics reported in these studies were recorded and the most commonly used metrics were identified. RESULTS: We identified 195 studies on emergency care delivery in LMICs. There was little uniformity in either patient- or facility-level metrics reported. Patient demographics were inconsistently reported: only 33% noted average age and 63% the gender breakdown. The upper age boundary used for paediatric ...","In the wake of COVID-19 disease, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, we designed and developed a predictive model based on Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning algorithms to determine the health risk and predict the mortality risk of patients with COVID-19. In this study, we used documented data of 117,000 patients world-wide with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19. This study proposes an AI model to help hospitals and medical facilities decide who needs to get attention first, who has higher priority to be hospitalized, triage patients when the system is overwhelmed by overcrowding, and eliminate delays in providing the necessary care. The results demonstrate 93% overall accuracy in predicting the mortality rate. We used several machine learning algorithms including Support Vector Machine (SVM), Artificial Neural Networks, Random Forest, Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, and K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) to predict the mortality rate in patients with COVID-19. In this study, the most...","Abstract Objective This document summarizes the limited experience of SARS in pregnancy and suggests guidelines for management.

MERS-CoV infection had previously caused multiple health-care-associated outbreaks and resulted in transmission of the virus within families. Community onset MERS-CoV cases continue to occur. Dromedary camels are currently the most likely animal to be linked to human MERS-CoV cases. Serologic tests showed significant infection in adult camels compared to juvenile camels. The control of MERS-CoV infection relies on prompt identification of cases within health care facilities, with institutions applying appropriate infection control measures. In addition, determining the exact route of transmission from camels to humans would further add to the control measures of MERS-CoV infection.","COVID-19 threatens to overwhelm hospital facilities throughout the United States. We created an interactive, quantitative model that forecasts demand for COVID-19 related hospitalization based on county-level population characteristics, data from the literature on COVID-19, and data from online repositories. Using this information as well as user inputs, the model estimates a time series of demand for intensive care beds and acute care beds as well as the availability of those beds. The online model is designed to be intuitive and interactive so that local leaders with limited technical or epidemiological expertise may make decisions based on a variety of scenarios. This complements high-level models designed for public consumption and technically sophisticated models designed for use by epidemiologists. The model is actively being used by several academic medical centers and policy makers, and we believe that broader access will continue to aid community and hospital leaders in their ...","[Abstract]Objective Coronavirus disease 2019 has become pandemic in the world. The need for IgG/IgM combined antibody test is booming, but data on diagnostic indexes evaluation was inadequate. The aim of this study was to evaluate diagnostic indexes of a rapid IgG/IgM combined antibody test for SARS-CoV-2. Methods A total of 179 patients were enrolled. Serum were collected for IgG-IgM combined antibody test and corresponding nasal and pharyngeal swab specimens were collected for SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR. According to SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR results, patients under study were categorized as PCR positive group in 90 patients and PCR negative group in 89 patients. Results 1. Of the 90 PCR positive samples, 77 were tested positive by SARS-CoV-2 IgG-IgM test kit, yielding a sensitivity of 85.6%. Meanwhile, of the 89 PCR negative sample, 8 samples were detected positive, resulting in a specificity of 91%. Positive predictive value, negative predictive value and accuracy of this test kit was 95.1%, 82.7%,...","Abstract Objective Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) was the first massive infectious disease outbreak of the 21st century. However, it is unlikely that this outbreak will be the last. This study aimed to evaluate the long-term psychiatric morbidities in survivors of SARS. Method This is a cohort study designed to investigate psychiatric complications among SARS survivors treated in the United Christian Hospital 30 months after the SARS outbreak. Psychiatric morbidities were assessed by the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV, the Impact of Events Scale\u2013Revised and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. Functional outcomes were assessed by the Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey. Results Ninety subjects were recruited, yielding a response rate of 96.8%. Post-SARS cumulative incidence of DSM-IV psychiatric disorders was 58.9%. Current prevalence for any psychiatric disorder at 30 months post-SARS was 33.3%. One-fourth of the patients had post-traumati...","Severe acute respiratory syndrome Covid-19 (SARS-CoV-2) has been declared a worldwide emergency and a pandemic disease by the World Health Organisation (WHO). It started in China in December 2019, and it is currently rapidly spreading throughout Italy, which is now the most affected country after China. There is great attention for the diffusion and evolution of the CoVid-19 infection which started from the north (particularly in the Lombardia region) and it is now rapidly affecting other Italian regions. We investigate on the impact of patients hospitalisation in Intensive Care Units (ICUs) at a regional and subregional granularity. We propose a model derived from well-known models in epidemic to estimate the needed number of places in intensive care units. The model will help decision-makers to plan resources in the short and medium-term in order to guarantee appropriate treatments to all patients needing it. We analyse Italian data at regional level up to March 15th aiming to: (i) s...","Abstract Introduction Breast radiotherapy accounts for a significant proportion of patient volume in contemporary radiation oncology practice. In the setting of anticipated resource constraints and widespread community infection with SARS-CoV-2 during the COVID-19 pandemic, measures for balancing both infectious and oncologic risk among patients and providers must be carefully considered. Here, we present evidence-based guidelines for omitting or abbreviating breast cancer radiotherapy, where appropriate, in an effort to mitigate risk to patients and optimize resource utilization. Methods Multidisciplinary breast cancer experts at a high-volume comprehensive cancer center convened contingency planning meetings over the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic to review the relevant literature and establish recommendations for the application of hypofractionated and abbreviated breast radiation regimens. Results Substantial evidence exists to support omitting radiation among certain favorabl...","AbstractEpidemics of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) now have more than 100,000 confirmed cases worldwide. Diagnosis of COVID-19 is currently performed by RT-qPCR methods, but the capacity of RT-qPCR methods is limited by its requirement of high-level facilities and instruments. Here, we developed and evaluated RT-LAMP assays to detect genomic RNA of SARS-CoV-2, the causative virus of COVID-19. RT-LAMP assays in this study can detect as low as 100 copies of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Cross-reactivity of RT-LAMP assays to other human Coronaviruses was not observed. We also adapted a colorimetric detection method for our RT-LAMP assay so that the tests potentially performed in higher throughput.","Summary Emerging infectious diseases arising from livestock and wildlife pose serious threats to global human health, as shown by a series of continuous outbreaks involving highly pathogenic influenza, SARS, Ebola and MERS. The risk of pandemics and bioterrorism threats is ever present and growing, but our ability to combat them is limited by the lack of available vaccines, therapeutics and rapid diagnostics. The use of high bio-containment facilities, such as the CSIRO Australian Animal Health Laboratory, plays a key role studying these dangerous pathogens and facilitates the development of countermeasures. To combat diseases like MERS, we must take a holistic approach that involves the development of early biomarkers of infection, a suite of treatment options (vaccines, anti-viral drugs and antibody therapeutics) and appropriate animal models to test the safety and efficacy of candidate treatments.","The largest outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) struck Beijing in spring 2003. Multiple importations of SARS to Beijing initiated transmission in several healthcare facilities. Beijing\u2019s outbreak began March 5; by late April, daily hospital admissions for SARS exceeded 100 for several days; 2,521 cases of probable SARS occurred. Attack rates were highest in those 20\u201339 years of age; 1% of cases occurred in children &lt;10 years. The case-fatality rate was highest among patients &gt;65 years (27.7% vs. 4.8% for those 20\u201364 years, p &lt; 0.001). Healthcare workers accounted for 16% of probable cases. The proportion of case-patients without known contact to a SARS patient increased significantly in May. Implementation of early detection, isolation, contact tracing, quarantine, triage of case-patients to designated SARS hospitals, and community mobilization ended the outbreak.","Lack of evidence on SARS-CoV-2 transmission dynamics has led to shifting isolation guidelines between airborne and droplet isolation precautions. During the initial isolation of 13 individuals confirmed positive with COVID-19 infection, air and surface samples were collected in eleven isolation rooms to examine viral shedding from isolated individuals. While all individuals were confirmed positive for SARS-CoV-2, symptoms and viral shedding to the environment varied considerably. Many commonly used items, toilet facilities, and air samples had evidence of viral contamination, indicating that SARS-CoV-2 is shed to the environment as expired particles, during toileting, and through contact with fomites. Disease spread through both direct (droplet and person-to-person) as well as indirect contact (contaminated objects and airborne transmission) are indicated, supporting the use of airborne isolation precautions.","Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infections sharply increased in the Arabian Peninsula during spring 2014. In Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, these infections occurred primarily among healthcare workers and patients. To identify and describe epidemiologic and clinical characteristics of persons with healthcare-associated infection, we reviewed laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV cases reported to the Health Authority of Abu Dhabi during January 1, 2013\u2013May 9, 2014. Of 65 case-patients identified with MERS-CoV infection, 27 (42%) had healthcare-associated cases. Epidemiologic and genetic sequencing findings suggest that 3 healthcare clusters of MERS-CoV infection occurred, including 1 that resulted in 20 infected persons in 1 hospital. MERS-CoV in healthcare settings spread predominantly before MERS-CoV infection was diagnosed, underscoring the importance of increasing awareness and infection control measures at first points of entry to healthcare facilities.","The number of people infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus causing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), is dramatically increasing worldwide.The first person-to-person transmission in Italy was reported on Feb 21, 2020, and led to an infection chain that represents the largest COVID-19 outbreak outside Asia to date. Here we document the response of the Emergency Medical System (EMS) of the metropolitan area of Milan, Italy, to the COVID-19 outbreak.On Jan 30, 2020, WHO declared the COVID-19 outbreak a public health emergency of international concern.2 Since then, the Italian Government has implemented extraordinary measures to restrict viral spread, including interruptions of air traffic from China, organised repatriation flights and quarantines for Italian travellers in China, and strict controls at international airports' arrival terminals. Local medical authorities adopted specific WHO recommendations to identify and isolate suspected ...","Over the past several decades, we have witnessed the emergence of many new infectious agents, some of which are major public threats. New and emerging infectious diseases which are both transmissible from patient-to-patient and virulent with a high mortality include novel coronaviruses (SARS-CoV, MERS-CV), hemorrhagic fever viruses (Lassa, Ebola), and highly pathogenic avian influenza A viruses, A(H5N1) and A(H7N9). All healthcare facilities need to have policies and plans in place for early identification of patients with a highly communicable diseases which are highly virulent, ability to immediately isolate such patients, and provide proper management (e.g., training and availability of personal protective equipment) to prevent transmission to healthcare personnel, other patients and visitors to the healthcare facility.","BACKGROUND: Infection prevention and control measures are critical to prevent the possible spread of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome-coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in healthcare facilities. Therefore, healthcare workers should be aware of all procedures concerning prevention of and protection from MERS-CoV. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to improve the knowledge of the dental students and evaluate their awareness about MERS-CoV. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A questionnaire was made according to MOH information and 200 dental students (Al-Farabi Colleges, Jeddah) were interviewed to evaluate their knowledge about MERS-CoV. RESULTS: More than half of the dental students (54%) interviewed had good knowledge about the etiology, symptoms, and treatment of MERS-CoV. Measurements for infection control and protection were also known (79%). The sources of information for the students were: college (27%), MOH (25%), media (24%), and social community (23%), while 17% of the students interviewed had no id...","BACKGROUND: SARS is not only an acute disease, but also leads to long-term impaired lung diffusing capacity in some survivors. However, there is a paucity of data regarding long-term CT findings in survivors after SARS. The aim of this study was to assess the changes in lung function and lung thin-section computed tomography (CT) features in patients recovering from severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), especially the dynamic changes in ground-glass opacity (GGO). MATERIAL/METHODS: Clinical and radiological data from 11 patients with SARS were collected. The serial follow-up thin-section CTs were evaluated at 3, 6, and 84 months after SARS presentation. The distribution and predominant thin-section CT findings of lesions were evaluated. RESULTS: The extent of the lesions on the CT scans of the 11 patients decreased at 6 and 84 months compared to 3 months. The number of segments involved on 84-month follow-up CTs was less than those at 6 months (P&lt;0.05). The predominant thin-section...","Abstract This is a prospective observational study of a cohort of inpatients exposed to a severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak. Strict infection control policies were instituted. The 70 patients exposed to the SARS outbreak were isolated from the rest of the hospital. They were triaged, quarantined and cohorted in three open plan wards. Selective isolation was carried out immediately when symptoms and signs suspicious of SARS manifested clinically. The patients' ages ranged from 21 to 90 years and 56% had surgery before the quarantine. Sixteen patients with unexplained fever during the period of quarantine were isolated, seven of whom were eventually diagnosed with probable SARS. The crude incidence of SARS in our cohort was 10%. The SARS case fatality was 14%. No secondary transmission of the SARS virus within the cohort was observed. Strict infection control, together with appropriate triaging, cohorting and selective isolation, is an effective and practical model of int...","Summary Several new viral respiratory tract infectious diseases with epidemic potential that threaten global health security have emerged in the past 15 years. In 2003, WHO issued a worldwide alert for an unknown emerging illness, later named severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). The disease caused by a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV) rapidly spread worldwide, causing more than 8000 cases and 800 deaths in more than 30 countries with a substantial economic impact. Since then, we have witnessed the emergence of several other viral respiratory pathogens including influenza viruses (avian influenza H5N1, H7N9, and H10N8; variant influenza A H3N2 virus), human adenovirus-14, and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). In response, various surveillance systems have been developed to monitor the emergence of respiratory-tract infections. These include systems based on identification of syndromes, web-based systems, systems that gather health data from health facilities (suc...","Balkan endemic nephropathy (BEN), originally described in the late 1950s as a chronic tubulointerstitial kidney disease, is identified by its unique epidemiological features. The most remarkable characteristic of BEN is the focal topographical nature that characterizes its occurrence at the global, national, and even household level. BEN affects only certain endemic rural foci along tributaries of the Danube River in the Balkan countries of Bosnia, Bulgaria, Croatia, Romania, and Serbia. The spatial distribution has remained astonishingly unchanged with time because the disease affects the same endemic clusters as 50 years ago. The natural course of the disease is characterized by universal development of end-stage renal disease and the frequent development of upper urinary tract tumors, posing a substantial disease burden to the afflicted areas. The greatest challenge in the study of BEN has been the elucidation of its cause. The unique features of the disease, in particular its endem...","BACKGROUND: The Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is an emerging respiratory pathogen with a high mortality rate and no specific treatments available to date. The purpose of this study was to determine the feasibility of conducting a randomized controlled trial (RCT) of convalescent plasma therapy for MERS-CoV-infected patients by using MERS-CoV-specific convalescent plasma obtained from previously recovered patients. METHODS: A survey was adapted from validated questionnaire originally aimed to measure network capacities and capabilities within the International Severe Acute Respiratory and emerging Infection Consortium (ISARIC). The questionnaire was modified for this study to include 26 items that were divided into three main domains of interest: (1) the ability to care for critically ill MERS-CoV patients; (2) laboratory capacity to diagnose MERS-CoV and blood bank ability to prepare convalescent plasma; and (3), research capacity to conduct randomized control...","Summary Currently, the emergence of a novel human coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, has become a global health concern causing severe respiratory tract infections in humans. Human-to-human transmissions have been described with incubation times between 2-10 days, facilitating its spread via droplets, contaminated hands or surfaces. We therefore reviewed the literature on all available information about the persistence of human and veterinary coronaviruses on inanimate surfaces as well as inactivation strategies with biocidal agents used for chemical disinfection, e.g. in healthcare facilities. The analysis of 22 studies reveals that human coronaviruses such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) coronavirus, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) coronavirus or endemic human coronaviruses (HCoV) can persist on inanimate surfaces like metal, glass or plastic for up to 9 days, but can be efficiently inactivated by surface disinfection procedures with 62\u201371% ethanol, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide o...","ABSTRACT Within weeks, COVID-19 has transformed our practice of palliative care and clinical medicine as we know it. Telemedicine has emerged as a critical technology to bring medical care to patients while attempting to reduce the transmission of COVID-19 among patients, families, and clinicians. It is also increasingly necessary to preserve scarce resources like personal protective equipment. In this article, we share just-in-time tips to support palliative care clinicians and program leaders in providing the best care possible by telemedicine. These quick, practical tips cover telemedicine set-up, patient considerations, and clinician considerations. Next steps include ensuring equitable access to affordable telemedicine technology for vulnerable populations through creative solutions and financing, and dedicated attention to telemedicine evaluation and quality improvement.","In this work we construct a mathematical model for the transmission and spread of coronavirus disease 2019 or COVID-19. Our model features delay terms to account for (a) the time lapse or latency period between contracting the disease and displaying symptoms, and (b) the time lag in testing patients for the virus due to the limited numbers of testing facilities currently available. We find that the delay introduces a significant disparity between the actual and reported time-trajectories of cases in a particular region. Specifically, the reported case histories lag the actual histories by a few days. Hence, to minimize the spread of the disease, lockdowns and similarly drastic social isolation measures need to be imposed some time before the reported figures are approaching their peak values. We then account for the social reality that lockdowns can only be of a limited duration in view of practical considerations. We find that the most effective interval for imposing such a limited-ti...","Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is infecting people throughout the world. It is probable that coronavirus disease (COVID-19) will be transmitted to people experiencing homelessness, which will become a major problem in particular in North America where there are sizable populations of people experiencing homelessness in nearly every metropolitan city in the USA and Canada. In the USA, more than 500 000 people were reported to be experiencing homelessness on any given night over the past decade (2007\u201319).1 The State of Homelessness in Canada 2016 report2 estimated 35 000 people are experiencing homelessness on any given night in Canada. People experiencing homelessness live in environments that are conducive to a disease epidemic. Many people experiencing homelessness live in congregate living settings\u2014be it formal (ie, shelters or halfway houses) or informal (ie, encampments or abandoned buildings)\u2014and might not have regular access to basic hygiene supplies...","BACKGROUND: The ongoing worldwide outbreak of the 2019-nCoV is markedly similar to the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak 17 years ago. During the 2002-2003 SARS outbreak, healthcare workers formed a special population of patients. Although virus-specific IgG play important roles in virus neutralization and prevention against future infection, limited information is available regarding the long term persistence of IgG after infection with SARS-like coronavirus. METHODS: A long-term prospective cohort study followed 34 SARS-CoV-infected healthcare workers from a hospital with clustered infected cases during the 2002-2003 SARS outbreak in Guangzhou, China, with a 13-year follow-up. Serum samples were collected annually from 2003-2015. Twenty SARS-CoV-infected and 40 non-infected healthcare workers were enrolled in 2015, and their serum samples were collected. All sera were tested for IgG antibodies with ELISA using whole virus and a recombinant nucleocapsid protein of SARS...","Abstract Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is a recently emerged virus that has caused a number of human infections and deaths, primarily in the Middle East. The transmission of MERS-CoV to humans has been proposed to be as a result of contact with camels, but evidence of human-to-human transmission also exists. In order to work with MERS-CoV in a laboratory setting, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has determined that MERS-CoV should be handled at a biosafety level (BSL) 3 (BSL-3) biocontainment level. Many processes and procedures used to characterize MERS-CoV and to evaluate samples from MERS-CoV infected animals are more easily and efficiently completed at BSL-2 or lower containment. In order to complete experimental work at BSL-2, demonstration or proof of inactivation is required before removal of specimens from biocontainment laboratories. In the studies presented here, we evaluated typical means of inactivating viruses prior to handl...","Background: Affected by a Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak, Since December 2019, there have been more than 76,000 cases of COVID-19 in China, causing more than 3,000 medical staff infections. Due to COVID-19 spreads quickly, is highly contagious, and can be fatal in severe cases, and there are no specific medicines, it poses a huge threat to the life and health of nurses and has a large impact on their emotional responses and coping strategies. Methods: This study conducted an online questionnaire survey from February 1 to 9, 2020 to investigate the current state of emotional responses and coping strategies of nurses and college nursing students in Anhui Province. This study used a modified Brief COPE (Carver, 1997) and a emotional responses scale. Results: The results found that women showed more severe anxiety and fear than men. Participants from cities showed more anxiety and fear than participants from rural, but rural participants showed more sadness than urban partic...","Being aware and implementing the latest and best scientific evidence in infection control and health care epidemiology is critical to enhancing patient outcomes. In this review, the latest published scientific data in health care epidemiology and patient safety were reviewed for the period May 2003-May 2004. Medline reviews and reviews of infection control and infectious diseases journals were used for this period. The latest guidelines and publications on antimicrobial resistance, nursing or infection control professional staffing, West Nile virus, and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) are included. Awareness of these and other important infection control publications is essential if the latest measures are to be implemented to prevent and control health care-associated infections.","This study reviewed problems in the prevention of outbreak and spread of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and aimed to provide assistance in establishing policies to prevent and manage future outbreaks of novel infectious diseases of foreign origin via in-depth epidemiological investigation of the patient who initiated the MERS outbreak in Korea, 2015. Personal and phone interviews were conducted with the patient and his guardians, and his activities in Saudi Arabia were investigated with the help of the Saudi Arabian Ministry of Health.

All long-term care facilities must have a policy in place that identifies workers who become sick and allows them to be absent from work. Guidance proposed by AMDA includes screening employees at entry for signs of infection. Protocols must also be developed that ensure staffing levels if an employee needs to call off or be sent home. It is noteworthy that many long-term care workers live paycheck to paycheck in an environment without reserve staffing; they therefore may be conditioned to report even when sick. Providing a work environment that allows healthcare workers to call out without repercussion will be critically important. Within the facility, protecting workers involves maintaining an adequate supply of gowns, gloves, and face masks. This involves both keeping track and awareness of inventory and negotiating with suppliers and public health officials who might seek to redirect limited resources to other healthcare environments.","Long-Term Care/ or exp Nursing Homes/ or Homes for the Aged/ or Assisted Living Facilities/ 21 (\"long-term care\" or \"long term care\" or \"senior* home*\" or \"senior* residence*\" or \"nursing home*\" or \"old age home*\" or \"old age residence*\" or \"home* for the aged\").tw,kf.

Pneumonia has been reported to be the second most frequent infection in this setting, carries the highest mortality of any infection in this population, and is a common cause for hospitalization. 228, 229 Silent aspiration is a major risk factor, as are poor functional status, nasogastric feeding, confusion, the presence of obstructive lung disease, the presence of a tracheostomy, and advancing age. 230 Key modifiable risk factors are inadequate oral care and swallowing difficulties. 231 The subtle presentation noted especially those with chronic underlying disease and those who are bedridden and recently hospitalized. Pseudomonas infection should be suspected in patients with pulmonary comorbidities and recent hospital stays.","Our initial response to COVID-19, now that disputes over whether it is real and who is to blame for it are over, is to slow its spread to avoid overwhelming the ability of our health care system to handle sick patients. COVID-19 is proving to be more infectious than severe acute respiratory syndrome, leading to 10 times as many cases in one-quarter of the time. 1 A significant portion of cases in China were due to hospital-related transmission, 2 and skilled nursing facilities in Washington state have followed suit. Without proper containment measures, the fear is that hospitals will be overrun with COVID-19 cases. Not only does this limit our ability to treat seriously ill patients infected with the virus but it also could prevent uninfected individuals suffering from more mundane life-threatening conditions, such as myocardial infarction and stroke, from receiving timely treatment that they would routinely get in \"normal\" times.","Over the past 2 decades, assisted living has rapidly emerged as a preferred housing and long-term care option for many older and disabled adults who require assistance with activities of daily living (ADLs). Each day in calendar year 2014, approximately 36,000 AL communities provided residence to over 835,000 Americans. 12 Despite caring for frail older residents, AL settings are not staffed or equipped to provide the type of care that nursing homes can provide. Further, the amenities and support are more heterogenous than the highly regulated nursing homes with marked differences in staffing levels and their training, policies and procedures, and their threshold for accepting certain types of patients (eg, cognitive impairment). As ALs are not routinely regulated by the federal government, state regulators will need to consider how to encourage ALs to have the staffing and infrastructure in place to meet the care delivery needs for this potentially vulnerable population when COVID-19 enters the community. It will also be important for state regulators to ensure that AL facilities have a plan in place to prepare for cases of COVID-19.","To lessen the chance of infection among older people in nursing homes, more local authorities are banning visitors to nursing homes and longterm care facilities. 5 In January, 2020, the Chinese Ministry of Civil Affairs implemented similar social-distancing measures. 6 As a result, older residents lost face-to-face contact with their family members. Group activities in nursing homes were also prohibited. As a consequence, the residents of nursing homes became more socially isolated. We have observed that under the dual stress of fear of infection and worries about the residents' condition, the level of anxiety among staff in nursing homes increased and they developed signs of exhaustion and burnout after a month-long full lockdown of the facilities.","Second, all countries should consider a combination of response measures: case and contact finding; containment or other measures that aim to delay the onset of patient surges where feasible; and measures such as public awareness, promotion of personal protective hygiene, preparation of health systems for a surge of severely ill patients, stronger infection prevention and control in health facilities, nursing homes, and long-term care facilities, and postponement or cancellation of largescale public gatherings.","Several epidemiological variables make long-term care facilities a priority area for near term public health planning. Most significantly, long-term care residents are among those at highest risk for COVID-19 morbidity and mortality. In 2014, 42% of long-term care residents were over the age of 85 and 68% over 75. 4 Initial estimates from the Chinese Centers for Disease Control indicate an overall fatality rate from COVID-19 of 2.3%. 5 As a broader segment of the population gets tested, this overall estimated fatality rate will decrease as the number of individuals with mild or asymptomatic disease are increasingly included in the calculations. Regardless, the fatality rate is highest among older patients. For patients under the age of 50, the case fatality rate for COVID-19 has not exceeded 0.4% (5) . Among susceptible older adults, however, the recorded death rate rapidly increases. Among patients aged 70 to 79, the fatality rate in China has been estimated at 8.0%; for patients over 80, the estimate increases to 14%. 5 Even as the overall case fatality rate drops, the risk of death among older adults may be 10-fold higher than for younger individuals.","Notify the health department about residents with severe respiratory infection and clusters of respiratory infection. See State-Based Prevention Activities for contact information for the healthcare-associated infections program in each state health department. CDC has resources for performing respiratory infection surveillance in long-term care facilities during an outbreak. In general, when caring for residents with undiagnosed respiratory infection use Standard, Contact, and Droplet Precautions with eye protection unless the suspected diagnosis requires Airborne Precautions (e.g., tuberculosis). This includes restricting residents with respiratory infection to their rooms. If they leave the room, residents should wear a facemask (if tolerated) or use tissues to cover their mouth and nose. Continue to assess the need for Transmission-Based Precautions as more information about the resident's suspected diagnosis becomes available If COVID-19 is suspected, based on evaluation of the resident or prevalence of COVID-19 in the community, Residents with known or suspected COVID-19 do not need to be placed into an airborne infection isolation room (AIIR) but should ideally be placed in a private room with their own bathroom. Room sharing might be necessary if there are multiple residents with known or suspected COVID-19 in the facility. As roommates of symptomatic residents might already be exposed, it is generally not recommended to separate them in this scenario. Public health authorities can assist with decisions about resident placement. Facilities should notify the health department immediately and follow the Interim Infection Prevention and Control Recommendations for Patients with COVID-19 or Persons Under Investigation for COVID-19 in Healthcare Settings, which includes detailed information regarding recommended PPE. If a resident requires a higher level of care or the facility cannot fully implement all recommended precautions, the resident should be transferred to another facility that is capable of implementation. Transport personnel and the receiving facility should be notified about the suspected diagnosis prior to transfer. While awaiting transfer, symptomatic residents should wear a facemask (if tolerated) and be separated from others (e.g., kept in their room with the door closed). Appropriate PPE should be used by healthcare personnel when coming in contact with the resident.","MOHLTC, 2018; Country: Canada Sponsor: Ontario Ministry of Health and Long-term Care Scope: assist long-term care facilities and public health units with prevention, detection and management of respiratory infection outbreaks 3.1 Outbreak Management","In recent years, negative outcomes in nursing homes during disaster situations have led the media, public health officials, and politicians to find fault with nursing home providers. Most recently, 4 nursing home workers who cared for residents during Hurricane Irma were charged with criminal homicide in Florida. 13 Though the circumstances in the Florida case were different, this historical reality is chilling when viewed through the prism of what is currently transpiring in Washington state where second-guessing of care quality has already begun. Quite clearly, mortality within long-term care environments related to COVID-19 will be significantly higher than among the general population as a function of resident advanced age and comorbidity rather than substandard care. Some understanding of this fact will certainly be welcomed by the long-term care industry, who are often responsible for delivering difficult care under suboptimal circumstances.","Third, hospitals lack expertise and human resources skilled in infection management. Senior managers fail to consider qualified personnel. A few health care institutions simply fill available vacancies with retired nurses to ensure the number of required personnel in the department of nosocomial infection.","Because of the ease of spread in a long-term care setting and the severity of illness that occurs in residents with COVID-19, facilities should discourage visitation and begin screening visitors even before COVID-19 is identified in their community. Facilities should: Send letters or emails to families advising them to consider postponing or using alternative methods for visitation (e.g., video conferencing) during the next several months. Post signs at the entrances to the facility instructing visitors to not enter if they have fever or symptoms of a respiratory infection.","While we were unable to find an accurate recent estimate of the human resources currently available in the camps (e.g., number of doctors, nurses, midwives), it is very likely that they will be inadequate to face a large influx of patients.Given the limited availability of skilled health workers and hospital beds in Cox's Bazar, it is unlikely that additional health care professionals within Bangladesh would be available. A surge of international health care workers could be considered, but this will be difficult given the high demands worldwide during the pandemic and existing travel restrictions. Furthermore, issues of introduction of the virus from expatriates into Bangladesh would need to be carefully addressed. A more likely strategy will be task shifting among existing health care workers, with physicians treating the most severe cases, nurses the less severe cases, and community health workers addressing mild infections. Such task shifting would require intensive training that needs to begin immediately. An examination of the \"re-purposing\" of people working in various capacities (e.g., teachers as schools are closed) needs to be undertaken to assess how they can be used to address this epidemic while ensuring integration and .

AMDA, The Society for Post-Acute and Long-Term Care Medicine, has recently published interim recommendations (https://paltc.org/COVID-19) for health care providers in Long-Term Care Facilities. The documents offer guidance and address frequently asked questions on how Post-Acute and Long-Term Care Facilities should prepare for and manage individuals with suspected COVID-19. Symptoms of COVID-19 include fever, cough, and shortness of breath, but initial symptoms are milder and frail older adults often present atypically. The symptoms may range from mild to severe. While studies underway to assess antiviral medications for COVID-19 have begun, supportive care is the best available therapeutic option.","There have been a wide range in responses across states since the first case of COVID-19 was announced in Washington State on January 14, 2020. Upon this, the CDC began releasing recommendations to those at risk of being exposed to the virus. The initial recommendations included travel warnings and restricted travel to countries with confirmed cases and sustained COVID-19 spread. These travel restrictions grew to include inbound and outbound travel bans to a list of 26 countries, in both Europe and Asia. 108 Other policies have included social distancing, which has been widely recommended or enforced at various levels of government. This method involves avoiding crowds, staying home, limiting or avoiding visiting vulnerable populations (such as long-term care facilities) and standing at least six feet away from others in public spaces. Some regions have implemented school closures at both the K-12 and higher education level. Business closures have also been recommended or enforced, such that employees should work from home, unless their work is considered essential to the greater public (e.g. health care, grocery stores). To support employees working remotely or staying home when sick, a number of states have also mandated paid sick leave for those who are affected by . Free testing has also been implemented in certain states, so that anyone experiencing symptoms or has been exposed to the virus can now get tested for free. 111 We coded various policies that cancel events and large gatherings as follows: the cancellation of large events, specifically the election postponement in Louisiana, is categorized as \" event_cancel .\" The separate \" no_gathering \" policy variable represents policy measures that banned all events or mass gatherings of a certain size, i.e. no gatherings over a certain number of people (where this number has varied by region). The \" social_distance \" category includes measures that prevent visits to elderly care facilities, close public facilities such as libraries, and require workers to work remotely. The \" emergency_declaration \" encompasses the declarations of a state of emergency at the city, county, state, and federal level. This declaration allows the affected area to immediately marshal emergency funds and resources and activate emergency legislation, while also giving the public an indication of the gravity of the situation.","Use of an education programme to encourage hand hygiene with alcohol-based handrub and reduce near-patient environmental contamination in elderly residents in long-term care O'Donoghue Margaret 1 , Yang Lin 1 , Siu Gilman Kit-Hang 2 , Lee Paul Hong 1 , Boost Maureen Valerie 1 , Ho Jacqueline Mei Chi 1 , Suen Lorna Kwai Ping 1 . 1 School of Nursing, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, 2 Department of Health Technology and Informatics, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University Background: Elderly residents of long-term care facilities (LTCFs) colonized or infected with multidrug resistant organisms act as important reservoirs leading to cross-contamination within the LTCF as well as transfer to the hospital upon admission. Colonization with MRSA is well recognized as a major risk factor for subsequent infection. The role of patients' hands has been neglected both in hospitals and LTCFs even though it has been suggested that they may represent an under-recognized reservoir of pathogens. We aimed to determine if education, regular reminders and improved availability of alcohol based hand rub (ABHR) would increase frequency of hand hygiene by elderly residents in long term care capable of performing hand hygiene without assistance. Methods: Nasal swabs were collected from 321 elderly subjects attending community centres for social activities. Swabs were cultured on chromogenic agar. Species identification was performed using MALDI-TOF. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed and results interpreted according to EUCAST guidelines. Presence of AR genes was detected by PCR. Figure 1 . Hand and near-patient environmental contamination before-and after a one-month hand hygiene intervention involving use of ABHR in a LTCF for elderly residents (data for test subjects).","Objectives: Scabies is an itching dermatosis which continues to be a frequent health problem. Long-term follow-up of the epidemiological situation confirms a thirty-year cycle for which there is no satisfactory explanation. Methods: Standard methodology of diagnostics is based on a) subjective sensations in the patient b) objective dermatological finding c) positive epidemiological history d) laboratory demonstrations of causative agent e) remission of symptoms upon specific therapy. Cases of scabies diagnosed and reported by dermatologists nationwide are included by the public health service in the central system EPIDAT (NIPH, Prague). Results: The last two documented epidemic waves of scabies affecting the Czech Republic peaked in 1970 and in 1993. Specific morbidity is the highest among persons 15-24 years of age (it closely connected with sexual activity-the source of infestation in 60% of adults was a sexual partner and that is confirmed by an almost identical trend in reported scabies morbidity and fresh cases of syphilis in 1965-1999 years), but the morbidity trend has been falling sharply after the year 1993. However, morbidity in persons over 65 years of age has been gradually rising over recent years. Group epidemics (86) have been repeatedly reported in such facilities as departments of gerio-psychiatry, institutions for long-term chronic patients, old folks homes, social care institutes and charity facilities. That occurs in bed-ridden subjects hospitalized on a long-term basis, the mentally retarded and the superannuated, in whom the scabies is of a nosocomial character. The affected staff of healthcare institution is very often the source of further transmission to others, namely to immobile patients, as well as to especially vulnerable individuals under higher risk of infection. Analysis of the reported cases revealed a 13% share of healthcare workers in this infection. Under greater risk are senior nurses (62%), junior nurses (21%), auxiliary paramedical staff (13%)and the last of all physicians (4%). Scabies as an occupational disease occurs almost exclusively in the healthcare sector. Conclusions: Scabies poses on increased risk for the younger population (active scabies) and the elderly population (passive scabies). It poses a great occupational risk in the paramedical healthcare staff carrying out nursing or managing services. It is necessary to consistently observe preventive and repressive epidemiological measures in the population.","Residents of long-term care facilities often have medical conditions associated with an increased risk of morbidity and mortality to COVID-19. Based on analyses of deaths related to COVID-19 through February 11, 2020, the odds of dying from the virus were greater in those with heart (OR \u00bc 12. 6 Analysis of China's mortality data indicates that 10.5% of those who died had cardiovascular disease, 7.3% had diabetes, 6.3% had chronic respiratory disease, 6% had hypertension, and 5.6% had cancer. 7 These conditions are commonplace in the long-term care environment, where rates of heart disease exceed 30% and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exceeds 20%. 8, 9 Further, extreme functional impairment within long-term care facilities makes close contact between health care workers and residents inevitable. Additionally, cognitive impairment among residents may make contact precautions and isolation a practical impossibility.","PubMed was searched. Studies of any design reporting influenza outbreaks among elderly individuals in LTCFs were considered for inclusion. During full text review, articles were included if they contained the number of influenza cases occurring on a specific date or within a 3-day period, such as through an epidemic curve or a line list of symptom onset dates 37 studies N = NR Long term care facilitiesdefined as any residential environment that housed older adults or elderly individuals with the assistance of medical staff and included facilities referred to as 'assisted living' or 'nursing homes' but excluded community centers and daytime-only facilities serving older adults living in the outside community.","The health status of refugees has improved since 2017 but remains fragile. The latest crude and child mortality rates are below emergency levels, while global acute malnutrition remains high. 4 The site is served by five hospitals run by non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and foreign governments with a total of 340 hospital beds (5.7 beds per 10,000 population) and up to 630 hospital beds when needed (10.6 per 10,000 population). 5 There are 24 primary health care centers (1 PHC/25,000 persons) with numerous health posts, though the total number of functioning PHCs varies. 6, 7 Outside of the refugee site, there are 910 beds available in Cox's Bazar district, including government, private, and NGO facilities for both the host community and refugees. 8, 9 The district hospital, with a 250-bed capacity, typically treats between 400-600 inpatients daily; 50-60 of whom are estimated to be refugees. 9,10 It suffers from overcrowding with a bed occupancy rate over 200%, poor infection control, and inadequate hygiene protocol and waste management. 9, 10 While it has six intensive care unit (ICU) beds available, the ICU is reportedly not functional. 11 There are an estimated 0.31 physicians and 0.12 nurses per 1,000 population in Bangladesh, far below the 4.5 skilled health workers per 1,000 population recommended by WHO. 12, 13 In this study, we aim to understand how SARS-CoV-2 might impact refugee camp populations, using the Rohingya refugees living in the Kutupalong-Balukhali Expansion Site as a case study. The primary aims of this analysis are to: 1) develop a baseline expectation of the possible infection burden, speed, and hospitalization capacity needed to respond to a COVID-19 epidemic; 2) use these findings to provide some recommendations to support ongoing preparedness planning by the Bangladesh government, United Nations agencies and other actors for a COVID-19 outbreak; and 3) apply lessons from this case study to refugees and other forcibly displaced persons globally.","At the national level there should be an IC programme, which would provide healthcare facilities with appropriate direction, guidance and support in preventing the spread of infection in healthcare facilities. This will ensure consistency of approach. 49 In those areas without existing legislation to make IC and prevention interventions mandatory, public health officials should promote meetings with policy makers to lobby for legislation to mandate that each hospital should have an IC committee (ICC) with a specified core membership and an appropriate IC infrastructure, including resources. Functions of the hospital ICC should include outbreak investigation, surveillance, reviewing local epidemiological data, educating staff, patients and visitors, developing and promoting local guidelines and estimating resource needs. The ICC should be multidisciplinary and include nursing, medical, laboratory, public health, pharmacy, occupational health, hospital management and engineering representatives.","The current evidence suggests that with antiviral chemoprophylaxis with adamantine is effective in managing respiratory illness in residents of long-term care facilities. The rest of the strategies can be used in long-term care facilities, yet have limited evidence supporting their use.","In silicone material than latex catheter coated silicone coating material has trained more microorganisms ( p = 0.013). Compared to the two groups, the not changing bag group microorganism culture data was over 105cfu, and with 14 patients (13.1%), changing group is 4 patient (10.8%), there is no significant in statistic analysis ( p = 0.486). Logistic regression were use analyzing, we adjusted other variables, not changing group has sheltering effect. However, whethere changing urinary drainage bag or not would be not significant in bacteria culture ( p = 0.717). Conclusion: Patients indwelling catheter for more than 14 days in the group did not change the urinary drainage bag every 14 days the catheter is significantly dirty, but there is no significant difference in the urinary drainage bag and microbial culture with the replacement urinary drainage bag group. Background: Most of the residents in the LTCFs were survivors from acute medical conditions and frequently harbored multi-drug resistant organisms resulting from their previous treatment course. Therefore, infection or colonization with Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) have become an important issue. This study planned to investigate the antimicrobial agent susceptibility of and the molecular typing of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in the residents and environments in six long-term care facilities (LTCFs) in Taiwan. Methods: We prospectively investigated the existence of MDROs, including MRSA, in residents of six LTCFs and their environments from January to December 2016. Active surveillance of colonization of MDROs was performed by culturing nasal and rectal swab samples every three months for the residents. If MSA was identified, then swab specimens from environmental sources were collected and cultured. The minimal inhibitory concentration (MICs) of common anti-microbial agents were tested. The SCCmec genotype and Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) of selected MRSA isolates were further analyzed. Results: A total of 339 isolates of MRSA was identified during the study period. Among them, 135 isolates (39.8%) were identified from LTCF residents. Generally, the isolate numbers from LTCF residents in each surveillance culture correlated with the number of isolates from the environment. The predominant SCCmec genotypes were type IV and V. The predominant MLST types belonged to ST59 (42.3%, 60/152) and ST45 (19.7%, 28/142). The predominant MLST strains varied from facilities to facilities. However, the MLST typing from the environment cultures could correlate with the culture from the residents. The minimal inhibitory concentration (MICs) of 339 isolates of MRSA to various commonly used antibiotics were determined. All isolates were susceptible to vancomycin, nitrofurantoin, quinopristin-dalfoprestine, linezolid, mupirocin, and teicoplanin. Daptomycin (99.7%), rifampicin (97.9%), and fucidic acid (96.8%) also exerted excellent in vitro activities against these 339 isolates of MRSA. However, the MIC values of tetracycline, trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole, and ciprofloxacin were significantly lower in ST59 as compared to ST45. Conclusion: The MRSA widely distributed in some but not all the long-term care facilities in Taiwan. No single clonal expansion was found in different facilities. However, the MLST typing of the environmental stains highly correlated with the colonized strains in LTCF residents. An individualized environmental cleansing policy should be adopted to facilitate the LTCF to reduce the environmental colonization with MRSA. Commonly used antimicrobial agents against hospital-acquired strain of MRSA remained highly active against these isolates from LTCFs.","Preventing respiratory illness in long-term care facilities: One high quality SR found mixed results for the effectiveness of hand hygiene to prevent infection with 2 studies reporting statistically significant positive results in favour of hand hygiene and 1 study reporting nonstatistically significant results. One moderate quality SR with meta-analysis found a moderate non-statistically significant effect in favour of personal protective equipment (PPE) in preventing infection. The same SR and meta-analysis also examined the effectiveness of social isolation to prevent infection and found no statistically significant results. One moderate quality SR reported statically significant evidence for the effectiveness of amantadine and amantadine + PPE to prevent the spread of viral respiratory infections in long-term care facilities.","Member States have defined common objectives emanating from the Lisbon Strategy as well as monitoring indicators and analytical tools through the Progress Program to improve the capabilities of comparative analysis, knowledge transfer, mutual learning, better coordination, and strategic planning. The directions of the OMC for social protection and the basic indicators of an ongoing pan-European research should be expanded and revised regularly as for example, the indicators of material deprivation (digital exclusion), of affluent households, life expectancy, and the transition from work to retirement. 18 The directions of the OMC as an intergovernmental cooperation method on accessible, quality and sustainable health-care, and long-term care, focus on the following: l Access for all to adequate health-care and long-term care, ensuring that the need for care does not lead to poverty and financial dependency while at the same time addressing inequalities related to access to care and the results of health services. l Quality in health-care and long-term health care and adjustment, including preventive care, to the changing needs and preferences of society and individuals, primarily through the development of quality standards that meet international best practices and through the development of a higher sense of responsibility among health professionals and patients and recipients of care. l Sustainability of adequate and quality health-care and long-term care through the rational use of resources and mainly through appropriate incentives for users and providers, good governance and coordination between care systems and public and private entities. Long-term sustainability and quality also require the promotion of a healthy and active lifestyle as well as the existence of good human resources for the health-care sector.","Given the disparate allocation of infection control resources within and among SARS-affected countries, mobile teams might be effective mechanisms to assess infection control practices at hospitals. Mobile teams can focus infection control resources to hospitals actively evaluating patients suspected of SARS infection and provide specific training and recommendations that are appropriate to a hospital's setting and resources. On-site assessment and interventions can actively supplement recommendations and information that have been disseminated passively. Further follow-up and evaluation are needed to assess whether mobile teams improve implementation of infection control recommendations at targeted hospitals. In many facilities, a single evaluation visit or training might not be sufficient to ensure safe infection control practices, and a long-term mechanism for supervision and assessment of quality control could be useful. Unfortunately, resources are limited, and reevaluation of hospitals since the 2003 epidemic has not been done.","There is a disproportionate number of individuals with mental and somatic illnesses among persons in detention (Bhugra, 2020; Ginn, 2012) . It is also known that infections which are transmitted human to human via droplet or close contact spread particularly well in confined spaces. Since transfer options for further treatment are more difficult (especially in detention facilities) preventive measures are strongly emphasized, particularly in the case of viral droplet infections. For example, in the context of influenza, vaccination of detainees and staff is recommended (NHS 2019) . If such options are not available, prisons and other closed facilities, like asylum centers, shelters, and closed psychiatric hospitals, pose a risk for the rapid spread of such diseases. In the past, Australia for example has described the rapid spread of influenza among prison inmates (Awofeso et al., 2001) . The Spanish flu is also reported to have affected about a quarter of all inmates; a prevalence much higher when compared to data from the general population (Finnie, Copley, Hall, &amp; Leach, 2014) . We are also currently receiving news from China, which reports a rapid spread of Covid-19 infections among prisoners from the Hubei Province. Regarding Covid-19, the spread seems to have been caused by infected security personnel importing it into detention facilities. According to the media, the Chinese government reacted to the outbreak among inmates by locking down affected prisons, suspending the transportation of goods, testing inmates who were in contact with the diagnosed wardens, and also by dismissing the prison directors and setting up a commission to analyse the spread of the virus among detained individuals (Caixing Global 2019). Correctly, there has recently been talk of a \"blind spot\" in the media regarding the spread of Covid-19 among prison inmates. (Global Times 2020) We argue that the blind spot extends further to particularly marginalized groups such as individuals using and abusing drugs and people without legal residence status, especially since these groups often overlap with individuals in detention (Liem, Wang, Wariyanti, Latkin, &amp; Hall, 2020) . Under normal circumstances, the psychological and psychiatric care of individuals in prison is already a major challenge for many health care systems; a problem that is even more evident in times of crisis, as is currently observed. The difficulties arise on different levels and affect detained individuals, security personnel, as well as medical staff alike (Chen et al., 2020) . Fears, worries, and uncertainties, especially for isolated or quarantined patients, can cause an increase in stress-related illnesses but also the exacerbation of pre-existing mental disorders (Duan &amp; Zhu, 2020) . This leads to a dilemma: the higher level of care and support that is required is contravened by recommendations that, especially under conditions of isolation, advise against the routine consultation of clinical psychologists, psychiatrists, and social workers in order to prevent the spread of infections. In this situation, medical staff, who are primarily focused on treating the infection (or complications thereof), must then additionally provide psychological care and be ready to intervene during a mental health crisis. Against this backdrop, some authors advocate for the use of online counselling tools and web platforms to support individuals in isolation and those affected (Liu et al., 2020) . Although these recommendations are directed at the general population and not at a prison population, it does not seem reasonable that such channels of care should not be used for individuals under detention as well. Other models could be envisaged, such as the provision of telephone counselling for prisoners and staff. However, for the current outbreak of Covid-19, such elements may not be implemented quickly enough. This raises the question of how to provide rational, basic psychiatric care under the current challenging conditions. We urge that governments take into account special needs of people in confined closed spaces. They must try: -Preserving continuity in provision of psychiatric and psychological care to individuals in detention is imperative and should remain so during the Covid-19 outbreak. -Early coordination between regional prison authorities, prison psychiatry, and general medical and general psychiatric care providers (e.g. in cases of referrals). This must also include close liaison with court diversion schemes, probation officers and others. Some clear guidance needs to be developed urgently regarding visitors to prisons and jails. -Given the potential shortage of time and human resources, the more severe psychiatric and psychological cases must be carefully triaged. Here, factors such as pre-existing mental illness, self-and extraneous endangerment, violence and aggressive behavior, refusal to eat, and also assessments and recommendations of experienced security staff should be taken into account. -Given the flood of perceivable unsettling information on Covid-19, staff providing psychological or psychiatric treatment should be informed regularly and urgently about symptomatology and presentation and on the realistic clinical course, also in comparison to other infectious diseases or in comparison to other daily risks. Sharing of accurate information without bias and panic is critical. -Ensuring the provision of masks, disinfectants and protective measures in sufficient quantity for psychological and psychiatric staff visiting individuals in detention. -Particular attention should also be paid to certify that staff deployed to provide psychological-psychiatric care in institutions are informed and/or sensitized of known potential risk factors for a more severe course of a Covid-19 infection of their own (advanced age, somatic comorbidities, chronic respiratory diseases, hypertension, cancer, known immune deficiencies etc.). Due to the currently limited understanding of Covid-19, it may be advisable to prohibit employees with such conditions from providing psychological or psychiatric care to individuals in detention and prisons. -If there is a sudden shortage of staff providing psychological and psychiatric care to detained individuals with a mental illness, staff from general psychiatry may have to fill consequential gaps. This needs careful planning on an urgent basis so that the potential of extremely long working hours of medical staff during the current outbreak can be managed successfully.","Strategies to manage CRE colonized/infected patients and to control outbreaks in health care facilities have been reviewed. [109] [110] [111] Both the WHO 112 and the CDC 113 provide detailed guidance on methods to control CRE. The use of bundles to control horizontal transmission of CRE in health care facilities have been reviewed. 114 Environmental contamination and survival CRE has been isolated from the environment in the vicinity of hospitalized colonized/infected patients including pillows, infusion pumps, bedside tables, and toilet areas. [115] [116] [117] The frequency of recovery has varied among studies, but objects closer to the patient are more likely contaminated with 5%-15% of samples from bedrails and over bed tables yielding CRE. 115, 116 Fecal continence is an independent predictor of being a nonspreader of CRE. 117 CRE has also been isolated in the environment of long-term care facilities. 118 Havill et al 119 reported survival of CRE on stainless steel discs for &gt;10 days. However, Weber et al 120 reported that 3 species of CRE (Klebsiella, Enterobacter, and Escherichia coli) survived poorly (&gt;85% die-off in 24 hours). Likely this difference was owing to the fact that Havill et al 119 used a high inoculum (ie, 5-7-log 10 ) whereas Weber used a low inoculum (ie, \u00bb2-log 10 ), which is similar to the actual amount of CRE found on surfaces in the vicinity of patients colonized/ infected with CRE.","A major component of eff orts to reduce HAI infections is CDC's National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN), the most extensive and widely used HAI tracking system in the USA. With NHSN, data for HAIs and other related issues, including adherence rates of infection control, use of antibiotics, infections with multidrug-resistant organisms, and safety and vaccinations of health-care personnel, are obtained and made available to facilities, states, and regional and national organisations to help to identify and correct problems and to measure progress. Established as the National Nosocomial Infections Surveillance System in 1970, NHSN includes more than 12 000 facilities in all 50 states and extends beyond hospitals to include outpatient dialysis centres and nursing homes. Numbers of participating facilities and types of data obtained are expected to increase in the future. Reports of NHSN data, including national and state-specifi c reports of standardised infection ratios, have shown many successes in the reduction of the burden of certain HAIs, including a 41% decrease in central-line-associated bloodstream infections, 17% decrease in surgical-site infections, and 7% decrease in catheter-associated urinary tract infections in 2011 when compared with baseline (2008, 2009) rates. 43 Despite these successes, additional eff orts are needed, with intensifi ed actions aimed at reduction of antibiotic-resistant threats. 44 Comprehensive approaches are needed to prevent introduction and spread of infections as patients move between and within health-care facilities and into communities. A major concern is Clostridium diffi cile infection, a common and sometimes fatal infection that occurs mainly in association with health-care settings in patients receiving antibiotics. Transmitted by the faecal-oral route, C diffi cile infections rapidly spread in these settings because spores can survive on fomites and environmental surfaces for months. From 2000-09, discharge diagnoses of C diffi cile infection in patients in US hospitals more than doubled-from 139 000 to 336 600-and the number of patients with a primary C diffi cile infection diagnosis tripled, from 33 000 to 111 000, and only recently have these infections begun to plateau. 45 47 CRE infections can be severe, with mortality rates more than 40%, 48 and can easily spread from hospitals to other health-care settings in communi ties. CRE containing New Delhi metallo-\u03b2-lactamase (NDM) are of particular concern; NDM enzymes can be encoded on plasmids, which spreads multidrug-resistance to other Enterobacteriaceae and other bacteria. Identifi cation of patients colonised by or infected with CRE and segregation of patients and staff can reduce these infections, 49 but additional steps are needed. A crucial measure to control antibiotic resistance is eff ective implementation of antibiotic stewardship programmes to restrict the use of these drugs for appropriate indications. Additional eff orts include enhanced surveillance and laboratory networks with advanced molecular diagnostic capacities to improve detection, characterisation, and control of these infections.","There is a disproportionate number of individuals with mental and somatic illnesses among persons in detention (Bhugra, 2020; Ginn, 2012) .

The epidemiology of other respiratory viral outbreaks may hold some clues, with influenza being the best characterized. We cannot yet predict whether the spread of COVID-19 follows the 1918 Spanish Flu pandemic with mortality rates akin to those calculated so far, or more like the 2009 A/H1N1 pandemic where the mortality rates more closely mirrored those of seasonal influenza. However, these pandemics did follow a pattern with a milder sentinel wave in the Spring months like we have now, followed by ongoing lower level of activity before resurging with a significant impact during the subsequent fall and winter seasons. As accurate testing becomes more readily available, we will likely discover the mortality rates are much lower than the estimates from China, and hopefully, as low as more severe seasonal influenza, that is, well below 1%. Case fatality rate estimates are likely to fall in older adults as well but, as for influenza, will almost certainly remain highest among the frailest individuals, like the residents of long-term care facilities. Until then, training staff and visitors on how to minimize their risk for picking up virus in the community and the facility and transmitting it to others will remain our most important tools. This begins with frequent hand washing, not touching our face with unwashed hands, and keeping surfaces touched by others clean. Executing a communication strategy that keeps residents, family members, and the public informed will also be critical during this rapidly evolving crisis.","Another issue of our existing model is that hospitals and health care facilities are not specifically differentiated due to the unavailability of reliable data. There seems to be some indication 13 that, when health care facilities are overwhelmed by demand and have limited resources, these facilities themselves can become a hot zone of significant additional infections to staff and visitors. Once additional data become available, this limitation can be addressed in future work. As the first peak subsides, the role of imported new COVID-19 cases will again play a more significant role in the containment of COVID-19.","(5) Catheterization is recommended to be guided by ultrasound, with the bed unit elevated to an optimal position to facilitate the operation. 7) Vein-vein extra corporeal membrane oxygenation (VV-ECMO) should be considered the primary mode; however, since myocarditis is reported as a common complication associated with H1N1 influenza A and MERS-CoV viral infections, [17] [18] [19] [20] a heart-assisted mode of venoarterial ECMO (VA-ECMO) should be considered in this group of patients. [21] Recognized as a highly skilled and high-risk operation, ECMO is frequently demanded in the rescue of COVID-19 patients. We call for an action to establish more ECMO centers in affected cities with numerous COVID-19 cases, especially in Hubei province. Expert ECMO teams should be organized for immediate and professional rescue. A standard ICU single room is recommended, and daily care by ICU-specialized nursing teams should be established to avoid lethal complications. All ECMO-related equipment and consumables should be distributed or deployed by a centralized department."," Surfaces must be carefully and frequently cleaned with alcohol-based disinfectants including nursing stations, computer keyboards, etc.No equipment should be shared.Air turbulence when changing linens should be minimized.No eating may be allowed at nursing stations. Protective gear must be removed and not hung around neck when eating/drinking.Staff must monitor their own health, and most centers have set up screening mechanisms for staff on arrival at work.In the ICU the risk of droplet spread is increased by various procedures (Table 1). Efforts to avoid viral spread include the avoidance of nebulizers for drug administration and limitation or avoidance of the use of noninvasive ventilation. Nebulized humidification for oxygen therapy may carry similar risks, and our practice is to provide nonhumidified oxygen using nasal prongs or a venturi mask. A non-rebreather mask with expiratory port allowing gas filtration is available and may be of value. During bag-mask-valve ventilation a filter should be used on the expiratory port. High-risk procedures include endotracheal intubation and bronchoscopy. Intubation should be performed by the most skilled person available using the method with which they are most comfortable. Awake intubation may be associated with patient agitation and coughing, which can severely compromise infection control precautions. A powered air purification respirator (e.g., 3M Airmate) can be used for these procedures.","All countries should immediately activate the highest level of National Response Management protocols to ensure the all-of-government and allof-society approach needed to contain COVID-19 with non-pharmaceutical measures. This includes fully engaging the public on the seriousness of, and their role in, the response. Policy makers need to ensure that trained epidemiology teams are in place, along with quarantine facilities, revised hospital workflows, and laboratory processes (who to test, how, and in which laboratory). Surveillance needs to be expanded to test all patients with atypical pneumonias for COVID-19, and COVID-19 testing needs to be added to existing surveillance systems for influenza-like illness and severe acute respiratory infections. The demand on facilities, the number of test kits, personal protective equipment, and medication stockpiles should be forecast to enable scaleup. Health systems vary whereby people in under-resourced countries will be particularly at risk. Vulnerable countries will therefore need extraordinarily intensified support from other countries. WHO freely provides online resources that include training courses, downloadable standardised case report forms, guidance on clinical management and infection control, protection of health-care workers, ","The increasing incidence of imported Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) cases in acute-care facilities in Belgium led us to investigate the prevalence of MRSA carriers among nursing home (NH) residents. Objectives: To study the national prevalence of MRSA colonisation in Belgian NH-residents, to identify risk factors for MRSA carriage. Methods: In 2005, a prevalence survey was performed in a random stratified sample of 60 NH, representative of the geographic regions of the country and patient care profile. For each NH, maximum 50 residents were randomly selected for screening (nose, throat, skin wound/ urinary meatus) during a single day survey. Risk factors for MRSA carriage were collected by questionnaire, at resident -and at NH level. Results: The mean size of the NH was 106 beds, 46% of which were high-care beds. Most of these facilities (68%) were private, 36 were located in the Flanders region, 18 in the Walloon region and 6 in the Brussels region. From all screened residents, 50.7% were S. aureus carriers and 19.0% (95%CI, were MRSA carriers. There were no statistically significant differences in MRSA prevalence by region, by proportion of high-care beds in the NH's or by NH size. MRSA carriership was more frequent in private (20.9%) than in public NH's (17.6%) (p = 0.004). In NH with an infection control protocol the MRSA prevalence is lower (17%) than in NH without such protocol (22.2%) (p = 0.046). Among S. aureus carriers the mean resistance proportion was 37.8% (95% CI, 33. 4-42.1) . A linear relation was observed between resistance proportion and prevalence of MRSA carriership (Pearson: 0.88, p \u00a3 0.001).","First, many families have to live in a single bedroom with shared kitchen and toilet facilities, causing overcrowding and making self-isolation impossible in confined spaces. 5 Often, children have inadequate space to crawl or play and no access to fresh air. Second, no regulation on temporary accommodation exists regarding what is deemed suitable or how long someone can stay in temporary housing. With COVID-19, these children will stay in temporary accommodation for extended periods because no applications or services are being processed or provided. Third, handwashing and hygiene are reduced because of minimal access to soap, water, disinfectants, and bathrooms. Another issue is that no face-to-face contact with general practitioners and health outreach services is available, including health visitors, which limits routine checks such as early identification of need and risk, health and development reviews with screening assessments, immunisations, promotion of social and emotional development, support for parenting, promotion of health and behavioural change, prevention of obesity, and promotion of breastfeeding. 6 Furthermore, for these families, access to basic essentials (eg, food, nappies) is scarce, with no resources to shop online and many charities and dropins now closed. Additionally, they do not have regular support services (eg, legal advice, weekly allowances, housing or immigration, online access to resources from the National Health Service via WiFi). A further consideration is that risks to parental mental health are increased, especially among single mothers, given that housing instability is associated with an increased risk of depression in mothers. 7 Finally, existing vulnerabilities and risk factors for safeguarding are exacerbated by additional factors introduced by the pandemic.","Individual-, Institutional-, Community-, and Global-Based Strategies Disease prevention and control activities for infectious agents occur at four levels. The first level is targeted to the individual and is predominantly the domain of the clinician. A variety of prevention activities can be targeted to individuals through their primary care provider. Use of chemoprophylaxis to prevent surgical wound infections is an example of a control measure targeted to the individual. The second level is that of the institution, which is predominantly the domain of the infection-control practitioner or the school health official. This level includes health care facilities, nursing homes, other residential facilities, and schools. Programs to prevent the spread of bloodborne pathogens or tuberculosis to health care workers in hospitals are examples of control strategies targeted at the institutional level. The third level is targeted to the community in general and is predominantly the domain of public health agencies (at the local, state, and national levels). Removal of a contaminated food product from the market is an example of a control measure targeted to the community. The fourth level is related to global strategies. For a number of important pathogens, it has become clear that global control strategies are critical to have an impact on disease occurrence within the United States. The growing proportion of tuberculosis cases among refugees and immigrants to the United States and ongoing episodes of importation of measles from abroad are two examples pertinent to U.S. disease control in the early 21st century.","The final principle is support. Perianesthesia nursing leaders should ensure that their staff has the proper education and training to care for surge patients, adequate quantities of surge supplies, and sufficient staff reinforcements should a true influenza pandemic present itself. Because of the inherent infection control issues, staff should also receive training regarding which personal protective equipment (PPE) is necessary and how to properly don and doff the PPE. 14,15 Supply shortages will be routine in a pandemic, thereby making it impractical to rely on just-in-time supplies. Some supplies will be available to health care facilities from the federal Strategic National Stockpile; however, these ''push packages'' are delivered to the state level, and it may take time for the supplies to arrive at the local facility requesting the items. 16 As such, par levels should be increased for critical items, in anticipation of high use and broken supply chains.","One solution is to authorize ambulance transport for these patients from their homes to hemodialysis facilities, but this would likely require substantial support from the state and federal governments given local regulations and recent cuts in reimbursement for non-emergency basic life support transports to and from dialysis facilities. 14 Optimally, collaboration can be enhanced between dialysis facilities and current transportation services to improve driver education, enhance infection prevention, and strengthen communication regarding managing risk of COVID-19 transmission and potential exposures.","In half of the hospitals, hand-washing facilities (hand-washing basin with soap, clean water, and clean drying towels) were available immediately outside the patient's room or anteroom. In most remaining hospitals, hand-washing facilities were at a location distant from the patient's room, such as the nursing station. One hospital lacked access to running water for several hours per day.","With school closures and skilled nursing lock-downs, deliberate and creative forms of connection offer children the security of human connection. In most hospitals, children are feeling especially isolated/alone (as are their parents) while honoring the public health need for only one parent to visit at a time. Most hospitals have banned sibling visits. Hospitals may consider helping the siblings understand by having a special website page for siblings explaining the visitation limit reasons and by helping patients remain connected to siblings through messaging or virtual interaction. Whether in the form of virtual preschool sessions or facetime visits with peers and relatives, recognize and foster the relationality of children. Families may consider checking-in with the child's school about homeschool and distant learning opportunities. If additional therapeutic services are being received, some occupation and physical therapists are offering the scheduling of remote sessions.","Multiple outbreaks of MERS have involved health care facilities. 91, 93, [95] [96] [97] One outbreak involved 23 patients receiving hemodialysis in an intensive care unit; the case fatality rate was 65%. In the recent outbreak in South Korea, substantial transmission was reported in health care facilities. 98, 99 For example, a hospital reported a single primary case, 25 secondary cases, and 11 tertiary cases. 98 HCP have been at high risk of acquiring MERS. Al-Tawfiq and Perl reported that of 952 cases reported in Saudi Arabia (June 2012-September 2014), approximately 27% were HCP. Factors contributing to intrahospital transmission include: (1) initial symptoms of MERS are nonspecific leading to a failure to isolate the patient; (2) inadequate compliance with infection control practices; (3) inadequate health care facilities (eg, overcrowding, close proximity of patients to cases); (4) use of aerosol-generating procedures; and (5) prolonged viral shedding. 93 Per the CDC, key methods for preventing transmission of MERS in health care facilities include notifying patients to call before arrival at a health care facility if they have had travel to the Middle East plus signs and symptoms of MERS; strict adherence to respiratory hygiene in clinics and the emergency department; early identification of possible patients; and prompt institution of contact and airborne isolation for possible cases. 100 ","Additional steps to reduce transmission in hemodialysis facilities include decreasing the number of patients present at any given time by opening additional shifts, enhanced scheduling to reduce congregation in waiting rooms, increased distancing of patients within a hemodialysis facility, and careful placement of PUIs in isolation rooms or more isolated areas of hemodialysis facilities. Other adopted strategies include designating either entire facilities or specific shifts within a facility for COVID positive patients. All of these strategies represent a significant logistic burden, but appear essential to optimize use of societal healthcare resources. Different strategies may be more readily adoptable, depending on local considerations.","To promote the use of TM in the age of COVID-19, various online resources have been developed both from regulatory agencies and from the major allergy professional societies (Table I ). In addition, because of the public health emergency, as of March 6, 2020, Medicare will pay to treat COVID-19 (and for other medically reasonable purposes) using TM services for patients if they have seen a provider in the same practice from offices, hospitals, and places of residence (such as homes, nursing homes, and assisted living facilities). 7 There also has been a relaxation of Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) regulations to permit providers to use their personal phones to see patients. In addition, in an effort to get COVID-19 tests to the public more quickly, the US Food and Drug Administration has waived the normal regulations to expedite allowing test makers to market scientifically valid products in the United States. 8 "],"title":["Guidelines for preventing respiratory illness in older adults aged 60 years and above living in long-term care: A rapid review of
