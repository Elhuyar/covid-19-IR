To safeguard Chinese citizens and to strengthen global health security, China has made great efforts to control the epidemic. Many in the global community have joined China to limit the epidemic. However, discrimination and prejudice driven by fear or misinformation have been flowing globally, superseding evidence and jeopardizing the anti-severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 efforts. We analyze this phenomenon and its underlying causes and suggest practical solutions.","Problem: Due to the spread of SARS CoV-2 virus infection and COVID-2019 disease, there is an urgent need to analyze COVID-2019 epidemic perception in Poland. This would enable authorities for preparation of specific actions minimizing public health and economic risks. Methods: We study the perception of COVID-2019 epidemic in Polish society using quantitative analysis of its digital footprints on the Internet (on Twitter, Google, YouTube, Wikipedia and electronic media represented by Event Registry) from January 2020 to 12.03.2020 (before and after official introduction to Poland on 04.03.2020). To this end we utilize data mining, social network analysis, natural language processing techniques. Each examined internet platform was analyzed for representativeness and composition of the target group. Results: We identified three major cluster of the interest before disease introduction on the topic COVID-2019: China- and Italy-related peaks on all platforms, as well as a peak on social me...","The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has been rapidly transmitted in China, Macau, Hong Kong, and other Asian and European counterparts. This COVID-19 epidemic has aroused increasing attention nationwide. Patients, health professionals, and the general public are under insurmountable psychological pressure which may lead to various psychological problems, such as anxiety, fear, depression, and insomnia. Psychological crisis intervention plays a pivotal role in the overall deployment of the disease control. The National Health Commission of China has summoned a call for emergency psychological crisis intervention and thus, various mental health associations and organizations have established expert teams to compile guidelines and public health educational articles/videos for mental health professionals and the general public alongside with online mental health services. In addition, mental health professionals and expert groups are stationed in designated isolation hospitals to prov...","Background: Affected by a Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak, Since December 2019, there have been more than 76,000 cases of COVID-19 in China, causing more than 3,000 medical staff infections. Due to COVID-19 spreads quickly, is highly contagious, and can be fatal in severe cases, and there are no specific medicines, it poses a huge threat to the life and health of nurses and has a large impact on their emotional responses and coping strategies. Methods: This study conducted an online questionnaire survey from February 1 to 9, 2020 to investigate the current state of emotional responses and coping strategies of nurses and college nursing students in Anhui Province. This study used a modified Brief COPE (Carver, 1997) and a emotional responses scale. Results: The results found that women showed more severe anxiety and fear than men. Participants from cities showed more anxiety and fear than participants from rural, but rural participants showed more sadness than urban partic...","Background: Community responses are important for outbreak management during the early phase when non-pharmaceutical interventions are the major preventive options. Therefore, this study aims to examine the psychological and behavioral responses of the community during the early phase of the COVID-19 epidemic in Hong Kong. Method: A cross-sectional online survey was launched within 36 hours after confirmed COVID-19 cases were first reported. Councilors of all 452 district council constituency areas were approached for survey dissemination. Respondent demographics, anxiety level, risk perception, sources to retrieve COVID-19 information, actual adoption and perceived efficacy of precautionary measures were collected. Result: Analysis from 1715 complete responses indicated high perceived susceptibility (89%) and high perceived severity (97%). Most respondents were worried about COVID-19 (97%), and had their daily routines disrupted (slightly/greatly: 98%). The anxiety level, measured by ...","","Objective: The 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) epidemic has raised international concern. Mental health is becoming an issue that cannot be ignored in our fight against it. This study aimed to explore the prevalence and factors linked to anxiety and depression in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Methods: A total of 144 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 were included in this study. We assessed depression and anxiety symptoms using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), and social support using the Perceived Social Support Scale (PSSS) among patients at admission. Multivariate linear regression analyses were performed to identify factors associated with symptoms of anxiety and depression. Results: Of the 144 participants, 34.72% and 28.47% patients with COVID-19 had symptoms of anxiety or depression, respectively. The bivariate correlations showed that less social support was correlated with more anxious (r=-0.196, p&lt;0.05) and depressive (r=-0.360\uff0cp&lt;0.05) symptoms among...","The 2014\u201315 Ebola outbreak in West Africa highlighted the potential for large disease outbreaks caused by emerging pathogens and has generated considerable focus on preparedness for future epidemics. Here we discuss drivers, strategies and practical considerations for developing vaccines against outbreak pathogens. Chimpanzee adenoviral (ChAd) vectors have been developed as vaccine candidates for multiple infectious diseases and prostate cancer. ChAd vectors are safe and induce antigen-specific cellular and humoral immunity in all age groups, as well as circumventing the problem of pre-existing immunity encountered with human Ad vectors. For these reasons, such viral vectors provide an attractive platform for stockpiling vaccines for emergency deployment in response to a threatened outbreak of an emerging pathogen. Work is already underway to develop vaccines against a number of other outbreak pathogens and we will also review progress on these approaches here, particularly for Lassa f...","The peak of Internet searches and social media data about the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak occurred 10\u201314 days earlier than the peak of daily incidences in China. Internet searches and social media data had high correlation with daily incidences, with the maximum r &gt; 0.89 in all correlations. The lag correlations also showed a maximum correlation at 8\u201312 days for laboratory-confirmed cases and 6\u20138 days for suspected cases.","The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic began in Wuhan, China in late 2019 and continues to spread globally, with exported cases confirmed in 28 countries at the time of writing. During the interval between February 19 and 23, 2020, Iran reported its first 43 cases with eight deaths. Three exported cases originating in Iran were identified, suggesting a underlying burden of disease in that country than is indicated by reported cases. A large epidemic in Iran could further fuel global dissemination of COVID-19. We sought to estimate COVID-19 outbreak size in Iran based on known exported case counts and air travel links between Iran and other countries, and to anticipate where infections originating in Iran may spread to next. We assessed interconnectivity between Iran and other countries using using International Air Transport Association (IATA) data. We used the methods of Fraser et al. to estimate the size of the underlying epidemic that would result in cases being observed i...","We plotted daily data on the frequencies of keywords related to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) from WeChat, a Chinese social media. Using 'Feidian', Chinese abbreviation for SARS, may detect the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in 2019 two weeks earlier. WeChat offered a new approach to early detect disease outbreaks.","BACKGROUND: As internet and social media use have skyrocketed, epidemiologists have begun to use online data such as Google query data and Twitter trends to track the activity levels of influenza and other infectious diseases. In China, Weibo is an extremely popular microblogging site that is equivalent to Twitter. Capitalizing on the wealth of public opinion data contained in posts on Weibo, this study used Weibo as a measure of the Chinese people\u2019s reactions to two different outbreaks: the 2012 Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) outbreak, and the 2013 outbreak of human infection of avian influenza A(H7N9) in China. METHODS: Keyword searches were performed in Weibo data collected by The University of Hong Kong\u2019s Weiboscope project. Baseline values were determined for each keyword and reaction values per million posts in the days after outbreak information was released to the public. RESULTS: The results show that the Chinese people reacted significantly to both ou...","Although, to our knowledge, there has been no exhaustive or credible review of the evidence of the disease burden of COPD in China, COPD has become an increasing public health concern to the Chinese medical community. The purpose of this article is to review the evidence and evaluate and clarify the disease burden of COPD in China with the aim of improving effective management. We reviewed previous studies of COPD in China, which included data on prevalence, mortality, disease burden, risk factors, diagnosis, and management by searching related Web sites, including PubMed, ProQuest, and Thomson Reuters' Web of Knowledge, as well as major Chinese databases and government Web sites. Reported COPD prevalence varied between 5% and 13% in different provinces/cities across China. In 2008, COPD ranked fourth as a leading cause of death in urban areas and third in rural areas. In addition, COPD accounted for 1.6% of all hospital admissions in China in that year. The high prevalence of smoking ...","BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), formerly known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), was first identified in December 2019 in Wuhan City, China. Structural equation modeling (SEM) is a multivariate analysis method to determine the structural relationship between measured variables. This observational study aimed to use SEM to determine the effects of social support on sleep quality and function of medical staff who treated patients with COVID-19 in January and February 2020 in Wuhan, China. MATERIAL/METHODS: A one-month cross-sectional observational study included 180 medical staff who treated patients with COVID-19 infection. Levels of anxiety, self-efficacy, stress, sleep quality, and social support were measured using the and the Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS), the General Self-Efficacy Scale (GSES), the Stanford Acute Stress Reaction (SASR) questionnaire, the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), a...","Summary Background As the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) progresses, epidemiological data are needed to guide situational awareness and intervention strategies. Here we describe efforts to compile and disseminate epidemiological information on COVID-19 from news media and social networks. Methods In this population-level observational study, we searched DXY.cn, a health-care-oriented social network that is currently streaming news reports on COVID-19 from local and national Chinese health agencies. We compiled a list of individual patients with COVID-19 and daily province-level case counts between Jan 13 and Jan 31, 2020, in China. We also compiled a list of internationally exported cases of COVID-19 from global news media sources (Kyodo News, The Straits Times, and CNN), national governments, and health authorities. We assessed trends in the epidemiology of COVID-19 and studied the outbreak progression across China, assessing delays between symptom onset, seeking care...","Environmental factors, including seasonal climatic variability, can strongly impact on spatio-temporal patterns of infectious disease outbreaks. We assessed the effects of temperature and humidity on the global patterns of COVID-19 early outbreak dynamics during January-March 2020. Climatic variables were the best drivers of global variation of confirmed COVID-19 cases growth rates. Growth rates peaked in temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere with mean temperature of ~5 degrees, and humidity of approx 0.6-1 kPa during the outbreak month, while they decreased in warmer and colder regions. The strong relationship between local climate and COVID-19 growth rates suggests the possibility of seasonal variation in the spatial pattern of outbreaks, with temperate regions of the Southern Hemisphere becoming at particular risk of severe outbreaks during the next months.","Bats are being increasingly recognized as an important reservoir of zoonotic viruses of different families, including SARS coronavirus, Nipah virus, Hendra virus and Ebola virus. Several recent studies hypothesized that bats, an ancient group of flying mammals, are the major reservoir of several important RNA virus families from which other mammalian viruses of livestock and humans were derived. Although this hypothesis needs further investigation, the premise that bats carry a large number of viruses is commonly accepted. The question of whether bats have unique biological features making them ideal reservoir hosts has been the subject of several recent reviews. In this review, we will focus on the public health implications of bat derived zoonotic viral disease outbreaks, examine the drivers and risk factors of past disease outbreaks and outline research directions for better control of future disease events.","","","First, although COVID-19 is spread by the airborne route, air disinfection of cities and communities is not known to be effective for disease control and needs to be stopped. The widespread practice of spraying disinfectant and alcohol in the sky, on roads, vehicles, and personnel has no value; moreover, large quantities of alcohol and disinfectant are potentially harmful to humans and should be avoided.3 , 4 Second, in the use of personal protective equipment, we should try to distinguish different risk factors, adopt different epidemic prevention measures, and reduce the waste of personal protective equipment, as these resources are already in short supply. Although surgical masks are in widespread use by the general population, there is no evidence that these masks prevent the acquisition of COVID-19, although they might slightly reduce the spread from an infected patient. High-filtration masks such as N95 masks and protective clothing (goggles and gowns) should be used in hospitals...","Compared with other mammals, bats harbor more zoonotic viruses per species and do not demonstrate signs of disease on infection with these viruses. To counteract infections with viruses, bats have evolved enhanced mechanisms to limit virus replication and immunopathology. However, molecular and cellular drivers of antiviral responses in bats largely remain an enigma. In this study, we demonstrate that a serine residue in IRF3 is positively selected for in multiple bat species. IRF3 is a central regulator of innate antiviral responses in mammals. Replacing the serine residue in bat IRF3 with the human leucine residue decreased antiviral protection in bat cells, whereas the addition of this serine residue in human IRF3 significantly enhanced antiviral protection in human cells. Our study provides genetic and functional evidence for enhanced IRF3-mediated antiviral responses in bats and adds support to speculations that bats have positively selected for multiple adaptations in their antiv...","","The outbreaks of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic in 2003 resulted in unprecedented impacts on people's daily life. One of the most significant impacts to people is the fear of contacting the SARS virus while engaging daily routine activity. Here we use data from daily underground ridership in Taipei City and daily reported new SARS cases in Taiwan to model the dynamics of the public fear of the SARS virus during the wax and wane of the SARS period. We found that for each reported new SARS case there is an immediate loss of about 1200 underground ridership (the fresh fear). These daily loss rates dissipate to the following days with an e-folding time of about 28 days, reflecting the public perception on the risk of contacting SARS virus when traveling with the underground system (the residual fear). About 50% of daily ridership was lost during the peak of the 2003 SARS period, compared with the loss of 80% daily ridership during the closure of the underground syste...","Abstract A COVID-19 epidemic has been spreading in China and other parts of the world since December 2019. The epidemic has brought not only the risk of death from infection but also unbearable psychological pressure. We sampled college students from Changzhi medical college by using cluster sampling. They responded to a questionnaire packet that included the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7) and those inquiring the participants\u2019 basic information. We received 7,143 responses. Results indicated that 0.9% of the respondents were experiencing severe anxiety, 2.7% moderate anxiety, and 21.3% mild anxiety. Moreover, living in urban areas (OR = .810, 95% CI = .709 - .925), family income stability (OR = .726, 95% CI = .645 - .817) and living with parents (OR = .752, 95% CI = .596 - .950) were protective factors against anxiety. Moreover, having relatives or acquaintances infected with COVID-19 was a risk factor for increasing the anxiety of college students (OR = 3.007, 95% C...","Abstract On the Internet, there is a lot of open access information related to infectious diseases, e.g., official announcement, media news, bulletin boards, blogs, and other social media. If proper data retrieval and screening methods were applied on these Internet-based data, it would be very useful to improve the timeliness of early detection for infectious diseases. In China, we practice early warning using Internet-based data with routine intelligence screening assessment every day, and respond to any unusual event in a timely manner. Through this mechanism, the surveillance and early warning of Internet-based data for infectious disease and public health emergency plays an important supplemental role to the traditional surveillance systems.","Early analysis of outbreaks of novel pathogens to evaluate their likely public health impact depends on fitting predictive models to data gathered and updated in real-time. Both transmission rates and the critical threshold (i.e. the pathogen's 'reproductive number') are inferred by finding the values that provide the best model fit to reported case incidence. These models and inferred results are then the basic tools used for public health planning: how many people expected to be infected, at what scales of time and space, and whether potential intervention strategies impact disease transmission and spread. An underlying assumption, however, is that the ability to observe new cases is either constant, or at least constant relative to diagnostic test availability. We present a demonstration, discussion, and mathematical analysis of how this assumption of predictable observability in disease incidence can drastically impact model accuracy. We also demonstrate how to tailor estimations o...","This case study is the first to be developed in the Middle East region to document what happened during the response to the 2013 MERS outbreak in Qatar. It provides a description of key epidemiologic events and news released from a prime daily newspaper and main Emergency Risk Communication (ERC) actions that were undertaken by public health authorities. Using the Crisis and Emergency Risk Communication (CERC) theoretical framework, the study analyzes how the performed ERC strategies during the first days of the outbreak might have contributed to the outbreak management. Methods: MERS-CoV related events were chronologically tracked, together with the relevant stories that were published in a major newspaper over the course of three distinct phases of the epidemic. The collected media stories were then assessed against the practiced emergency risk communication (ERC) activities during the same time frame. Results: The Crisis &amp; Emergency Risk Communication (CERC) framework was partially ...","","Importance: To predict the diagnosed COVID-19 patients and the trend of the epidemic in China. It may give the public some scientific information to ease the fear of the epidemic. Objective: In December 2019, pneumonia infected with the novel coronavirus burst in Wuhan, China. We aimed to use a mathematical model to predict number of diagnosed patients in future to ease anxiety on the emergent situation. Design: According to all diagnosis number from WHO website and combining with the transmission mode of infectious diseases, the mathematical model was fitted to predict future trend of outbreak. Setting: Our model was based on the epidemic situation in China, which could provide referential significance for disease prediction in other countries, and provide clues for prevention and intervention of relevant health authorities. Participants: In this retrospective, all diagnosis number from Jan 21 to Feb 10, 2020 reported from China was included and downloaded from WHO website. Main Outco...","Background: Since the new coronavirus epidemic in China in December 2019, information and discussions about COVID-19 have spread rapidly on the Internet and have quickly become the focus of worldwide attention, especially on social media. Objective: This study aims to investigate and analyze the public's attention to COVID-19-related events in China at the beginning of the COVID-19 epidemic in China (December 31, 2019, to February 20, 2020) through the Sina Microblog hot search list. Methods: We collected topics related to the COVID-19 epidemic on the Sina Microblog hot search list from December 31, 2019, to February 20, 2020 and described the trend of public attention on COVID-19 epidemic-related topics. ROST CM6.0 (ROST Content Mining System Version 6.0) was used to analyze the collected text for word segmentation, word frequency, and sentiment analysis. We further described the hot topic keywords and sentiment trends of public attention. We used VOSviewer to implement a visual clust...","This year marks the 15th anniversary of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in Canada and the 100th anniversary of the 1918 Spanish influenza pandemic. These, and other recent public health events, provide an opportunity for us to review and reflect on the evolution of Canada\u2019s public health emergency response over the past 15 years\u2014from SARS, to the 2009 H1N1 pandemic influenza, to Ebola virus and Zika virus disease. Key lessons have been learned and milestones achieved that have shaped and sharpened our response approach and structures. While SARS was a wake-up-call to strengthen infection prevention and control capacity in health care settings and led to the formation of the Public Health Agency of Canada, it also strengthened our Federal/Provincial/Territorial (FPT) senior-level governance and led to agreements for pan-Canadian mutual aid and infectious disease information sharing. As well, our collective public health laboratory capacity has been strengthened through ongoing ...","Abstract Infectious diseases continue to plague mankind and evolve to keep pace with the efforts to control them. Sir William Osler captured the ongoing fear of infectious pathogens when he said, \u201cHumanity has but three great enemies: fever, famine, and war; of these by far the greatest, by far the most terrible, is fever.\u201d Despite the significant impact of antimicrobials and vaccines on public health, there has only been one major human pathogen eradicated\u2014variola virus, the agent of smallpox. In its place have been a series of new and reemerging microbes responsible for isolated infections, regional outbreaks, and global pandemics. Bacterial, fungal, and parasitic pathogens have the capacity to cause widespread epidemics such as the \u201cBlack Death\u201d caused by Yersinia pestis in 14th century Europe. However, bacteria, fungi, and parasites are less likely to cause widespread human pandemics at this point in history and are less amenable to vaccine strategies than viral diseases. Focusing ...","The 2019-2020 influenza sentinel surveillance data exhibits unexpected trends. Typical influenza seasons have a small herald wave, followed by a decrease due to school closure during holidays, and then a main post-holiday peak that is significantly larger than the pre-holiday wave. During the 2019-2020 influenza season, influenza-like illness data in the United States appears to have a markedly lower main epidemic peak compared to what would be expected based on the pre-holiday peak. We hypothesize that the 2019-2020 influenza season does have a lower than expected burden and that this deflation is due to a behavioral or ecological interaction with COVID-19. We apply an intervention analysis to assess if this influenza season deviates from expectations, then we compare multiple hypothesized drivers of the decrease in influenza in a spatiotemporal regression model. Lastly, we develop a mechanistic metapopulation model, incorporating transmission reduction that scales with COVID-19 risk ...","ABSTRACT SARS-CoV-2, the novel coronavirus from China, is spreading around the world, causing a huge reaction despite its current low incidence outside China and the Far East. Four common coronaviruses are in current circulation and cause millions of cases worldwide. This article compares the incidence and mortality rates of these four common coronaviruses with those of SARS-COV-2 in Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries. It is concluded that the problem of SARS-CoV-2 is probably being overestimated, as 2.6 million people die of respiratory infections each year compared with less than 4000 deaths for SARS-CoV-2 at the time of writing.","Abstract SARS is a new infection in human. Patients recovering from SARS had palpitation in the form of sinus tachycardia. This study to identify the possible causes for the tachycardia excluded active disease, thyroid dysfunction, haematological, cardiac, autonomic and significant pulmonary defect at 2 months from onset of disease. The symptomatology was attributed to physical deconditioning and anxiety state. Physical and psychological fitness should be restored with rehabilitation.","Advanced age often is associated with functional and immunologic decline and chronic cardiopulmonary diseases that predispose to pneumonia when viral infection occurs. Influenza virus remains the primary viral pathogen in the elderly, although the impact of the other respiratory viruses remains to be defined. The clinical syndromes associated with respiratory viruses frequently are indistinguishable from one another or bacterial pathogens; often, viral illness in older adults exacerbates underlying conditions, complicating diagnosis. Antiviral therapy is available for influenza A and B; specific viral diagnosis, particularly with the use of rapid antigen detection, may be useful for clinical management. Treatment for other viruses primarily is supportive.","Influenza-like illness (ILI) accounts for a large burden of annual morbidity and mortality worldwide. A finer-grained knowledge of the parameters and dynamics of the viruses commonly underlying ILI is needed for modeling, diagnostic, and intervention efforts. We conducted an extensive literature review for epidemiological parameter values for influenza, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), rhinovirus, human coronavirus (HCoV), and adenovirus. We also developed a deterministic SEIR model for ILI, and derived an expression for R0. We here report ranges and means for parameters for these five common viruses.","Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), a highly lethal respiratory disease caused by a novel coronavirus (MERS-CoV), is an emerging disease with high potential for epidemic spread. It has been listed by the WHO and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) as an important target for vaccine development. While initially the majority of MERS cases were hospital acquired, continued emergence of MERS is attributed to community acquisition, with camels likely being the direct or indirect source. However, the majority of patients do not describe camel exposure, making the route of transmission unclear. Here, using sensitive immunological assays and a cohort of camel workers (CWs) with well-documented camel exposure, we show that approximately 50% of camel workers (CWs) in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) and 0% of controls were previously infected. We obtained blood samples from 30 camel herders, truck drivers, and handlers with well-documented camel exposure and from hea...","Abstract Background : A novel form of Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) in Wuhan has created a confused and rapidly evolving situation. In this situational framework, patients and front-line healthcare workers are vulnerable. Method : Studies were identified using large-circulation international journals found in two electronic databases: Scopus and Embase. Results : Populations of patients that may require tailored interventions are older adults and international migrant workers. Older adults with psychiatric conditions may be experiencing further distress. The COVID-19 epidemic has underscored potential gaps in mental health services during emergencies. Conclusions : Most health professionals working in isolation units and hospitals do not receive any training for providing mental health care. Fear seems more certainly a consequence of mass quarantine.","Social distancing is an effective way to contain the spread of a contagious disease, particularly when pharmacological interventions are not available. Conventional wisdom suggests that social distancing measures should be introduced as soon as possible after the beginning of an outbreak. Using a simple epidemiological model we show, however, that there is in fact an optimal time to initiate a temporal social distancing intervention if the goal is to reduce the final epidemic size or flatten the epidemic curve. The optimal timing depends strongly on the effective reproduction number (R0) of the disease, such that as the R0 increases, the optimal time decreases non-linearly. Additionally, if pharmacological interventions (e.g., a vaccine) become available at some point during the epidemic, the sooner these interventions become available the sooner social distancing should be initiated to maximize its effectiveness. Although based on a simple model, we hope that these insights inspire fu...","","Sarcoidosis is a granulomatous disease of unknown etiology, characterized by a Th1 immunophenotype, most commonly involving the lung, skin, lymph node and eyes. Molecular and immunologic studies continue to strengthen the association of sarcoidosis with infectious antigens, particularly those derived from Propionibacterium and Mycobacterium species. Independent studies report the presence of microbial nucleic acids and proteins within sarcoidosis specimens. Complementary immunologic studies also support the role of infectious agents in sarcoidosis pathogenesis. Th-1 immune responses directed against mycobacterial virulence factors have been detected within sarcoidosis diagnostic bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). Th1 and Th17 immune responses against propionibacteria have also been reported. More recently, case reports and clinical trials from Japanese, European and American investigators have emerged regarding the efficacy of antimicrobials against Propionibacterium and Mycobacterium speci...","COVID-19 is a complex disease phenotype where the underlying microbiome could influence morbidity and mortality. Amplicon and metagenomic MinION based sequencing was used to rapidly (within 8 hours) identify SARS-CoV-2 and assess the microbiome in nasopharyngeal swabs obtained from patients with COVID-19 by the ISARIC 4C consortium.","Abstract Background Patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019(COVID-19) will experience high levels of anxiety and low sleep quality due to isolation treatment. Some sleep-improving drugs may inhibit the respiratory system and worsen the condition. Prolonged bedside instruction may increase the risk of medical infections. Objective To investigate the effect of progressive muscle relaxation on anxiety and sleep quality of COVID-19. Methods In this randomized controlled clinical trial, a total of 51 patients who entered the isolation ward were included in the study and randomly divided into experimental and control groups. The experimental group used progressive muscle relaxation (PMR) technology for 30 min per day for 5 consecutive days. During this period, the control group received only routine care and treatment. Before and after the intervention, the Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Scale (STAI) and Sleep State Self-Rating Scale (SRSS) were used to measure and record patient anxiety and...","The pace of pathogen discovery is increasing dramatically. This reflects not only factors that enable the appearance and globalization of new microbial infections but also improvements in methods for ascertainment. New molecular diagnostic platforms; investments in pathogen surveillance in wildlife, domestic animals and humans; and the advent of social media tools that mine the world wide web for clues to outbreaks of infectious disease are proving invaluable in early recognition of threats to public health. Additionally, models of microbial pathogenesis are becoming more complex, providing insights into the mechanisms by which microorganisms can contribute to chronic illnesses like cancer, peptic ulcer disease and mental illness. Here we review the contributions of each of these elements to infectious disease emergence and strategies for addressing the challenges of pathogen surveillance and discovery.","Objective: To investigate psychological and behavioral responses to the threat of SARS-CoV-2 infections and their associations with public perceptions in China Design: Cross sectional population-based telephone survey via random digital dialing between 1 and 10 February, 2020 Setting: Wuhan (the epicentre and quarantined city), and Shanghai (a typical major city with close transportation link with Wuhan) Participants: Random sample of 510 residents in Wuhan and 501 residents in Shanghai aged above 18 Main outcome measures: Anxiety (measured by the 7-item generalized anxiety disorder [GAD-7] scale), recommended and avoidance behaviors (engaged in all six behaviors such as increasing surface cleaning and reducing going out). Results: The prevalence rates of moderate or severe anxiety (score \u226510 on GAD-7) were 32.7% (n=167) among Wuhan participants and 20.4% (n=102) among Shanghai participants. 78.6% (n=401) of Wuhan participants and 63.9% (n=320) of Shanghai participants had carried out ...","","Background: During the first week of March, the surge of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases reached over 100 countries with more than 100,000 cases. Healthcare authorities have already initiated awareness and preparedness activities beyond borders. A poor understanding of the disease among healthcare workers (HCWs) may result in delayed treatment and the rapid spread of infection. This study aimed to investigate the knowledge and perceptions of HCWs about COVID-19. Methods: A cross-sectional, web-based study was conducted among HCWs about COVID-19 during the first week of March 2020. A 23-item survey instrument was developed and distributed randomly to HCWs using social media; it required 5 minutes to complete. A chi-square test was used to investigate the level of association among variables at the significance level of p&lt;0.05. Results: Of 529 participants, a total of 453 HCWs completed the survey (response rate: 85.6%); 51.6% were males, 32.1% were aged 25-34 years, and most w...","BACKGROUND: The outbreak of COVID-19 has laid unprecedented psychological stress on health workers (HWs). We aimed to assess the immediate psychological impact on HWs at Tongji Hospital in Wuhan, China. METHODS: We conducted a single-center, cross-sectional survey of HWs via online questionnaires between February 8th and 10th, 2020. We evaluated stress, depression and anxiety by Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R), Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), and Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item (GAD-7), respectively. We also designed a questionnaire to assess the effect of psychological protective measures taken by Tongji Hospital. Multivariate logistic regression was used to identify predictors of acute stress, depression, and anxiety. RESULTS: We received 5062 completed questionnaires (response rate, 77.1 percent). 1509 (29.8 percent), 681 (13.5 percent) and 1218 (24.1 percent) HWs reported stress, depression and anxiety symptoms. Women (hazard ratio[HR], 1.31; P=0.032), years of wo...","Importance: As with other traumatic events, pandemics such as coronavirus-19 (COVID-19) may precipitate or exacerbate psychiatric symptoms such as anxiety and depression, while potentially interfering with health systems' capacity to treat such symptoms. Objective: To quantify the impact of increasing COVID-19 infection on extent of psychiatric assessment across 5 Eastern Massachusetts hospitals. Design: In silico cohort using narrative clinical notes generated between 1/2/2020 and 3/25/2020 Setting: Emergency department and outpatient settings from 2 academic medical centers and 3 community hospitals Participants: All individuals age 13 and older presenting to emergency department or outpatient clinics Main Outcome or Measure: Documentation of psychiatric symptoms reflecting depression, anxiety, psychosis, or suicide, and documentation of violence, was drawn from previously-validated term lists.

A recent study of 138 hospitalized COVID-19 patients shows that SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted from person to person through droplets and hand contact during an incubation period as well as on acute attack[2]. The closer we are to the truth, the farther we are from fear or panic. We think that open and transparent information on the outbreak to the public in China and the world, and administrative warning from authorities in every country are necessary to reduce fear and discrimination[34]. The health authorities should make the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic and essential preventive measures to the public in China and the world openly and transparently in time through radio, television, newspaper, WeChat, and the internet, i.e. washing hands and wearing a mask. A 24-h free hotline 7 d a week should be set up for public to respond to all the questions and concerns, relive the worries and panic, and clear the rumor or misinformation. The public hospitals should open COVID-19 clinics and mental health clinics to consult with people to clear panic and misinformation.","However, discrimination and prejudice driven by fear or misinformation have been flowing within and outside China[19,25-31], triggering panic and jeopardizing the response efforts of health workers and health authorities[25,32]. Importantly, discrimination, prejudice, and stigma make sick people reluctant to get medical help[19]. Nurses are prevented from accessing the areas where their rented houses are located[33]. This should be stopped[23,29].","globally with at least 12,000 confirmed deaths so far in 151 countries (WHO Situation Report). The numbers of those affected are rising and as countries start reporting fresh cases every day, there is widespread panic and anxiety related to an unknown illness. Even though the mortality rate is far lesser than its earlier congeners Sudden Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), this is not enough to allay the fear of getting affected in millions (Velavan and Meyer, 2020) . Apart from countries like China, South Korea and Iran suffering huge economic losses, there are burden of strict quarantine measures, restrictions to travel, and heavy screening and monitoring. Added to this is the plethora of misinformation circulating in the social media that add to the anxiety about the illness. Misinfodemics is the term used for misinformation contributing to the spread of illness and that is quite prevalent for COVID-19 (Gyenes and Mina, 2018) . In spite of clear guidelines by the World Health Organization (WHO) and Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), people resort to wrong methods of treatment thus neglecting the precautionary measures, contributing even more to the spread. Added to this is marginalization and stigmatization arising out of this fear of an unknown infection.","While the nature and impact of 2019-nCoV on mental health remains to be determined, there are clues in the existing literature that may help us begin to understand what to expect. Research on the psychological reactions to previous epidemics and pandemics suggests that various psychological vulnerability factors may play a role in coronaphobia, including individual difference variables such as the intolerance of uncertainty, perceived vulnerability to disease, and anxiety (worry) proneness (Taylor, 2019) . More research is needed to understand the relationship between coronaphobia and coronavirusrelated xenophobia. Research from other outbreaks of infectious disease suggests that individual difference variables such as the perceived vulnerability to disease may play a role in both coronaphobia and coronavirus-related xenophobia (Taylor, 2019) . Likewise, lack of information and misinformation, often aided by sensational popular media headlines and foci, have been shown to fuel health-related fears and phobias (Taylor &amp; Asmundson, 2004) . These factors may also play a significant role in coronophobia.","Similarly, misinformation was widespread during the early years of the HIV epidemic. It too was plagued by conspiracy theories, rumours, and misinformation for many years, with the effects still visible in regions to this day. Many people continue to argue that HIV does not exist, or cause AIDS, and that its therapies are toxic to human health. All the arguments proposed by these deniers have been rebuked through a multitude of scientific publications and debate. Yet, they continue to persist. The influence of these false arguments can be so infectious that it can influence governmental policy, which has the potential to be fatal. This was particularly highlighted by the Mbeki South African government\u2019s denialism of HIV in the early 2000s and their infamous rejection of the evidence surrounding the efficacy of HIV medication. In turn, thousands of mothers were denied access to antiretroviral therapies. Instead, the government promoted the unsubstantiated use of herbal remedies including garlic, beetroot, and lemon juice for AIDS treatment [2], leading to unnecessary HIV transmission, especially to children from pregnant mothers. This costs more than 300,000 lives [3]. It is important that we learn from past mistakes, and the media has a large role to play in this. It seems in a bid to increase viewership, major media organisations are creating dramatic headlines but are instead inciting panic amongst the public. Whilst healthcare professionals are still learning about the virus, the media has already begun to speculate about the potential health impact that the virus can have, and by publishing the potential worst effects of the virus, it only serves to fuel panic amongst the general public.","Stigma and discrimination are more harmful than the SARS-CoV-2 itself for our global efforts to control the outbreak. As WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said, \"This is a time for facts, not fear. This is the time for science, not rumors. This is the time for solidarity, not stigma. This outbreak is a test of solidarity - political, financial and scientific. We need to come together to fight a common enemy that does not respect borders\"[23].","This type of information is inaccurate and unreliable but the distributer of that information disseminates it inadvertently and pays little attention to the effects of this information on the society (2). In the Coronavirus crisis, bad news that was spread through online social networks such as WhatsApp, Telegram, etc. regarding the number of infected and dead people increased the fear and anxiety among people. However, if this kind of news is produced and distributed on purpose, it is no longer called misinformation; it is named disinformation because the producer(s) pursued inhumane purposes.","Attempts to control the epidemic have involved isolation and quarantine, lockdown of an entire city, cancellation of flights, and evacuation of foreign nationals from Wuhan. As the World Health Organization\u2019s (WHO\u2019s) Director of Global Infectious Hazard Preparedness Sylvie Briand said, \"Fear and stigma go together and when people fear, they tend to stigmatize some groups and what we try to do is to reduce this fear\"[34].","Likewise, government authorities in every country should cooperate with China to oppose stigma, language abuse and discrimination caused by the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic and strictly abide by disciplines and laws stress that our enemy is SARS-CoV-2 rather than the fear and stigma.","There are several ways in which high health anxiety may influence behavioural responses to the belief of being infected. On the one hand, some people with high health anxiety may regard hospitals and doctor's offices as a source of contagion and, therefore, avoid seeking medical assistance. On the other hand, other people with high health anxiety tend to seek out health-related information and reassurance, often from doctors. As such, they may visit multiple doctors or even attend hospital emergency rooms in their pursuit of reassurance that their bodily sensations and changes are not due to infection. This behaviour, if it occurs, would add undue burden to health care resources. This was evident during the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic, where the surge of patients on hospitals occurred even when the outbreak was only a rumor. At the time in the state of Utah, for example, there was heightened public concern about influenza but little actual disease prevalence; however, emergency room departments experienced substantial surges in patient volumes, with the volumes comparable to the increases experienced when the disease actually reached the state (McDonnell, Nelson, &amp; Schunk, 2012) . Most of the surge was due to pediatric visits. Young children frequently contract diseases with flulike features (e.g., fever, cough, congestion), which were likely misinterpreted by their parents as possible signs of pandemic influenza. A recent article in the Journal of the American Medical Association highlights the need for hospital and medical clinic preparedness so that that concerns regarding COVID-19 do negatively impact normal medical care or compound its direct morbidity and mortality (Adalja, Toner, &amp; Inglesby, 2020) .","Reporting of the situation in real-time from the public on social media could lead to more accurate collating of information by the media. However, the rapid pace of developments, increasing case detection rates, along with increasing diversity of information mean it has become increasingly difficult for the media to assimilate and make meaningful interpretations from this information source. Moreover, the volume of information being reported to and by global public health authorities exceeds the capacity to collate and analyse it, or to cross-reference and verify with other data received. This inability to validate information can fuel speculation, and thereby lead to media and public concern.","Social media, in addition to being a tool to release and track official outbreak information [38], offers a new opportunity for public health practitioners to understand social and behavioral barriers to infection control, to identify misinformation and emerging rumors [39], and to better understand the sentiments and risk perception associated with outbreaks and preventive and control measures [13]. In turn, these will help facilitate better health communication between public health agencies and the society at large, as well as among citizens themselves.","The ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak is giving rise to worldwide anxieties, rumours, and online misinformation. But it offers an opportunity to put into practice some lessons learned in studies of social media during epidemics, particularly with respect to the dynamics of online heroisation and blame. Epidemics such as the H1N1 influenza pandemic, severe acute respiratory syndrome, and Ebola take place in a complex world, with many disasters (human-caused and natural) and a host of social, cultural, economic, political, and religious concerns. Responding to such concerns is not usually part of public health approaches to epidemic communications, which emphasise biomedical and epidemiological information.","The ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak is giving rise to worldwide anxieties, rumours, and online misinformation. But it offers an opportunity to put into practice some lessons learned in studies of social media during epidemics, particularly with respect to the dynamics of online heroisation and blame.","Definitions There are four main types of phobia: \u25a0 Claustrophobiafear of closed spaces, is probably the most common phobic disorder \u25a0 Agoraphobia -fear of being in public places from which escape might be difficult or help unavailable \u25a0 Social phobia -overwhelming anxiety and excessive self-consciousness in normal social situations \u25a0 Simple, or specific phobias (phobic neurosis) -a morbid irrational fear, or anxiety out of all proportion to the threat: \u2022 phobic neuroses differ from anxiety neuroses in that the phobic anxiety arises only in specific circumstances, whereas patients with anxiety neuroses are generally anxious \u2022 common specific phobias are centred on heights, tunnels, driving, water, flying, insects, dogs, injuries involving blood, and dental procedures \u2022 dental 'phobia' is more extreme than straightforward anxiety and is characterised by avoidance behaviour -previous frightening dental experiences are often the major factor in its development.","China's final approach to penetrate Taiwanese society is \"magnifying.\" Similar to the misinformation approach, magnifying is also a strategy of using media to create disinformation to manipulate Taiwanese public opinion, a case of China's sharp power. However, the two approaches have different missions and tactics. The goal of the misinformation approach is to delegitimize Taiwan's democratic institutions and values. Hence, misinformation regularly relies on fake news to amplify existing divisions, instigate social conflicts, trigger political instability, and sabotage public trust and confidence in the Taiwanese government. In contrast, magnifying is designed to propagate the China model, glorify the \"Chinese Dream,\" and preach the necessity of reunification of Taiwan and China. Therefore, the magnifying approach adopts media propaganda that exalts the success of China's development, highlights China's cultural significance, praises China's contribution to the world, and advocates the benefit and the inevitability of joining China's sphere of influence.","The rise in popularity of social media has been a source of panic, spreading immense anxiety and fear as people voice their experiences, concerns and opinions. It has also been a source of information to many in places where information has been limited or complicated. Accurate information as it becomes available is vital in reducing the confusion caused by the fear-based rhetoric. Untangling fear-based rhetoric from the truth is something as midwives we do daily. As always, we need to respond with sensitivity and compassion and not get swept up by this disempowering rhetoric. Rather than fear, the focus on providing accurate, and factual information from reliable sources is paramount. Our focus needs to be on eliminating discrimination and the racial undertones that further isolate and increase risk for those most vulnerable. The fluid nature of this emergency is unprecedented in our time and requires us all to come together in solidarity.","The media should focus on having altruistic intentions and develop dialogue with the appropriate authorities to protect global health security through effective amiable partnerships. They should highlight vaccine development efforts as well as educational and public health measures that are being put in place to prevent the spread of infection. Although there are many things to still learn regarding how best to respond to disease outbreaks of this nature, 7 there are also several positives, such as diagnostics tests being developed within 2 weeks and rolled out globally or the rapid garnering of financial support for vaccine development, which should perhaps be in the headlines, to fuel reassurance rather than fear.","An area of little exploration has been air travel stress and anxiety. 35 Whereas typical issues such as fear of flying have been addressed by the airlines in the past, problems that have surfaced related to terrorism and airline security have increased. Passenger lines, terminal crowding, lesser personal services due to cost-cutting, etc. have taken a toll on the ease in which air travel is currently perceived. Addressing these potential problems with the air traveler, particularly with those who have any underlying illness or general anxiety, is helpful.","Although the COVID-19 outbreak caused by SARS-CoV-2 started in Wuhan, China, it is now a global public health issue rather than a Chinese issue. As global community, we need solidarity instead of stigma or discrimination to contain the spread of SARS-CoV-2 outbreak. An open and transparent information on the outbreak to the global public, and administrative warning from authorities in every country are necessary to reduce fear and discrimination.","This lack of operational transparency fed rumors, speculation and misinformation which were amplified by the media; furthermore, it invoked international fear and, in some cases resulted in inappropriate courses of action being followed. Rather than maintaining stability, this approach had the opposite effect [8]. To the credit of the Chinese government, through much introspection, considerable reform to the public health system was made, including: the development of public health legislation and regulations to improve government response; and transformation of the Sanitation and Anti-epidemic Stations into Centers for Disease Control and Prevention with dramatically improved infrastructure and technical capabilities. The SARS epidemic lead to a revolution in China's approach to infectious disease surveillance and response. Emphasis was shifted back to \u201cPrevention First\u201d and the utility of this approach improved China's handling of a number of subsequent EID events, including: H5N1 avian influenza, Streptococcus suis infections, severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome virus, and the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic. Despite the shift in approach, there were still concerns; the Chinese Government appeared to conceal cases during the 2004 H5N1 outbreak and criticized publications that indicated otherwise [9].","Infections can create a range of behavioural and psychological effects. Patients can be informed about common stress responses like insomnia, panic attacks, health-anxiety, fear of illness or increase in substance use. Children and adolescents might show varied emotional responses like irritability, isolation or aggression which can be misinterpreted as 'regressive' behaviours. It is important to inform the public about general measures of countering stress like sleep hygiene, activity scheduling, exercising, social connections, avoiding social media forwards and relaxation techniques. Also, they need to be made aware about the sources and sites of help available.","In a world of polarising distrust and trade tensions, the spread of coronavirus disease 2019 , both within nations and internationally, is aided and abetted by misinformation that circumnavigates the planet in microseconds. Such misinformation is not all malevolent, although its impact can be devastating. The only bastion of defence against rising public panic, financial market hysteria, and unintended mis understandings of the science and epidemiology of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is agile, accurate, worldwide-available counter-information that takes the high moral ground and conveys a consistently science-driven narrative. Some have sought to limit misinformation about COVID-19 on social media by pressuring corporations, such as Facebook, Weibo, and Twitter, to censor bad actors-an approach that has not stopped conspiracy theorists, trolls, and liars.","Patients with confirmed or suspected 2019-nCoV may experience fear of the consequences of infection with a potentially fatal new virus, and those in quarantine might experience boredom, loneliness, and anger. Furthermore, symptoms of the infection, such as fever, hypoxia, and cough, as well as adverse effects of treatment, such as insomnia caused by corticosteroids, could lead to worsening anxiety and mental distress. 2019-nCoV has been repeatedly described as a killer virus, for example on WeChat, which has perpetuated the sense of danger and uncertainty among health workers and the public. In the early phase of the SARS outbreak, a range of psychiatric morbidities, including persistent depression, anxiety, panic attacks, psychomotor excitement, psychotic symptoms, delirium, and even suicidality, were reported. 6, 7 Mandatory contact tracing and 14 days quarantine, which form part of the public health responses to the 2019-nCoV pneumonia outbreak, could increase patients' anxiety and guilt about the effects of contagion, quarantine, and stigma on their families and friends.","Patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 mostly experience great fear of the highly contagious and even fatal disease, and quarantined people also experience boredom, loneliness, and anger. Furthermore, symptoms of the infection such as fever, hypoxia, and cough as well as adverse effects of the treatments such as insomnia caused by corticosteroids can lead to more anxiety and mental distress. In the early phase of the SARS outbreak, a range of psychiatric morbidities including persistent depression, anxiety, panic attacks, psychomotor excitement, psychotic symptoms, delirium, and even suicidality were reported 89,90. Mandatory contact tracing and quarantine, as a part of the public health responses to the COVID-19 outbreak, can make people more anxious and guilty about the effects of the contagion, quarantine, and stigma on their families and friends 66.","It is noteworthy that despite the common mental health problems and disorders found among patients and health workers in such settings, most health professionals working in isolation units and hospitals do not receive any training for providing mental health care . Barbisch et al. (2015) describe how the confinement \"caused a sense of collective hysteria, leading the staff to desperate measures.\" Fear seems more certainly a consequence of mass quarantine. Anxiety within Wuhan is to be expected even without being in quarantine. During disease outbreaks, community anxiety can rise following the first death, increased media reporting, and an escalating number of new cases. Thus, mass quarantine is likely to raise anxiety substantially, for multiple reasons. Elevated anxiety may also have knock-on implications for other health measures (Rubin and Wessely, 2020) .","In China, 173 million people are living with mental health disorders, 1 and neglect and stigma regarding these conditions still prevail in society. 2 When epidemics arise, people with mental health disorders are generally more susceptible to infections for several reasons. First, mental health disorders can increase the risk of infections, including pneumonia. 3 One report released on Feb 9, 2020, discussing a cluster of 50 cases of COVID-19 among inpatients in one psychiatric hospital in Wuhan, China, has raised concerns over the role of mental disorders in coronavirus transmission. 4 Possible explanations include cognitive impairment, little awareness of risk, and diminished efforts regarding personal protection in patients, as well as confined conditions in psychiatric wards. Second, once infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2-which results in COVID-19-people with mental disorders can be exposed to more barriers in accessing timely health services, because of discrimination associated with mental ill-health in health-care settings. Additionally, mental health disorder comorbidities to COVID-19 will make the treatment more challenging and potentially less effective. 5 Third, the COVID-19 epidemic has caused a parallel epidemic of fear, anxiety, and depression. People with mental health conditions could be more substantially influenced by the emotional responses brought on by the COVID-19 epidemic, resulting in relapses or worsening of an already existing mental health condition because of high susceptibility to stress compared with the general population. Finally, many people with mental health disorders attend regular outpatient visits for evaluations and prescriptions. However, nationwide regulations on travel and quarantine have resulted in these regular visits becoming more difficult and impractical to attend.","For most of the first three months of the epidemic, much of the response was driven by \"fear, stigma, or discrimination\" (Ren 2020) , including naming SARS-CoV-2 the \"China virus\" (Rogers 2020) , despite the fact that seasonal respiratory zoonotic pathogens typically originate in China, where lifeanimal markets provide chances for animal viruses to transmit to humans. (Malik 2020) After three months, enough data are available to discuss important epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 and the potential impact of interventions. In particular, we have now seen the number of new cases (and deaths) to decline in China and South Korea and to at least stabilize in some European countries. Changes in number of deaths follow the changes in number cases (albeit at a lower level) by about two weeks. Hence, we can discuss both the infectiousness and the lethality of the virus, two important characteristics to assess public health impact of the disease.","Searching for someone to blame is part of the process of making sense of any disaster, akin to the phenomenon of moral panic. 5 Conspiracy theories and misinformation are already circulating in traditional and social media about COVID-19. 6, 7 Thus, it is important to track the evolving dynamics of blame in real time, both to correct inaccurate information and to respond to online scapegoating.","Searching for someone to blame is part of the process of making sense of any disaster, akin to the phenomenon of moral panic. 5 Conspiracy theories and misinformation are already circulating in traditional and social media about COVID-19. 6, 7 Thus, it is important to track the evolving dynamics of blame in real time, both to correct inaccurate information and to respond to online scapegoating.","For the past 10 years, I have been working with large datasets that might be relevant to public health and epidemiology, from Google searches and social-media sentiment to weather conditions. More recently, I started to study a different type of contagion: how cognitive biases can be exploited by online platforms to make us even more susceptible to \u2018misinformation viruses\u2019. The current outbreak enables us to bring them together.","In this era of smartphone and their accompanying applications, the authorities are required to combat not only the epidemic per se, but perhaps an even more sinister outbreak of fake news and false rumours, a socalled infodemic. The most obvious consequences of an infodemic are, at best, a noisy cacophony that confuses and can provoke irrational fear, even mass panic, and ultimately imposes a destabilising effect on society when precisely the opposite is required. The images of empty supermarket shelves in the most open free-trade economies of Singapore and Hong Kong, where fewer than 100 cases have been reported to date, provide a salutary reminder of the potential impact of such infodemics. Another example is the worldwide shortage of and some national export bans on face masks. Creating a resource such as Sun and colleagues have compiled in their work would allow scientists and lay observers alike to quickly fill knowledge vacuums that would otherwise fuel infodemics.","In this era of smartphone and their accompanying applications, the authorities are required to combat not only the epidemic per se, but perhaps an even more sinister outbreak of fake news and false rumours, a socalled infodemic.

We stand together to strongly condemn conspiracy theories suggesting that COVID-19 does not have a natural origin. Scientists from multiple countries have published and analysed genomes of the causative agent, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), 1 and they overwhelmingly conclude that this coronavirus originated in wildlife, 2-10 as have so many other emerging pathogens. 11,12 This is further supported by a letter from the presidents of the US National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine 13 and by the scientific communities they represent. Conspiracy theories do nothing but create fear, rumours, and prejudice that jeopardise our global collaboration in the fight against this virus. We support the call from the Director-General of WHO to promote scientific evidence and unity over misinformation and conjecture. 14 We want you, the science and health professionals of China, to know that we stand with you in your fight against this virus.","Heath anxiety occurs when perceived bodily sensations or changes, including but not limited to those related to infectious diseases (e.g., fever, coughing, aching muscles), are interpreted as symptoms of being ill (Asmundson, Abramowitz, Richter, &amp; Whedon, 2010; Taylor &amp; Asmundson, 2004) . Almost everyone experiences health anxiety to some degree, and the associated vigilance to potential health-related threat can be protective, helping identify early signs of health issues that prompt health-promoting behavior. But, when excessive, health anxiety can be detrimental. As illustrated by Kosic, Lindholm, Jarvholm, Hedman-Lagerlof, and Axelsson (2020) in this volume, high levels of health anxiety are becoming increasingly common and, given that high health anxiety is known to manifest following exposure to disease-related popular media (Asmundson et al., 2010) , of which there is no current shortage with COVID-19, levels around the world and particularly in areas reporting confirmed cases are likely to be on the rise.","A principal lesson learned from the Beijing experience is the importance of rapid response to SARS. Early detection of patients and prompt isolation can limit transmission, and adherence to personal and administrative infection control measures can reduce opportunities for transmission within healthcare facilities. The resources needed to respond to simultaneous outbreaks in multiple hospitals and address community transmission are much greater than those required for individual case investigation or management. Communities seeking to prepare for SARS must be alert to the speed with which one imported case can lead to dozens or hundreds of transmission chains. Thus a strong system of early detection and open communication will facilitate prompt recognition of possible problems and immediate response measures. Addressing community concerns, including fear of attending fever clinics or stigma associated with having one\u2019s neighborhood quarantined, should be an important component of planning efforts.","Finally, stigma can negatively affect both the emotional and mental health of infected individuals. The CDC has acknowledged that stopping stigma is vital to make community members resilient and that everyone can help to stop the spread of stigma related to COVID-19. Pharmacists can play a role in this by promoting an empathy culture and helping to prevent the stigmatisation of infected individuals based on ethnicity, population or nationality by broadcasting facts in their communities via various media. In this way, they can protect COVID-19-infected individuals from social avoidance or rejection, and/or being denied healthcare, education, housing or employment, and/or even physical violence. 14 ","Although institutions aim to protect and safeguard their HCWs against communicable diseases, success is not always attainable without a culture of vigilance. The approval by executive management to implement the recommended ICP measures was primarily due to recognition of a true potential threat, and in support of recommendations by the taskforce. This prompt action and support is reflective of the mission, vision, and core values of our institution, which supports a culture of safety. Due to urgency, time for a prescheduled mock drill to test proposed interventions and make the necessary adjustments based on the results of the simulation was not possible at time of initial implementation. Changes or improvements to ICP measures occurred in real time with immediate effect. Ongoing monitoring for effectiveness occurred through observational HCW compliance monitoring, noting frequency of unprotected exposure events, and screening during outbreak investigations. Those working in our institution-especially within high-risk areas (eg, ED and ICU) observed an increased level of anxiety reflected by an increased use of masks while not performing direct patient care. In particular, in the use of high-particulate respirators. In our opinion this anxiety was as a result of rumors and misconceptions of MERS-CoV transmission and number of actual cases within our institution, documented human-to-human and animal-to-human transmission, a high mortality rate (36%) that includes HCWs, limited treatment options, and the unavailability of vaccines. 4 Communication and transparency helped to reduce levels of anxiety and rumor. Our reported MERS-CoV mortality rate of 62% is higher than that reported nationally and most likely due to the complexity and comorbidities of the patient population served in our major city tertiary care institution.","As researchers all over toil hard for an effective anti-viral and vaccine against COVID-19, the psychological impact of the illness is largely neglected. Pandemics like this, are not just a medical phenomenon; they tend to affect quality of life in an individual and as a whole, causing social dysfunction. Stigma, xenophobia, mass hysteria and panic are the common offshoots. As the global prevalence increases, people start hoarding medical supplies, isolate themselves physically, restrict social interaction and enter into a constant state of health-anxiety even over mild conditions that can mimic the illness, like common cold (Duan and Zhu, 2020) . People with mental illness are especially vulnerable to these effects, as are the health-care workers in hospitals and laboratories, the volunteers and social service personnel and those quarantined for prolonged duration. Recent literature states that even though online and at-site psychological services have been initiated in China, the lack of sensitization and training in mental health often adversely affect the performance and health outcome of the medical staff there (Chen et al., 2020) .","Based on the proposed analysis, we believe that SCH\u2019s early preparedness to the epidemic and its commitment to a proactive and open risk communication strategy, which included actions during the first days of the outbreak such as sharing of information in a timely manner with the public and domestic and international organizations, and acknowledging the uncertainty of the situation, favored the establishment of the SCH\u2019s image as a credible source of information and allowed for the quick initiation of overall response efforts and effective rumor control during the course of the outbreak. Moreover, despite that the CERC framework was only partially adopted in Qatar, this case study consolidated the validity of the framework and also emphasized the significant role of communication primarily as a public health tool for managing emergencies.","Constant exposure to the infectious agent creates apprehension of getting infected and spreading the infection to loved ones. Chronic anxiety, guilt, helplessness, isolation and insomnia can impair functioning. Having regular meals, sleep and work-breaks are vital. Constructive peer-support, supportive therapy and early mental health interventions go a long way to reduce absenteeism and improve their quality of care, both for themselves and the patients. It is also important for us to stay away from misinformation ouselves and be responsible for what we share on media platforms.","To efficiently cope with the 2019-nCoV outbreak, the Chinese Government has implemented rapid and comprehensive public health emergency interventions. To date, all of the 31 provincial-level regions in mainland China with confirmed 2019-nCoV cases have activated socalled level 1 public health emergency responses (ie, the highest level of emergency public health alerts and responses within the national public health management system). 6 The provincial governments are responsible for organising, coordinating, and handling all emergency public health treatments, disclosing information, and gathering emergency materials and facilities under the guidance of the State Council. For health-care sectors, in addition to public health interventions, dealing with public psychological barriers and performing psychological crisis intervention is included in the level 1 response. The National Health Commission has released guidelines for local authorities to promote psychological crisis intervention for patients, medical personnel, and people under medical observation during the 2019-nCoV outbreak. 7 Peking University is preparing a mental health handbook for the public that describes how to deal with stress and other psychological problems occurring due to the outbreak of 2019-nCoV. 8 The Chinese Government strives to improve the public's awareness of prevention and intervention strategies by providing daily updates about surveillance and active cases on websites and social media. Increasingly, psychologists and psychiatrists use the internet and social media (eg, WeChat, Weibo, etc) to share strategies for dealing with psychological stress. For example, experts from Peking University Sixth Hospital made six suggestions for the public to cope with mental stress. 9 These included assessing the accuracy of information disclosed, enhancing social support systems (eg, families and friends), eliminating stigma associated with the epidemic, maintaining a normal life under safe conditions, and using the psychosocial service system, particularly telephone-based and internet-based counselling for health-care staff, patients, family members, and the public. Numerous psychiatric hospitals, psychological counselling centres, and psychology departments within universities have launched specialised hotlines to provide psychological counselling services for people in need. 7 We believe that including mental health care in the national public health emergency system will empower China and the world during the campaign to contain and eradicate 2019-nCoV.","However, while transdisciplinary integration may serve well in a crisis, it does not necessarily address the systemic social and ecological drivers of EIDs. In the case of SARS, the investigation and solutions that were forged during its emergence were certainly effective in controlling disease spread, particularly in British Columbia. However, to achieve long-term control and understanding of SARS, explicit analyses of social and ecological drivers of disease (such as in-depth investigations into the health and socio-economic status of workers in game markets), or large-scale analyses of ecological drivers of diseases particular to southern China (such as the mixing of farmed game animals with poached wildlife species) must be introduced into the picture. Some attention to these less-obvious drivers of disease was paid, but, as far as we are aware, was sporadic, even among studies that were put into place long after the immediate crisis had passed.","A press release was issued by the SCH three days after the detection of a rumor saying that the SCH did not undertake appropriate efforts to support the transfer of the patient to the UK. The press release was timed for weekday release, in order to reach a larger readership, and it detailed how the SCH was monitoring the patient\u2019s condition. This action is aligned with the CERC framework recommendation of monitoring rumors and dispelling them quickly. In order to address the fears regarding the risk of spread during the Hajj season starting on 24 October, the KSA Minister of Health released a statement emphasizing that, in the regional and religious context of the evolving outbreak, the situation was not of particular concern, as the novel virus did not seem to spread easily among humans. A SCH spokesperson was interviewed regarding the preparations for the Hajj on 3 October 2012. During the interview, the spokesperson reassured the public by focusing on the following two facts: (1) seasonal flu immunization is mandatory, as per KSA health regulations for pilgrims; and that (2) the situation was being monitored through information sharing with the KSA and WHO.","An area that received so little attention was the psychological support of health care workers who came to work every day during the SARS outbreak (17) . Surely they were aware of the risk of infection, the possibility of serious morbidity and even of dying from infection transmitted in the hospital as an occupational hazard. Several studies have documented the psychiatric morbidity among health workers associated with the SARS epidemic (18) (19) (20) . Quarantined workers experienced stigma and fear (18) , stress levels were raised (19) , and feelings of extreme vulnerability, uncertainty and threat to life were perceived (20) .","People might resist or be reluctant to be visited by CHWs, and they could opt out of home visits at any time, but experience with CHWs in Brazil in the past 30 years suggests this would happen rarely. 4 In Brazil, 250 000 CHWs provide a much needed and relied upon service. CHWs in Brazil have been established for many years, are well integrated into their communities, and provide a wide range of health and social care support activities to each of the 100-150 households that they are responsible for. Therefore, in Brazil, additional roles for preventing the spread of and supporting those infected with COVID-19 or in self-isolation could be integrated into the work of CHWs. Much can be learned from countries with successful experiences of radical, large-scale workforce interventions. 9 It could be argued that this is an unrealistic proposal and that adapting the existing system or training so many people is too challenging. However, current health and social care systems in the UK are under extreme pressure and could become overwhelmed. In a time of fear, isolation, and growing health inequalities, 10 use of CHWs for the COVID-19 response would boost social coherence and fill gaps that have begun to emerge between health and social care and in-person and virtual access to health care. Our proposal for CHWs would produce a large cadre of people with an understanding of basic epidemiological and public health concepts 11 who could challenge scientific misinformation and explain the rationale for specific health policies and interventions to the public. This approach would also help build a new generation of leaders who can help tackle the complex challenges of our age. ","National governments; international agencies; non-governmental organisations and charities; corporate entities; academic institutions Weakness in behavioural change guidance from national and international organisations; scarcity of sustainable leadership and financing in failed states leading to neglected or uncoordinated health systems; increasing duration and frequency of insecurity or conflict zones hindering efforts to recognise and respond to health threats; failure of countries to report disease outbreaks because of fear of economic consequences Social Travel patterns, migration, and interconnectivity; trade; technology and digital revolution, including those that affect human interaction; expansion and control of information; patterns of communication including social media; expectations and definition of expertise; social conflict and privacy","The past decade has witnessed an exponential rise in internet-based social media sites such as Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube. 118 Healthcare professionals are increasingly using social media applications to follow medical developments and emerging scientific literature and to share their own research findings, observations, and opinion. 119 The general public often uses these tools as news outlets to seek and share medical and scientific information. 120 However, in the context of MERS-CoV, social media have been a double-edged sword. For example, social media were at some point rife with inaccurate information that included rumours of hospitals closed due to MERS-CoV outbreaks and certain social events being nodes for MERS-CoV transmission. The authors are aware of examples of information and photos shared on social media resulting in patients losing their right to privacy and confidentiality. Patients often cancelled their clinic appointments or scheduled surgical procedures for fear of acquiring MERS-CoV while in hospital. Some avoided attending emergency departments despite having acute problems that required medical attention. Some individuals posted videos and messages challenging the suggestion that camels may be a source of MERS-CoV infection. Scepticism and mistrust in governmental agencies and the medical community were sometimes promoted and propagated.","Good risk communication from official organizations helps travel health providers communicate and navigate risk with their clients. Consistency with in-country guidance will help reduce uncertainty and rumor. In rapidly changing outbreak situations such as this, travel health providers must be aware of where to get the latest official guidance, and be able to direct travellers to getting relevant local ","Psychiatric morbidity is an important concern, as the virus may affect the central nervous system and provoke systemic inflammation (Arabi et al., 2015) . A recent paper reported that COVID-19 infection triggers the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including interleukin (IL)-1b and IL-6 (Conti et al., 2020) . Furthermore, psychosocial stresses imposed by societal changes in response to this epidemic viral infection may increase psychiatric problems. Over 50% of patients infected by SARS and MERS experienced psychological distress (Mark et al., 2009; Kim et al., 2018) . Although the psychological impact of COVID-19 remains unclear, infected patients may experience anxiety, depression, guilt, stigma, and anger. The emotional problems thus may reduce immunity and compromise recovery."],"title":["Fear can be more harmful than the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 in controlling the corona virus disease 2019 epidemic","Fear can be more harmful than the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 in controlling the corona virus disease 2019 epidemic","The COVID-19 outbreak: Crucial role the psychiatrists can play","Coronaphobia: Fear and the 2019-nCoV outbreak","Coronavirus: the spread of misinformation","Fear can be more harmful than the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 in controlling the corona virus disease 2019 epidemic","Information Typology in Coronavirus (COVID-19) Crisis; a Commentary","Fear can be more harmful than the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 in controlling the corona virus disease 2019 epidemic","Fear can be more harmful than the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 in controlling the corona virus disease 2019 epidemic","How health anxiety influences responses to viral outbreaks like COVID-19: What all decision-makers, health authorities, and health care professionals need to know","Toning down the 2019-nCoV media hype\u2014and restoring hope","Chinese social media reaction to the MERS-CoV and avian influenza A(H7N9) outbreaks","Tracking online heroisation and blame in epidemics","Tracking online heroisation and blame in epidemics","Chapter 3 SPECIFIC PROBLEM AREAS","Weaponized Interdependence: China's Economic Statecraft and Social Penetration against Taiwan","Midwives in a pandemic: A call for solidarity and compassion","Toning down the 2019-nCoV media hype\u2014and restoring hope","Chapter 46 Aircraft Cabin Environment","Fear can be more harmful than the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 in controlling the corona virus disease 2019 epidemic","A brief historical overview of emerging infectious disease response in China and the need for a One Health approach in future responses","The COVID-19 outbreak: Crucial role the psychiatrists can play","COVID-19: the medium is the message","Timely mental health care for the 2019 novel coronavirus outbreak is urgently needed","COVID-19: what has been learned and to be learned about the novel coronavirus disease","The emotional impact of Coronavirus 2019-nCoV (new Coronavirus disease)","Patients with mental health disorders in the COVID-19 epidemic","The first three months of the COVID-19 epidemic: Epidemiological evidence for two separate strains of SARS-CoV-2 viruses spreading and implications for prevention strategies","Tracking online heroisation and blame in epidemics","Tracking online heroisation and blame in epidemics","In the fight against the new coronavirus outbreak, we must also struggle with human bias","Crowdsourcing data to mitigate epidemics","Crowdsourcing data to mitigate epidemics","Statement in support of the scientists, public health professionals, and medical professionals of China combatting COVID-19","How health anxiety influences responses to viral outbreaks like COVID-19: What all decision-makers, health authorities, and health care professionals need to know","Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, Beijing, 2003","SARS-CoV-2 outbreak: How can pharmacists help?","Infection control and prevention practices implemented to reduce transmission risk of Middle East respiratory syndrome-coronavirus in a tertiary care institution in Saudi Arabia","The COVID-19 outbreak: Crucial role the psychiatrists can play","How Do the First Days Count?
