We evaluated the effects of travel bans in the Australia context and projected the epidemic until May 2020. Our modelling results closely align with observed cases in Australia indicating the need for maintaining or improving on the control measures to slow down the virus.","Australia implemented a travel ban on China on February 1st 2020. Partial lifting of the ban is being considered, given the decline in incidence of COVID-19 in China. We modelled three scenarios to test the impact of travel bans on epidemic control in Australia. Scenario one was no ban, scenario two was the current ban, scenario three was a partial lifting of the current ban to allow over 100,000 university students to enter Australia, but not tourists. We used disease incidence data from China and air travel passenger movements between China and Australia, derived from incoming passenger arrival cards. We estimated the true incidence of disease in China using data on expected proportion of under-ascertainment of cases. We used an age specific deterministic model divided in 18 age stratified groups to model the epidemic in each scenario. The modelled epidemic with the full ban fitted the observed incidence of cases well. The modelled epidemic of the current ban predicts 57 cases on Mar...","Background COVID-19 is leading to the implementation of social distancing policies around the world and in the United States, including school closures. The evidence that mandatory school closures reduce cases and ultimately mortality mostly comes from experience with influenza or from models that do not include the impact of school closure on the healthcare labor supply or the role of the healthcare labor force in reducing the per infection mortality from the pathogen. There is considerable uncertainty of the incremental effect of school closures on transmission and lives saved from school closures. The likely, but uncertain, benefits from school closure need to be weighed against uncertain, and seldom quantified, costs of healthcare worker absenteeism associated with additional child care obligations. Methods We analyze data from the US Current Population Survey to measure the potential child care obligations for US healthcare workers that will need to be addressed if school closures...","Background Emergency school closures are often used as public health interventions during infectious disease outbreaks in an attempt to minimise the spread of infection. However, if children continue to mix with others outside the home during the closures, these measures are unlikely to be effective. Objectives This review aimed to summarise existing literature on children's activities and contacts made outside the home during unplanned school closures. Methods We searched four databases from inception to February 2020 for relevant literature. Main findings were extracted. Results 3,343 citations were screened and 19 included in the review. Activities and social contacts appeared to decrease during closures but contact was still common. All studies reported children leaving the house or being looked after by non-household members. There was some evidence that older child age and parental disagreement with closure were predictive of children leaving the house, and mixed evidence regardi...","The spread of a novel pathogenic infectious agent eliciting protective immunity is typically characterised by three distinct phases: (I) an initial phase of slow accumulation of new infections (often undetectable), (II) a second phase of rapid growth in cases of infection, disease and death, and (III) an eventual slow down of transmission due to the depletion of susceptible individuals, typically leading to the termination of the (first) epidemic wave. Before the implementation of control measures (e.g. social distancing, travel bans, etc) and under the assumption that infection elicits protective immunity, epidemiological theory indicates that the ongoing epidemic of SARS-CoV-2 will conform to this pattern. Here, we calibrate a susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) model to data on cumulative reported SARS-CoV-2 associated deaths from the United Kingdom (UK) and Italy under the assumption that such deaths are well reported events that occur only in a vulnerable fraction of the populati...","Background: Controlling the transmission of respiratory infections such as influenza and COVID-19 is a critical public health priority. Non-pharmaceutical intervention policies such as community quarantines, closures and travel bans are often implemented in emergencies but many of them are disruptive and difficult to maintain for extended periods of time. A promising alternative recommended by the CDC for influenza is requiring individuals showing fever symptoms to remain isolated at home until they are fever-free for at least one day, but there is limited evidence to support the effectiveness of such symptom-based isolation policies. Methods: Here we introduce a computational model of symptom-based isolation that accounts for the timing of symptoms, viral shedding and the population structure. It was validated on outbreaks of influenza in schools and modified to account for COVID-19. It was then used to estimate the outbreak curves and the attack rates (the proportion of the populatio...","Widespread, non-stop, and often sensational coverage of the coronavirus (COVID-19) has caught many governments flat-footed in efforts to protect the health and safety of their citizens. In response to the current global health event, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic. Mass gatherings present a historic challenge in protecting the health and safety of attendees. The majority of the prominent mass gatherings are religious in nature. Global sporting events, such as the Olympics and the World Cup, pose unique health risks to attendees and host nations. Deferment or cancellation of such mass gatherings may exert an extraordinary economic loss to the host nation. Universal adoption of best practices for infection control is the surest way for governments to prepare for mass gatherings. In these uncertain times, it is up to intergovernmental organizations to be the voice of reason.","During the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic, when SARS-CoV-2 was chiefly reported in the city of Wuhan, cases exported to other locations were largely predicted using flight travel data from Wuhan. However, given Wuhan's connectivity to other cities in mainland China prior to the lockdown, there has likely been a substantial risk of exportation of cases from other Chinese cities. It is likely that many of these exportations remained undetected because early international case definitions for COVID-19 required a recent travel history from Wuhan. Here, we combine estimates of prevalence in 18 Chinese cities with estimates of flight volume, accounting for the effects of travel bans and the timing of Lunar New Year, to approximate the number of cases exported from cities outside of Wuhan from early December 2019 to late February 2020. We predict that for every one case from Wuhan exported internationally, there were approximately 2.9 cases from large Chinese cities exported internation...","School closures have been enacted as a measure of mitigation during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic due to their ability to reduce transmission. It has been shown that school closures could cause absenteeism amongst healthcare workers with dependent children, but there is a need for detailed high-resolution analysis of the relationship between school closures and healthcare worker absenteeism to inform local community preparedness. We provide national- and county-level simulations of school closures and absenteeism across the United States. At the national level, we estimate the projected absenteeism rate to range from 7.5% to 8.6%, and the effectiveness of school closures to range from 172 to 218 fewer hospital beds used per 100,000 people at peak demand. At the county-level, we find substantial variations of projected absenteeism and school closure effects, ranging from 2.0% to 18.6% absenteeism and 88 to 280 fewer hospital beds used per 100,000 people at peak demand. We also find sign...","Doubling Time (DT) is typically calculated for growth curves that show exponential growth, such as the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases day by day. DT represents the time it takes before the number of COVID-19 cases, in a certain country or area, doubles. Throughout the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak, DT values are continually changing. These changes are influenced by the measures that are recommended by the health authorities and implemented by governments. After the governmental shutdowns of Nordic Countries that were announced around the 12th of March 2020, I followed the development of the DT in the region. Governments put in place measure never before experienced during peace time; home working, closed schools and kindergartens, travel bans and social distancing. But does it work? The initial set of results following the shutdown are encouraging, demonstrating a trend towards slower growth; however, this could be reversed if the measures that are in place now are abandoned too early...","Summary Increasing international travel and migration can interfere with public health in both the country of destination and back home. The revised International Health Regulations (IHR) and travel disease sentinel networks are means to protect public and individual health. Public health risks related to infectious disease are higher in mass gatherings, in travellers visiting friends and relatives and in sexual encounters away from home. In contrast, in-flight transmission of infections plays only a limited role.","Background: The rapid global spread of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is unprecedented. The outbreak has quickly spread to more than 100 countries reporting over 100,000 confirmed cases. Australia reported its first case of COVID-19 on 25th January 2020 and has since implemented travel restrictions to stop further introduction of the virus. Methods: We analysed daily global COVID-19 data published by the World Health Organisation to investigate the spread of the virus thus far. To assess the current risk of COVID-19 importation and local spread in Australia we predict international passenger flows into Australia during 2020. Findings: Our analysis of global data shows that Australia can expect a similar growth rate of reported cases as observed in France and the United States. We identify travel patterns of Australian citizens/residents and foreign travellers that can inform the implementation of new and the alteration of existing travel restrictions related to COVID-19. Interpretation...","Summary Background In December, 2019, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a novel coronavirus, emerged in Wuhan, China. Since then, the city of Wuhan has taken unprecedented measures in response to the outbreak, including extended school and workplace closures. We aimed to estimate the effects of physical distancing measures on the progression of the COVID-19 epidemic, hoping to provide some insights for the rest of the world. Methods To examine how changes in population mixing have affected outbreak progression in Wuhan, we used synthetic location-specific contact patterns in Wuhan and adapted these in the presence of school closures, extended workplace closures, and a reduction in mixing in the general community. Using these matrices and the latest estimates of the epidemiological parameters of the Wuhan outbreak, we simulated the ongoing trajectory of an outbreak in Wuhan using an age-structured susceptible-exposed-infected-removed (SEIR) model for several ...","Background Many countries have banned groups and gatherings as part of their response to the pandemic caused by the coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2. Although there are outbreak reports involving mass gatherings, the contribution to overall transmission is unknown. Methods We used data from a survey of social contact behaviour that specifically asked about contact with groups to estimate the Population Attributable Fraction (PAF) due to groups as the relative change in the Basic Reproduction Number when groups are prevented. Findings We estimate that PAF due to groups of 50+ people is 2.2% (95%CI 1.1%, 3.6%); the PAF due to groups of 20+ people is 6.4% (5.0%, 8.0%); the PAF due to groups of 10+ is 11.3% (9.9%, 13.0%) Interpretation Large groups of individuals have a small epidemiological impact; small and medium sized groups between 10 and 50 people have a larger impact on an epidemic.","Social distancing policies are critical but economically painful measures to flatten the curve against emergent infectious diseases. As the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19 spread throughout the United States in early 2020, the federal government issued social distancing recommendations but left to the states the most difficult and consequential decisions restricting behavior, such as canceling events, closing schools and businesses, and issuing stay-at-home orders. We present an original dataset of state-level social distancing policy responses to the epidemic and explore how political partisanship, COVID-19 caseload, and policy diffusion explain the timing of governors' decisions to mandate social distancing. An event history analysis of five social distancing policies across all fifty states reveals the most important predictors are political: all else equal, Republican governors and governors from states with more Trump supporters were slower to adopt social distancing polici...","Strict interventions were successful to control the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak in China. As transmission intensifies in other countries, the interplay between age, contact patterns, social distancing, susceptibility to infection and disease, and COVID-19 dynamics remains unclear. To answer these questions, we analyze contact surveys data for Wuhan and Shanghai before and during the outbreak and contact tracing information from Hunan Province. Daily contacts were reduced 7-9 fold during the COVID-19 social distancing period, with most interactions restricted to the household. Children 0-14 years were 59% (95% CI 7-82%) less susceptible than individuals 65 years and over. A transmission model calibrated against these data indicates that social distancing alone, as implemented in China during the outbreak, is sufficient to control COVID-19. While proactive school closures cannot interrupt transmission on their own, they reduce peak incidence by half and delay the epidemic. Thes...","Social mixing patterns are crucial in driving transmission of infectious diseases and informing public health interventions to contain their spread. Age-specific social mixing is often inferred from surveys of self-recorded contacts which by design often have a very limited number of participants. In addition, such surveys are rare, so public health interventions are often evaluated by considering only one such study. Here we report detailed population contact patterns for United Kingdom based self-reported contact data from over 36,000 volunteers that participated in the massive citizen science project BBC Pandemic. The amount of data collected allows us generate fine-scale age-specific population contact matrices by context (home, work, school, other) and type (conversational or physical) of contact that took place. These matrices are highly relevant for informing prevention and control of new outbreaks, and evaluating strategies that reduce the amount of mixing in the population (su...","The number of confirmed COVID-19 cases admitted in hospitals is continuously increasing in the Philippines. Frontline health care workers are faced with imminent risks of getting infected. In this study, we formulate a theoretical model to calculate the risk of being infected in health care facilities considering the following factors: the average number of encounters with a suspected COVID-19 patient per hour; interaction time for each encounter; work shift duration or exposure time; crowd density, which may depend on the amount of space available in a given location; and availability and effectiveness of protective gears and facilities provided for the frontline health care workers. Based on the simulation results, we recommend the following: (i) decrease the rate of patient encounter per frontline health care worker, e.g., maximum of three encounters per hour in a 12-hour work shift duration; (ii) decrease the interaction time between the frontline health care worker and the patient...","Various epidemic prevention and control measures aimed at reducing person-to-person contact has paid a certain cost while controlling the epidemic. So accurate evaluation of these measures helps to maximize the effectiveness of prevention and control while minimizing social costs. In this paper, we develop the model in Dirk Brockmann and Dirk Helbing (2013) to theoretically explain the impact mechanism of traffic control and social distancing measures on the spread of the epidemic, and empirically tests the effect of the two measures in China at the present stage using econometric approach. We found that both traffic control and social distancing measures have played a very good role in controlling the development of the epidemic. Nationally, social distancing measures are better than traffic control measures; the two measures are complementary and their combined action will play a better epidemic prevention effect; Traffic control and social distancing do not work everywhere. Traffic ...","Social distancing is an effective way to contain the spread of a contagious disease, particularly when pharmacological interventions are not available. Conventional wisdom suggests that social distancing measures should be introduced as soon as possible after the beginning of an outbreak. Using a simple epidemiological model we show, however, that there is in fact an optimal time to initiate a temporal social distancing intervention if the goal is to reduce the final epidemic size or flatten the epidemic curve. The optimal timing depends strongly on the effective reproduction number (R0) of the disease, such that as the R0 increases, the optimal time decreases non-linearly. Additionally, if pharmacological interventions (e.g., a vaccine) become available at some point during the epidemic, the sooner these interventions become available the sooner social distancing should be initiated to maximize its effectiveness. Although based on a simple model, we hope that these insights inspire fu...","Abstract Our recommendation, as experts who have monitored health hazards at the Hajj for over 15 years, especially if the situation with COVID-19 continues to escalate globally is that Hajj 2020 will be at risk of being suspended and a means for Muslims to fulfill their rights in the future either personally or even by proxy need to be announced. The same holds true for the Summer 2020 Olympics in Japan and for many other MGs and large gatherings. Decisions in the time of COVID-19 will be closely followed and will be a blueprint for other mass gatherings.","Abstract Mass gathering (MG) medicine emerged against the backdrop of the 2009 pandemic H1N1 Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) when the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) hosted the largest annual mass gathering of over 3 million pilgrims from 180 plus countries. However, the events surrounding the latest threat to global health, the PHEIC COVID-19, may be sufficient to highlight the role of mass gatherings, mass migration, and other forms of dense gatherings of people on the emergence, sustenance, and transmission of novel pathogens. The COVID-19 spread illustrates the role of MGs in exacerbation of the scope of pandemics. Cancellation or suspension of MGs would be critical to pandemic mitigation. It is unlikely that medical countermeasures are available during the early phase of pandemics. Therefore, mitigation of its impact, rather than containment and control becomes a priority during pandemics. As the most systematically studied MG-related respiratory disease dat...","In response to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak, the Chinese Government has ordered a nationwide school closure as an emergency measure to prevent spreading of the infection. Public activities are discouraged. The Ministry of Education estimates that more than 220 million children and adolescents are confined to their homes; this includes 180 million primary and secondary students and 47 million preschool children).1 Thanks to the strong administrative system in China, the emergency home schooling plan has been rigorously implemented.2 Massive efforts are being made by schools and teachers at all levels to create online courses and deliver them through TV broadcasts and the internet in record time. The new virtual semester has just started in many parts of the country, and various courses are offered online in a well organised manner. These actions are helping to alleviate many parents' concerns about their children's educational attainment by ensuring that school learn...","Objective: Establishing a social contact data sharing initiative and an interactive tool to assess mitigation strategies for COVID-19. Results: We organized data sharing of published social contact surveys via online repositories and formatting guidelines. We analyzed this social contact data in terms of weighted social contact matrices, next generation matrices, relative incidence and R0. We incorporated location-specific isolation measures (e.g. school closure or telework) and capture their effect on transmission dynamics. All methods have been implemented in an online application based on R Shiny and applied to COVID-19 with age-specific susceptibility and infectiousness. Using our online tool with the available social contact data, we illustrate that social distancing could have a considerable impact on reducing transmission for COVID-19. The effect itself depends on assumptions made about disease-specific characteristics and the choice of intervention(s). Keywords: social contact ...","Background: The COVID-19 outbreak containment strategies in China based on non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) appear to be effective. Quantitative research is still needed however to assess the efficacy of different candidate NPIs and their timings to guide ongoing and future responses to epidemics of this emerging disease across the World. Methods: We built a travel network-based susceptible-exposed-infectious-removed (SEIR) model to simulate the outbreak across cities in mainland China. We used epidemiological parameters estimated for the early stage of outbreak in Wuhan to parameterise the transmission before NPIs were implemented. To quantify the relative effect of various NPIs, daily changes of delay from illness onset to the first reported case in each county were used as a proxy for the improvement of case identification and isolation across the outbreak. Historical and near-real time human movement data, obtained from Baidu location-based service, were used to derive the i...","Background: The impact of COVID-19 has been profound, and the public health challenge seem to be the most serious regarding respiratory viruses since the 1918 H1N1 influenza pandemic. In the absence of effective vaccine or biomedical treatment, the basic rules of public health measures have not changed, namely public distancing. Methods: We analyzed epidemiological investigation reports during the first month of the outbreak in Israel. In addition, we present a deterministic compartment model and simulations of several scenarios emphasizing quarantine and isolation policies given their efficiency. Results: We identify an abrupt change from controlled epidemic regime to an exponential growth (R_0= 2.19) in light of the actual policy-makers decisions and public behavior in Israel. Our analysis show that before the abrupt change, the new cases trend was due to returning citizens infected abroad. The abrupt change followed a holiday in which social distancing was clearly inefficient and ma...","Summary Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), a novel coronavirus that causes a severe lower respiratory tract infection in humans, emerged in the Middle East in 2012. Since then, MERS-CoV has caused an ongoing epidemic in the Arabian Peninsula with sporadic cases imported in Europe, North Africa, Southeast Asia, and the United States of America. As of 28th May 2014, 636 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV have been reported to World Health Organization including 14 cases imported by travelers. The epicenter of the current MERS-CoV epidemic is located in Saudi Arabia, where millions of pilgrims travel for two mass gatherings annually. In this review we summarize MERS-CoV cases in relation to travel with focus on the epidemiology and prevention in travelers. It is important to increase awareness of travelers about the risks and appropriate preventive measures and for health professionals to be on alert if a patient with severe respiratory symptoms re...","Background The novel coronavirus COVID19 has been classified by the World Health Organisation as a pandemic due to its worldwide spread. The ability of countries to contain and control transmission is critical in the absence of a vaccine. We evaluated a range of social distancing measures to determine which strategies are most effective in reducing the peak daily infection rate, and consequential pressure on the health care system. Methods Using COVID19 transmission data from the outbreak source in Hubei Province, China, collected prior to activation of containment measures, we adapted an established individual based simulation model of the city of Newcastle, Australia, population 272,409. Simulation of virus transmission in this community model without interventions provided a baseline from which to compare alternative social distancing strategies. The infection history of each individual was determined, as was the time infected. From this model generated data, the rate of growth in c...","Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) has emerged in the Arabian Gulf region, with its epicentre in Saudi Arabia, the host of the \u2018Hajj\u2019 which is the world\u2019s the largest mass gathering. Transmission of MERS-CoV at such an event could lead to its rapid worldwide dissemination. Therefore, we studied the frequency of viruses causing influenza-like illnesses (ILI) among participants in a randomised controlled trial at the Hajj 2013. We recruited 1038 pilgrims from Saudi Arabia, Australia and Qatar during the first day of Hajj and followed them closely for four days. A nasal swab was collected from each pilgrim who developed ILI. Respiratory viruses were detected using multiplex RT-PCR. ILI occurred in 112/1038 (11%) pilgrims. Their mean age was 35 years, 49 (44%) were male and 35 (31%) had received the influenza vaccine pre-Hajj. Forty two (38%) pilgrims had laboratory-confirmed viral infections; 28 (25%) rhinovirus, 5 (4%) influenza A, 2 (2%) adenovirus, 2 (2%) human cor...","Background: With new cases of COVID-19 surging around the world, some countries may have to prepare for moving beyond the containment phase. Prediction of the effectiveness of non-case-based interventions for mitigating, delaying or preventing the epidemic is urgent, especially for countries affected by the increased seasonal influenza activity. Methods: We developed a transmission model to evaluate the impact of self-imposed prevention measures (handwashing, mask-wearing, and social distancing) due to COVID-19 awareness and of short-term government-imposed social distancing on the peak number of diagnoses, attack rate and time until the peak number of diagnoses. Findings: For fast awareness spread in the population, self-imposed measures can significantly reduce the attack rate, diminish and postpone the peak number of diagnoses. A large epidemic can be prevented if the efficacy of these measures exceeds 50%. For slow awareness spread, self-imposed measures reduce the peak number of d...","Governments around the world must rapidly mobilize and make difficult policy decisions to mitigate the COVID-19 pandemic. Because deaths have been concentrated at older ages, we highlight the important role of demography, particularly how the age structure of a population may help explain differences in fatality rates across countries and how transmission unfolds. We examine the role of age structure in deaths thus far in Italy and South Korea and illustrate how the pandemic could unfold in populations with similar population sizes but different age structures, showing a dramatically higher burden of mortality in countries with older versus younger populations. This powerful interaction of demography and current age-specific mortality for COVID-19 suggests that social distancing and other policies to slow transmission should consider both the age composition of local and national contexts as well as the social connectedness of older and younger generations. We also call for countries t...","Summary Background Since the coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak began in the Chinese city of Wuhan on Dec 31, 2019, 68 imported cases and 175 locally acquired infections have been reported in Singapore. We aimed to investigate options for early intervention in Singapore should local containment (eg, preventing disease spread through contact tracing efforts) be unsuccessful. Methods We adapted an influenza epidemic simulation model to estimate the likelihood of human-to-human transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in a simulated Singaporean population. Using this model, we estimated the cumulative number of SARS-CoV-2 infections at 80 days, after detection of 100 cases of community transmission, under three infectivity scenarios (basic reproduction number [R 0] of 1\u00b75, 2\u00b70, or 2\u00b75) and assuming 7\u00b75% of infections are asymptomatic. We first ran the model assuming no intervention was in place (baseline scenario), and then assessed the effect of four in...","On January 20, 2020, the first COVID-19 case was confirmed in South Korea. After a rapid outbreak, the number of incident cases has been consistently decreasing since early March; this decrease has been widely attributed to its intensive testing. We report here on the likely role of social distancing in reducing transmission in South Korea. Our analysis suggests that transmission may still be persisting in some regions.","The COVID-19 pandemic has shown a markedly low proportion of cases among children. Age disparities in observed cases could be explained by assortative mixing patterns and reactive school closures which decrease mixing between children, or by children exhibiting lower susceptibility to infection, or by children having a lower propensity to show clinical symptoms. We formally test these hypotheses by fitting an age-structured mathematical model to epidemic data from six countries, finding strong age dependence in the probability of developing clinical symptoms, rising from around 20% in under 10s to over 70% in older adults. We find that interventions aimed at halting transmission in children may have minimal effects on preventing cases depending on the relative transmissibility of subclinical infections. Our estimated age-specific clinical fraction has implications for the expected global burden of clinical cases because of demographic differences across settings. In younger populations...","SARS-CoV-2 has infected over 140,000 people as of March 14, 2020. We use a mathematical model to investigate the effectiveness of social distancing interventions lasting six weeks in a middle-sized city in the US. We explore four social distancing strategies by reducing the contacts of adults over 60 years old, adults over 60 years old and children, all adults (25, 75 or 95% compliance), and everyone in the population. Our results suggest that social distancing interventions can avert cases by 20% and hospitalizations and deaths by 90% even with modest compliance within adults as long as the intervention is kept in place, but the epidemic is set to rebound once the intervention is lifted. Our models suggest that social distancing interventions will buy crucial time but need to occur in conjunction with testing and contact tracing of all suspected cases to mitigate transmission of SARS-CoV-2.","The purpose of this article is to reach all those who find it difficult to become well informed about the repercussions of a lockdown strategy to tackle the COVID-19 pandemic and to spark discussion and thought. Here we use simple stochastic simulations to evaluate different approaches taken to tackle the crisis, along with the efficiency they will hold and the number of casualties they may incur. It is clear that the less strict the social distancing the more time it will take for life to return to normal, and the more lives will be at risk. This is shown through simulations formed by an open sourced code, which allows evaluation of the outcomes from different intervention scenarios or conditions.","We developed a computational tool to assess the risk of novel coronavirus outbreaks outside China. We estimate the dependence of the risk of a major outbreak in a country from imported cases on key parameters such as: (i) the evolution of the cumulative number of cases in mainland China outside the closed areas; (ii) the connectivity of the destination country with China, including baseline travel frequencies, the effect of travel restrictions, and the efficacy of entry screening at destination; (iii) the efficacy of control measures in the destination country (expressed by the local reproduction number Rloc). We found that in countries with low connectivity to China but with relatively high Rloc, the most beneficial control measure to reduce the risk of outbreaks is a further reduction in their importation number either by entry screening or travel restrictions. Countries with high connectivity but low Rloc benefit the most from policies that further reduce Rloc. Countries in the midd...","A novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) first detected in Wuhan, China, has spread rapidly since December 2019, causing more than 80,000 confirmed infections and 2,700 fatalities (as of Feb 27, 2020). Imported cases and transmission clusters of various sizes have been reported globally suggesting a pandemic is likely. Here, we explore how seasonal variation in transmissibility could modulate a SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Data from routine diagnostics show a strong and consistent seasonal variation of the four endemic coronaviruses (229E, HKU1, NL63, OC43) and we parameterize our model for SARS-CoV-2 using these data. The model allows for many subpopulations of different size with variable parameters. Simulations of different scenarios show that plausible parameters result in a small peak in early 2020 in temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and a larger peak in winter 2020/2021. Variation in transmission and migration rates can result in substantial variation in prevalence between regions. W...","Abstract Microbiology laboratories have traditionally relied upon phenotypic methods involving culture and biochemical testing to identify and characterize clinically important pathogens. These techniques have several disadvantages including poor sensitivity and long turn-around time. Molecular and mass spectroscopy techniques are rapidly changing infection diagnosis and management. Compared with conventional culture-based techniques, these modern approaches provide substantially more rapid and specific information on organism identification and on the presence of resistance mechanisms. These methods are expected to contribute substantially to enhancing antibiotic stewardship and to improving \u2018time to appropriate antibiotics\u2019, one of the most important factors in improving the prognosis of patients with life-threatening infections. This article gives an overview of some of the practical applications of these newer technologies.","Emergence of new viral diseases is linked to mutation or recombination events. The likelihood of cross-species transmission is related to phenotypic plasticity of a virus and its capacity to produce genetically variable progeny. Herein a model is described connecting the production of genetic variability with increasing genome size. Comparing all known zoonotic viral genome sizes to known non-zoonotic viral genome sizes demonstrates that zoonotic viruses have significantly larger genomes. These results support the notion that large viral genomes are important in producing new zoonotic disease, and suggest that genome size may be a useful surrogate in screening for potential zoonotic viruses.","The ongoing COVID-19 epidemic that spread widely in China since December 2019 is now generating local transmission in multiple countries including Singapore as of March 5, 2020. This highlights the need to monitor in real time the transmission potential of COVID-19. In Singapore, four major COVID-19 case clusters have emerged thus far. Here we estimate the effective reproduction number, Rt, of COVID-19 in Singapore from the publicly available daily case series of imported and autochthonous cases by date of symptoms onset, after adjusting the local cases for reporting delays. We also derive the reproduction number from the distribution of cluster sizes using a branching process analysis. The effective reproduction number peaked with a mean value ~1.0 around February 6-12, 2020 and declined thereafter. As of March 5, 2020, our most recent estimate of Rt is at 0.9 (95% CI: 0.7,1.0) while an estimate of the overall R based on cluster size distribution is at 0.7 (95% CI: 0.5, 1.0). The traj...","An outbreak of the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19 respiratory disease, has infected over 290,000 people since the end of 2019, killed over 12,000, and caused worldwide social and economic disruption. There are currently no antiviral drugs with proven efficacy nor are there vaccines for its prevention. Unfortunately, the scientific community has little knowledge of the molecular details of SARS-CoV-2 infection. To illuminate this, we cloned, tagged and expressed 26 of the 29 viral proteins in human cells and identified the human proteins physically associated with each using affinity-purification mass spectrometry (AP-MS), which identified 332 high confidence SARS-CoV-2-human protein-protein interactions (PPIs). Among these, we identify 67 druggable human proteins or host factors targeted by 69 existing FDA-approved drugs, drugs in clinical trials and/or preclinical compounds, that we are currently evaluating for efficacy in live SARS-CoV-2 infection assay...","Background The outbreak of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) started in the city of Wuhan, China, with a period of rapid initial spread. Transmission on a regional and then national scale was promoted by intense travel during the holiday period of the Chinese New Year. We studied the variation in transmission of COVID-19, locally in Wuhan, as well as on a larger spatial scale, among different cities and even among provinces in mainland China. Methods In addition to reported numbers of new cases, we have been able to assemble detailed contact data for some of the initial clusters of COVID-19. This enabled estimation of the serial interval for clinical cases, as well as reproduction numbers for small and large regions. Findings We estimated the average serial interval was 4.8 days. For early transmission in Wuhan, any infectious case produced as many as four new cases, transmission outside Wuhan was less intense, with reproduction numbers below two. During the rapid growth phase ...","The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is straining healthcare resources worldwide, prompting social distancing measures to reduce transmission intensity. The amount of social distancing needed to curb the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in the context of seasonally varying transmission remains unclear. Using a mathematical model, we assessed that one-time interventions will be insufficient to maintain COVID-19 prevalence within the critical care capacity of the United States. Seasonal variation in transmission will facilitate epidemic control during the summer months but could lead to an intense resurgence in the autumn. Intermittent distancing measures can maintain control of the epidemic, but without other interventions, these measures may be necessary into 2022. Increasing critical care capacity could reduce the duration of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic while ensuring that critically ill patients receive appropriate care.","BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), formerly known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), was first identified in December 2019 in Wuhan City, China. Structural equation modeling (SEM) is a multivariate analysis method to determine the structural relationship between measured variables. This observational study aimed to use SEM to determine the effects of social support on sleep quality and function of medical staff who treated patients with COVID-19 in January and February 2020 in Wuhan, China. MATERIAL/METHODS: A one-month cross-sectional observational study included 180 medical staff who treated patients with COVID-19 infection. Levels of anxiety, self-efficacy, stress, sleep quality, and social support were measured using the and the Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS), the General Self-Efficacy Scale (GSES), the Stanford Acute Stress Reaction (SASR) questionnaire, the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), a...","The increasing burden of emerging infectious diseases worldwide confronts us with numerous challenges, including the imperative to design research and responses that are commensurate to understanding the complex social and ecological contexts in which infectious diseases occur. A diverse group of scientists met in Hawaii in March 2005 to discuss the linked social and ecological contexts in which infectious diseases emerge. A subset of the meeting was a group that focused on \u201ctransdisciplinary approaches\u201d to integrating knowledge across and beyond academic disciplines in order to improve prevention and control of emerging infections. This article is based on the discussions of that group. Here, we outline the epidemiological legacy that has dominated infectious disease research and control up until now, and introduce the role of new, transdisciplinary and systems-based approaches to emerging infectious diseases. We describe four cases of transboundary health issues and use them to discu...","A standard SEIR-type compartment model, parameterised for New Zealand, was used to simulate the spread of Covid19 in New Zealand and to test the effectiveness of various control strategies. Control aims can be broadly categorised as either suppression or mitigation. Suppression aims to keep cases to an absolute minimum for as long as possible. Mitigation aims to allow a controlled outbreak to occur, with the aim of preventing significant overloads on healthcare systems and gradually allowing the population to develop herd immunity. Both types of strategy are fraught with uncertainty. Suppression strategies can succeed in delaying an outbreak, but only for as long as such control measures can be sustained. Once controls are eased or restricted, an epidemic is likely to follow as no herd immunity has been acquired. The success or failure of mitigation strategies can depend sensitively on the timing and efficacy of control measures, and require the ability to bring rapidly growing outbrea...","BACKGROUND: In December 2019, a novel strain of SARS-CoV-2 emerged in Wuhan, China. Since then, the city of Wuhan has taken unprecedented measures and efforts in response to the outbreak. METHODS: We quantified the effects of control measures on population contact patterns in Wuhan, China, to assess their effects on the progression of the outbreak. We included the latest estimates of epidemic parameters from a transmission model fitted to data on local and internationally exported cases from Wuhan in the age-structured epidemic framework. Further, we looked at the age-distribution of cases. Lastly, we simulated lifting of the control measures by allowing people to return to work in a phased-in way, and looked at the effects of returning to work at different stages of the underlying outbreak. FINDINGS: Changes in mixing patterns may have contributed to reducing the number of infections in mid-2020 by 92% (interquartile range: 66-97%). There are benefits to sustaining these measures unti...","Abstract We summarize findings of SARS-CoV infections in several animal models each of which support viral replication in lungs accompanied by histopathological changes and/or clinical signs of illness to varying degrees. New findings are reported on SARS-CoV replication and associated pathology in two additional strains (C57BL/6 and 129S6) of aged mice. We also provide new comparative data on viral replication and associated pathology following infection of golden Syrian hamsters with various SARS-CoV strains and report the levels of neutralizing antibody titers following these infections and the cross-protective efficacy of infection with these strains in protecting against heterologous challenge. Finally, we summarize findings of a variety of vaccine approaches and discuss the available in vitro and in vivo data addressing the potential for disease enhancement following re-infection in animals previously vaccinated against or infected with SARS-CoV.","An estimated 1.9 million children travel overseas annually. Infectious disease risks associated with international travel are diverse and depend on the destination, planned activities, and baseline medical history. Children have special needs and vulnerabilities that should be addressed when preparing for travel abroad. Children should have a pretravel health assessment that includes recommendations for both routine and special travel-related vaccination; malaria chemoprophylaxis, if indicated; and prevention counseling regarding insect and animal exposures, food and water safety, and avoiding injuries. Special consideration should be given to children with chronic diseases. Families should be given anticipatory guidance for management of potential illnesses and information about the location of medical resources overseas."],"title":["Delaying the COVID-19 epidemic in Australia: Evaluating the effectiveness of international travel bans","The effectiveness of full and partial travel bans against COVID-19 spread in Australia for travellers from China.","The Impact of School Closure for COVID-19 on the US Healthcare Workforce and the Net Mortality Effects","The impact of unplanned school closure on children's social contact: Rapid evidence review","Fundamental principles of epidemic spread highlight the immediate need for large-scale serological surveys to assess the stage of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic","Symptom-Based Isolation Policies: Evidence from a Mathematical Model of Outbreaks of Influenza and COVID-19","An Ounce of Prevention: Coronavirus (COVID-19) and Mass Gatherings","Estimating the number of undetected COVID-19 cases exported internationally from all of China","Healthcare worker absenteeism, child care costs, and COVID-19 school closures: a simulation analysis","How to evaluate the success of the COVID-19 measures implemented by the Norwegian government by analyzing changes in doubling time","Travel and public health","The current state of COVID-19 in Australia: importation and spread","The effect of control strategies to reduce social mixing on outcomes of the COVID-19 epidemic in Wuhan, China: a modelling study","The Population Attributable Fraction (PAF) of cases due to gatherings and groups with relevance to COVID-19 mitigation strategies","Pandemic Politics: Timing State-Level Social Distancing Responses to COVID-19","Age profile of susceptibility, mixing, and social distancing shape the dynamics of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak in China","Contacts in context: large-scale setting-specific social mixing matrices from the BBC Pandemic project","A COVID-19 Infection Risk Model for Frontline Health Care Workers","Which Measures are Effective in Containing COVID-19?

Upon this, the CDC began releasing recommendations to those at risk of being exposed to the virus. The initial recommendations included travel warnings and restricted travel to countries with confirmed cases and sustained COVID-19 spread. These travel restrictions grew to include inbound and outbound travel bans to a list of 26 countries, in both Europe and Asia. 108 Other policies have included social distancing, which has been widely recommended or enforced at various levels of government. This method involves avoiding crowds, staying home, limiting or avoiding visiting vulnerable populations (such as long-term care facilities) and standing at least six feet away from others in public spaces. Some regions have implemented school closures at both the K-12 and higher education level. Business closures have also been recommended or enforced, such that employees should work from home, unless their work is considered essential to the greater public (e.g. health care, grocery stores). To support employees working remotely or staying home when sick, a number of states have also mandated paid sick leave for those who are affected by . Free testing has also been implemented in certain states, so that anyone experiencing symptoms or has been exposed to the virus can now get tested for free. 111 We coded various policies that cancel events and large gatherings as follows: the cancellation of large events, specifically the election postponement in Louisiana, is categorized as \" event_cancel .\" The separate \" no_gathering \" policy variable represents policy measures that banned all events or mass gatherings of a certain size, i.e. no gatherings over a certain number of people (where this number has varied by region). The \" social_distance \" category includes measures that prevent visits to elderly care facilities, close public facilities such as libraries, and require workers to work remotely. The \" emergency_declaration \" encompasses the declarations of a state of emergency at the city, county, state, and federal level. This declaration allows the affected area to immediately marshal emergency funds and resources and activate emergency legislation, while also giving the public an indication of the gravity of the situation.","As of this writing, the current number of infected is 153,648, along with 5,746 deaths and cases in 146 countries, areas, or territories [1]. Governments have been hesitant in their response with border and school closures, bans on public gatherings, and screening of passengers at transportation hubs. The question remains whether this is truly effective. Some authorities have advocated the usage of thermal scanners to identify those who are febrile. These scanners could be used today to identify febrile individuals who will be in close contact with heads of state, government, or business. Although well-intentioned, this is imprecise for mass gatherings. As seen below, many infected, yet non-febrile individuals will be missed with such screening tools (Figure 1).","Short-term government-imposed social distancing 160 Governments may decide to promote social distancing policies through interventions such as school and workplace 161 closures or by issuing a ban on large gatherings. These policies will cause a community-wide contact rate reduction, 162 regardless of the awareness status. Here, we assume that the government intervention is initiated if the number of 163 diagnosed individuals exceeds a certain threshold (10-1000 persons) and terminates after a fixed period of time (1-3 164 months). As such, the intervention is implemented early into the epidemic. The efficacy of government-imposed 165 social distancing is described by the reduction of the average contact rate in the population which ranges from 0% 166 (no distancing) to 100% (complete quarantine of the population). and of all individuals (government-imposed social distancing). We refer to these quantities as the efficacy of a 175 prevention measure and vary it from 0% (zero efficacy) to 100% (full efficacy) ( Table 1 ). The main analyses were 176 performed for two values of the rate of awareness spread that corresponded to scenarios of slow and fast spread 177 of awareness in the population (Table 1) . For these scenarios, the proportion of the aware population at the peak 178 of the epidemic was 40% and 90%, respectively. In the main analyses, government-imposed social distancing was 179 initiated when 10 individuals got diagnosed and was lifted after 3 months.","Travel bans and social distancing measures are effective public health tools to control epidemic diseases (2), and Australia successfully delayed the introduction of the 1918 pandemic by 1 year and reduced the total mortality compared to other countries (3) . However, travel bans are not sustainable indefinitely, and a careful risk analysis needs to be done comparing the health and economic consequences of alternative scenarios. The epidemic in China peaked on February 5 th and has declined since (4) . The risk of importation of COVID-19 cases through travel from an affected country is proportional to the volume of travel from that country and their prevalence of infection at that time point. We aimed to estimate the impact of the implementation of the travel ban on China from February 1 st 2020 on the epidemic trajectory in Australia, as well as the impact of lifting the ban completely or partially from the 8 of March.","As of February 28, 2020 the COVID-19 outbreak has caused 78,961 confirmed cases (2791 deaths) across China, with the majority seen in Wuhan City, and 4691 cases (67 deaths) reported in the other 51 countries. 1 Further spread has occurred to all populated continents of the World, with many anticipating that a pandemic is approaching. 2, 3 As an emerging disease, effective pharmaceutical interventions are not expected to be available for months, 4 and healthcare resources will be limited for treating all cases. Nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) are therefore essential components of the public health response to outbreaks. 1, [5] [6] [7] These include isolating ill persons, contact tracing, quarantine of exposed persons, travel restrictions, school and workplace closures, and cancellation of mass gathering events. [5] [6] [7] These containment measures aim to reduce transmission, thereby delaying the timing and reducing the size of the epidemic peak, buying time for preparations in the healthcare system, and enabling the potential for vaccines and drugs to be used later on. 5 For example, social distancing measures have been effective in past influenza epidemics by curbing human-to-human transmission and reducing morbidity and mortality. [8] [9] [10] Three major NPIs have been taken to mitigate the spread and reduce the outbreak size of COVID-19 across China. 11, 12 First, inter-city travel bans or restrictions have been taken to prevent further seeding the virus during the","Populations in almost every country are now currently weighing whether, or when, the health benefits of anti-contagion policies are worth the costs they impose on society. For example, restrictions imposed on businesses are increasing unemployment, 19 travel bans are bankrupting airlines, 20 and school closures may have enduring impacts on affected students. 21 It is therefore not surprising that some populations hesitate before implementing such dramatic policies, particularly when these costs are visible while their health benefits -infections and deaths that would have occurred but instead were avoided or delayed -are unseen. Our objective is to measure this direct benefit; specifically, how much these policies slowed the growth rate of infections. We treat recently implemented policies as hundreds of different natural experiments proceeding in parallel. Our hope is to learn from the recent experience of six countries where the virus has advanced enough to trigger largescale policy actions, in part so that societies and decision-makers in the remaining 180+ countries can access this information immediately.","After an initial period of inactivity, many governments have now moved to impose international travel restrictions to prevent any further importation of COVID-19 cases. However, given that the virus is now a global pandemic and has reached most countries it is reasonable to question the impact of ongoing travel restrictions. In this short communication we have used international flight data and models of disease transmission to predict the national epidemic trajectory had travel bans not been put in place. Our results show that the travel ban on individuals arriving from China successfully delayed the onset of widespread transmission in Australia by four weeks. We also showed that travel bans from Hubei Province alone would have been much less effective, as the virus had already spread to many other provinces by the time the bans were enforced. Similarly, until now travel bans for South Korea and Iran (imposed on February 9 and March 5 respectively) were also shown to have negligible impact. However, as the number of cases in these countries continues to rise we expect these restrictions to become increasingly effective. Universal international travel bans coming into force now appear to be the only rational response, however, we need to consider how long they can and should last.","Our predictions of travel patterns can help policy makers weigh the COVID-19 risk posed by travellers from different countries, as well as the potential reduction in this risk by implementing travel bans and quarantine rules that only apply to foreign travellers. The risk reduction in COVID-19 importations into Australia as a result of travel bans varies across the different source countries. The risk reduction when travel bans are applied to countries where traveller volumes into Australia are dominated by visitors, such as 4 .

In contrast, the risk reduction for travel bans relating to countries with a dominant number of returning Australian citizens or residents, such as Italy, Spain, Thailand, and Indonesia, will have a smaller impact on COVID-19 importations, as the citizens and residents can still enter the country.","(1). Following China, many countries around the world have adopted social distancing measures largely based on quarantine and travel bans, as well as on isolation of infected patients and their close contacts (2) . Countries around the world are adding additional extreme distancing measures aiming to slow the rate of infections after watching the overwhelmed health systems of Italy and Spain which are suffering from rapidly spreading infections and a large number of fatalities (3) .","The evolving story of the COVID-19 outbreak has advanced over a remarkably short time frame (Fig 1) . On December 31, 2019, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission reported a cluster of pneumonia of unknown origin, all linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market. This market harboured a variety of live and deceased exotic wildlife, including live bamboo rats, palm civets, badgers, and wolf cubs. It is notable that a quarter of the initially reported 27 pneumonia cases presented with severe disease. 45 Within days, the cause of the pneumonia was identified as a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). 2 On January 19, 2020 the WHO issued a warning that the virus may have the ability to spread from human to human. 3 Wuhan is a major transportation hub within China with a population of 11 million. On a typical day, approximately 3500 people take flights to other countries from Wuhan, and the number increases with holidays and the Chinese Lunar New Year. Within 1 month, the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases rose to more than 9000, surpassing the number of SARS and MERS cases reported to date. Similarly, global fears escalated as cases spread to other countries. Extensive control measures were put into place, starting with massive decontamination efforts and, ultimately, closure of the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, banning the trade of wildlife and poultry in wet markets, contact tracing of cases, exit screening at airports, lockdown and quarantine measures that progressed to include adjacent cities (an estimated 50e60 million people affected), school closures, extension of the Lunar New Year holiday, prohibition of mass gatherings, and building of two new hospitals (1000 and 1600 beds) to care for infected individuals. Other nations instituted airport screening, travel bans, and evacuating citizens from Hubei Province and quarantining them through the incubation period. 6 Despite these measures, the case counts continued to increase in the outbreak epicenter, and countries with imported cases reported clusters of human-to-human transmission. On January 30, 2020, the WHO declared a PHEIC, calling for intensified international collaborative efforts to halt the outbreak. 3 Although Chinese authorities have heavily restricted movement from Wuhan, this austere measure came at the same time as the Spring Festival, a time when the number of outbound travellers from Wuhan is estimated to be more than 15 million.","In order to deal with the COVID-19 outbreak, on March 12 th , 2020 the Norwegian government implemented the most drastic measures since World War 2 5 . Schools and kindergartens were closed, flights were cancelled, public gatherings were postponed and citizens with symptoms were advised to self-quarantine for 14 days. Citizens that had been abroad were required to stay at home with their families for 14 days. On March 16 th , 2020, the country was officially shut down for travel with strict control of borders. Denmark implemented even stronger measures, with many shops such as IKEA being required to close as well. In the Norwegian capital Oslo, pubs and restaurants are still open, although with a much lower number of visitors than usual. In Norway, companies that could move their employees over to working from home were advised to do so. Iceland and Finland implemented similar measures, while Sweden closed some, but not all, schools. Sweden also recently introduced travel bans.","The COVID-19 outbreak has spread widely across China since December 2019, with many other countries affected. The containment strategy of integrated nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) including travel bans and restrictions, contact reductions and social distancing, early case identification and isolation have been rapidly deloyed across China to contain the outbreak, and the combination of these interventions appears to be effective. We ","Extreme social distancing measures, including school closures, workplace closures, and avoiding any public gatherings all at once, can push the transmission to households leading to increased clustering in .

Most countermeasures are in line with (ii) and (iii), aside from the three cities on complete lockdown, while some countries at high risk refused any entry from China (e.g., Australia) or those from Hubei and Zhejiang provinces (e.g., Japan). All travel arrangements including tourist tours outbound from China (to international destinations) organized by Chinese travel agencies were cancelled, and all non-urgent travel with business purposes both inbound and outbound were greatly reduced.","To investigate why some states acted quickly to implement social distancing while others took longer, we identified five critical areas of social distancing policy -recommendations and restrictions against public gatherings, mandatory school closures, restrictions on the normal operation of restaurants, closure of non-essential businesses, and stay-at-home orders -and collected the dates each state first announced such measures. Our primary objective is to explain the variation in timing of these measures across states using an event history analysis. This approach allows us to statistically separate the impact of having a Republican governor or a Republican electorate from a series of potential confounders, including the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in the state, state income, and cases and policies in neighboring states.","Since Wuhan was placed on lockdown, travel restriction and border control have been implemented by various countries, either as: (i) complete travel bans, (ii) travel restriction and quarantine-which allows for restriction of healthy individuals, (iii) entry screening for all incoming travelers, or some combination thereof.

Examples of social distancing include closing of schools, non-essential workplace closures, and avoiding large gatherings (i.e. public transport, concerts, religious gatherings) in which a large number of individuals are in close contact and facilitating the contagion process [15] . In most cases, due to socio-economic and logistic reasons [13] , social distancing measures can only be in effect for a finite period of time (e.g., 2 weeks, 1 month, 2 months) that is typically much shorter than the full duration of the epidemic.","We have coded various policies that cancel events and large gatherings as such: any cancellations of professional sporting and other specific pre-scheduled events as the policy variable \" event_cancel .\" The \" no_gathering \" policy variable represents policy measures that banned all events or mass gatherings of a certain size, e.g. no gatherings of over 1,000 people. The \" social_distance \" policy variable includes measures preventing visits to elder care establishments, closures of public pools and tourist attractions, and teleworking plans for workers.","We do not consider cases coming in from other countries -however, this study illustrates the principle of travel bans and public health impact on epidemic control using China as a case study. A further limitation is the uncertainty of parameters used, particularly the proportion of asymptomatic cases. We have used a conservative estimate, but if the rate is higher than 40%, the outcomes would be worse. While it has been showed that distancing measures are highly effective (2, 22) a systematic review looking at the effectiveness of travel restrictions (23) , shows that international travel restriction are effective in delaying the epidemic but may not contain it. We also assumed a very optimistic scenario of 80% of contacts being identified, which may not occur with high case numbers, if a high proportion of asymptomatic transmission is occurring, or if self-quarantine is ineffective. In this study we assumed voluntary home quarantine, which is showed to be about 50% effective in R0 reduction (16) , however there could be an increased risk of intra-household transmission infected people to contacts (24) , which is not considered in this model.","School closure, a major pillar of the response to pandemic influenza A, 14 is unlikely to be effective given the apparent low rate of infection among children, although data are scarce. Avoiding large gatherings of people will reduce the number of super-spreading events; however, if prolonged contact is required for transmission, this measure might only reduce a small proportion of transmissions. Therefore, broader-scale social distancing is likely to be needed, as was put in place in China. This measure prevents transmission from symptomatic and non-symptomatic cases, hence flattening the epidemic and pushing the peak further into the future. Broader-scale social distancing provides time for the health services to treat cases and increase capacity, and, in the longer term, for vaccines and treatments to be developed. Containment could be targeted to particular areas, schools, or mass gatherings. This approach underway in northern Italy will provide valuable data on the effectiveness of such measures. The greater the reduction in transmission, the longer and flatter the epidemic curve (figure), with the risk of resurgence when interventions are lifted perhaps to mitigate economic impact.","Although travel restrictions can be effective in the intervention of infectious disease spread, they are temporary and difficult to sustain in the long term [21] . In the case of travel bans being lifted, a rapid increase in the number of imported cases can be expected. In 2019, air passengers from New Zealand formed the largest group (\u2248 2, 622, 967) of arrivals into Australia, followed by arrivals from China (\u2248 1, 999, 857) States (\u2248 1, 700, 860).

Finally, a minority of states have added closures of non-essential business and stay-at-home orders. By the end of our study period, all states except Arkansas and Mississippi had recommended against or restricted public gatherings, 44 states had closed schools and restricted restaurant operations, nineteen states closed non-essential businesses, and fourteen states issued stay-at-home orders. The final plot on the bottom right highlights the rapid growth in states enacting multiple social distancing measures, as well as the presence of a substantial number of laggard states still lacking most social distancing policies as late as 23 March 2020.","Targeted pharmaceutical interventions for COVID-19 are likely months away. However, supportive measures by healthcare providers are important. Social distancing, including school closures, can limit COVID-19 cases. However, the evidence that the potential transmission reduction benefits of mandatory school closures exceed the costs of potentially imposing greater child care obligations on healthcare workers, thereby reducing the healthcare workforce, is not overwhelming. We provide the first explicit analysis of the school closure tradeoff between case reduction and labor force impact on patient survival probability. A 15% decline in the healthcare labor force, combined with reasonable parameters for COVID-19 such as a 15% case reduction from school closings and 2% baseline mortality rate implies that a 15% loss in the healthcare labor force must decrease the survival probability per percent healthcare worker loss by 17.6% for school closures to increase cumulative mortality. This means that the per infection probability of survival cannot increase by more than 2.4%; otherwise, school closures will lead reduce patient survival. Even if the only objective is to save lives, there is still a tradeoff associated with closing schools due to potential losses in healthcare labor force capacity.","COVID-19 and its effects afford ample evidence of the imperative of bringing health into DRR. The economic fall-out from COVID-19 appears to be profound, at least $20 trillion in a few short weeks, and may exceed the 2008-2009 Great Recession. The direct costs of COVID-19 travel bans, social distancing, and other responses are merely one aspect. Far more devastating is the uncertainty that has gripped capital markets. Declining economic activity and large drops in capital markets have a mutually reinforcing impact, undermining the capacity of heavily indebted businesses and households to cover their debts. Uncertainty is the primary driver of such crises, and stems in large measure from lack of close coordination and science-based decision-making. Were there more certainty, households, investors and other economic agents would be less inclined to panic. COVID-19 appears certain to become a very costly lesson that DRR does indeed save many more multiples in avoided costs than its initial investment. An additional point in this regard is that health is a critical infrastructure. The resilience of critical infrastructure is well identified in DRR literature (e.g. [18, 19] ). Resilience is fostered not just by sciencebased decisions and coordination, but also via redundancy to ensure buffer capacity when a particular system collapses [20] . Disaster-illiterate economic policy tends to see redundancy as inefficiency. But in order to cope with COVID-19 and alleviate -if not prevent -future emergencies, supply chains for at least some critical items need to be more local. In tandem, governments and private businesses will have to broaden their crisis planning to ensure timely availability of items essential to limiting pandemic risks.","The evacuations from Wuhan and the Diamond Princess Cruise ship are not considered in this model, which only examines regular travel between China and Australia. In order to estimate the effectiveness of the travel ban that has been implemented in Australia for travellers from China, we did not consider bans to other countries. We assumed that the chance of cases coming into Australia from China depends from the number of cases in China and the number of travellers to Australia. To estimate the number of people infected that are predicted to enter Australia every two weeks from 20/01 to April, we utilised 2019 air travel passenger movements between China and Australia, derived from incoming passenger arrival cards, with data aggregated monthly and published by the Australia Bureau of Statistics (5) . For the purpose of this analysis air movements of passengers between China and Australia were derived from 2019 data. A baseline level of entries into Australia from China was calculated from the total number of entries over the April -Jun 2019 time period and was assumed to represent the baseline arrivals for the purpose of tourism and other business. The seasonal excess of travellers was then calculated by deducting this baseline from the January-March 2019 data. The seasonal excess arrivals were assumed to represent the arrival of international students starting the 2019 study year, which begins in February to March each year. Where travel bans were instituted in this analysis, or lifted, it was assumed that international students unable to enter Australia would return to Australia following the lifting of the ban, 60% in the rest of March and the remaining 40% over the month of April. However, tourists not able to travel during a travel ban were not assumed to enter Australia at a later date. Tourism activity was assumed to recover to baseline levels immediately after the lifting of a travel ban. The daily number of travellers from China to Australia in each month and for each scenario is showed in Table S2 of the supplementary material.","At this moment, we do not have strong evidence to guide decisions on durations of school closures and how various durations will effect public health. A few days of closure is reasonable in response to school-based cases of COVID-19 for decontamination and contact tracing; while medium to longer lengths of closure (4\u20138 weeks) may be considered as part of a broader community mitigation strategy.11 Extending school closure will likely support the overall effectiveness of social distancing and thus aid in lowering the peak of the epidemic curve. The policy should be balanced between public health benefits and the significant societal consequences.","What we know about social distancing policies is based largely on models of influenza, 4,13 where children are a vulnerable group. However, preliminary data on COVID-19 suggests that children are a small fraction of cases and may be less vulnerable than older adults. 14 If these early results hold-up, then the already uncertain transmission reduction benefits from school closures will be reduced relative to influenza. Conversely, school closures may be implemented earlier in COVID-19 outbreaks, which may lead to greater levels of prevented cases. Furthermore, school closures may lead to other adults staying home, which could reduce cases. These are all important questions when considering school closures.","School closures are a common measure of pandemic mitigation for many countries, driven by the logic that social distancing reduces transmission. [1] [2] [3] Although school closures are known to reduce transmission, previous works have suggested that school closures could have downstream consequences on the healthcare system such as healthcare worker absenteeism. 4, 5 However, lack of granular, high-resolution data has restrained previous studies to providing estimates based on national data with strong assumptions, underscoring the need for more detailed analysis. 3 Newly available demographic and occupational data from the American Community Survey permits county-level scenario analyses of school closures with respect to healthcare worker absenteeism across the United States for the first time.","On January 24, 2020, travel bans began to be instituted by the Chinese government, resulting in restricted travel in and out of Hubei Province, including the city of Wuhan, and fewer travelers undergoing entry screening in the United States. In response to the escalating risks associated with travel from mainland China, on January 31, 2020, the Presidential Proclamation further refined the border health strategy to temporarily suspend entry, undergo additional screening, or possible quarantine for individuals that have visited China (excluding Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan) in the past 14 days. These enhanced entry screening efforts are taking place at 11 airports at which all air travelers from China are being directed.","We simulate our stochastic meta-population model 1000 times to generate estimates of: the cumulative number of imported cases in each country (see Figures 1 and 2 ) and the projected epidemic curves in Australia both in the presence and absence of travel bans.","The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is . https://doi.org/10. 1101 /2020 the measure is also related to challenges in the logistical resources. Comparing with quarantining at a designated place, the advantage of cordon sanitaire is that it tends to keep the community intact, including its basic resources, businesses, and infrastructure. A method that is the opposite of it is called protective sequestration, which means that unaffected communities separate themselves from the outside until there is no risk of an outbreak. Social distancing is a voluntary, recommended restriction on physical contacts, such as staying at home and avoiding public places and activities. Some less drastic, but quite effective and more frequently used measures of social distancing include canceling mass gatherings, school, and workplace closures, travel restrictions, etc. Wilder-Smith (2020) believed that SARS-CoV has now been eliminated, indicating that we can completely stop this epidemic and interrupt person-to-person transmission. In the absence of vaccines and antivirals, only strict implementation of traditional public health measures made this remarkable achievement possible. In the early stages, isolating patients is particularly effective in interrupting the spread of infectious diseases. Since the infected can spread before he is symptomatic, isolation is often too late to prevent transmission and contain the pandemic. Quarantine is one of the oldest and most effective tools for controlling outbreaks of infectious diseases (Cetron &amp; Landwirth, 2005) , which possibly apply at the individual or group level and usually involves restrictions on houses or designated facilities. Social distancing aims to reduce interactions between people in the wider community, where individuals may be contagious but have not yet been identified and therefore have not been isolated. Social distancing is particularly useful where community transmission is considered to be occurring, but the links between cases are unclear, or where restrictions on the known contacts are not considered sufficient to prevent further spread. Social distancing includes closing schools or office buildings, suspending public markets, and canceling gathering. If these measures are considered inadequate, then a community-wide containment is likely to be required. A community-wide containment is an intervention that applies to an entire community, city, or region, aiming to reduce physical contact between people. Implementing a community-wide containment requires close partnerships and cooperation with law enforcement agencies at the local and state levels, and inspection stations are usually established, and legal penalties may be required if there is a violation.","It is likely that governors will face this difficult decision again. Governors may choose to roll back social distancing at different points in time. Some experts contend that authorities will need to alternate between two months of social distancing and one month of restored freedoms to reduce the likelihood that health systems are overwhelmed by severe cases until a vaccine is developed, produced, and circulated. (3; 44) This implies state governments will be asked to impose difficult social distancing policies not once, but many times. Each instance will be a test of whether states can act promptly to prevent COVID-19 cases from peaking at unmanageable levels. If Republican governors and states with Republican majorities continue to lag behind, the cumulative impact on those states, and on the country as whole through spillovers, could be vast. Baseline hazards are stratified across the five pooled social distancing measures: recommendations and restrictions on gatherings, school closures, restaurant restrictions, non-essential business closures, and stay-at-home orders. Each row shows the hazard ratio for (the counterfactual change in) the covariate listed at the left. Counterfactual changes are chosen to simplify comparison of hazard ratios for covariates with different scales of measurement. Covariates with both 95% confidence limits below 1.0 significantly reduce the chance of adopting an additional social distancing measure. Standard errors used to compute confidence intervals are clustered by state. The concordance index shows the proportion of all pairs of states for which the model correctly predicts which state will adopt a given social distancing mandate first. Schoenfeld residuals show no evidence of violation of proportionality for any covariate. The Efron method is used to resolve ties.","Diagnostic tests for 2019-nCoV are already available internationally. As a marker of global forward planning, the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium has prepared standard forms and these were used to record data in the Lancet report on initially affected patients [5] . The ECDC and the WHO Regional Office for Europe are coordinating the rapid reporting of data [9] . Public health measures in place in China since late January include bans on travel from the city of Wuhan, with overall 15 cities -a population of 57 million -under full or partial travel lockdown [11] , major sporting events cancelled and gatherings banned, including for weddings and birthdays, and limits on how many family members can leave home each day. On 28th January 2020, Hong Kong announced closure of many border crossings with mainland China [8] . USA, Japan, Russia and Australia and many other countries have now closed their borders to arrivals from China. Checks are now in place at many international airports for symptoms and fever in travelers from China, with international 14 day quarantine for travellers at risk. With remarkable speed, new 10 0 0 bed containment hospital for suspected coronavirus cases was built and opened in Wuhan on 3rd February and a further new 1500 bed hospital is under construction.","Although we also coded implementation dates for each of these policies, our focus is on the dates policies were announced, for two reasons. First, we expect much of the effect of these emergency measures on social behavior to be immediate. The state's power to compel socially responsible behavior is often said to act through \"quasi-voluntary compliance,\" in which most citizens choose pro-social behaviors given a cue from the state that is backed with the threat of sanction. (21) This effect should be all the stronger to the extent people treat costly social distancing measures as a credible signal of the viral threat. Second, our focus is on predicting the timing of governor's actions, which naturally points to announcement dates, rather than implementation dates which may be delayed (in the case of school closures, for example), by weekends and spring breaks. Figure 1 displays the timing of different states' adoptions of these five social distancing policies over the four-week study period. No state acted before 10 March, a full thirteen days after the first report of community transmission, yet by 15 March, uptake was rapid across states. In general, states typically started social distancing through recommendations or restrictions on public gatherings, then turned to restrictions on schools 2 We include recommendations in this category for two reasons: first, this was often the first action states took, and early actors did not always revisit these policies with a restrictive mandate; second, the target of these measures was typically large events that would be unlikely to maintain viable attendance under the cloud of a state recommendation to cancel events.","China We acquired epidemiological data from an open source GitHub project 1 that scrapes time series data from Ding Xiang Yuan. We extended this dataset back in time to January 10 by manually collecting official daily statistics from the central and provincial (Hubei, Guangdong, and Zhejiang) Chinese government websites. We compiled policies by collecting data on the start dates of travel bans and lockdowns at the city-level from the \"2020 Hubei lockdowns\" Wikipedia page 2 , the Wuhan Coronavirus Timeline project on Github 3 , and various other news reports. As we suspect that most Chinese cities have been treated by at least one anti-contagion policy, due to their reported trends in infections, we have dropped cities where we cannot find a policy deployment date to avoid miscategorizing the policy status of cities.","We generate the imputed daily air-travel volume for the epidemic period, taking into account yearly increases in flight numbers and the impact of travel bans, using two data sources: monthly air-travel volume data from BlueDot 18 for each origin airport i as a result of yearly increase in air travel as well as travel bans , \u03b3 i implemented in late January 2020 as the following: CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license It is made available under a author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.","Another part of the literature assesses the effectiveness and the scope of application of public health policies. Rothstein &amp; Talbott (2007) found that to make quarantine to be the most effective measure for limiting the spread of infection, compliance with quarantine regulations should be encouraged, that is, providing job security and income replacement. Wang et al. (2012) found that In the case of short reaction time, intra-population, such as patient isolation, are more effective than inter-population such as travel restrictions. Jefferson (2008) pandemic influenza (H1N1) and found those were effective to some extent. Rashid (2015) researched the public health policy of the 2009 pandemic influenza and concluded that the school closure, whether positive or passive, seemed to be moderately effective and acceptable in reducing the spread of influenza and delaying the peak of the epidemic, but it is related to high expenses of secondary school. Voluntary isolation and quarantine at home are also effective and acceptable measures, but it takes the risk of intra-household transmission from index cases to contacts. Workplace-related interventions, such as work closure and work at home, are also moderately effective and acceptable, but it may have negatively impact on economy. Internal mobility restriction is only effective when extremely high restrictions (50% of travel) are imposed and mass gatherings which happened within 10 days before the epidemic peak is likely to increase the risk of transmission of influenzas. Rothstein (2015) compared the effectiveness of public health policies to intervene with infectious diseases, among which quarantine is one of the most aggressive and controversial measures that public health officials can take when trying to control an outbreak. Serious legal and ethical concerns have been raised because of restrictions on the movement of potentially large numbers of people (Fidler et al., 2007) . During the SARS epidemic in 2003, quarantine was widely used in several Asian countries and Canada, and it played a role in ending the epidemic. Similarly, during the 2014 Ebola outbreak in West Africa, social distancing measures, including quarantine, had become a major containment strategy. The paradox of quarantine and other social distancing measures is that they may effectively resist the outbreak of disease, but the scope of application is too wide, leading to various social hazards, including economic disruption, physical isolation and even violence. Quarantine is the first public health tool to control infectious diseases and remains a legitimate and valuable public health strategy because it has a significant impact on civil liberties, economic activity and social cohesion, so officials must be extra careful about the possibility of abusing quarantine authority (Rothstein, 2015) .","By providing a rigorous estimation of the impact of within and cross-city migration on the spread of the 2019-nCoV virus in China, our study contributes to fast-growing literature on 2019-nCoV infection, mostly in the medical and public health fields. Huang et al. (2020) describe high rates of respiratory distress, intensive care admission, and abnormal findings on chest computed tomography (CT) in the first 41 patients hospitalized from December 16 to January 2 in Wuhan, as well as a 15% death rate. Chan et al. (2020) investigate a family cluster and confirm the human-to-human transmission of this Novel Coronavirus within hospitals and families. The basic reproduction number (R0) for COVID-19 in 12 studies has a mean of 3.28 and a median of 2.79 (Liu et al., 2020 ) (compared to 3 for SARS (WTO, 2003) ). This study is also related to disaster-induced migration, which has often occurred during flooding (Gray and Mueller, 2012) , drought (Munshi, 2003) , earthquake (Lu et al., 2012) , and other destructive climatic phenomena. Given that the 2019-nCoV has rapidly spread worldwide due to human travel and caused severe illness and significant mortality, it is therefore essential to understand the impact of various control measures on human mobility and the virus transmission. Qiu et al. (2020) apply machine learning tools and use exogenous temperature, wind speed, and precipitation in the preceding third and fourth weeks as the instruments to show that the massive lockdown and other control measures significantly reduced the virus transmission. Their results highlight that the population outflow from the outbreak source city poses higher risks to the destination cities than other social and economic factors, such as geographic proximity and similarity in economic conditions. Our results are also in line with the results of the latest modeling exercises, which mostly rely on model calibrations of various parameters, such as generation time, incubation period, detection rates, and changes in travel flow. Using the Global Epidemic and Mobility model, Chinazzi et al. (2020) project the impact of travel limitation on the national and international spread of the 2019-nCoV. The study finds that only 24.4% of infected cases were reported as of February 1, and the Wuhan lockdown reduced the cases by 10% in cities outside Wuhan by January 31. The study most closely related to ours is Li et al. (2020) , which shows that contagious but undocumented COVID-19 cases facilitated the geographic spread of the epidemic in China. Using a networked dynamic meta-population model and Bayesian inference, Li et al. (2020) find that 86% of all infections were undocumented before the Wuhan lockdown and reported infections would have been reduce by 78.7% in China, without transmission from undocumented cases between January 10 and January 23. Lai et al. (2020) build a travel network-based susceptibleexposed-infectious-removed (SEIR) model to simulate the outbreak across cities in mainland China. They use epidemiological parameters estimated from the early stage of outbreak in Wuhan to parameterize the transmission before the non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPI) were implemented. The NPIs they consider include travel bans and restrictions, contact reductions and social distancing, early case identification and isolation. Through their sim-ulations, they find that the NPIs deployed in China appear to be effectively containing the COVID-19 outbreak, but the efficacy of the different interventions varied, with the early case detection and contact reduction being the most effective. Moreover, deploying the NPIs early is also important to prevent further spread. Relative to our study, it is important to point out that in their simulations, they assumed that the pattern of population movements was the same in years when there were no outbreaks and interventions. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first to provide a causal interpretation of the impact of city lockdown on human mobility and the spread of 2019-nCoV, and to clearly disentangle the lockdown effects from other potential contributing factors such as panic and virus effect, as well as the seasonal Spring Festival effect (see Section 3).","is the (which was not peer-reviewed) The copyright holder for this preprint . https://doi.org /10.1101 /10. /2020 The French government website contains a timeline of all national policy measures. Each regional 57 public health agency ( l'Agence R\u00e9gionale de Sant\u00e9 ) in France posts press releases with information on the policies the r\u00e9gion or d\u00e9partements within the r\u00e9gion will implement to mitigate the spread and impact of the COVID-19 outbreak. The Wikipedia page on the 2020 coronavirus pandemic in France 58 has collated information on the major policy measures taken in response to the Starting February 29, 2020, France banned mass gatherings of more than 5,000 people nationwide, while some major sporting events were cancelled and a handful of schools closed to mitigate the spread of the virus. As more COVID-19 cases were confirmed during the following week, additional sporting events were canceled, more schools decided to close, and certain cities and d\u00e9partements limited mass gatherings to no more than 50 people, excluding shops, business, restaurants, bars, weddings, and funerals. Some r\u00e9gions closed early childhood establishments (e.g. nurseries, daycare centers) and prohibited visitors to elderly care facilities. On March 8, 2020, France banned mass gatherings of more than 1,000 people nationwide. Other schools, cities, and d\u00e9partements followed suit with additional school closures and limiting mass gatherings. On March 11, 2020 , France prohibited all visits to elder care establishments. Starting March 16, 2020 , France closed all schools nationwide.","Following the WHO global alert, and a stronger emergency travel advisory issued by WHO on March 15, 2003 , almost all countries with imported cases were able to either prevent any further transmission or keep the number of additional cases small. Exit screening via thermal scanners was done for all departing passengers at all airports of affected countries. Many countries also implemented entry screening for all passengers arriving from affected areas. After all these measures were implemented, new imported cases of SARS did not trigger new outbreaks as systems were in place to identify and isolate them early. 27 No travel bans were implemented at any time, but travel advisories to avoid nonessential travel to countries affected by SARS were issued by several governments. The psychological effects of SARS, coupled with travel restrictions imposed by various national and international authorities, resulted in a major economic loss for the airline industry and world economy in 2003, far beyond the main areas affected by SARS. 28","At the time of writing, data on air-travel volume were not available for the pre-lockdown epidemic period and total epidemic period, which we considered to be from 8 December 2019 (date of epidemic seeding in Wuhan) to 23 January 2020 and from 8 December 2019 to 28 February 2020, respectively. Historical air-travel volume data are likely not representative of the epidemic time period for two reasons : 1) Lunar New Year was earlier than in preceding years (25 January 2020), and 2) large-scale travel bans and flight cancellations took place in late January 2020. We therefore combined monthly historical air-travel volume data with recent daily flight departure data to estimate daily air-travel volume out of cities in China to our destinations of interest during the total epidemic period, as described in the Supplement.","We obtain data on China's policy response to the COVID-19 pandemic by culling data on the start dates of travel bans and lockdowns at the city-level from the \"2020 Hubei lockdowns\" Wikipedia page, the Wuhan Coronavirus Timeline project on Github, and various news reports.","The Times of Israel. Israel bans foreigners coming from East Asian countries over virus fears. https://www.timesofisrael.com/israel-bans-foreigners-coming-from-east-asian-countries-over-virusfears/.","Initial outbreak sizes were among the key determinants for the success of isolation. 2 months ago, the world knew almost nothing about COVID-19, and Wuhanthe epicentre of the outbreak-did not have the luxury of early detection and response. Challenged by the reality that earlier opportunities had been missed, China launched a costly public health response in Wuhan, which involved many tactics besides isolation of cases and contacts, including lockdown of the city and mass quarantine, social distancing mandates, school closures, and intense case finding and contact tracing by the medical and public health professionals who were mobilised across the country to come to Wuhan. [2] [3] [4] The approach in Wuhan and the nearby cities in Hubei Province took exceptional measures in response to the outbreak, because there was evidence of high-level community transmission and widespread nosocomial infections. 5 As of Feb 11, 2020, 3019 COVID-19 cases among health workers had been reported, with at least five deaths. 5,6 In many regions outside of China, decision makers and the medical community still have the opportunity of early detection and response. 2 The Article by Hellewell and colleagues gives us a clearer sense of how quickly the window for early response is closing: when the number of initial cases increases to 40, the probability of failure to control is high, at 80% even with 80% of contacts traced and isolated. Based on the early experience in Wuhan, the number of COVID-19 cases could increase from 20 to 40 cases within 3 days (from Jan 6-8, 2020), and outbreak sizes doubled in every 7\u00b74 days on average, highlighting the urgency of early detection and rapid response. 7 In Hellewell and colleagues' model, transmission before symptoms, even when the percentage is moderate, at 15-30%, had a marked effect on probability to control. 1 Unlike the severe acute respiratory syndrome virus, where almost all onward transmissions occur after symptom onset, 8 we now know that transmission of COVID-19 virus can occur before symptom onset. In the fifth version of Chinese guidelines governing contact tracing, it defined close contacts as \"those who have been in close contact since 2 days before the onset of symptoms in suspected and confirmed cases, or 2 days prior to an asymptomatic confirmed case,\" which reflects our current understanding that secondary transmission of COVID-19 virus is possible at least 2 days before symptom onset. 9 However, the efficiency of transmission remains uncertain, and seroprevalence studies among different contacts will be important. Transmission by people with no or mild symptoms can dampen the power of the isolation strategy because of reduced likelihood of isolating all cases and tracing all contacts. The identification and testing of potential cases need to be as extensive as is permitted by health care and diagnostic testing capacity-including the identification, testing, and isolation of suspected cases with no or mild disease (eg, influenza-like illness).","With 565 confirmed cases (3) and still counting, COVID-19 now looks certain to cause sustained local transmission within Australia. Therefore, at this time it is reasonable to reflect on the value of travel restrictions imposed to date, and to consider the benefit of ongoing travel restrictions in the coming weeks and months, when community transmission starts to increase. We answer these questions using OAG-travel data and a meta-population model for disease transmission. First we examine the counterfactuals: what would have happened had the travel ban from Wuhan/China not been implemented. Similarly we examine the impacts of bans to other emerging epicentres including Iran, Italy, and South Korea. We then examine the impacts for the future and compare the cases expected through community transmission, and from importation over the next 2 months.","Gilbert and colleagues' modelling study 3 of the risk of COVID-19 importation from China indicates that the ability of African countries to manage local transmission of COVID-19 after importation hinges on implementing stringent measures of detection, prevention, and control. Nigeria demonstrated its ability through intensifying its preparedness against COVID-19 importation, drawing on recent successes in controlling polio and Ebola epidemics. 4 These experiences strengthened the health system's capacity to rapidly deploy high-quality surveillance and temperature screening at airports using equipment acquired during the Ebola epidemic; collect passengers' contact details and interview those arriving from COVID-19 hotspots; and issue travel bans. 1 However, unlike polio and Ebola, for which vaccines now exist, 5 COVID-19 has neither a vaccine nor an approved treatment. Moreover, Gilbert and colleagues' modelling rated Nigeria as vulnerable to exposing huge populations to COVID-19 (potentially 200 million citizens), with a moderate capacity to control the outbreak. 3 This assessment questions Nigeria's capacity to provide sufficient bed space and associated clinical care to support those who could need isolation and quarantine if local cycles of transmission of COVID-19 occur in the country.","We first validate our model by comparing estimates of imported cases provided by the model simulations with reported values as at January 31 st 2020 (see Figure 1 ). We find that our metapopulation model accurately reproduces reported observations for many countries -in particular, Australia -however estimates become increasingly unreliable for countries with significant migration volumes with China. Variation between model predictions and observation can be partially accounted for by stochastic variation and potential under-reporting. 2020, our model estimates that Australia would have received over 70 imported cases of COVID-19 compared with the 15 cases that were actually observed. This represents a 79% reduction in expected cases, and similar to what was estimated elsewhere (6) . However, the introduction of travel bans on international passengers arriving from Iran, South Korea and Italy, does not lead to a significant decrease in the expected COVID-19 importation count to Australia. One reason for this is that the much lower prevalence in these countries compared with China. Furthermore, Italy had already placed itself on lock down by the time Australia enforced restrictions on travelers arriving from Italy. Finally, we explored the effects of travel ban and other intervention -such as reducing contacts to lower the basic reproduction number -on delaying widespread local transmission within Australia. We found that without travel bans, Australia would have experienced local transmission as early as Jan 15 and possibly have become the Pacific epicenter. However, with the China travel ban in place, this delayed the widespread occurrence of local transmission by approximately one month (see Figure  3 ). Thus, if interventions are in place that can reduce the reproduction number to 1.73 (in-line with China's response) local transmission can be further delayed by another 5 weeks (Figure 3 ). Overlaying the simulation prediction with observed local cases in Australia suggesting more needs to be done to slow down the virus in Australia.","We recognize that conference cancellations may have a severe impact on organizations\u2019 and societies\u2019 finances, though we ask that they endeavor to issue refunds of registration fees promptly. If needed, refunds should be prioritized for those researchers who are most likely to be experiencing financial hardship in this difficult time. Researchers from countries with limited funding, graduate students and postdoctoral researchers tend to be the lowest paid and are perhaps more likely to have covered the costs of attending these meetings out of their own pocket (Malloy, 2020). These groups\u2019 risk of financial hardship may be exacerbated by the fact that those with limited resources are often obligated to book the cheapest flights and accommodation, which may not be eligible for refunding or rebooking. For meetings that are not canceled, refunds of registration fees should be given to those who are unable to attend due to travel bans, or who choose not to attend for reasons of personal safety and public health."],"title":["The Effect of Large-Scale Anti-Contagion Policies on the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Pandemic","An Ounce of Prevention: Coronavirus (COVID-19) and Mass Gatherings","Impact of self-imposed prevention measures and short-term government intervention on mitigating and delaying a COVID-19 epidemic","The effectiveness of full and partial travel bans against COVID-19 spread in Australia for travellers from China.","Effect of non-pharmaceutical interventions for containing the COVID-19 outbreak in China","The Effect of Large-Scale Anti-Contagion Policies on the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Pandemic","Delaying the COVID-19 epidemic in Australia: Evaluating the effectiveness of international travel bans","The current state of COVID-19 in Australia: importation and spread","Global versus focused isolation during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic-A cost-effectiveness analysis","Outbreak of a new coronavirus: what anaesthetists should know","How to evaluate the success of the COVID-19 measures implemented by the Norwegian government by analyzing changes in doubling time","Effect of non-pharmaceutical interventions for containing the COVID-19 outbreak in China","The effect of control strategies that reduce social mixing on outcomes of the COVID-19 epidemic in Wuhan, China","Assessing the Impact of Reduced Travel on Exportation Dynamics of Novel Coronavirus Infection (COVID-19)","Pandemic Politics: Timing State-Level Social Distancing Responses to COVID-19","Assessing the impact of reduced travel on exportation dynamics of novel coronavirus infection (COVID-19)","The effectiveness of full and partial travel bans against COVID-19 spread in Australia for travellers from China.","Optimal timing for social distancing during an epidemic","The Effect of Large-Scale Anti-Contagion Policies on the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Pandemic","The effectiveness of full and partial travel bans against COVID-19 spread in Australia for travellers from China.","How will country-based mitigation measures influence the course of the COVID-19 epidemic?","The current state of COVID-19 in Australia: importation and spread","The Effect of Large-Scale Anti-Contagion Policies on the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Pandemic","Pandemic Politics: Timing State-Level Social Distancing Responses to COVID-19","The Impact of School Closure for COVID-19 on the US Healthcare Workforce and the Net Mortality Effects","Building resilience against biological hazards and pandemics: COVID-19 and its implications for the Sendai Framework","The effectiveness of full and partial travel bans against COVID-19 spread in Australia for travellers from China.","Are We Ready for Coronavirus Disease 2019 Arriving at Schools?","The Impact of School Closure for COVID-19 on the US Healthcare Workforce and the Net Mortality Effects","Healthcare worker absenteeism, child care costs, and COVID-19 school closures: a simulation analysis","Initial Public Health Response and Interim Clinical Guidance for the 2019 Novel Coronavirus Outbreak \u2014 United States, December 31, 2019\u2013February 4, 2020","Delaying the COVID-19 epidemic in Australia: Evaluating the effectiveness of international travel bans","Which Measures are Effective in Containing COVID-19?
