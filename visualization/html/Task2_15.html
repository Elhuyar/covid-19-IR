These factors include male sex, comorbid pre-existing illnesses (such as obesity, diabetes mellitus, cancer, chronic heart, lung, and kidney disease, and immunocompromised states), low serum albumin, thrombocytopenia, lymphopenia, concomitant infections, and positive plasma MERS-CoV RNA. DPP4 receptors are upregulated in the lungs of smokers and patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, which might explain why patients with comorbid lung diseases are prone to severe illness. 118 In the 2015 Korean outbreak, the case-fatality rate was 20\u00b74% (39 of 186 patients died), the in-hospital mortality was 19\u00b74% (36 of 186 patients), 7-day mortality (from symptom onset) was 3\u00b78% (seven of 186), and 28-day mortality was 17\u00b77% (33 of 186). 11, 12 Host factors associated with mortality in this outbreak were older age (&gt;60 years), smoking history, pre-existing pneumonia, abnormal renal function, and comorbidity. Low albumin, altered mentality, and high pneumonia severity index score at admission were risk factors for mortality.","The following demographic variables and pre-existing medical conditions were collected for all study participants: age, sex, ethnicity, educational level, smoking, alcohol consumption, pregnancy in women aged 15-49 years, history of pneumonia in the last two years, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma, cardiovascular disease, renal failure, diabetes, HIV infection, disabling neurological disease, neoplasia, transplantation, morbid obesity (body mass index [BMI] \u2265 40), treatment with systemic corticosteroids and inhaled corticosteroids, and antibiotic treatment within 90 days prior to admission.","In terms of pre-existing medical conditions, cardiovascular diseases had the highest prevalence among diseases that put patients at higher risk of SARS-CoV-2 threats. Decreasing the pro-inflammatory cytokines, which leads to a weaker immune function may account for this condition (2, 22). It is worth noting that similar results were found regarding MERS (23). We also found that smokers are more susceptible to Coronavirus infections, especially to the most recent species. Various reasons may justify this happening. It has been mentioned that smokers have unregulated ACE2 in remodeled cell types, which is consistent with results of SARS studies. However, factors such as amount of smoking, the duration of smoking, and the duration of smoking cessation also play a role. In some previous studies on MERS-CoV-2 it has been shown that dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP4), which is the specific receptor for this virus, had a higher rate of expression in smokers and COPD patients (24). ","The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03. 23.20041848 doi: medRxiv preprint We combined all the lung-related disease (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, chronic pneumonia, lung cancer etc.) as an integrated category, called lung disease. The total number of pre-existing comorbidities was defined as the total number of pre-existing among hypertension, coronary heart disease (CHD), chronic bronchitis, lung disease and diabetes, ranging from zero to four.","In 2002, about 30% of the world's cigarettes were manufactured and consumed in China, 30 which had worldwide to the seventh-highest by 2030. The burden of COPD in China was greater than that in developed Western countries, and it ranked second among chronic diseases as a leading cause of DALYs lost in 2001 ( Fig 2 ) . 29 be attributed to passive smoking. 40 In contrast to these fi ndings, no signifi cant association between COPD and passive smoking was revealed in other localized surveys. 7, 11, 40 In the survey conducted by Yang et al, 43 about 74% of the smokers indicated that they did not want to quit, which may be partly because of ignorance about the harmful effects of smoking. About 20% of the smokers had intended to quit smoking at least once, of which about one-half reverted to smoking. 43, 44 Smoking cessation has been the most cost-effective intervention in COPD management, 1 and the importance of effective tobacco-control programs cannot be emphasized too strongly. Men and women who stopped smoking in 2003 were expected to lower their absolute risks of COPD by 56% and 63% after 5 years relative to those who continued smoking. 45 Antismoking education should focus the public's attention on the risk of active and passive smoking, as well as the expense of smoking, especially among the poor. 46 ","A lack of awareness about biomarkers and risk factors for COPD among physicians had led to delayed diagnosis and interventions for patients. Early diagnosis may help patients quit smoking and lead to the adoption of effective therapies to prevent progres- monary physicians, showed that expectorants were the most often prescribed medications, followed by b 2 -agonists and anticholinergics. 97 Instead of longacting bronchodilators, more than one-half of the patients were prescribed short-or medium-acting bronchodilators, which was inconsistent with the guidelines. 81 Most of the physicians underused oxygen therapy, noninvasive intermittent positive pressure ventilation, and antiinfl ammation therapy. 82 Only 20% of the primary care physicians were fully knowledgeable about pharmacologic therapies for COPD. 98 Prospects COPD represents a challenging issue because of its impact on both personal and public health and its economic consequences. There is an urgent need to understand the present and future burden of COPD in China from well-designed epidemiologic studies on its prevalence and morbidity. Because of ethnic differences, studies on genetic susceptibility to COPD among the Chinese population should be carried out to improve prevention and lead to early diagnosis. Because China is the world's largest cigarette manufacturer and because it is the world's largest consumer of cigarettes, there is a great challenge to restrict and regulate smoking in China with an intent to reduce the burden of COPD. During the last decade, smoking prevention and cessation programs have been implemented widely and preliminary results have been observed ( Tables 2, 3 ) . 29, 99, 100 However, there are many factors affecting the execution of smoking laws and regulations by the government. Rural workers, teenagers, and women with high or rising rates of smoking need to be targeted specifi cally for tobaccocontrol measures. The existing public health policies should be strengthened and new strategies, including raising taxes and the price of cigarettes, should be put into effect. On the other hand, physicians should take the leading role in the fi ght against smoking. It has been found that about 40% of male physicians are current smokers, 101 which adds to the diffi culty of smoking control. patients diagnosed with COPD received a spirometry test. [6] [7] [8] In 185 previously diagnosed COPD patients, 67 were confi rmed by spirometry based on diagnostic criteria, 47 had normal lung function, and 63 had mixed ventilation disorder. 88 Profound underuse of spirometry was considered to be a barrier to decent care of Chinese COPD patients. 89 Barriers hindering use of spirometry in clinical practice include ignorance of the crucial role of spirometry, facility inaccessibility, and limited budgets, especially in most of the primary care settings.","Data on pre-existing conditions were reported for seven cases; five had no pre-existing conditions while one was reported to be obese and one had pre-existing cardiac disease. No data on clinical signs e.g. dyspnea etc. were reported for any of the 38 cases.","\u2022 Smoking: smoking cessation reduces in a half the risk of suffering a CAP in the following five years (Level I). The episode of pneumonia must be taken into advantage for persuading the patient about the risks of smoking and provide him with the available resources to help him to stop smoking (Level III). \u2022 Anti-flu vaccination: it is efficient to prevent or reduce the infection by the virus of flu (Level I). It reduces in a half the incidence of pneumonia and hospitalization, and mortality in 68% (Level I). \u2022 Anti-S. pneumoniae vaccination: there has not been demonstrated a reduction in the risk of CAP by S. pneumoniae, but a reduction of 44% in the incidence of bacteraemia has been found (Level I).","Although public attention often focuses on CDC's infectious diseases and preparedness activities, most Americans will die from chronic diseases, such as heart disease, cancer, chronic lower respiratory diseases, and stroke. Common underlying risk factors for these conditions include tobacco use, uncontrolled hypertension, poor diet, physical inactivity, and high blood cholesterol. Surveillance systems supported by CDC, including the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, and the National Health Interview Survey, measure the prevalence of these conditions and risk factors and track these data over time. The Million Hearts Initiative, led by CDC and including other federal partners, aims to prevent 1 million heart attacks and strokes between 2012 and 2017 through a combination of public health interventions (reduction of smoking and intake of trans fat and sodium) and clinical interventions (improved blood pressure control and hypertension management, increasing aspirin use for high-risk individuals). CDC also leads the National Diabetes Prevention Program, a public-private partnership to prevent or delay the onset of type 2 diabetes in persons with pre-diabetes.","Post-transplant malignancies \u25a0 Transplant recipients have an increased risk of some malignant neoplasms after transplantation as a consequence of the immunosuppressive drug therapy \u25a0 The neoplasms may be recurrence of pre-existing cancers in recipients, donor-transmitted, or de novo malignancies \u25a0 Skin cancer, including squamous cell carcinoma, melanoma, and basal cell carcinoma, occurs up to 20 times more frequently in transplant recipients than in the general population \u25a0 De novo malignancies include Kaposi's sarcoma, lymphomas and squamous cell carcinomas of the skin and lip, and carcinoma of the cervix, external genitalia, and perineum \u25a0 These malignancies can be virally induced, such as HPV-associated carcinoma of the cervix, HHV-8 associated Kaposi's sarcoma, and EBV-associated post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease (PTLD) and lymphomas \u25a0 Some malignancies are seen more frequently in certain subpopulations of transplant recipients, according to pre-existing risk factors or behaviours, such as oropharyngeal and lung cancer in those with alcoholism and those who smoke, or colon cancer in patients with pre-existing inflammatory bowel disease transplanted for primary sclerosing cholangitis. Post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) \u25a0 Post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) is a relatively uncommon but serious complication of transplantation \u25a0 PTLD forms a heterogeneous group of tumours, ranging from benign B-cell hyperplasia to immunoblastic malignant lymphoma \u25a0 The incidence of PTLD varies with the type of transplanted allograft but is generally about 2%, and most cases develop within the first year after transplantation \u25a0 The more intense the immunosuppression used, the higher the incidence of PTLD, and the earlier it appears \u25a0 PTLD is usually associated with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection. Risk factors include recipient pre-transplant EBV seronegativity and donor EBV seropositivity. \u25a0 Clinical presentation of PTLD is very variable and includes fever, lymphadenopathy, gastrointestinal symptoms, infectious mononucleosis-like syndrome that can be fulminant, pulmonary symptoms, CNS symptoms and weight loss \u25a0 The presentation and clinical course are variable; at one end of the spectrum is aggressive disease with diffuse involvement, at the other end of the spectrum are localised lesions that are indolent and slow, growing over months, as opposed to days or weeks \u25a0 The most common sites involved are lymph nodes, liver, lung, kidney, bone marrow, small intestine, and spleen. Diagnosis A diagnosis of PTLD is made by having: \u25a0 a high index of suspicion in the appropriate clinical setting \u25a0 histopathological evidence of lymphoproliferation \u25a0 EBV-DNA, RNA, or viral protein in the biopsy tissue. Treatment \u25a0 Treatment is reduction or withdrawal of immunosuppression, plus ganciclovir therapy \u25a0 Other treatment modalities that can be employed additionally include: \u2022 rituximab -a new anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody \u2022 interferon alpha \u2022 immunoglobulin \u2022 surgical excision \u2022 radiation therapy \u2022 chemotherapy.","As shown in Table 1 , 51.65% of the 788 enrolled patients were male, with low rate of smoking (6.85%). The top three co-existing conditions were hypertension (15.99%), diabetes (7.23%) and chronic liver disease (3.93%). The median period from illness onset to outpatient visiting, PCR confirmation and hospital admission were 2, 4 and 3 days, respectively. The most common symptoms were fever (80.71%) and cough (64.21%) while the highest rate of CT/X-ray manifestation was bilateral pneumonia (37.56%). The rates of mild, sever and critical types of COVID-19 were 90.1%, 7.74% and 2.16%, respectively. The ZJ01 patient is male, 30y, and had neither smoking history nor any co-existing condition. He visited outpatient clinics 1 day after symptom onset and was admitted in hospital confirming with COVID-19 in the same day by PCR test. He had no exposure history to Wuhan and none of his family members was reported to be virus positive till now. Consistent with other COVID-19 patients, he had the symptoms of fever, cough and sputum production, with CT image showing bilateral pneumonia. This .

We speculate that the increased expression of ACE2 in the lungs of smokers could partially contribute to the severe cases of COVID-19 that have been observed in this population. In support of this hypothesis, mice that were engineered to express high levels of human ACE2 succumbed to infections with a related coronavirus more quickly than mice that expressed low levels of human ACE2 9 . Nonetheless, the relevance of increased ACE2 expression as a driver of disease susceptibility in humans or for SARS-CoV-2 remains to be demonstrated. Chronic smokers may exhibit a number of co-morbidities, including emphysema, atherosclerosis, and decreased immune function 86 , that are also likely to affect COVID-19 progression. While the effects of smoking can last for years, smoking cessation causes an improvement in lung function and an overall decrease in disease burden 86 . Interestingly, quitting smoking also leads to a normalization of respiratory epithelial architecture 87 , a decrease in hyperplasia 88 , and a downregulation of ACE2 levels. Thus, for multiple reasons, smoking cessation could eventually lessen the risks associated with SARS-CoV-2 infections.","Here, factors such as pre-existing mental illness, self-and extraneous endangerment, violence and aggressive behavior, refusal to eat, and also assessments and recommendations of experienced security staff should be taken into account. -Given the flood of perceivable unsettling information on Covid-19, staff providing psychological or psychiatric treatment should be informed regularly and urgently about symptomatology and presentation and on the realistic clinical course, also in comparison to other infectious diseases or in comparison to other daily risks. Sharing of accurate information without bias and panic is critical. -Ensuring the provision of masks, disinfectants and protective measures in sufficient quantity for psychological and psychiatric staff visiting individuals in detention. -Particular attention should also be paid to certify that staff deployed to provide psychological-psychiatric care in institutions are informed and/or sensitized of known potential risk factors for a more severe course of a Covid-19 infection of their own (advanced age, somatic comorbidities, chronic respiratory diseases, hypertension, cancer, known immune deficiencies etc.). Due to the currently limited understanding of Covid-19, it may be advisable to prohibit employees with such conditions from providing psychological or psychiatric care to individuals in detention and prisons. -If there is a sudden shortage of staff providing psychological and psychiatric care to detained individuals with a mental illness, staff from general psychiatry may have to fill consequential gaps. This needs careful planning on an urgent basis so that the potential of extremely long working hours of medical staff during the current outbreak can be managed successfully.","(The cost of cigarettes per pack varied from $0.294 to $33.971 in China 37 ). Smoking has been recognized as the most important causative factor in the pathogenesis of COPD. 38 In 2005, a total of 673,000 deaths were attributed to smoking in China, whereas 268,000, 146,200, and 66,800 deaths were attributed to cancer, cardiovascular disease, and respiratory disease, respectively. 39 In another case-control study, conducted from 2000 to 2001 in Nanjing, a signifi cant dose-response relationship between COPD and total amount of cigarettes smoked was detected after adjusting for other risk factors. The study further showed that women smokers were more susceptible to COPD. 21, 40 Because of a diversity of methodologies and exposure assessment criteria, there are confl icting results regarding an association between passive smoking and the risk of COPD. The aim of the Biobank Cohort Study was to demonstrate that the high prevalence of COPD among Chinese nonsmokers is the result of a positive dose-response relationship between passive smoking exposure and any respiratory symptom. 41, 42 It was estimated that 1.9 million excessive deaths from COPD without smoking could 45, 54 Along with rapid development of the economy and urbanization in most rural areas, indoor air pollution and ventilation in the kitchen would be gradually improved and the negative infl uence of biomass fuel use on health would be expected to decrease.","The personal data and clinical data of patients included in the study were collected. Personal data included sex, age, epidemiological history, history of smoking, and comorbidities [e.g., chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), cancer, hypertension and/or diabetes].","Concerning smoking and COVID-19, our data showed a pooled prevalence of 9% current smokers, (95% CI, 4%-14%), lower than the reported prevalence of smoking in China that was 25.2% (25. (18, 29) . The impact of smoking history on vulnerability to COVID-19 has been explored but there is limited data on the contribution of tobacco smoking to the spread of and poor outcome in COVID-19. A recent systematic review on COVID-19 and smoking including five studies found that smoking was most likely associated with the negative outcomes. This recommended further research to explore this in more detail due to limited studies (32) . Evidence from other respiratory viruses, respiratory syncytial virus, has shown that inhaled tobacco smoke raises the transmission rate and severity of viral respiratory tract infections (53) . It seems there is underlying mechanisms behind this prevalence, as smoking has been related to higher expression of ACE2 (the receptor for SARS-CoV-2) (pre-print) (54) . However, as more reports globally from diverse racial and genetic contexts become available, differences in the production of ACE2 can be further evaluated and linked to how they lead to COVID-19 vulnerability in different groups (55) .","Existing surveillance databases, new study tools, and innovation methodologies may help to identify population health risks and support Health-EDRM policy development. Using a syndromic surveillance database in the Philippines, Salazar, Law, Winkler [7] showed how an existing clinical based database might be useful in assisting emergency health service planning decision making during outbreaks in armed conflict. Even with the database limitations to report injuries and death, this existing data system was nevertheless useful to support non-communicable diseases\u2019 service caseload planning. Using the computerized random digit dialling methods for rapid data collection after a major urban subway fire incident, Chan, Huang, Hung et al. [8] captured health risk perception, misconceptions, and community first-aid response knowledge in urban man-made emergency incidents. Using social media data from Twitter, Gruebner, Lowe, Sykora et al. [9] showed how the spatio-temporal distribution of negative emotions varied in New York City after a natural disaster. Their study showed that pre-disaster status could be used as a significant predictor of post-disaster emotional outcomes in communities. Using a disturbance management model to estimate logistics constraints in medical supplies during natural disasters, Shi and He [10] examined how medical supplies, which required cold-chain support (e.g., blood and vaccines), might be optimized after natural disasters when transport might be disturbed. Using a three-phase methodology and the online, global, and publicly available databases, Chan, Huang, Lam et al. [11] developed a health vulnerability index (HVI) that captures seven main health dimensions with nine indicators. This index allows the inclusion of non-communicable disease burden of countries/communities into the disaster risk assessment and may reflect underlying health needs and the capacity requirement to address Health-EDRM at the country level.","Categorical variables were analyzed by using Fisher's exact test or a chi-square test. Significance was defined as a p value of \u03fd 0.05. Being a health care worker and visiting a hospital where SARS patients had been treated were risk factors for SARS. Lack of a clear contact history was more common in non-SARS patients than SARS patients. All of the latter had a typical clinical course and most had a positive PCR (Table 2) . Table 3 shows clinical features. SARS patients sought medical care at a mean of FD 3.1 \u03ee 2.8, whereas non-SARS patients came at a mean of 4.2 \u03ee 5.5 days after onset of their symptoms. In the SARS patients, fever (\u03fe 38\u00b0C) was both the most common (52/53, 98%) and the earliest symptom (50/53, 94%). The one patient without a fever initially was a 10-year-old girl who was part of a family cluster and had a positive PCR on throat swab. All of the patients presented with fever as their first symptom except for 2, of whom one had chronic (3), congestive heart failure (1), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (1), rheumatoid arthritis (1), chronic hepatitis B (1), and end-stage renal disease with regular hemodialysis (1). ** Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (5 patients), diabetes mellitus (3), essential hypertension (3), hepatoma (1), old pulmonary TB (1), schizophrenia (1) and end stage renal disease (1). \u2020 Pregnancy (4). Note: Number in parentheses is percentage. obstructive pulmonary disease and the other congestive heart failure. Both had pre-existing respiratory symptoms related to these underlying chronic diseases, including productive cough and dyspnea on exertion. Of the non-SARS patients, only 5 of 31 (16%) presented with fever as the first symptom (p \u03fd 0.0001). The mean (SD) duration of fever was 10 \u03ee 3.69 days in the SARS group and 3 \u03ee 2.57 days in the non-SARS group (p \u03fd 0.0001).","Apart from MERS001 and the MVA-based vaccine tested in dromedary camels, other vector-based approaches are also being actively pursued, including adenovirus [68,69,72,73,80], measles virus [74,75], VEEV replicon particle [76,77], vesicular stomatitis virus [78], and rabies virus [79]. All recombinant viruses encoding the MERS-CoV S or S1 antigen demonstrated strong immunogenicity in mice or non-human primate models, and some were shown to confer protection in MERS-CoV challenge mouse models (Table 2). However, concerns remain regarding the pre-existing immunity against these viral vectors from natural infection, because it would diminish the vaccine potency [95]. To overcome the issue of pre-existing immunity against human adenoviruses while preserving their advantages such as high yields and strong immunogenicity, rare serotypes of chimpanzee adenovirus of low human seroprevalence may be adopted as viral vectors [70,73]. Our group recently developed a vaccine candidate with replication-defective chimpanzee adenovirus C68 (AdC68) vector expressing full length MERS-CoV S glycoprotein. Seroprevalence of AdC68 is around 2% in human population, much lower than that of the commonly used human adenovirus 5 (HuAd5) vector (&gt;60%) [96,97]. One intra-nasal administration of 2 \u00d7 109 viral particles completely protected human DPP4 knock-in (hDPP4-KI) mice from lethal MERS-CoV challenge, and passive transfer of AdC68-S immune sera conferred survival advantage in lethal challenge mouse models [73]. Further, the safety profiles of these vectors have yet to be extensively tested in humans. Recently, Hashem and colleagues showed that the adenovirus-based S1 vaccine may pose potential safety concerns because it may induce pulmonary perivascular hemorrhage in a MERS-CoV challenge mouse model, regardless of the its full protection upon lethal viral infection. They also showed that the pulmonary pathology can be mitigated by incorporating CD40L, an immune-modulator therefore potential molecular adjuvant, into the recombinant adenovirus-based vaccine [72]. Whether this vaccine-associated pathology is related to residual infectious viruses or unbalanced immune responses awaits further investigation. With this in mind, all future MERS-CoV vaccine candidate designs should take extra cautions on safety evaluation.","In this descriptive study all leprosy cases that had been recorded during 45 years in the Qazvin province, were studied about age group, sex, clinical symptoms, disability stage, incidence rate and typing based on the documents of Leprosy surveillance system. Results: During 45 years, 321 patients with leprosy had been treated from them 177 (55%) cases were men and 144 (45%) cases were women. Only 16 (5%) cases were in &lt; 20 years old age group. Most of patients (118 cases: 36.8%) had &gt; 60 years old. Multi Bacillary cases were 264 (82.2%) and Puci Bacillary cases were 57 (17.8%). Lesion of macular and without sensation was the most common sign. The most patients had been recorded during [1971] [1972] [1973] [1974] [1975] [1976] [1977] [1978] [1979] [1980] [1981] [1982] [1983] [1984] [1985] [1986] [1987] [1988] [1989] [1990] . Leprosy disease has been at the elimination phase (prevalence \u00a3 1/10000 population) from 1995 in the Qazvin province. Discussion &amp; Conclusion: Qazvin province is one of leprosy endemic provinces that it has achieved to goal of the elimination of Leprosy. Also less cases of Leprosy in &lt; 20-year sold age group indicates success of program for leprosy by using MDT in the Qazvin province. Objectives: Clinical and epidemiological study of disease caused by Mycobacterium kansasii in Zaragoza, Spain. Methods: A retrospective study was carried out between January 1990 and December 1999 in Miguel Servet Hospital, Cl\u00ednico Lozano Blesa Hospital, and Royo Villanova Hospital. Diagnosis of the disease was performed according to American Thoracic Society criteria. Results: The patient charts of 94 patients in which an isolate of M. kansasii had been recorded were reviewed. Sputum was by far the most common source of isolates, accounting for 79.7%. We considered 34 patients to be suffering from disease caused by M. kansasii. The number increased for the second half of the study period (13 vs. 21 cases). Pulmonary disease was the most frequent clinical presentation (98.9%). Seventy nine percent of all patients with disease were male. The mean age was 44 years. The most common risk factors associated with disease due to M. kansasii were smoking (82.4%), infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) (23.5%), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (17.6%), and tuberculosis (17.6%). The mean CD4 cell count of the HIVinfected patients at diagnosis was 45 \u00b7 106/l. The most frequent clinical features were the respiratory symptoms (85.3%), followed by fever (64.7%), and constitutional symptoms (38.2%). Chest radiographs revealed cavitating pulmonary disease in 82.3% of HIV-negative cases and in 12.5% of HIV-positive cases (p &lt; 0.01). The incidence of unilateral disease was 88.2% in HIV-negative patients and 25% in HIV-positive patients (p &lt; 0.01). The most common treatment regimen was rifampicin, isoniazid, and ethambutol (85.3%), and the average duration was 13.3 months. Twentyone patients (70%) were initially treated for M. tuberculosis. With treatment, all cases of non-HIV-associated disease had favourable outcomes, but those of HIV-associated pulmonary and disseminated disease were poor (37.5%). Conclusion: The increasing incidence of disease causing M. kansasii is surmised to be due to AIDS, and other factors may be external factors causing either changes in the distribution or virulence of mycobacteria in the environment. Outcomes of therapy in HIV-negative patients were excellent, but in HIV-positive patients were poor.","critically assessed early reports on medRxiv, a pre-print server (https://www.medrxiv.org/) (date of last search: March 16, 2020) . Since the initial epicenter for this outbreak was from China, the majority of data on patients with COVID-19 are from this region. Although a systematic attempt was made to include reports and viewpoints from other heavily affected countries, data related to CV risk factors or presentation were limited. This is important, since the testing strategies, care seeking behavior, and hospitalization thresholds vary in different settings and can bias numerators and denominators, influencing estimates of the impact of the virus. This selection bias in testing, care and reporting can lead to differences in prevalence estimates of pre-existing risk factors and patient presentation across the reports from various countries. Further, the majority of the existing analyses, including those related to CV complications of COVID-19 are based on retrospective and often single-center series. Accordingly, data elements were usually reported via chart review, without external prospective ascertainment. No published or completed prospective cohort studies or randomized controlled trials were present in this literature search. These issues have important implications for research priority setting, and for interpretations of the results reported herein. There is an urgent need for high quality research in this area, but at this point it is useful to review the available data.","There is a disproportionate number of individuals with mental and somatic illnesses among persons in detention (Bhugra, 2020; Ginn, 2012) . It is also known that infections which are transmitted human to human via droplet or close contact spread particularly well in confined spaces. Since transfer options for further treatment are more difficult (especially in detention facilities) preventive measures are strongly emphasized, particularly in the case of viral droplet infections. For example, in the context of influenza, vaccination of detainees and staff is recommended (NHS 2019) . If such options are not available, prisons and other closed facilities, like asylum centers, shelters, and closed psychiatric hospitals, pose a risk for the rapid spread of such diseases. In the past, Australia for example has described the rapid spread of influenza among prison inmates (Awofeso et al., 2001) . The Spanish flu is also reported to have affected about a quarter of all inmates; a prevalence much higher when compared to data from the general population (Finnie, Copley, Hall, &amp; Leach, 2014) . We are also currently receiving news from China, which reports a rapid spread of Covid-19 infections among prisoners from the Hubei Province. Regarding Covid-19, the spread seems to have been caused by infected security personnel importing it into detention facilities. According to the media, the Chinese government reacted to the outbreak among inmates by locking down affected prisons, suspending the transportation of goods, testing inmates who were in contact with the diagnosed wardens, and also by dismissing the prison directors and setting up a commission to analyse the spread of the virus among detained individuals (Caixing Global 2019). Correctly, there has recently been talk of a \"blind spot\" in the media regarding the spread of Covid-19 among prison inmates. (Global Times 2020) We argue that the blind spot extends further to particularly marginalized groups such as individuals using and abusing drugs and people without legal residence status, especially since these groups often overlap with individuals in detention (Liem, Wang, Wariyanti, Latkin, &amp; Hall, 2020) . Under normal circumstances, the psychological and psychiatric care of individuals in prison is already a major challenge for many health care systems; a problem that is even more evident in times of crisis, as is currently observed. The difficulties arise on different levels and affect detained individuals, security personnel, as well as medical staff alike (Chen et al., 2020) . Fears, worries, and uncertainties, especially for isolated or quarantined patients, can cause an increase in stress-related illnesses but also the exacerbation of pre-existing mental disorders (Duan &amp; Zhu, 2020) . This leads to a dilemma: the higher level of care and support that is required is contravened by recommendations that, especially under conditions of isolation, advise against the routine consultation of clinical psychologists, psychiatrists, and social workers in order to prevent the spread of infections. In this situation, medical staff, who are primarily focused on treating the infection (or complications thereof), must then additionally provide psychological care and be ready to intervene during a mental health crisis. Against this backdrop, some authors advocate for the use of online counselling tools and web platforms to support individuals in isolation and those affected (Liu et al., 2020) . Although these recommendations are directed at the general population and not at a prison population, it does not seem reasonable that such channels of care should not be used for individuals under detention as well. Other models could be envisaged, such as the provision of telephone counselling for prisoners and staff. However, for the current outbreak of Covid-19, such elements may not be implemented quickly enough. This raises the question of how to provide rational, basic psychiatric care under the current challenging conditions. We urge that governments take into account special needs of people in confined closed spaces. They must try: -Preserving continuity in provision of psychiatric and psychological care to individuals in detention is imperative and should remain so during the Covid-19 outbreak. -Early coordination between regional prison authorities, prison psychiatry, and general medical and general psychiatric care providers (e.g. in cases of referrals). This must also include close liaison with court diversion schemes, probation officers and others. Some clear guidance needs to be developed urgently regarding visitors to prisons and jails. -Given the potential shortage of time and human resources, the more severe psychiatric and psychological cases must be carefully triaged. Here, factors such as pre-existing mental illness, self-and extraneous endangerment, violence and aggressive behavior, refusal to eat, and also assessments and recommendations of experienced security staff should be taken into account. -Given the flood of perceivable unsettling information on Covid-19, staff providing psychological or psychiatric treatment should be informed regularly and urgently about symptomatology and presentation and on the realistic clinical course, also in comparison to other infectious diseases or in comparison to other daily risks. Sharing of accurate information without bias and panic is critical. -Ensuring the provision of masks, disinfectants and protective measures in sufficient quantity for psychological and psychiatric staff visiting individuals in detention. -Particular attention should also be paid to certify that staff deployed to provide psychological-psychiatric care in institutions are informed and/or sensitized of known potential risk factors for a more severe course of a Covid-19 infection of their own (advanced age, somatic comorbidities, chronic respiratory diseases, hypertension, cancer, known immune deficiencies etc.). Due to the currently limited understanding of Covid-19, it may be advisable to prohibit employees with such conditions from providing psychological or psychiatric care to individuals in detention and prisons. -If there is a sudden shortage of staff providing psychological and psychiatric care to detained individuals with a mental illness, staff from general psychiatry may have to fill consequential gaps. This needs careful planning on an urgent basis so that the potential of extremely long working hours of medical staff during the current outbreak can be managed successfully.","Given the limited understanding of the prognostic factors for COVID-19, more research is needed to investigate the mechanism by which pre-existing CHD may increase mortality risk among patients with COVID-19. From the clinical point of view, early evaluation of patient medical history is necessary to possibly decrease the mortality risk. we suggest monitoring the dynamic heart rate for patient with pre-existing CHD. For those severe-symptomatic patients who had pre-existing heart ischemia and abnormal heart function, early medical intervention maybe needed [45] . controlling the patient number beneath the capacity limit.

In some cases no cause can be found. Septic peritonitis is less common in cats than dogs.","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic threatens to kill large numbers of people in the UK and to place unprecedented demands on the National Health Service (NHS). The case fatality rate is increased in older people and those with pre-existing disease and is reported to be about 20% in people with COVID-19 who are older than 80 years, 1 although this does not take into account the under-reporting of mildly affected cases. There are about 8\u00b78 million people aged 70 years or older in the UK and many others with health conditions that increase their vulnerability to COVID-19. In the face of the rapid spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, older people and other vulnerable groups are being asked to self-isolate for a considerable time to reduce the risks of infection, with potential adverse effects on physical and mental health.","Another important category of potential lung injury related to blood-product transfusion is the worsening of pre-existing acute lung injury (ALI) by subsequent hemotherapy. It often is difficult to make a diagnosis of TRALI in critically ill patients who have existing ALI/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS); however, if there is a sudden worsening of oxygenation and pulmonary compliance in a patient who is receiving or in the past 6 hours has received a blood-product transfusion (in the absence of signs of volume overload), a probable diagnosis of TRALI can be made. There are a few studies in the medical literature that support a contribution of bloodproduct transfusion to the worsening of preexisting ALI/ARDS. Using the largest prospective study on the incidence of ALI in the pediatric population, Church and colleagues [2] retrospectively assessed the role of blood-product transfusions on the clinical outcomes of this patient population. These investigators discovered that the transfusion of fresh frozen plasma (FFP) was an independent risk factor for mortality in these pediatric ALI patients at 30 days. In an adult prospective investigation of the risk factors, incidence, and outcomes of ALI/ARDS at a single center, Gong and colleagues [3] reported that PRBC transfusion was independently associated with the initial development of ALI/ARDS and was an independent risk factor for mortality in ALI/ARDS, with a dose-dependent response.","Waterpipe smoking is the process of inhaling tobacco smoke, passed through a chilled water chamber, via a hose capped with a plastic mouthpiece. Globally, there are an estimated 100 million daily hookah smokers (Wolfram et al., 2003). More recently, demand for the waterpipe smoking has grown in several countries that have no previous tradition of use, including the United States and Saudi Arabia (Maziak et al., 2007). In the regions where waterpipe smoking is prevalent, it has been linked with numerous smoking-related health problems such as: oral diseases, urinary bladder cancer, cardiovascular disease and pulmonary dysfunction (Al-Belasy, 2004, Bedwani et al., 1997, Jabbour et al., 2003). The smoke inhaled as a result of waterpipe smoking contains toxic materials similar to those resulting from smoking cigarettes such as carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons, and carcinogenic polycyclic aromatic volatile aldehydes (World Health Organization, 2005, Chaouachi, 2009, Kiter et al., 2000). Although the average frequency of waterpipe smoking in the United States is lower than that of cigarettes, a single waterpipe session typically lasts for 45 min and may produce 50\u2013100 times the smoke volume inhaled from a single cigarette (Lipkus et al., 2011, Rastam et al., 2011, Primack et al., 2012, Alzoubi et al., 2013, Maziak, 2013).","The overall management principles for patients presenting with COVID-19 who develop CV complications or who have pre-existing CVD are same as for any other patient without COVID-19. However, there are a few important points that need consideration-1. As caregivers, it is our utmost responsibility to protect ourselves from getting infected while managing these patients. Therefore, all heath caregivers engaged in the care of COVID-19 patients must observe necessary precautions at all times. All of them should be trained in donning, usage, and doffing of the personal protective equipment in accordance with the existing practice guidelines. 2. The hospital systems need to ensure preparedness for dealing with large volume of COVID-19 patients, many of whom would need ICU care and/or acute cardiac care. Appropriate protocols for rapid diagnosis, triage, isolation, and management of COVID-19 patients with CV complications should be developed and well-rehearsed. Rapid triaging and management of these patients is crucial, not only to allow efficient utilization of healthcare resources but also to minimize exposure to caregivers. There are already reports highlighting delays in delivering acute cardiac care due to extra precautions that need to be observed in view of COVID-19 (14) . Efforts should be made to minimize such delays. 3. Strong emphasis should be placed on avoiding unwarranted diagnostic tests (e.g. cardiac troponin, echocardiography, etc.) in these patients. This is required to minimize unwarranted downstream diagnostic/therapeutic procedures which would further strain the already stretched healthcare resources and would also subject caregivers to added risk of exposure to the infection. The American College of Cardiology has released an advisory discouraging random measurement of cardiac biomarkers such as troponins and natriuretic peptides (15) . It urges all the clinicians to reserve these assays for circumstances in which they would actually meaningfully add to the management of the patients with COVID-19. The American Society of Echocardiography has also issued a similar advisory regarding the use of echocardiography in these patients (16). 4. The individual hospitals may also have to reconsider risk-benefit ratio of primary percutaneous intervention vs fibrinolysis in patients with COVID-19 who present with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction. 5. There has been a concern regarding the safety of ACE inhibitors (ACEi) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. These agents upregulate expression of ACE2 in various tissues, including on cardiomyocytes (17) . Since SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2 to gain entry into human cells, there is a potentially increased risk of developing COVID-19 or developing more severe disease in patients who are already on background treatment with ACEi/ARB. However, to date, no experimental or clinical data have emerged to support these concerns. At the same time, the risks of discontinuing these therapies are well known. Therefore, several leading professional societies have strongly urged to not discontinue clinically-indicated ACEi/ARB therapy in the event the patient develops COVID-19 (18, 19) . 6. Clinicians caring for these patients also need to be fully aware of the potential CV side-effects of various therapies used for treating the viral infection. Additionally, various anti-retroviral drugs have significant interactions with cardiac drugs, which need to be considered and appropriate dose modification done. More recently, chloroquine/ hydroxychloroquine and azathioprine have been proposed as potential therapeutic options, based on preliminary evidence (20). Both these drugs are known to prolong QT interval and due caution must be exercised when prescribing these agents. Their combination is best avoided and even when using chloroquine/ hydroxychloroquine alone, daily electrocardiogram for monitoring QT interval is warranted, esp. in patients with hepatic or renal dysfunction and in those receiving another drug with potential to prolong QT interval.","Our results show that when disease transmission is driven by social contacts between different age groups, knowledge of the age distribution of cases makes it possible to separate the effective reproduction number into two components: inherent pathogen transmissibility, and pre-existing immunity in older age groups. Based on observed outbreak size distributions, we estimated that individuals over age 20 had susceptibility to monkeypox reduced by a factor 0.4 compared with younger hosts. This value agrees well with published estimates of population susceptibility (Table 3), with cross-immunity coming from the smallpox vaccination campaigns that ended in the two decades preceding the outbreaks [5]. We also found evidence of pre-existing immunity to influenza A(H5N1) in older individuals; it has previously been suggested that such immunity could result either from prior exposure to H5N1, or from cross-immunity from previous infection with influenza A(H1N1) [27]. In contrast, we estimated that both age groups had similar levels of susceptibility to MERS and influenza A(H7N9). Given that immunity from vaccination and natural infection tends to increase with age, this suggests that there was little pre-existing immunity to these pathogens. While serological studies have found no evidence of pre-existing immunity to H7N9 virus in these locations [28, 29], serological analysis remains challenging for novel coronaviruses such as MERS-CoV [30]. The approach we describe can therefore provide crucial information about the degree of population susceptibility before serological surveys are available.","Al-Turaiki et al. used predictive models such as na\u00efve Bayes and J48 to analyse MERS data pertaining to Saudi Arabia [20] . The recovery model generated indicates that the healthcare workers are most likely to recover from the infection. In the case of non-healthcare workers, pre-existing diseases hamper the recovery. The authors also generated a stability model from which it can be inferred that in the case of people with pre-existing diseases, symptoms and age turned out to be the significant factors in determining the severity of viral infection. Abdullah et. al. used classification methods such as support vector machine, random forest and na\u00efve Bayes to detect MERS Co-V infection. The authors observed that people above 50 years had more chances of infection compared to the rest [21] .","To characterize both the inherent properties of the pathogen and the level of population immunity, we analysed both the size and age distribution of minor outbreaks. Individuals of different ages have heterogeneous social contact patterns and hence different risks of infection during an outbreak [19, 20, 21]. Pre-existing immunity in older age groups can alter this pattern [22], making it possible to separate the reproduction number into its pathogen- and population-specific components. We made use of this observation by developing a novel age-structured model of stuttering transmission chains, which combined reported social contact data with a multi-type branching process [23, 24].","To identify the genes highly associated with key comorbidities of severe COVID-19 [1, 3] , we mined all relevant scientific literature of these human diseases. Specifically, over 8,000 abstracts containing the terms \"pulmonary hypertension,\" \"chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,\" \"hypertension,\" \"smoking,\" \"pulmonary fibrosis,\" or \"asthma\" in the title or abstract were selected (Figure 1a ). Our text-mining analysis revealed 804 genes highly associated with one or more COVID-19 morbidities (Figure 1b) . Among those genes, 26 were associated with four or more diseases (Figure 1c ). Although ACE2 was known to be related to \"Cardiovascular Diseases\", \"Familial Primary Pulmonary Hypertension\", \"Hypertension, Pulmonary\", and \"Hypertension\", none of the articles containing this gene-disease association studied how ACE2 expression was altered in the lungs of patients with these diseases. Text-mining approach to retrieve genes in abstracts associated with six human diseases.","A total of 27 categorical variables were identified in univariate logistic regression analysis, namely: age, smoking, BMI, hypnotics, dyspnea, diabetes, malignancy, cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases, serum amyloid A, procalcitonin, hypersensitive troponin I, creatine kinase CMB, lactate dehydrogenase, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, glucose, leukocyte count, neutrophil count, platelet count, rRT-PCR at diagnosis, clinical status at admission, bilateral GGO, crazy paving sign, diffuse patchy ground glass and air bronchogram, and multiple bilateral pulmonary consolidation and intralobular interstitial thickening (Table S2) . Eight variables were demonstrated as independent risk factors based on the multivariate logistic regression model. The results indicated that age (patients over 65 years) , smoking , critical disease designation , diabetes, abnormally higher hypersensitive troponin I (&gt;0.04 pg/mL) , leukocyte count (&gt;10x10 9 /L ) and neutrophil count (&gt;75 x10 9 /L) were significantly associated with unfavorable clinical outcome, and hypnotics showed significant beneficial effects on clinical outcomes (p&lt;0.001) (Figure 2A ).","Cardiac complications, including new or worsening heart failure, new or worsening arrhythmia, or myocardial infarction are common in patients with pneumonia. Cardiac arrest occurs in about 3% of inpatients with pneumonia. 21 Risk factors of cardiac events after pneumonia include older age, pre-existing cardiovascular diseases, and greater severity of pneumonia at presentation. 22 Coronary heart disease has also been found to be associated with acute cardiac events and poor outcomes in influenza and other respiratory viral infections. [22] [23] [24] In this study, increased high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I during hospitalisation was found in more than half of those who died. The first autopsy of a 53-year-old woman with chronic renal failure in Jinyintan Hospital showed acute myocardial infarction (data not published; personal communication with a pathologist from the Chinese Academy of Science). About 90% of inpatients with pneumonia had increased coagulation activity, marked by increased d-dimer concentrations. 25 In this study, we found d-dimer greater than 1 \u00b5g/mL is associated with fatal outcome of COVID-19. High levels of d-dimer have a reported asso ciation with 28-day mortality in patients with infection or sepsis identified in the emergency department. 26 Contri butory mechanisms include systemic pro-inflammatory cytokine responses that are mediators of atherosclerosis directly contributing to plaque rupture through local inflammation, induction of procoagulant factors, and haemodynamic changes, which predispose to ischaemia and thrombosis. [27] [28] [29] In addition, angiotensin converting enzyme 2, the receptor for SARS-CoV-2, is expressed on myocytes and vascular endothelial cells, 30, 31 so there is at least theoretical potential possibility of direct cardiac involvement by the virus. Of note, interstitial mononuclear inflammatory infiltrates in heart tissue has 32 The level and duration of infectious virus replication are important factors in assessing the risk of trans mission and guiding decisions regarding isolation of patients. Because coronavirus RNA detection is more sensitive than virus isolation, most studies have used qualitative or quantitative viral RNA tests as a potential marker for infectious coronavirus. For SARS-CoV, viral RNA was detected in respiratory specimens from about a third of patients as long as 4 weeks after disease onset. 33 Similarly, the dura tion of MERS-CoV RNA detection in lower respiratory specimans persisted for at least 3 weeks, 34, 35 whereas the duration of SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection has not been well characterised.","In practice, several factors frequently cause enough impairment of host defenses to contribute to the development of pneumonia, even though individuals with such impairment are not considered \"immunosuppressed.\" Viral upper respiratory tract infections, ethanol abuse, cigarette smoking, heart failure, and preexisting chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are a few of the contributing factors. More severe impairment of host defenses is caused by diseases associated with immunosuppression (e.g., advanced AIDS), various underlying malignancies (particularly leukemia and lymphoma), and the use of corticosteroids and other immunosuppressive drugs. In these cases associated with impairment of host defenses, individuals are susceptible to both bacterial and more unusual nonbacterial infections (see Chapters 24 to 26).","In practice, several factors frequently cause enough impairment of host defenses to contribute to the development of pneumonia, even though individuals with such impairment are not considered \"immunosuppressed.\" Viral upper respiratory tract infections, ethanol abuse, cigarette smoking, heart failure, and preexisting chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are a few of the contributing factors.

Given that COVID-19 has a relatively long incubation period and during this time the infected person can transmit the virus without showing symptoms, it is strongly recommended that patients with chronic or underlying diseases avoid any close contact with other people in the community, especially in epidemic areas. During the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, the statistics reported by different countries regarding associated mortality of those with risk factors, incubation time, and estimated overall mortality have not been consistent and general conclusions should be drawn with caution. It should be noted that the outbreak worsens with decrease in adherence to diagnostic guidelines and prevention strategies, such as avoiding traveling and gathering in public places. ","The special issue also touches on risk behaviors among marginalized populations. Wang and Shuanglong [16] explored generational differences in smoking, alcohol and dietary consumption behaviours among British minorities. They found that the second generation of migrants is more likely to smoke and consume alcohol and less likely to eat fruits and vegetables than white British, and identified a need for targeting second-generation ethnic minorities adopting unhealthy lifestyles. Pallesen et al. [17] conducted a study of the feasibility of a participatory intervention for improving dietary behaviour among ethnic minority women in Denmark. They reported that minority women of lower socioeconomic backgrounds easily engaged with a culturally relevant and acceptable cardiovascular disease prevention intervention, which positively motivated healthy dietary behaviour, and showed that, with the correct engagement, marginalized groups can have reduced dietary risks. Dearle et al. [18] also explored cultural factors related to risk for NCDs, examining knowledge and attitudes towards diabetes among Fijians. They investigated attitudes towards a traditional diet, the influence of family members, community beliefs, and awareness of diabetes, and found that effective intervention should incorporate cultural values and practices, emphasizing the essential role of family networks and church groups in conveying health messages. ","Simple linear regressions were used to test the association of ACE2 gene expression with each single variable of age, gender, race and smoking status. And, multiple linear regression was used to test the association of ACE2 expression with multiple factors (age, gender, race, smoking status and data platform). Also, ordinal regression was performed to investigate the association between ACE2 expression and ordinal categorical smoking history. All data management, statistical analyses and visualizations were accomplished using R 3.6.1.","Mean age was elevated (79.5 years) and 90% were older than 60 years (Table 1) . Only two patients lived in a longterm care facility, but near 20% were bedridden. Over 50% of the patients had two or more comorbidities, mainly chronic pulmonary conditions, heart disease, diabetes mellitus, or neurologic diseases. Cancer, morbid obesity, or kidney disease were not common. No case was associated with chronic liver disease and only one patient was immunosuppressed. Previous tobacco smoking affected near a third of this population and current smoking was still admitted by two out of 32 patients. Almost one-third of patients with chronic lung disease were domiciliary oxygen users (Table 1) .","Sex-specific numbers of sCoV differed by healthcare setting; we observed a trend towards female sCoV cases for primary care, but male sCoV cases for secondary/tertiary care. This finding may reflect sex differences in healthcare seeking behaviors and/or illness severity. In terms of sex differences in detection odds (a proxy for infection risk), a statistically significant sex effect was found for CoV-229E, with a greater odds among males than females. This finding is consistent with previous reports of a male bias for CoV-OC43 and CoV-NL63 among the hospital setting [12] , and in relation to influenza hospitalizations and mortality in the context of acute respiratory infections more generally [22, 23] . It has been proposed that differences in sex hormones may explain variation in respiratory infection susceptibility, with testosterone exerting an immunosuppressive effect in males, and with estrogen playing a protective role in females [24, 25] . We note however our analyses do not control for potential confounding factors such as smoking or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).","Kaplan-Meier curve were plotted to check the proportional hazard assumption and Pearson correlation test was used to rule out the multicollinearity concern before fitting any model. Univariate weighted Cox models were performed for each of the comorbidity of interest. Multivariate weighted Cox model was used to determine if pre-existing comorbidity yielded prognostic hazard information. Other than the common risk factors (age, gender and history of surgery), the multivariate model also adjusted for location of diagnosis (in vs. outside of Hubei Province) and early period of pandemic (after vs. before January 11 th , 2020 when no-intervention was taken by the government) [20] . Although matching was based on age and gender, we adjusted for the matching covariates, since the matching was broken with inverse probability weighting [31] . A separate multivariate model was built by using the total number of pre-existing comorbidities as an ordinal predictor, adjusting for the same covariates. Hazard ratios (HRs) from weighed Cox model were reported along with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) and p-values.","Disaster Risk assessment is a standard approach in DRR. Core methodologies for disaster risk assessment include hazard and vulnerability assessment. These methods can be utilised for COVID-19 risk assessment. In addition, the health sciences should be more involved in the community of disaster risk management, to advance our understanding of outbreaks and pandemics, the health impacts of all hazards, and improve data collection [15] . Science is recognised especially in modelling disease spread, data on affected people, and the rush for vaccines. Open data, Open Science and Open Map are being advocated. Existing spatial and remote sensing capacity for disaster can be used for mapping pandemics. The UN-SPIDER (Spacebased Information for Disaster Management and Emergency Response) knowledge portal recognises epidemics as a source of hazard. The existing regional tsunami early warning systems can also be tasked for healthrelated emergencies. The systems include the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center (PTWC); the Indian Ocean Tsunami Warning System (IOTWS); and the North Eastern Atlantic, the Mediterranean and connected Seas (NEAMTWS). There is strong recognition for integration on DRR and CCA and appropriate adaptation can greatly reduce the health burden resulting from climate change and disasters [16] . The Sendai Framework takes an interconnected and pluralistic approach to understanding risk (UNDRR, 2019). The nature of current risks is complex and systemic, and can also be compound, interconnected, infracting and cascading risks [17] . Natural, technological and biological hazard disasters can occur in these fashions, as shown in the triple disasters of earthquake, tsunami and nuclear power plant failure in March 11, 2011 in Japan. Countries like Japan, or Indonesia, despite having to respond to current COVID-19, they also need to be ready should an earthquake or tsunami occur.","Patients infected with HIV are at high risk for the development of pulmonary infections. [66] [67] [68] [69] Although the incidence of pneumonia has decreased notably in the developed world with the advent of highly active antiretroviral therapy, pneumonia remains a common HIV complication. Principal risk factors for pneumonia in this population include low current CD4 + count, nadir CD4 + count, injection drug use, smoking, increasing age, and lack of highly active antiretroviral therapy and anti-Pneumocystis prophylaxis. 67, 70 In considering the etiology of pulmonary infection in patients infected with HIV, geographic exposures, demographic characteristics of the patient, and the degree of immune suppression need to be considered. With the development of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) and effective prophylactic strategies, the incidence of Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia in patients with AIDS has decreased from 70% to 80% to less than 1 per 100 patient-years. 71 It is now predominantly seen in individuals who have a CD4 + count less than 100/mm 3 and are either unaware of having HIV infection or are not receiving care. 69 Bacterial pneumonia was a significant complication for HIV-infected individuals and in the preantiretroviral era with an incidence 5-to 10-fold that seen in the general population; and the incidence of invasive pneumococcal disease is more than 50-fold higher in HIV-infected patients than in non-HIV-infected controls. 70, 72 The incidence of these infections has now notably decreased, although there remains a high risk in patients not on treatment. 69 The incidence of pneumonia due to P. aeruginosa and S. aureus has also been notably higher in HIV-infected patients. 69 Although relatively less common in the developed world, in developing countries, Mycobacterium tuberculosis is now viewed as the major pulmonary pathogen in patients with AIDS. 68 The use of HAART has led to a decreased incidence of AIDS, but its overall importance as a pulmonary pathogen remains. In the severely immunosuppressed HIV population, fungal infections can play a major role, and depending on the patient's exposure history, cryptococcosis, histoplasmosis, blastomycosis, and coccidioidomycosis should be considered.","Investigating lymphocyte responses to allergens has been hindered by the low frequency of circulating allergen-specific lymphocytes. It has generally been assumed that allergens induce T H 2 responses because most cultured allergen-specific clones have a T H 2 phenotype. However, analysis of allergen-specific lymphocytes in nonallergic individuals has not been extensively examined. In the current paper, the investigators reported a new approach using carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester (CSFE) to detect allergen-specific lymphocytes by flow cytometry. The CSFE dye is equally distributed into dividing cells so that its level is a specific indication of the number of replication cycles that a cell has undergone. Accordingly, the investigators examined CSFE-low cells after culture in medium supplemented with peanut antigen. Comparison of (1) peanut-allergic individuals, (2) non-peanut-allergic individuals, and (3) individuals who had outgrown peanut allergy revealed interesting findings. Notably, T cells of peanut-allergic donors showed a T H 2 polarization; in contrast, T cells of individuals who had outgrown their allergies and T cells of nonallergic individuals showed T H 1 cytokine responses to peanut antigen. Similar results were seen in lymphocytes of individuals with egg allergy when the lymphocytes were cultured with ovalbumin. These results suggest that food antigens (in particular, peanut antigen) do not intrinsically induce T H 2 skewing but that the type of response depends on the donor's allergic status. The finding that lymphocytes of individuals who outgrow peanut allergy do not have a T H 2 skewing suggests that shifting of a T H 2 response to a T H 1 response underlies clinical tolerance to orally administered allergens. The application of this novel approach to examine antigen-specific T cells is likely to be informative in developing better strategies for immunotherapy. Effects of early-onset asthma and in utero exposure to maternal smoking on subsequent childhood lung function It has been suggested that in utero exposure to maternal smoking and early onset of asthma in infancy are independently associated with subsequent chronic decreases in lung function in childhood. This study compared the effects of these factors, present individually and in combination, within a population of 5933 participants in a Children's Health Study. As predicted, children without asthma who had previously been exposed in utero to maternal smoking showed decreased FEV 1 /forced vital capacity (FVC) ratios and FEF 25-75 . Among children without prior in utero exposure to maternal smoking, those with early-onset asthma had larger decreases in FEV 1 , FEV 1 /FVC, and FEF 25-75 than those with later-onset asthma. However, the largest decreases in pulmonary function were seen in children with both in utero tobacco smoking exposure and early-onset asthma (FEV 1 /FVC decreased approximately 9%; FEF 25-75 decreased approximately 28%). Somewhat surprisingly, there was no significant effect of postnatal environmental tobacco smoke exposure alone on childhood lung function. These findings suggest a possible additive effect of in utero tobacco exposure and early-onset asthma on childhood lung function, providing further evidence of the deleterious effects of maternal smoking during pregnancy. Such smoking during pregnancy might be particularly harmful in situations in which the child to be born is Articles of note . . . ","To assess the risk posed by novel infections, it is important to quantify their transmission potential. Transmissibility can be summarised using the effective reproduction number, R, defined as the average number of secondary cases produced by a typical infectious host [9]. The reproduction number can be separated into two components: the inherent transmissibility of a pathogen, and the level of susceptibility in the host population. In some circumstances, susceptibility might be reduced as a result of pre-existing immunity from previous vaccination campaigns, as is the case with monkeypox [5, 10], or prior exposure to a similar pathogen, as has been suggested for influenza A/H1N1p [11]. Such immunity will not necessary be distributed evenly across the population: if pathogens circulate over an extended period of time, or vaccination campaigns have been discontinued, pre-existing immunity is more likely to be found in older age groups [12].","Regarding further future directions, we point to the new digital technologies that have a potential to improve the ripple effect control in cases of epidemic outbreaks. Making innovations and data work for the SC resilience in crisis times is a promising future research avenue with a particular focus on data analytics, artificial intelligence, and machine learning. The understanding and progressing the research of how all these technologies can be used to operate the SCs in a resilient way in cases of epidemic outbreaks is an important future research area (Choi et al., 2017 (Choi et al., , 2019 Choi and Lambert, 2017b , Dubey et al., 2019a , Ganasegeran and Abdulrahman, 2020 , Queiroz and Wamba, 2019 , Yoon et al., 2019 . In particular, digital SC twins ) -i.e., the computerized SC models that represent the network state for any given moment in real time -can be used to support the decision-making during the epidemic outbreaks. In the pre-disruption mode, digital twins allow for a visualization of SC risks, assessment of supplier disruption risks, prediction of possible supply interruptions, and computation of alternative supply network topologies and back-up routes with assessment of estimated times of arrival. In the dynamic, reactive mode, i.e., in the case of a real epidemic outbreak the digital twins can be applied using real-time data to simulate disruption impacts on the SC and alternative SC designs that contain non-disrupted network nodes and arcs depending on real-time inventory, demand, and capacity data.","The symptoms of MERS are not very specific Based on reports so far, people with pre-existing medical conditions (also called comorbidities) may be more likely to become infected with MERS-CoV, or have a severe case. (Pre-existing diseases like Diabetes, Cancer, Chronic lung, heart, and Kidney disease) Individuals with weak Immunity are also easy victims.","First, early case reports suggest that patients with previous or underlying cardiovascular diseases are at higher risk for developing severe symptoms if infected with SARS-CoV-2. In a report on 138 patients with COVID-19 hospitalized in Wuhan (Hubei province, China) [5] , 64 (46.4%) had one or more coexisting medical conditions, mostly cardiovascular or cerebrovascular. Hypertension was present in 31.2%, diabetes in 10.1%, and cardiovascular disease in 14.5% of patients [5] . Interestingly, these proportions were significantly higher in patients with the most severe forms of COVID-19 (i.e. requiring hospitalization in an intensive care unit), with hypertension in 58.3%, diabetes in 22.2%, cardiovascular disease in 25.0% and cerebrovascular disease in 16.7% [5] . Similarly, while the true overall mortality rate of COVID-19 is still undetermined, and is estimated (based on a crude mortality ratio) at between 3% and 4%, it could be higher in older patients (&gt; 60 years) or patients with pre-existing comorbid https://doi.org/10.1016/j.acvd.2020.03.009 1875-2136/\u00a9 2020 The Author(s).

While the disease can present as a pulmonary disease, the case-fatality rate for patients with underlying cardiovascular disease is greater (10.5%) than in patients with underlying chronic respiratory disease (6.3%) [4] ."],"title":["Middle East respiratory syndrome","Effectiveness of hand hygiene and provision of information in preventing influenza cases requiring hospitalization","Prevalence of

There is limited evidence on the mortality risk effect of pre-existing comorbidity for clinical disease (coronavirus disease 2019 [COVID-19]), which has important implications for early treatment. Objective: To evaluate the risk of the common preexisting comorbidities, including hypertension, coronary heart diseases (CHD), respiratory diseases and diabetes on COVID-19 mortality, and provide clinical suggestions accordingly. Method: This study used a nested case-control design to assess the impact of pre-existing comorbidities on the hazard of COVID-19 in mainland China. A total of 321 publicly reported confirmed cases (146 cases and 175 controls) with trackable time-to-death information and history of comorbidities were collected between December 18th, 2019 and March 8th, 20...","The transmission potential of a novel infection depends on both the inherent transmissibility of a pathogen, and the level of susceptibility in the host population. However, distinguishing between these pathogen- and population-specific properties typically requires detailed serological studies, which are rarely available in the early stages of an outbreak. Using a simple transmission model that incorporates age-stratified social mixing patterns, we present a novel method for characterizing the transmission potential of subcritical infections, which have effective reproduction number R&lt;1, from readily available data on the size of outbreaks. We show that the model can identify the extent to which outbreaks are driven by inherent pathogen transmissibility and pre-existing population immunity, and can generate unbiased estimates of the effective reproduction number. Applying the method to real-life infections, we obtained accurate estimates for the degree of age-specific immunity against...","Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an evolving infectious disease that dramatically spread all over the world in the early part of 2020. No studies have yet summarised the potential severity and mortality risks caused by COVID-19 in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and we update information in smokers. Methods: We systematically searched electronic databases from inception to March 24, 2020. Data were extracted by two independent authors in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses guidelines. Study quality was assessed using a modified version of the Newcastle Ottawa Scale. We synthesised a narrative from eligible studies and conducted a meta-analysis using a random-effects model to calculate pooled prevalence rates and 95% confidence intervals (95%CI). Results: In total, 123 abstracts were screened and 61 full-text manuscripts were reviewed. A total of 15 studies met the inclusion criteria, which ...","Abstract Background Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) is a major infectious disease which has affected the Middle Eastern countries, especially the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) since 2012. The high mortality rate associated with this disease has been a major cause of concern. This paper aims at identifying the major factors influencing MERS recovery in KSA. Methods The data used for analysis was collected from the Ministry of Health website, KSA. The important factors impelling the recovery are found using machine learning. Machine learning models such as support vector machine, conditional inference tree, na\u00efve Bayes and J48 are modelled to identify the important factors. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis is also carried out to identify the significant factors statistically. Result The main factors influencing MERS recovery rate are identified as age, pre-existing diseases, severity of disease and whether the patient is a healthcare worker or not. In spit...","BACKGROUND: Strategies are urgently needed to mitigate the risk of zoonotic disease emergence in southern China, where pathogens with zoonotic potential are known to circulate in wild animal populations. However, the risk factors leading to emergence are poorly understood, which presents a challenge in developing appropriate mitigation strategies for local communities. METHODS: Residents in rural communities of Yunnan, Guangxi and Guangdong provinces were recruited and enrolled in this study. Data were collected through ethnographic interviews and field observations, and thematically coded and analysed to identify both risk and protective factors for zoonotic disease emergence at the individual, community and policy levels. RESULTS: Eighty-eight ethnographic interviews and 55 field observations were conducted at nine selected sites. Frequent human\u2013animal interactions and low levels of environmental biosecurity in local communities were identified as risks for zoonotic disease emergence...","Background Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is an emerging infectious disease, and indeed, the SARS epidemic in Taiwan from March to July 2003 had a great impact. This study depicts the clinical characteristics and short-term outcomes of patients with SARS treated at Taipei Veterans General Hospital; potential predictive factors for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) are also analyzed. Methods This study retrospectively analyzed data for 67 SARS patients, who were grouped according to whether or not ARDS developed during the clinical course of SARS. Results There were 32 males (mean age, 50.3 years; range, 20\u201375 years) and 35 females (mean age, 51.1 years; range, 23\u201386 years). Twenty-five patients (37.3%) were health care workers. At admission, 50 patients (74.6%) had abnormal chest radiographs, and all patients developed pulmonary infiltrates during the following week. During hospitalization, lymphopenia was found in 57 patients (85.1%); and elevated levels of lactate ...","BACKGROUND: Rapid triaging, as in the current COVID-19 pandemic, focuses on age and pre-existing medical conditions. In contrast, preoperative assessments use cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) to categorise patients to higher and lower risk independent of diagnostic labels. Since CPET is not feasible in population-based settings, our aims included evaluation of a triage/screening tool for cardiorespiratory risk. METHODS: CPET-derived anaerobic thresholds were evaluated retrospectively in 26 patients with pulmonary arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) who represent a challenging group to risk-categorise. Pulmonary AVM-induced hypoxaemia secondary to intrapulmonary right-to-left shunts, anaemia from underlying hereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasia and metabolic equivalents derived from the 13-point Veterans Specific Activity Questionnaire (VSAQ) were evaluated as part of routine clinical care. Pre-planned analyses evaluated associations and modelling of the anaerobic threshold and p...","Background: Recently, Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak started in Wuhan, China. Although the clinical features of COVID-19 have been reported previously, data regarding the risk factors associated with the clinical outcomes are lacking. Objectives: To summary and analyze the clinical characteristics and identify the predictors of disease severity and mortality. Methods: The PubMed, Web of Science Core Collection, Embase, Cochrane and MedRxiv databases were searched through February 25, 2020. Meta-analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (MOOSE) recommendations were followed. We extracted and pooled data using random-effects meta-analysis to summary the clinical feature of the confirmed COVID-19 patients, and further identify risk factors for disease severity and death. Heterogeneity was evaluated using the I2 method and explained with subgroup analysis and meta-regression. Results: A total of 30 studies including 53000 patients with COVID-19 were included in this s...","Summary Background Public health measures to prevent, detect, and respond to events are essential to control public health risks, including infectious disease outbreaks, as highlighted in the International Health Regulations (IHR). In light of the outbreak of 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), we aimed to review existing health security capacities against public health risks and events. Methods We used 18 indicators from the IHR State Party Annual Reporting (SPAR) tool and associated data from national SPAR reports to develop five indices: (1) prevent, (2) detect, (3) respond, (4) enabling function, and (5) operational readiness. We used SPAR 2018 data for all of the indicators and categorised countries into five levels across the indices, in which level 1 indicated the lowest level of national capacity and level 5 the highest. We also analysed data at the regional level (using the six geographical WHO regions). Findings Of 182 countries, 52 (28%) had prevent capacities at leve...","Introduction: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a respiratory infection caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus2 (SARSCoV-2). This virus uses the angiotensin converting enzyme II (ACE2) as the cellular entry receptor to infect the lower respiratory tract. Because individuals with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are at increased risk of severe COVID19, we determined whether ACE2 expression in the lower airways was related to COPD and cigarette smoking. Methods: Using RNAseq, we determined gene expression levels in bronchial epithelia obtained from cytologic brushings of 6th to 8th generation airways in individuals with and without COPD. We externally validated these results from two additional independent cohorts, which used microarray technologies to measure gene expression levels from 6th to 12th generation airways. Results: In the discovery cohort (n=42 participants), we found that ACE2 expression levels were increased by 48% in the airways of CO...","Objective: To evaluate the spectrum of comorbidities and its impact on the clinical outcome in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Design: Retrospective case studies Setting: 575 hospitals in 31 province/autonomous regions/provincial municipalities across China Participants: 1,590 laboratory-confirmed hospitalized patients. Data were collected from November 21st, 2019 to January 31st, 2020. Main outcomes and measures: Epidemiological and clinical variables (in particular, comorbidities) were extracted from medical charts. The disease severity was categorized based on the American Thoracic Society guidelines for community-acquired pneumonia. The primary endpoint was the composite endpoints, which consisted of the admission to intensive care unit (ICU), or invasive ventilation, or death. The risk of reaching to the composite endpoints was compared among patients with COVID-19 according to the presence and number of comorbidities. Results: Of the 1,590 cases, the mean age w...","The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), first reported in China, in December, 2019, now affects the whole world. As of March 8, 2020, more than 105 000 laboratory-confirmed cases and more than 3500 deaths in over 100 countries had been reported. Since SARS-CoV-2 RNA was first detected in a stool specimen of the first reported COVID-19 case in the USA,1 much attention has been paid to the study and reporting of gastrointestinal tract infection of SARS-CoV-2. According to a study2 including 1099 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 from 552 hospitals in China as of Jan 29, 2020, nausea or vomiting, or both, and diarrhoea were reported in 55 (5\u00b76%) and 42 (3\u00b78%) patients. Autopsy studies are crucial to help understand the involvement of COVID-19 in the digestive system; however, to date, there has been only one autopsy report3 for a man aged 85 years with COVID-19, which showed segmental dilatation...","Abstract Objectives Following the public health emergency declared by the World Health Organization and the recent outbreak by 2019-nCoV in China and through other 29 countries, we aimed to summarize the clinical aspects of novel beta-coronavirus infection and its possible clinical presentations together with suggested therapeutic algorithms for patients who may require antibiotic treatment.

Cardiovascular, digestive and endocrine system diseases were commonly reported, except previous chronic pulmonary diseases (e.g., COPD, asthma, bronchiectasis) that were surprisingly underreporte...","INTRODUCTION: In the beginning of 2020, an unexpected outbreak due to a new corona virus made the headlines all over the world. Exponential growth in the number of those affected makes this virus such a threat. The current meta-analysis aimed to estimate the prevalence of underlying disorders in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. METHODS: A comprehensive systematic search was performed on PubMed, Scopus, Web of science, and Google scholar, to find articles published until 15 February 2020. All relevant articles that reported clinical characteristics and epidemiological information of hospitalized COVID-19 patients were included in the analysis. RESULTS: The data of 76993 patients presented in 10 articles were included in this study. According to the meta-analysis, the pooled prevalence of hypertension, cardiovascular disease, smoking history and diabetes in people infected with SARS-CoV-2 were estimated as 16.37% (95%CI: 10.15%-23.65%), 12.11% (95%CI 4.40%-22.75%), 7.63% (95%CI 3.83%-12.4...","COVID-19 is a coronavirus outbreak that initially appeared in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, in December 2019, but it has already evolved into a pandemic spreading rapidly worldwide(1,2). As of 18 March 2020, a total number of 194909 cases of COVID-19 have been reported, including 7876 deaths, the majority of which have been reported in China (3242) and Italy (2505)(3). However, as the pandemic is still unfortunately under progression, there are limited data with regard to the clinical characteristics of the patients as well as to their prognostic factors(4). Smoking, to date, has been assumed to be possibly associated with adverse disease prognosis, as extensive evidence has highlighted the negative impact of tobacco use on lung health and its causal association with a plethora of respiratory diseases(5). Smoking is also detrimental to the immune system and its responsiveness to infections, making smokers more vulnerable to infectious diseases(6). Previous studies have shown that smoke...","Background With evidence of sustained transmission in more than 190 countries, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been declared a global pandemic. As such, data are urgently needed about risk factors associated with clinical outcomes. Methods A retrospective chart review of 323 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in Wuhan was conducted. Patients were classified into three disease severity groups (non-severe, severe, and critical), based on their initial clinical presentation. Clinical outcomes were designated as favorable and unfavorable, based on disease progression and response to treatments. Logistic regression models were performed to identify factors associated with clinical outcomes, and logrank test was conducted for the association with clinical progression. Results Current standard treatments did not show significant improvement on patient outcomes in the study. By univariate logistic regression model, 27 risk factors were significantly associated with clinical outcomes. ...","BACKGROUND: While the risk of severe complications of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and its determinants have been explored in previous studies, a systematic analysis of published articles with different designs and populations has yet to be conducted. The present study aimed to systematically review the risk of death associated with MERS as well as risk factors for associated complications. METHODS: PubMed and Web of Science databases were searched for clinical and epidemiological studies on confirmed cases of MERS. Eligible articles reported clinical outcomes, especially severe complications or death associated with MERS. Risks of admission to intensive care unit (ICU), mechanical ventilation and death were estimated. Subsequently, potential associations between MERS-associated death and age, sex, underlying medical conditions and study design were explored. RESULTS: A total of 25 eligible articles were identified. The case fatality risk ranged from 14.5 to 100%, with the p...","BACKGROUND: Since early December 2019, the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has caused pneumonia epidemic in Wuhan, Hubei province of China. This study aims to investigate the factors affecting the progression of pneumonia in COVID-19 patients. Associated results will be used to evaluate the prognosis and to find the optimal treatment regimens for COVID-19 pneumonia. METHODS: Patients tested positive for the COVID-19 based on nucleic acid detection were included in this study. Patients were admitted to 3 tertiary hospitals in Wuhan between December 30, 2019, and January 15, 2020. Individual data, laboratory indices, imaging characteristics, and clinical data were collected, and statistical analysis was performed. Based on clinical typing results, the patients were divided into a progression group or an improvement/stabilization group. Continuous variables were analyzed using independent samples t-test or Mann-Whitney U test. Categorical variables were analyzed using Chi-square...","Background Notwithstanding the clinical hallmarks of COVID-19 patients were reported, several critical issues still remain mysterious, i.e., prognostic factors for COVID-19 including extrinsic factors as viral load of SARS-CoV-2 and intrinsic factors as individual's health conditions; myocarditis incidence rate and hallmarks. Methods Demographic, epidemiologic, radiologic and laboratory data were collected by medical record reviews of adult hospitalized patients diagnosed as COVID-19. Cycle threshold (Ct) value data of real-time PCR (RT-PCR) were collected. The time duration was from 21 January to 2 March, 2020. Pulmonary inflammation index (PII) values were used for chest CT findings. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to identify independent severity risk factors. RESULTS In total, 84 hospitalized adult patients diagnosed as COVID-19 were included, including 20 severe and 64 nonsevere cases. The viral load of the severe group was significantly higher than that of the ...","The SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) novel coronavirus represents a significant health risk, particularly in older patients. Cancer is one of the leading causes of death in most rich countries, and delivering chemotherapy may be associated with increased risk in the presence of a pandemic infection. Estimating this risk is crucial in making decisions about balancing risks and benefits from administering chemotherapy. However, there are no specific data about chemotherapy risks per se. Here we develop a simple model to estimate the potential harms in patients undergoing chemotherapy during a COVID outbreak. We use age-related case fatality rates as a basis for estimating risk, and use previous data from risk of death during influenza outbreaks to estimate the additional risk associated with chemotherapy. We use data from randomised trials to estimate benefit across a range of curative and palliative settings, and address the balance of benefit against the risk of harm. We then use those data to es...","The Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) emerged in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in 2012 causing a critical challenge to public health. The epidemiology of MERS-CoV remain enigmatic as human-to-human transmission is not fully understood. One possible scenario that might play a role in the virus transmission is the cultural waterpipe smoking. Caf\u00e9s providing waterpipe smoking in cities within Saudi Arabia have been moved to areas outside city limits that frequently place them close to camels markets. We report results of a surveillance study wherein waterpipe hoses throughout several regions in Saudi Arabia were tested for the presence of MERS-CoV. A total of 2489 waterpipe samples were collected from cities where MERS-CoV cases were continuously recorded. MERS-CoV RNA wasn\u2019t detected in collected samples. Irrespective of the negative results of our survey, the public health risk of waterpipe smoking should not be underestimated. To avoid a possible transmission within country whe...","The past century witnessed a rapid development of respiratory medicine in China. The major burden of respiratory disease has shifted from infectious diseases to chronic noninfectious diseases. Great achievements have been made in improving the national standard of clinical management of various respiratory diseases and in smoking control. The specialty of respiratory medicine is expanding into pulmonary and critical care medicine. Nevertheless, respiratory diseases remain a major public health problem, with new challenges such as air pollution and nosocomial infections. This review describes the history, accomplishments, new challenges, and opportunities in respiratory medicine in China.","The 2014\u201315 Ebola outbreak in West Africa highlighted the potential for large disease outbreaks caused by emerging pathogens and has generated considerable focus on preparedness for future epidemics. Here we discuss drivers, strategies and practical considerations for developing vaccines against outbreak pathogens. Chimpanzee adenoviral (ChAd) vectors have been developed as vaccine candidates for multiple infectious diseases and prostate cancer. ChAd vectors are safe and induce antigen-specific cellular and humoral immunity in all age groups, as well as circumventing the problem of pre-existing immunity encountered with human Ad vectors. For these reasons, such viral vectors provide an attractive platform for stockpiling vaccines for emergency deployment in response to a threatened outbreak of an emerging pathogen. Work is already underway to develop vaccines against a number of other outbreak pathogens and we will also review progress on these approaches here, particularly for Lassa f...","BACKGROUND: Prior to emergence in human populations, zoonoses such as SARS cause occasional infections in human populations exposed to reservoir species. The risk of widespread epidemics in humans can be assessed by monitoring the reproduction number R (average number of persons infected by a human case). However, until now, estimating R required detailed outbreak investigations of human clusters, for which resources and expertise are not always available. Additionally, existing methods do not correct for important selection and under-ascertainment biases. Here, we present simple estimation methods that overcome many of these limitations. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Our approach is based on a parsimonious mathematical model of disease transmission and only requires data collected through routine surveillance and standard case investigations. We apply it to assess the transmissibility of swine-origin influenza A H3N2v-M virus in the US, Nipah virus in Malaysia and Bangladesh, and also present...","The coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has infected more than 600,000 people and has overwhelmed hospital systems around the world. However, the factors mediating fatal SARS-CoV-2 infections are poorly understood. Here, we show that cigarette smoke causes a dose-dependent upregulation of Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2), the SARS-CoV-2 receptor, in rodent and human lungs. Using single-cell sequencing data, we demonstrate that ACE2 is expressed in a subset of epithelial cells that line the respiratory tract, including goblet cells, club cells, and alveolar type 2 cells. Chronic smoke exposure triggers a protective expansion of mucus-secreting goblet cells and a concomitant increase in ACE2 expression. In contrast, quitting smoking causes a decrease in lung ACE2 levels. Taken together, these results may partially explain why smokers are particularly likely to develop severe SARS-CoV-2 infections, and they suggest that quitting smoking could lessen coronavirus susceptibility.","Background/introduction COVID\u221219, a novel coronavirus outbreak starting in China, is now a rapidly developing public health emergency of international concern. The clinical spectrum of COVID\u221219 disease is varied, and identifying factors associated with severe disease has been described as an urgent research priority. It has been noted that elderly patients with pre-existing comorbidities are more vulnerable to more severe disease. However, the specific symptoms and comorbidities that most strongly predict disease severity are unclear. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to identify the symptoms and comorbidities predictive of COVID\u221219 severity. Method This study was prospectively registered on PROSPERO. A literature search was performed in three databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE and Global Health) for studies indexed up to 5th March 2020. Two reviewers independently screened the literature and both also completed data extraction. Quality appraisal of studies was performed using...","Pulmonary infections in critically ill patients are common and associated with high morbidity and mortality. Piperacillin-tazobactam is a frequently used therapy in critically ill patients with pulmonary infection. Antibiotic concentrations in the lung reflect target site antibiotic concentrations in patients with pneumonia. The aim of this study was to assess the plasma and intra-pulmonary pharmacokinetics (PK) of piperacillin-tazobactam in critically ill patients administered standard piperacillin-tazobactam regimens. A population PK model was developed to describe plasma and intra-pulmonary piperacillin and tazobactam concentrations. The probability of piperacillin exposures reaching pharmacodynamic endpoints and the impact of pulmonary permeability on piperacillin and tazobactam pulmonary penetration was explored. The median piperacillin and tazobactam pulmonary penetration ratio was 49.3% and 121.2%, respectively. Pulmonary piperacillin and tazobactam concentration were unpredicta...","Although, to our knowledge, there has been no exhaustive or credible review of the evidence of the disease burden of COPD in China, COPD has become an increasing public health concern to the Chinese medical community. The purpose of this article is to review the evidence and evaluate and clarify the disease burden of COPD in China with the aim of improving effective management. We reviewed previous studies of COPD in China, which included data on prevalence, mortality, disease burden, risk factors, diagnosis, and management by searching related Web sites, including PubMed, ProQuest, and Thomson Reuters' Web of Knowledge, as well as major Chinese databases and government Web sites. Reported COPD prevalence varied between 5% and 13% in different provinces/cities across China. In 2008, COPD ranked fourth as a leading cause of death in urban areas and third in rural areas. In addition, COPD accounted for 1.6% of all hospital admissions in China in that year. The high prevalence of smoking ...","Background: Management of high mortality risk due to significant progression requires prior assessment of time-to-progression. However, few related methods are available for COVID-19 pneumonia. Methods: We retrospectively enrolled 338 adult patients admitted to one hospital between Jan 11, 2020 to Feb 29, 2020. The final follow-up date was March 8, 2020. We compared characteristics between patients with severe and non-severe outcome, and used multivariate survival analyses to assess the risk of progression to severe conditions. Results: A total of 76 (31.9%) patients progressed to severe conditions and 3 (0.9%) died. The mean time from hospital admission to severity onset is 3.7 days. Age, body mass index (BMI), fever symptom on admission, co-existing hypertension or diabetes are associated with severe progression. Compared to non-severe group, the severe group already demonstrated, at an early stage, abnormalities in biomarkers indicating organ function, inflammatory responses, blood ...","Effective treatments for Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak are urgently needed. While anti-viral approaches and vaccines are being considered immediate countermeasures are unavailable. The aim of this article is to outline a perspective on the pathophysiology of COVID-19 in the context of the currently available clinical data published in the literature. This article appreciates clinical data published on COVID-19 in the context of another respiratory illness - high altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE). Both conditions have significant similarities that portend pathophysiologic trajectories. Following this potential treatment options emerge. Both COVID-19 and HAPE exhibit a decreased ratio of arterial oxygen partial pressure to fractional inspired oxygen with concomitant hypoxia and tachypnea. There also appears to be a tendency for low carbon dioxide levels in both as well. Radiologic findings of ground glass opacities are present in up to 86% of patients with COVID-19 in additi...","Up to 25% of patients with profound neutropenia lasting for &gt;10 days develop lung infiltrates, which frequently do not respond to broad-spectrum antibacterial therapy. While a causative pathogen remains undetected in the majority of cases, Aspergillus spp., Pneumocystis jirovecii, multi-resistant Gram-negative pathogens, mycobacteria or respiratory viruses may be involved. In at-risk patients who have received trimethoprim\u2013sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) prophylaxis, filamentous fungal pathogens appear to be predominant, yet commonly not proven at the time of treatment initiation. Pathogens isolated from blood cultures, bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) or respiratory secretions are not always relevant for the etiology of pulmonary infiltrates and should therefore be interpreted critically. Laboratory tests for detecting Aspergillus galactomannan, \u03b2-d-glucan or DNA from blood, BAL or tissue samples may facilitate the diagnosis; however, most polymerase chain reaction assays are not yet standardi...","Abstract The World has changed dramatically since the COVID-19 pandemic began. Together with our social, occupational, and personal life, the new corona virus poses novel challenges for all physicians, including dermatologists. Despite the virus not being dermatotropic, several skin conditions have emerged, mainly as a result of prolonged contact to personal protective equipment and excessive personal hygiene. Pressure injury, contact dermatitis, itch, pressure urticaria, and exacerbation of pre-existing skin diseases, including seborrheic dermatitis and acne, have been described. We have focused on the dermatologic aspects of COVID-19 infection, so that dermatologist may be aware of the skin complications and the preventive measures to be taken in the COVID-19 pandemic.","Background and aims Many patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have underlying cardiovascular (CV) disease or develop acute cardiac injury during the course of the illness. Adequate understanding of the interplay between COVID-19 and CV disease is required for optimum management of these patients. Methods A literature search was done using PubMed and Google search engines to prepare a narrative review on this topic. Results Respiratory illness is the dominant clinical manifestation of COVID-19; CV involvement occurs much less commonly. Acute cardiac injury, defined as significant elevation of cardiac troponins, is the most commonly reported cardiac abnormality in COVID-19. It occurs in approximately 8-12% of all patients. Direct myocardial injury due to viral involvement of cardiomyocytes and the effect of systemic inflammation appear to be the most common mechanisms responsible for cardiac injury. The information about other CV manifestations in COVID-19 is very limited at...","Surveillance is essential for communicable disease prevention and control. Traditional notification of demographic and clinical information, about individuals with selected (notifiable) infectious diseases, allows appropriate public health action and is protected by public health and privacy legislation, but is slow and insensitive. Big data\u2013based electronic surveillance, by commercial bodies and government agencies (for profit or population control), which draws on a plethora of internet- and mobile device\u2013based sources, has been widely accepted, if not universally welcomed. Similar anonymous digital sources also contain syndromic information, which can be analysed, using customised algorithms, to rapidly predict infectious disease outbreaks, but the data are nonspecific and predictions sometimes misleading. However, public health authorities could use these online sources, in combination with de-identified personal health data, to provide more accurate and earlier warning of infectio...","The 2019-nCov will not be the last epidemic to challenge public health experts. The growth of AI-driven techniques to identify epidemiologic risks early will be key to our improvement of prediction, prevention, and detection of future global health risks. The devastating situation in Wuhan, China and future epidemics will also find value in ongoing research in 2019-nCov case detection, spread prediction, treatment effectiveness, and containment. The wide variety, velocity, and veracity of data now available in crises yield data sets that many researchers will now need to incorporate into evermore complex models. This requires expansion of talent within AI for healthcare applications. AI is no longer a niche research area nor is it a tool for the most advanced healthcare systems only, its global impact on healthcare is real and its potential to save lives in this epidemic as well as future epidemics should not be underestimated. It is critical to the global health of all humankind for t...","Abstract Objective To investigate the characteristics and prognostic factors in the elderly patients with COVID-19. Methods Consecutive cases over 60 years old with COVID-19 in Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University from Jan 1 to Feb 6, 2020 were included. The primary outcomes were death and survival till March 5. Data of demographics, clinical features, comorbidities, laboratory tests and complications were collected and compared for different outcomes. Cox regression was performed for prognostic factors. Results 339 patients with COVID-19 (aged 71\u00b18 years,173 females (51%)) were enrolled, including 80 (23.6%) critical, 159 severe (46.9%) and 100 moderate (29.5%) cases. Common comorbidities were hypertension (40.8%), diabetes (16.0%) and cardiovascular disease (15.7%). Common symptoms included fever (92.0%), cough (53.0%), dyspnea (40.8%) and fatigue (39.9%). Lymphocytopenia was a common laboratory finding (63.2%). Common complications included bacterial infection (42.8%), liver enzyme a...","In current severe global emergency situation of 2019-nCov outbreak, it is imperative to identify vulnerable and susceptible groups for effective protection and care. Recently, studies found that 2019-nCov and SARS-nCov share the same receptor, ACE2. In this study, we analyzed five large-scale bulk transcriptomic datasets of normal lung tissue and two single-cell transcriptomic datasets to investigate the disparities related to race, age, gender and smoking status in ACE2 gene expression and its distribution among cell types. We didn't find significant disparities in ACE2 gene expression between racial groups (Asian vs Caucasian), age groups (&gt;60 vs &lt;60) or gender groups (male vs female). However, we observed significantly higher ACE2 gene expression in former smoker's lung compared to non-smoker's lung. Also, we found higher ACE2 gene expression in Asian current smokers compared to non-smokers but not in Caucasian current smokers, which may indicate an existence of gene-smoking interac...","ABSTRACTTo combat the pandemic of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19), numerous governments have established phone hotlines to prescreen potential cases. These hotlines have struggled with the volume of callers, leading to wait times of hours or, even, an inability to contact health authorities. Symptoma is a symptom-to-disease digital health assistant that can differentiate more than 20,000 diseases with an accuracy of more than 90%. We tested the accuracy of Symptoma to identify COVID-19 using a set of diverse clinical cases combined with case reports of COVID-19. We showed that Symptoma can accurately distinguish COVID-19 in 96.32% of clinical cases. When considering only COVID-19 symptoms and risk factors, Symptoma identified 100% of those infected when presented with only three signs. Lastly, we showed that Symptoma\u2019s accuracy far exceeds that of simple \u201cyes-no\u201d questionnaires widely available online. In summary, Symptoma provides unparalleled accuracy in systematically identifying...","The outbreak of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is quickly turning into a pandemic. Although the disease is now better contained in China, 32 702 cases remain as of March 2, 2020. 10 566 cases and 166 deaths outside of China had been reported as of March 3 (WHO situation report 43), which is a large increase from the 2918 cases and 44 deaths reported on Feb 26 (WHO situation report 37). Rapid progress has been made with diagnostic reagents (eg, nucleic acid and IgM or IgG detection, or both), drug repurposing (eg, remdesivir and chloroquine), and vaccine production. Studies on the biology of viral infection and clinical management of the disease have also been published, some of which have demonstrated that differences in COVID-19 disease prevalence and severity are associated with sex, and smoking is related to higher expression of ACE2 (the receptor for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 [SARS-CoV-2]), so that might also be a factor. One study (preprint),1 usin...","Summary Background Since December, 2019, Wuhan, China, has experienced an outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Epidemiological and clinical characteristics of patients with COVID-19 have been reported but risk factors for mortality and a detailed clinical course of illness, including viral shedding, have not been well described. Methods In this retrospective, multicentre cohort study, we included all adult inpatients (\u226518 years old) with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 from Jinyintan Hospital and Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital (Wuhan, China) who had been discharged or had died by Jan 31, 2020. Demographic, clinical, treatment, and laboratory data, including serial samples for viral RNA detection, were extracted from electronic medical records and compared between survivors and non-survivors. We used univariable and multivariable logistic regression methods to explore the risk factors associated with in-hosp...","Background: Estimating key infectious disease parameters from the COVID-19 outbreak is quintessential for modelling studies and guiding intervention strategies. Whereas different estimates for the incubation period distribution and the serial interval distribution have been reported, estimates of the generation interval for COVID-19 have not been provided. Methods: We used outbreak data from clusters in Singapore and Tianjin, China to estimate the generation interval from symptom onset data while acknowledging uncertainty about the incubation period distribution and the underlying transmission network. From those estimates we obtained the proportions pre-symptomatic transmission and reproduction numbers. Results: The mean generation interval was 5.20 (95%CI 3.78-6.78) days for Singapore and 3.95 (95%CI 3.01-4.91) days for Tianjin, China when relying on a previously reported incubation period with mean 5.2 and SD 2.8 days. The proportion of pre-symptomatic transmission was 48% (95%CI 32...","ABSTRACT BACKGROUND The epidemiological and clinical characteristics of heart transplant (HTx) recipients during the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic remains unclear. We studied the characteristics of HTx recipients during Dec 20, 2019 and Feb 25, 2020 in an effort to understand their risk and outcomes. METHODS All accessible HTx recipients were included in this single-center, retrospective study. We collected information on the recipients using a web-based questionnaire as well as the hospital database. RESULTS We followed 87 HTx recipients (72.4% were men and average age was 51 years). 79 recipients resided in Hubei, and 57 recipients had a Wuhan related history of travel or contact. The majority took precautionary measures while in contact with suspicious crowds. 96.6% of the families and communities undertook prevention and quarantine procedures. 4 upper airway infection were reported, and 3 of them tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 (the 4th recovered and was not tested). All cases were mild and s...","","","Policies and public health efforts have not addressed the gendered impacts of disease outbreaks.1 The response to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) appears no different. We are not aware of any gender analysis of the outbreak by global health institutions or governments in affected countries or in preparedness phases. Recognising the extent to which disease outbreaks affect women and men differently is a fundamental step to understanding the primary and secondary effects of a health emergency on different individuals and communities, and for creating effective, equitable policies and interventions. Although sex-disaggregated data for COVID-19 show equal numbers of cases between men and women so far, there seem to be sex differences in mortality and vulnerability to the disease.2 Emerging evidence suggests that more men than women are dying, potentially due to sex-based immunological3 or gendered differences, such as patterns and prevalence of smoking.4 However, current sex-disaggrega...","Abstract Experimental and clinical evidence supports an active role of the renin\u2013angiotensin system (RAS) in the pathogenesis and progression of lung diseases. Angiotensin II (Ang II), a key vasoactive peptide of the RAS, has been implicated in pulmonary disorders such as pulmonary arterial hypertension, lung fibrosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and acute respiratory distress syndrome. Over the past few years, the classical concept of the RAS has undergone substantial changes to include several new active components. Among them, the identification of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), its metabolic product angiotensin-(1-7) (Ang-(1-7)), and the Mas receptor has been of biological significance since these components form a counterregulatory axis (ACE2/Ang-(1-7)/Mas) that opposes the detrimental actions of Ang II. In this chapter, we will discuss the role of the ACE2/Ang-(1-7)/Mas axis in lung diseases and describe novel therapeutic approaches to activate this axis for t...","An outbreak of the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19 respiratory disease, has infected over 290,000 people since the end of 2019, killed over 12,000, and caused worldwide social and economic disruption. There are currently no antiviral drugs with proven efficacy nor are there vaccines for its prevention. Unfortunately, the scientific community has little knowledge of the molecular details of SARS-CoV-2 infection. To illuminate this, we cloned, tagged and expressed 26 of the 29 viral proteins in human cells and identified the human proteins physically associated with each using affinity-purification mass spectrometry (AP-MS), which identified 332 high confidence SARS-CoV-2-human protein-protein interactions (PPIs). Among these, we identify 67 druggable human proteins or host factors targeted by 69 existing FDA-approved drugs, drugs in clinical trials and/or preclinical compounds, that we are currently evaluating for efficacy in live SARS-CoV-2 infection assay...","Abstract 2020 has become the year of coping with COVID-19. This year was to be the \u201csuper year\u201d for sustainability, a year of strengthening global actions to accelerate the transformations required for achieving the 2030 agenda. We argue that 2020 can and must be a year of both. Thus we call for more utilisation of the health-emergency disaster risk management (Health-EDRM) framework to complement current responses to COVID-19 and the patent risk of similar phenomena in the future. To make our case, we examine current responses to COVID-19 and their implications for the SFDRR. We argue that current mechanisms and strategies for disaster resilience, as outlined in the SFDRR, can enhance responses to epidemics or global pandemics such as COVID-19. In this regard, we make several general and DRR-specific recommendations. These recommendations concern knowledge and science provision in understanding disaster and health-related emergency risks, the extension of disaster risk governance to m...","The 2019-nCoV is reported to share the same entry (ACE2) as SARS-CoV according to the updated findings. Analyzing the distribution and expression level of the route of coronavirus may help reveal underlying mechanisms of viral susceptibility and post-infection modulation. In this study, we found that the expression of ACE2 in healthy populations and patients with underlying diseases was not significantly different, suggesting relatively similar susceptibility, which was consistent with current clinical observations. Moreover, based on the expression of ACE2 in smoking individuals, we inferred that long-term smoking might be a risk factor for 2019-nCoV. Analyzing the ACE2 in SARS-CoV infected cells suggested that ACE2 was more than just a receptor but also participated in post-infection regulation, including immune response, cytokine secretion, and viral genome replication. We also constructed Protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks and identified hub genes in viral activity and cyto...","Background: Since the outbreak of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in China, respiratory manifestations of the disease have been observed. However, as a fatal comorbidity, acute myocardial injury (AMI) in COVID-19 patients has not been previously investigated in detail. We investigated the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients with AMI and determined the risk factors for AMI in them. Methods: We analyzed data from 53 consecutive laboratory-confirmed and hospitalized COVID-19 patients (28 men, 25 women; age, 19-81 years). We collected information on epidemiological and demographic characteristics, clinical features, routine laboratory tests (including cardiac injury biomarkers), echocardiography, electrocardiography, imaging findings, management methods, and clinical outcomes. Results: Cardiac complications were found in 42 of the 53 (79.25%) patients: tachycardia (n=15), electrocardiography abnormities (n=11), diastolic dysfunction (n=20), elevated myocardial enzymes (n=..."],"title":["History of Coronary Heart Disease Increases the Mortality Rate of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Patients: A Nested Case-Control Study Based on Publicly Reported Confirmed Cases in Mainland China","Characterizing the Transmission Potential of Zoonotic Infections from Minor Outbreaks","Prevalence, Severity and Mortality associated with COPD and Smoking in patients with COVID-19: A Rapid Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis","Main factors influencing recovery in MERS Co-V patients using machine learning","A qualitative study of zoonotic risk factors among rural communities in southern China","Clinical Features and Outcomes of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome and Predictive Factors for Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome","Triage assessment of cardiorespiratory risk status based on measurement of the anaerobic threshold, and estimation by patient-reported activity limitation","Incidence, clinical characteristics and prognostic factor of patients with COVID-19: a systematic review and meta-analysis","Health security capacities in the context of COVID-19 outbreak: an analysis of International Health Regulations annual report data from 182 countries","ACE-2 Expression in the Small Airway Epithelia of Smokers and COPD Patients: Implications for COVID-19","Comorbidity and its impact on 1,590 patients with COVID-19 in China: A Nationwide Analysis","Implications of COVID-19 for patients with pre-existing digestive diseases","2019-novel coronavirus outbreak: A new challenge","Prevalence of Underlying Diseases in Hospitalized Patients with COVID-19: a Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis","COVID-19 and smoking: A systematic review of the evidence","Risk Factors Associated with Clinical Outcomes in 323 COVID-19 Patients in Wuhan, China","Clinical determinants of the severity of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS): a systematic review and meta-analysis","Analysis of factors associated with disease outcomes in hospitalized patients with 2019 novel coronavirus disease","COVID-19 Myocarditis and Severity Factors\uff1a An Adult Cohort Study","Estimating the Risks from COVID-19 Infection in Adult Chemotherapy Patients","Waterpipe smoking as a public health risk: Potential risk for transmission of MERS-CoV","Respiratory Medicine in China Progress, Challenges, and Opportunities","Chimpanzee adenoviral vectors as vaccines for outbreak pathogens","Using Routine Surveillance Data to Estimate the Epidemic Potential of Emerging Zoonoses: Application to the Emergence of US Swine Origin Influenza A H3N2v Virus","Cigarette smoke triggers the expansion of a subpopulation of respiratory epithelial cells that express the SARS-CoV-2 receptor ACE2","Systematic review and meta-analysis of predictive symptoms and comorbidities for severe COVID-19 infection","Pulmonary penetration of piperacillin and tazobactam in critically ill patients","COPD in China The Burden and Importance of Proper Management","Risk assessment of progression to severe conditions for patients with COVID-19 pneumonia: a single-center retrospective study","Acetazolamide, Nifedipine and Phosphodiesterase Inhibitors: Rationale for Their Utilization as Adjunctive Countermeasures in the Treatment of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)","Diagnosis and antimicrobial therapy of lung infiltrates in febrile neutropenic patients (allogeneic SCT excluded): updated guidelines of the Infectious Diseases Working Party (AGIHO) of the German Society of Hematology and Medical Oncology (DGHO)(\u2020)","Covid-19 pandemic and the skin - What should dermatologists know?","Cardiovascular disease and COVID-19","Communicable Disease Surveillance Ethics in the Age of Big Data and New Technology","The Role of Augmented Intelligence (AI) in Detecting and Preventing the Spread of Novel Coronavirus","Coronavirus Disease 2019 in elderly patients: characteristics and prognostic factors based on 4-week follow-up","Bulk and single-cell transcriptomics identify tobacco-use disparity in lung gene expression of ACE2, the receptor of 2019-nCov","An artificial intelligence-based first-line defence against COVID-19: digitally screening citizens for risks via a chatbot","Sex difference and smoking predisposition in patients with COVID-19","Clinical course and risk factors for mortality of adult inpatients with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China: a retrospective cohort study","Estimating the generation interval for COVID-19 based on symptom onset data","EPIDEMIOLOGICAL AND CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS OF HEART TRANSPLANT RECIPIENTS DURING THE 2019 CORONAVIRUS OUTBREAK IN WUHAN, CHINA: A DESCRIPTIVE SURVEY REPORT","Active smoking is not associated with severity of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)","Cannabidiol as prophylaxis for SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19?
