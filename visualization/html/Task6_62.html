Methods A cross-sectional survey study guided by the health belief model was conducted in 2009. The study questionnaire is valid (content validity index, 0.81) and reliable (Cronbach \u03b1 range, 0.65-0.94). Results There were 678 questionnaires analyzed, with a response rate of 68.9%. The mean frequency score of SPs compliance was 4.38 \u00b1 0.40 out of 5. Tukey honest significant difference post hoc test indicated that year 2 and year 4 students had better SPs compliance than year 3 students. Further analysis using a univariate general linear model identified an interaction effect of perceived influence of nursing staff and year of study (F1,593 = 3.72; P &lt; .05). The 5 following predictors for SPs compliance were identified: knowledge of SPs, perceived barriers, adequacy of training, management support, and influence of nursing staff...","First, although COVID-19 is spread by the airborne route, air disinfection of cities and communities is not known to be effective for disease control and needs to be stopped. The widespread practice of spraying disinfectant and alcohol in the sky, on roads, vehicles, and personnel has no value; moreover, large quantities of alcohol and disinfectant are potentially harmful to humans and should be avoided.3 , 4 Second, in the use of personal protective equipment, we should try to distinguish different risk factors, adopt different epidemic prevention measures, and reduce the waste of personal protective equipment, as these resources are already in short supply. Although surgical masks are in widespread use by the general population, there is no evidence that these masks prevent the acquisition of COVID-19, although they might slightly reduce the spread from an infected patient. High-filtration masks such as N95 masks and protective clothing (goggles and gowns) should be used in hospitals...","BACKGROUND: Strategies are urgently needed to mitigate the risk of zoonotic disease emergence in southern China, where pathogens with zoonotic potential are known to circulate in wild animal populations. However, the risk factors leading to emergence are poorly understood, which presents a challenge in developing appropriate mitigation strategies for local communities. METHODS: Residents in rural communities of Yunnan, Guangxi and Guangdong provinces were recruited and enrolled in this study. Data were collected through ethnographic interviews and field observations, and thematically coded and analysed to identify both risk and protective factors for zoonotic disease emergence at the individual, community and policy levels. RESULTS: Eighty-eight ethnographic interviews and 55 field observations were conducted at nine selected sites. Frequent human\u2013animal interactions and low levels of environmental biosecurity in local communities were identified as risks for zoonotic disease emergence...","Abstract During the first few months of 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic has reached Europe. Health systems all over the world are trying to control the outbreak in the shortest possible time. Exotic disease outbreaks are not uncommon in animal health and randomised surveillance is frequently used as support for decision-making. This editorial discusses the possibilities of practicing One Health, by using methods from animal health to enhance surveillance for COVID-19 to provide an evidence base fort decision-making in communities and countries.","Much of the uncertainty about the progression of the COVID-19 pandemic stems from questions about when and how non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPI) by governments, in particular social distancing measures, are implemented, to what extent the population complies with these measures, and how compliance changes through time. Further uncertainty comes from a lack of knowledge of the potential effects of removing interventions once the epidemic is declining. By combining an epidemiological model of COVID-19 for the United Kingdom with simple sub-models for these societal processes, this study aims to shed light on the conceivable trajectories that the pandemic might follow over the next 1.5 years. We show strong improvements in outcomes if governments review NPI more frequently whereas, in comparison, the stability of compliance has surprisingly small effects on cumulative mortality. Assuming that mortality does considerably increase once a country's hospital capacity is breached, we show...","Chinese government has taken strong measures in response to the epidemic of new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) from Jan.23, 2020. The number of confirmed infected individuals are still increasing rapidly. Estimating the accurate infected population and the future trend of epidemic spreading under control measures is significant and urgent. There have been reports external icon of spread from an infected patient with no symptoms to a close contact, which means the incubation individuals may has the possibility of infectiousness. However, the traditional transmission model, Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered (SEIR) model, assumes that the exposed individual is being infected but without infectiousness. Thus, the estimating infected populations based on SEIR model from the existing literatures seems too far more than the official reported data. Here, we inferred that the epidemic could be spread by exposed (incubation) individuals. Then, we provide a new Exposed-identified-Recovered (EIR) ...","","OBJECTIVES: To determine paediatric emergency department (ED) staff perceptions of the effectiveness and practice of infection control measures against a novel virulent pathogen. METHODS: All medical staff of the paediatric ED in a tertiary medical centre completed a written questionnaire near the onset of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak. Level of concern regarding SARS, and perceptions of effectiveness and use of infection control measures were assessed on a 5 point scale. Statistical analysis was performed using \u03c7(2) test and one way analysis of variance with significance at p&lt;0.05. RESULTS: Response rate was 97% (116/120). All scores were given out of 5 possible points. Using isolation rooms (mean score 4.6), wearing a mask when examining patients (4.5), and handwashing (4.5) were considered most effective. Staff physicians reported handwashing more than nurses and trainees (4.9 v 4.5 and 4.5, respectively; p&lt;0.05) while other measures were reported equally. Re...","Timely detection of novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection cases is crucial to interrupt the spread of this virus. We assessed the required expertise and capacity for molecular detection of 2019-nCoV in specialised laboratories in 30 European Union/European Economic Area (EU/EEA) countries. Thirty-eight laboratories in 24 EU/EEA countries had diagnostic tests available by 29 January 2020. A coverage of all EU/EEA countries was expected by mid-February. Availability of primers/probes, positive controls and personnel were main implementation barriers.","What has happened in China shows that quarantine, social distancing, and isolation of infected populations can contain the epidemic.1 This impact of the COVID-19 response in China is encouraging for the many countries where COVID-19 is beginning to spread. However, it is unclear whether other countries can implement the stringent measures China eventually adopted. Singapore and Hong Kong, both of which had severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemics in 2002\u201303, provide hope and many lessons to other countries. In both places, COVID-19 has been managed well to date, despite early cases, by early government action and through social distancing measures taken by individuals. The course of an epidemic is defined by a series of key factors, some of which are poorly understood at present for COVID-19. The basic reproduction number (R0), which defines the mean number of secondary cases generated by one primary case when the population is largely susceptible to infection, determines the...","BACKGROUND: Viral epidemics or pandemics of acute respiratory infections like influenza or severe acute respiratory syndrome pose a global threat. Antiviral drugs and vaccinations may be insufficient to prevent their spread. OBJECTIVES: To review the effectiveness of physical interventions to interrupt or reduce the spread of respiratory viruses. SEARCH METHODS: We searched The Cochrane Library, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2010, Issue 3), which includes the Acute Respiratory Infections Group's Specialised Register, MEDLINE (1966 to October 2010), OLDMEDLINE (1950 to 1965), EMBASE (1990 to October 2010), CINAHL (1982 to October 2010), LILACS (2008 to October 2010), Indian MEDLARS (2008 to October 2010) and IMSEAR (2008 to October 2010).

We scanned 3775 titles, excluded 3560 and retrieved full pape...","While coronaviruses were first identified nearly 60 years ago, they received notoriety in 2003 when one of their members was identified as the etiological agent of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV) 1. Previously these viruses were known to be important agents of respiratory and enteric infections of domestic and companion animals and to cause approximately 15% of all cases of the common cold. This Review focuses on recent advances in our understanding of the mechanisms of coronavirus replication, interactions with the host immune response and disease pathogenesis and highlights the recent identification of numerous novel coronaviruses and the propensity of this virus family to cross species barriers.","Objective To provide an overview of supply and demand issues in the vaccine industry and the policy options that have been implemented to resolve these issues. Data sources Medline, Policy File, and International Pharmaceutical Abstracts were searched to locate academic journal articles. Other sources reviewed included texts on the topics of vaccine history and policy, government agency reports, and reports from independent think tanks. Keywords included vaccines, immunizations, supply, demand, and policy. Study selection Search criteria were limited to English language and human studies.

Policy decisions depend on such predictions but they vary widely. On the other hand much empirical information is already contained in the data of evolving epidemiological profiles. We show, both with evidence from data, and theoretically, how the ratio of daily infected and recovered cases can be used to track and predict the course of the epidemic. Ability to predict the turning points and the end of the epidemic is of crucial importance for fighting the epidemic and planning for a return to normalcy. The accuracy of the prediction of the peaks of the epidemic is validated using data in different regions in China showing the effects of different levels of quarantine. The validated tool can be applied to other countries where Covid-19 has spread, and generally to future epidemics. A preliminary prediction for South Korea...","The basic reproduction number of an infectious agent is the average number of infections one case can generate over the course of the infectious period, in a na\u00efve, uninfected population. It is well-known that the estimation of this number may vary due to several methodological issues, including different assumptions and choice of parameters, utilized models, used datasets and estimation period. With the spreading of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection, the reproduction number has been found to vary, reflecting the dynamics of transmission of the coronavirus outbreak as well as the case reporting rate. Due to significant variations in the control strategies, which have been changing over time, and thanks to the introduction of detection technologies that have been rapidly improved, enabling to shorten the time from infection/symptoms onset to diagnosis, leading to faster confirmation of the new coronavirus cases, our previous estimations on the transmission risk of the 2019-nCo...","Purpose: The COVID-19 death-rate in Italy continues to climb, surpassing that in every other country. We implement one of the first nationally representative surveys about this unprecedented public health crisis and use it to evaluate the Italian government's public health efforts and citizen responses. Findings: (1) Public health messaging is being heard. At this point, the Italian people understand how to keep themselves and others safe from the SARS-Cov-2 virus. This is true for all population groups we studied, with the partial exception of slightly lower compliance among young adults. Remarkably, even those who do not trust the government, and those who think the government has been untruthful about the crisis mostly believe the public health message and claim to be acting in accordance. (2) The quarantine is beginning to have serious negative effects on the population's mental health. Policy Recommendations: Public health messaging is being heard and understood. The focus now sho...","The Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) was first described in 2012 and, subsequently, many cases were reported with a lower case fatality rate than initial cases. Humans can become infected within their communities and transmission can then be amplified in the healthcare setting. Contact investigation among cases shows a variable amount of spread among family members and healthcare workers. So far, circulating virus strains remain similar under continuous monitoring, with no genetic changes. Here, we discuss the transmission pattern, phylogenetic evolution, and pathogenesis of MERS-CoV infection.","Summary The severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemics in 2002\u20132003 showed how quickly a novel infectious disease can spread both within communities and internationally. We have reviewed the epidemiological and genetic analyses that have been published both during and since these epidemics, and show how quickly data were collected and analyses undertaken. Key factors that determine the speed and scale of transmission of an infectious disease were estimated using statistical and mathematical modelling approaches, and phylogenetic analyses provided insights into the origin and evolution of the SARS-associated coronavirus. The SARS literature continues to grow, and it is hoped that international collaboration in the analysis of epidemiological and contact-network databases will provide further insights into the spread of this newly emergent infectious disease.","Abstract Individuals who visit community pharmacies are regarded as customers rather than patients. The public tends to view community pharmacists as businesspeople. Several factors influence individuals' willingness to patronize and to continue visiting such pharmacies. On the supply side, community pharmacists' responsibilities and duties center on the health and well-being of society. In this chapter, an assessment of community pharmacy practices in developing countries is particularly interesting in terms of medication dispensing and extended pharmacy services that promote public wellness. Community pharmacists in developing countries, who are supposedly strategically positioned in the community to provide public health, are not taking advantage on this opportunity. Although several studies have noted the services provided by community pharmacists, in general, the practice is far from meeting expectations due to several barriers. Pharmacists need to realize their opportunities and ...","BACKGROUND: In December 2019, a novel strain of SARS-CoV-2 emerged in Wuhan, China. Since then, the city of Wuhan has taken unprecedented measures and efforts in response to the outbreak. METHODS: We quantified the effects of control measures on population contact patterns in Wuhan, China, to assess their effects on the progression of the outbreak. We included the latest estimates of epidemic parameters from a transmission model fitted to data on local and internationally exported cases from Wuhan in the age-structured epidemic framework. Further, we looked at the age-distribution of cases. Lastly, we simulated lifting of the control measures by allowing people to return to work in a phased-in way, and looked at the effects of returning to work at different stages of the underlying outbreak. FINDINGS: Changes in mixing patterns may have contributed to reducing the number of infections in mid-2020 by 92% (interquartile range: 66-97%). There are benefits to sustaining these measures unti...","Laboratory researchers and students may expose to hazardous and toxic chemicals. Implementation of the Occupational Health, Safety, and Environment Management System (OHSEMS) has become a critical aspect in higher education. This study presents an overview of the evaluation of the implementation of the OHSEMS in higher education laboratories. The implementation of the OHSEMS is to prevent occupational accidents in the laboratory. The study design is a semiquantitative descriptive study. The aim of the study is to evaluate the implementation of the OHSEMS in higher education institution laboratories by evaluating the percentages of OHSEMS compliance in higher education laboratories. Five aspects are evaluated: occupational health, safety, and environment (OHSE) policy and commitment, planning, implementation, evaluation, and management review. The result shows that the average compliance with the OHSE policy and commitment aspect is 59.4% and for the planning, implementation, evaluation...","Abstract Background The novel coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19), which was first detected in Wuhan City, has now became a pandemic that affecting patients around the world. Particularly, the community patient population are at high risk of infection and are facing potential failure of proper medication use during the pandemic. Objective To discuss community pharmacists\u2019 role and the content of pharmaceutical care (PC) during the novel coronavirus pandemic to promote effective prevention and control and safe drug use of the community patient population. Method Collect and summarize the experience Chinese community pharmacies gained from providing pharmacy services during the COVID-19 outbreak, and taking the PC needs into consideration, analyze and discuss the methods and strategies that community pharmacies and pharmacists shall use to provide PC during the pandemic. Results Community pharmacy management teams shall support PC services by providing adequate supply of COVID-19 related me...","Viral infections of the newborn result in significant morbidity and mortality each year. The fetus and newborn are particularly wlnerable to viral infection. The range of expression may vary from no clinical disease to devastating illness and infection occurring before, during, or after birth. Nursing management is determined by the specific viral infection, the severity of the illness, and the unique conditions of the newborn and his/her family. Promising new therapies are on the horizon that may lessen the severity of viral disease. Until such time, the major thrusts of management of neonatal viral disease are prevention of infection and supportive care for the acutely ill newborn.","SARS-CoV-2 has infected over 140,000 people as of March 14, 2020. We use a mathematical model to investigate the effectiveness of social distancing interventions lasting six weeks in a middle-sized city in the US. We explore four social distancing strategies by reducing the contacts of adults over 60 years old, adults over 60 years old and children, all adults (25, 75 or 95% compliance), and everyone in the population. Our results suggest that social distancing interventions can avert cases by 20% and hospitalizations and deaths by 90% even with modest compliance within adults as long as the intervention is kept in place, but the epidemic is set to rebound once the intervention is lifted. Our models suggest that social distancing interventions will buy crucial time but need to occur in conjunction with testing and contact tracing of all suspected cases to mitigate transmission of SARS-CoV-2.","Policies and public health efforts have not addressed the gendered impacts of disease outbreaks.1 The response to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) appears no different. We are not aware of any gender analysis of the outbreak by global health institutions or governments in affected countries or in preparedness phases. Recognising the extent to which disease outbreaks affect women and men differently is a fundamental step to understanding the primary and secondary effects of a health emergency on different individuals and communities, and for creating effective, equitable policies and interventions. Although sex-disaggregated data for COVID-19 show equal numbers of cases between men and women so far, there seem to be sex differences in mortality and vulnerability to the disease.2 Emerging evidence suggests that more men than women are dying, potentially due to sex-based immunological3 or gendered differences, such as patterns and prevalence of smoking.4 However, current sex-disaggrega...","A novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has recently emerged as a global threat. As the epidemic progresses, many disease modelers have focused on estimating the basic reproductive number Ro -- the average number of secondary cases caused by a primary case in an otherwise susceptible population. The modeling approaches and resulting estimates of Ro vary widely, despite relying on similar data sources. Here, we present a novel statistical framework for comparing and combining different estimates of Ro across a wide range of models by decomposing the basic reproductive number into three key quantities: the exponential growth rate $r$, the mean generation interval $\\bar G$, and the generation-interval dispersion $\\kappa$. We then apply our framework to early estimates of Ro for the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak. We show that many early Ro estimates are overly confident. Our results emphasize the importance of propagating uncertainties in all components of Ro, including the shape of the generation-interval...","Interstitial lung disease (ILD) comprises an array of heterogeneous parenchymal lung diseases that are associated with a spectrum of pathologic, radiologic, and clinical manifestations. There are ILDs with known causes and those that are idiopathic, making treatment strategies challenging. Prognosis can vary according to the type of ILD, but many exhibit gradual progression with an unpredictable clinical course in individual patients, as seen in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and the phenomenon of \u201cacute exacerbation\u201d(AE). Given the often poor prognosis of these patients, the search for a reversible cause of respiratory worsening remains paramount. Infections have been theorized to play a role in ILDs, both in the pathogenesis of ILD and as potential triggers of AE. Research efforts thus far have shown the highest association with viral pathogens; however, fungal and bacterial organisms have also been implicated. This review aims to summarize the current knowledge on the role of infecti...","OBJECTIVE: Recognizing increasing interest in community disease surveillance globally, the goal of this study was to investigate whether respiratory viruses circulating in the community may be represented through clinical (hospital) surveillance in Nigeria. RESULTS: Children were selected via convenience sampling from communities and a tertiary care center (n = 91) during spring 2017 in Ilorin, Nigeria. Nasal swabs were collected and tested using polymerase chain reaction. The majority (79.1%) of subjects were under 6 years old, of whom 46 were infected (63.9%). A total of 33 of the 91 subjects had one or more respiratory tract virus; there were 10 cases of triple infection and 5 of quadruple. Parainfluenza virus 4, respiratory syncytial virus B and enterovirus were the most common viruses in the clinical sample; present in 93.8% (15/16) of clinical subjects, and 6.7% (5/75) of community subjects (significant difference, p &lt; 0.001). Coronavirus OC43 was the most common virus detected i...","Abstract Coronaviruses (CoVs) are enveloped, positive-strand RNA viruses with characteristic spike glycoproteins that project outward like the rays of the sun (corona \u2013 Latin for \u2018crown\u2019), when visualized by electron microscopy. CoV are classified, together with the toroviruses, in the family Coronaviridae and the order Nidovirales. All nidoviruses have a common genome organization and generate a nested set (nido \u2013 Latin for \u2018nest\u2019) of 3\u2032 co-terminal mRNAs. CoVs have been isolated from a variety of species, including birds, livestock, domestic animals, and humans. CoV infections can cause respiratory, gastrointestinal, and neurologic disease, depending on the strain of the virus and the site of infection. Importantly, CoVs have been shown to cross species barriers and have emerged from animal reservoirs to infect humans and cause severe disease. The CoV responsible for an outbreak of severe acute respiratory disease (SARS-CoV) in 2002\u201303 likely originated as a bat coronavirus which, du...","We are proposing to use machine learning algorithms to be able to improve possible case identifications of COVID-19 more quicker when we use a mobile phone-based web survey. This will also reduce the spread in the susceptible populations.","Abstract Objective To identify drug interaction databases (DID) and assess the quality of their structures. Method A search was made of the literature for DID and a series of exclusion and structural quality criteria were defined (at least 4 quality criteria: classification according to severity, classification according to level of evidence, bibliographical reference data, description of clinical management, and 11 criteria used for weighting). The level of compliance of every DID with the criteria defined was analysed, together with the level of compliance of each criteria in each DID. Results A total of 54 DID were identified, 30 of which complied with exclusion criteria and 15 of which did not meet the minimum criteria. The rest of the criteria were evaluated in 9 DID: Botplus and Medinteract (100%), SEFH Guide, Lexi-interact and Medscape (89%), Hansten (83%), Micromedex and Stockley (78%), Drug Interactions Facts (68%). Ninety-two percent of the DID describe the mechanism of actio...","","Protein structures are crucial for understanding their biological activities. Since the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), there is an urgent need to understand the biological behavior of the virus and provide a basis for developing effective therapies. Since the proteome of the virus was determined, some of the protein structures could be determined experimentally, and others were predicted via template-based modeling approaches. However, tertiary structures for several proteins are still not available from experiment nor they could be accurately predicted by template-based modeling because of lack of close homolog structures. Previous efforts to predict structures for these proteins include efforts by DeepMind and the Zhang group via machine learning-based structure prediction methods, i.e. AlphaFold and C-I-TASSER. However, the predicted models vary greatly and have not yet been subjected to refinement. Here, we are reporting new predictions fr...","The ongoing COVID-19 outbreak has expanded rapidly throughout China. Major behavioral, clinical, and state interventions are underway currently to mitigate the epidemic and prevent the persistence of the virus in human populations in China and worldwide. It remains unclear how these unprecedented interventions, including travel restrictions, have affected COVID-19 spread in China. We use real-time mobility data from Wuhan and detailed case data including travel history to elucidate the role of case importation on transmission in cities across China and ascertain the impact of control measures. Early on, the spatial distribution of COVID-19 cases in China was well explained by human mobility data. Following the implementation of control measures, this correlation dropped and growth rates became negative in most locations, although shifts in the demographics of reported cases are still indicative of local chains of transmission outside Wuhan. This study shows that the drastic control mea...","Abstract Objective To provide a general description of the roles and contributions of three pharmacists from the Regulatory Affairs program (RA) at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) who are involved in emergency preparedness and response activities, including the 2009 pandemic influenza A (H1N1) public health emergency. Setting Atlanta, GA. Practice description RA consists of a staff of nine members, three of whom are pharmacists. The mission of RA is to support CDC's preparedness and emergency response activities and to ensure regulatory compliance for critical medical countermeasures against potential threats from natural, chemical, biological, radiological, or nuclear events. Conclusion RA was well involved in the response to the H1N1 outbreak through numerous activities, such as submitting multiple Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) requests to the Food and Drug Administration, including those for medical countermeasures to be deployed from the Strategic National ...","The recent outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 (2019-nCoV) virus has highlighted the need for fast and efficacious vaccine development. Stimulation of a proper immune response that leads to protection is highly dependent on presentation of epitopes to circulating T-cells via the HLA complex. SARS-CoV-2 is a large RNA virus and testing of all overlapping peptides in vitro to deconvolute an immune response is not feasible. Therefore HLA-binding prediction tools are often used to narrow down the number of peptides to test. We tested 15 epitope-HLA-binding prediction tools, and using an in vitro peptide MHC stability assay, we assessed 777 peptides that were predicted to be good binders across 11 MHC allotypes. In this investigation of potential SARS-CoV-2 epitopes we found that current prediction tools vary in performance when assessing binding stability, and they are highly dependent on the MHC allotype in question. Designing a COVID-19 vaccine where only a few epitope targets are included is therefo...","Abstract Foodborne parasites have long been a neglected group of pathogens, as they often have insidious, chronic effects, rather than being acute diseases, and they are often associated with impoverished or marginalized populations. In addition, due to the long incubation period for most foodborne parasites, source attribution is often difficult, if not impossible. However, global trends have enabled foodborne parasites to emerge in different populations in new locations, transmitted through different food types, and sometimes with unexpected symptoms. This emergence of foodborne parasites has brought them into focus. In this chapter, six foodborne parasites are used as examples on emergence: Echinococcus multilocularis is spreading to new locations; Cryptosporidium spp. are beginning to be associated not only with water, but also with salads; Trypanosoma cruzi is being manifest with acute disease due to foodborne transmission, particularly transmitted with juices; Trichinella spp. ha...","Ten years have elapsed since the World Health Organization issued its first global alert for an unexplained illness named severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). The anniversary provides an opportunity to reflect on the international response to this new global microbial threat. While global surveillance and response capacity for public health threats have been strengthened, critical gaps remain. Of 194 World Health Organization member states that signed on to the International Health Regulations (2005), &lt;20% had achieved compliance with the core capacities required by the deadline in June 2012. Lessons learned from the global SARS outbreak highlight the need to avoid complacency, strengthen efforts to improve global capacity to address the next pandemic using all available 21st century tools, and support research to develop new treatment options, countermeasures, and insights while striving to address the global inequities that are the root cause of many of these challenges.","This paper focuses on the formulation of a deterministic 2019-nCov transmission model by considering the exposed and recovered populations with immunity. The scenario of the simulation is depicted based on the patient zero in Malaysia. The transmission model is found to be able to predict the next confirmed case given a single case introduced in a fully susceptible population. The mathematical model is developed based on the SEIR model which has susceptible, exposed, infectious and recovered populations. The system of equations which were obtained were solved numerically and the simulation results were analyzed. The analysis includes the impact of the disease if no control is taken.","Summary Objectives To assess associations between the functional polymorphisms G-2518A at the chemokine (C\u2013C motif) ligand 2 gene (CCL2) and mannose binding lectin (MBL) codon 54 variant (A/B) and susceptibility to SARS. Methods We genotyped the CCL2 G-2518A and MBL codon 54 variant (A/B) in 4 case\u2013control populations of Chinese descent, totally consisting of 932 patients with SARS and 982 control subjects. Results Both the high-CCL2-producing GG genotype and the low-MBL-producing B allele were consistently associated with increased risks of SARS-CoV infection in all 4 case\u2013control populations (joint P = 1.6 \u00d7 10\u22124 and 4.9 \u00d7 10\u22128, for CCL2 and MBL respectively), with no interaction between polymorphisms could be detected. Furthermore, all the 4 case\u2013control studies demonstrated a cumulative effect on risk of SARS-CoV infection for the combination of polymorphisms (joint P = 1.3 \u00d7 10\u221210). However, tests using the area under the curve (AUC) indicated that at this stage, the polymorphisms...","Zoonotic transmission of novel viruses represents a significant threat to global public health and is fueled by globalization, the loss of natural habitats, and exposure to new hosts. For coronaviruses (CoVs), broad diversity exists within bat populations and uniquely positions them to seed future emergence events. In this review, we explore the host and viral dynamics that shape these CoV populations for survival, amplification, and possible emergence in novel hosts.","One of the reasons for the fast spread of SARS-CoV-2 is the lack of accuracy in detection tools in the clinical field. Molecular techniques, such as quantitative real-time RT-PCR and nucleic acid sequencing methods, are widely used to identify pathogens. For this particular virus, however, they have an overall unsatisfying detection rate, due to its relatively recent emergence and still not completely understood features. In addition, SARS-CoV-2 is remarkably similar to other Coronaviruses, and it can present with other respiratory infections, making identification even harder. To tackle this issue, we propose an assisted detection test, combining molecular testing with deep learning. The proposed approach employs a state-of-the-art deep convolutional neural network, able to automatically create features starting from the genome sequence of the virus. Experiments on data from the Novel Coronavirus Resource (2019nCoVR) show that the proposed approach is able to correctly classify SARS-C...","ABSTRACT BACKGROUND The epidemiological and clinical characteristics of heart transplant (HTx) recipients during the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic remains unclear. We studied the characteristics of HTx recipients during Dec 20, 2019 and Feb 25, 2020 in an effort to understand their risk and outcomes. METHODS All accessible HTx recipients were included in this single-center, retrospective study. We collected information on the recipients using a web-based questionnaire as well as the hospital database. RESULTS We followed 87 HTx recipients (72.4% were men and average age was 51 years). 79 recipients resided in Hubei, and 57 recipients had a Wuhan related history of travel or contact. The majority took precautionary measures while in contact with suspicious crowds. 96.6% of the families and communities undertook prevention and quarantine procedures. 4 upper airway infection were reported, and 3 of them tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 (the 4th recovered and was not tested). All cases were mild and s...","Governments around the world must rapidly mobilize and make difficult policy decisions to mitigate the COVID-19 pandemic. Because deaths have been concentrated at older ages, we highlight the important role of demography, particularly how the age structure of a population may help explain differences in fatality rates across countries and how transmission unfolds. We examine the role of age structure in deaths thus far in Italy and South Korea and illustrate how the pandemic could unfold in populations with similar population sizes but different age structures, showing a dramatically higher burden of mortality in countries with older versus younger populations. This powerful interaction of demography and current age-specific mortality for COVID-19 suggests that social distancing and other policies to slow transmission should consider both the age composition of local and national contexts as well as the social connectedness of older and younger generations. We also call for countries t...","About one month after the COVID-19 epidemic peaked in Mainland China and SARS-CoV-2 migrated from China westward to Europe and then the U.S., the epidemiological data begin to provide important insights into the risks associated with the disease and the effectiveness of intervention strategies. Like other respiratory diseases, including the 2003 SARS epidemic, the virus remains only about two months in any given population, yet the peak incidence and the lethality can vary. The data suggest that at least two strains of the 2020 SARS-CoV-2 virus have evolved during its migration from Mainland China to Europe. South Korea, Iran, and Italy were hit by the more dangerous \"SKII\" variant. While the epidemic in China is about to end, and in Europe about to level off, the course of the epidemic in the younger US population is still increasing and the peak level will likely depend on which of the strains has entered the US first. The same models that help us to understand the epidemic also help...","The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) is the etiological agent for the infectious disease, SARS, which first emerged 10 years ago. SARS-CoV is a zoonotic virus that has crossed the species barriers to infect humans. Bats, which harbour a diverse pool of SARS-like CoVs (SL-CoVs), are believed to be the natural reservoir. The SARS-CoV surface Spike (S) protein is a major antigenic determinant in eliciting neutralizing antibody production during SARS-CoV infection. In our previous work, we showed that a panel of murine monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that target the S2 subunit of the S protein are capable of neutralizing SARS-CoV infection in vitro (Lip KM et al, J Virol. 2006 Jan; 80(2): 941\u201350). In this study, we report our findings on the characterization of one of these mAbs, known as 1A9, which binds to the S protein at a novel epitope within the S2 subunit at amino acids 1111\u20131130. MAb 1A9 is a broadly neutralizing mAb that prevents viral entry mediated by the S ...","COVID-19 is now a pandemic and many of the affected countries face severe shortages of hospital resources. In Brazil, the first case was reported on February 26. As the number of cases grows in the country, there is a concern that the health system may become overwhelmed, resulting in shortages of hospital beds, intensive care unit beds, and mechanical ventilators. The timing of shortage is likely to vary geographically depending on the observed onset and pace of transmission observed, on the availability of resources, and on the actions implemented. Here we consider the daily number of cases reported in municipalities in Brazil to simulate twelve alternative scenarios of the likely timing of shortage, based on parameters consistently reported for China and Italy, on rates of hospital occupancy for other health conditions observed in Brazil in 2019, and on assumptions of allocation of patients in public and private facilities. Results show that hospital services could start to experien...","Summary Background Public health measures to prevent, detect, and respond to events are essential to control public health risks, including infectious disease outbreaks, as highlighted in the International Health Regulations (IHR). In light of the outbreak of 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), we aimed to review existing health security capacities against public health risks and events. Methods We used 18 indicators from the IHR State Party Annual Reporting (SPAR) tool and associated data from national SPAR reports to develop five indices: (1) prevent, (2) detect, (3) respond, (4) enabling function, and (5) operational readiness. We used SPAR 2018 data for all of the indicators and categorised countries into five levels across the indices, in which level 1 indicated the lowest level of national capacity and level 5 the highest. We also analysed data at the regional level (using the six geographical WHO regions). Findings Of 182 countries, 52 (28%) had prevent capacities at leve...","Summary Background In December, 2019, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a novel coronavirus, emerged in Wuhan, China. Since then, the city of Wuhan has taken unprecedented measures in response to the outbreak, including extended school and workplace closures. We aimed to estimate the effects of physical distancing measures on the progression of the COVID-19 epidemic, hoping to provide some insights for the rest of the world. Methods To examine how changes in population mixing have affected outbreak progression in Wuhan, we used synthetic location-specific contact patterns in Wuhan and adapted these in the presence of school closures, extended workplace closures, and a reduction in mixing in the general community. Using these matrices and the latest estimates of the epidemiological parameters of the Wuhan outbreak, we simulated the ongoing trajectory of an outbreak in Wuhan using an age-structured susceptible-exposed-infected-removed (SEIR) model for several ...","Europe is now considered as the epicenter of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, France being among the most impacted country. In France, there is an increasing concern regarding the capacity of the healthcare system to sustain the outbreak, especially regarding intensive care units (ICU). The aim of this study was to estimate the dynamics of the epidemic in France, and to assess its impact on healthcare resources for each French metropolitan Region. We developed a deterministic, age-structured, Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Removed (SEIR) model based on catchment areas of each COVID-19 referral hospitals. We performed one month ahead predictions (up to April 14, 2020) for three different scenarios (R0=1.5, R0=2.25, R0=3), where we estimated the daily number of COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations and deaths, the needs in ICU beds per Region and the reaching date of ICU capacity limits. At the national level, the total number of infected cases is expected to range from 22,872 in the best case (R0=1...."],"title":["Predictors for compliance of standard precautions among nursing students","Taking the right measures to control COVID-19","A qualitative study of zoonotic risk factors among rural communities in southern China","Surveillance to improve evidence for community control decisions during the COVID-19 pandemic \u2013 Opening the animal epidemic toolbox for public health","How will this continue?

The purpose of the HBM is to identify the factors which can improve the likelihood of compliance to SPs among NSs. However, the underlying reasons why NSs might be affected by those factors might not be well explained by the HBM. Theory-in-use 38 might shine some light on the explanation of such findings in the present study. To apply the theory in the context of SPs compliance, theory-in-use is the performance of the behaviors related to the SPs compliance, whereas espoused theory is to explain or justify the behaviors related to the SPs compliance. Argyris and Schon 38 explained that theory-in-use (ie, actual practice and self-reported practice) of an individual worker is shaped by espoused theory, that is, his/her formal (eg, policies, guidelines) and informal (eg, observation, organizational culture) learning in the workplace. In terms of SPs compliance among NSs, increasing SPs knowledge, providing more SPs training, promoting a safety climate (management support), reducing identified SPs barriers, and improving nursing staff compliance to SPs would enhance NSs' SPs compliance.","Five predictors for compliance of SPs have been identified: knowledge of SPs, perceived barriers, perceived adequacy of training, perceived management support, and perceived influence of nursing staff (F 6,605 \u00bc 15.085; P &lt; .001) ( Table 4 ). The adjusted R 2 value was 0.122. This indicates that 12.2% of the variance in compliance of SPs was explained by the model. This small 12.2% variance indicated that the model explained only part, but not all, of the compliance of SPs among NSs. The perceived barriers included difficulty in performing procedures properly when wearing personal proactive equipment (39.3%, n \u00bc 247), offending patients when wearing personal proactive equipment to provide care (28.7%, n \u00bc 181), too busy to follow SPs (23.9%, n \u00bc 151), and offending nursing staff-ward practice if NSs followed proper SPs (22.7%, n \u00bc 143).","Once compliance has been accurately measured, work can then be undertaken to improve it, the optimal approach to this remains elusive [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] . The importance of customizing messaging and interventions: \"One size does not fit all\" was highlighted in this special edition last year [29] and has been embraced by Salmon et al in the context of the effect of messaging on different healthcare professions [30] . The benefit of taking into account cultural differences was demonstrated by Brink et al who report on the success of introducing a multi-modal hand hygiene framework leveraging the Ubuntu philosophy of \"I am who I am because of who we all are\" [31] . Greenough et al. present a follow-up to a previously published letter on the use of verbal reminders to increase compliance with hand hygiene amongst hospital visitors [32, 33] . This recognition of the role that visitors and family members play in the spread of nosocomial infections, particularly if they also have a caring role, as is common in low and middle income countries (LMIC's), has been considered and the impact of an educational intervention assessed [34] . Along with education, reducing barriers to hand hygiene would be expected to increase compliance rates, borne out by a study demonstrating that a 15s duration of hand rubbing with ABHR was non-inferior to the currently recommended 30s and that compliance was higher with the shorter duration [35] .","The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.26.20044370 doi: medRxiv preprint 234 network of Brazil, which is also key for the whole Latin America, if not properly 235 monitored and controlled, may cause a window of opportunity for the virus to spread 236 over the entire continent. 237 The consequences of this uncontrolled SARS-Cov-2 spreading is particularly 238 serious if one takes into consideration the chances of a mutant virulent strain appearing 239 and spreading into poorer and little monitored places of the world. Specifically, for the 240 Amazon region, the lack of any control will make the city of Manaus a very sensitive 241 cluster for public health, due to predominantly poor and indigenous-dominated cities in 242 the region, which are connected to Manaus and will be rapidly infected. Reaching 243 isolated regions means reaching indigenous or traditional communities, whose 244 individuals are classically more susceptible to new pathogens than western-influenced 245 or mixed urban populations. Therefore, a way to prevent such spreading, if still there is 246 time, would be to deal with airports as entrances that need severe infection barriers. The eventual lesson to take is that inflexible, severe, and easy to repeat 250 controlling protocols must be applied to all the cities with airports. Likewise, the follow-251 up monitoring of suspicious individuals and their living network should be reinforced as 252 a national strategy to prevent a large territory to be taken over by a pandemic in a short 253 period of time. In other words, internationally accepted procedures must be taken and 254 even be reviewed to adjust to complex national flight networks of any country. Such 255 procedures must be considered as a priority for national remote airports too, in order to 256 keep poorer and worse equipped cities away from a rapid spread of a pandemic 257 disease. 258 It is clear at this point that a fast spread of the SARS-CoV-2 is a reality in Brazil, 259 and across most of the country. We proposed this model in order to emphasize the 260 fragility of Brazilian surveillance in the airport network, in an attempt to cause some 261 policy change in time to preserve at least the most remote regions, which are also the 262 most vulnerable, with a weaker health service. Moreover, most of the Eastern part of the 263 country must stay in social isolation in order to prevent a health public collapse by mid-264 April, as the Ministry of Health predicted. In addition, we also could consider the 265 generalized poverty of Brazil as a further problem our model did not deal with. The 266 chances to produce home-to-home isolation, even legally imposed, is impossible for 267 these poor communities. Nonetheless, considering the few main entrances of most of 268 the Brazilian shanty towns and communities, a similar to airport entrance severe control 269 must be considered to protect a larger but closely connected set of people, eventually 270 following the protocols used for control of Ebola during the last epidemic in Africa (Lau 271 et al. 2017 ). 272 All rights reserved.

The widespread practice of spraying disinfectant and alcohol in the sky, on roads, vehicles, and personnel has no value; moreover, large quantities of alcohol and disinfectant are potentially harmful to humans and should be avoided. 3, 4 Second, in the use of personal protective equipment, we should try to distinguish different risk factors, adopt different epidemic prevention measures, and reduce the waste of personal protective equipment, as these resources are already in short supply. Although surgical masks are in widespread use by the general population, there is no evidence that these masks prevent the acquisition of COVID-19, although they might slightly reduce the spread from an infected patient. Highfiltration masks such as N95 masks and protective clothing (goggles and gowns) should be used in hospitals where health-care workers are in direct contact with infected patients. 5 Third, the practice of blocking traffic and lockdown of villages is of no value for the prevention and control of COVID-19. Since the outbreak of COVID-19, some countries have suspended flights to and from China, and prevented Chinese people from travelling to their countries; both of these actions violate WHO International Health Regulations. 6 Similarly, in community prevention and control of the disease, the measures taken by individual villages and communities to seal off roads are of no value. 7 Such measures could result in civil unrest and reduce compliance with infection prevention and control advice.","Certainly, organizational issues impact individual attitudes considerably. For example, workload issues are thought to affect HCW willingness to comply with recommendations for PPE use. Workers who feel stressed and overloaded at work are much less likely to be attendant to safety needs and precautions. 23 Helfgott et al found that knowledge of how to prevent occupational exposure did not appear to correlate with compliance with UP. 41 The most common reasons why HCWs in this study did not comply were time constraints, interference with performing specific tasks, and lack of risk-based information to assist HCWs in identifying infectious patients. It was also noteworthy that this study also found that level of compliance was inversely proportional to level of experience of the HCW. Osborne determined that mean compliance rates among Australian operating room nurses were 55.6% with always double gloving during surgical procedures and 92% with always wearing adequate eye protection. 52 The variable that had the most influence on compliance was the perception of barriers to compliance, specifically, that adhering to UP interfered with duties. Nickell et al found in their study of 2001 HCWs during the SARS outbreak in Toronto that the most commonly cited difficulty with complying with precautionary measures, especially masks, was that wearing one for any extended period of time was very uncomfortable. 53 Dejoy et al, in their 2000 study, demonstrated the importance of easy access to the correct PPE when needed as an influence on compliance. 14 Presumably, the greater perceived availability of PPE may lead to stronger beliefs in their effectiveness for prevention among HCWs. It is interesting that the case-control study conducted by Lau et al during the SARS outbreak in Hong Kong also found that perceiving that adequate PPE was unavailable was associated with an increased risk of acquiring disease. 40 The perception that the use of PPE may lead to decreased quality in the therapeutic relationship between patients and HCWs has been shown to be a significant factor that influences HCW compliance. 5, 54, 55 Interference with the practitioner-patient relationship and decreased dexterity were the most frequently cited reasons for noncompliance in one study. 54 Nickell et al found that, during the Toronto SARS outbreak, HCWs found that wearing of masks made communication difficult and led to a sense of social isolation. 53 Others have found that the wearing of PPE places barriers between 2 people, negatively altering interpersonal dynamics and complicating the performance of tasks and treatment. 14 Respirators cover the face and mouth, hampering communication, especially for the elderly population and those with hearing loss. Use of respirators may lead to increased isolation and fear among patients. 56 Prieto and Clark also cited concerns among nurses that isolation of patients could lead to depression from lack of social contacts. 45 CONCLUSION SARS was a disease largely spread by respiratory droplets. The lack of spread within the community and the recent information on relatively low natural transmission rates for SARS coronavirus indicate that SARS is less contagious than influenza and other similar respiratory infections. 1 The consistent application of basic infection control precautions terminated outbreaks in Vietnam, 10 Taiwan, 57 Singapore, Hong Kong, 58 and, eventually, Toronto. 59 Large outbreaks occurred when the causative agent was not recognized, generally early in the course of the epidemic, and basic infection control procedures were not in place. As such, attention to understanding why there was a failure to implement appropriate precautions, and how best to promote compliance in future, is an important topic for study.","Measures to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic are a focus of communities in countries, but preparedness plans should consider refugees and migrants and their needs. Evidence shows that this vulnerable population has a low risk of transmitting communicable diseases to host populations in general. 4 However, refugees and migrants are potentially at increased risk of contracting diseases, including COVID-19, because they typically live in overcrowded conditions without access to basic sanitation. The ability to access health-care services in humanitarian settings is usually compromised and exacerbated by shortages of medicines and lack of health-care facilities. Moreover, refugees typically face administrative, financial, legal, and language barriers to access the health system. 4 Conditions in refugee camps are concerning. Many people who have been affected by humanitarian crises live in camps or camp-like settings in host countries. These camps usually provide inadequate and overcrowded living arrangements that present a severe health risk to inhabitants and host populations. The absence of basic amenities, such as clean running water and soap, insufficient medical personnel presence, and poor access to adequate health information are major problems in these settings.","Bivariate statistical analysis found 9 factors were associated with compliance of SPs among NSs (Table 2 ). Those 9 factors were perceived susceptibility, perceived seriousness, knowledge of SPs, perceived barriers, perceived benefits, perceived adequacy of training, perceived management support, perceived influence of nursing staff, and year of study. Further analysis using a univariate general linear model identified an interaction effect of perceived influence of nursing staff and year of study (F 1,593 \u00bc 3.27; P &lt; .05) ( Table 3) . Results showed that second (t 271 \u00bc 3.49, P \u00bc .001) and third year (t 90 \u00bc 4.59, P &lt; .001) students were significantly affected by the nursing staff's compliance of SPs. However, there were no significant differences between perceived influence of nursing staff on compliance of SPs for first (t 94 \u00bc 0.53, P \u00bc .60) and fourth year (t 157 \u00bc 1.04, P \u00bc .30) NSs (Fig 2) .","The result of the study indicates that NSs from various years of study have high compliance on SPs. Interaction effects were found: year 2 and year 3 NSs were significantly affected by the nursing staff's infection control practice in the units. Furthermore, knowledge, training, management support, barriers, and nursing staff influence were the predictors for compliance of SPs. Assertiveness training coupled with communication skills training should be implemented to empower NSs to handle the challenges in the hierarchical clinical placement environment. Future studies using an observational design on SPs compliance among NSs and studies to explore the influence of nursing staff to NSs and junior nursing staff are recommended.","There is uncertainty regarding transmissibility and severity \u2013 more information is emerging about the spectrum of disease, especially mild disease, which is not identified using many current case definitions, and about the ease of transmission from person to person. Health agencies are unsure how to model this and estimates vary depending on the variables being used. For instance, SARS was essentially spread later in the disease from patients with more significant clinical pictures, and it was contained by infection control measures particularly in hospitals. The limited spread to family members of health workers and the community was contained by usual outbreak control measures including early identification and management of persons with infection, tracing of contacts with monitoring for onset of fever and/or symptoms, and active engagement of communities.","Compared with other international migrants (ie, international students), IMWs encounter more barriers in accessing health services in host countries (eg, inadequate health insurance), particularly migrant domestic workers. 2 Under normal conditions, IMWs have a high burden of common mental disorders (eg, depression) and a lower quality of life than local populations. 2, 3 This situation could worsen during the COVID-19 epidemic due to the potential and fear of governmental-imposed quarantine and lost income. For instance, some migrant domestic workers in Hong Kong and Macau have lost their jobs because their employers have left the territory. Many domestic workers cannot obtain masks from the pharmacy because they must stay with employers and adhere to government-recommended selfquarantine. 4 In the absence of reliable information in their own language, IMWs may also not recognise the seriousness of the epidemic or receive accurate information on how to protect themselves from infection. 5 However, most IMWs have smartphones, 3 which can be a useful aid in providing informational and social support during the epidemic, like during the previous MERS epidemic. 5 For instance, WeChat (a Chinese social network platform) is used by IMWs in Hong Kong and Macau for sharing key health messages and official information to the community and providing one another with emotional support. It can, however, also spread inaccurate information and panic that could lead to IMWs delaying visits to health centres due to stigmatisation of those who are infected. 5 Regardless of IMWs communities' self-reliance and resilience, addressing their health needs should be made an urgent public health priority because infection among these individuals could also lead to community infection, eventually affecting the entire population's health. For instance, during the epidemic, IMWs should be provided more accessible health care. Public health campaigns should be available in multiple languages and diffused through various communication channels and networks of IMWs as soon as possible. In addition, more countries should ratify the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families to provide global health equity and ensure that migrant workers' health is not neglected in future epidemics and disasters.","Ongoing modelling and surveillance should continue at the epicentre of the pandemic in mainland China to assess the effect of public health measures. However, attention must also move to the emerging foci outside of China, including Italy, Iran, and South Korea, to determine if the reproduction ratio might vary in different climates and sociological contexts. New foci of infection across different continents change the risk to global communities, as this coronavirus becomes a pandemic.","Many of the interventions that are necessary to reduce the transmission of a dangerous infectious agent spread by close contact involve restricting the activities of the population in order to reduce contact rates. Further interventions seek to change behaviour to reduce the probability of infection per contact by, for example, emphasising the importance of frequent hand-washing and by isolating potentially infectious cases. Compliance with these interventions will vary between individuals depending on a wide variety of factors, and because of the restrictive nature of the interventions it is likely that compliance will decay over time, especially if the public perception is that the risk is low or the epidemic is declining. This decline in compliance has been found in a number of studies of public behaviour, notably during recent influenza epidemics in Hong Kong (Liao et al. 2019) , Malaysia (Wong &amp; Sam 2010) and the Netherlands (de Zwart et al. 2010) .

Use of effective chemoprophylaxis requires that the infectious agent be susceptible to the antimicrobial drug used. As a primary prevention strategy, it may be used before or after exposure to prevent infection. Examples of chemoprophylaxis in the postexposure setting include erythromycin after exposure to pertussis; rifampin after N. meningitidis; amantadine, rimantadine, zanamir, or oseltamivir after influenza A virus; and zidovudine after HIV exposure. Use of antiretroviral drugs by HIV-infected pregnant women has been shown to substantially reduce the risk of perinatal HIV infection. 128 Prophylaxis against surgical wound infections with broad-spectrum coverage before surgery and prophylaxis of neonates against ophthalmia neonatorum are examples of chemoprophylaxis used in the hospital setting. In such situations, chemoprophylaxis is origin, socioeconomic status, and geographic location. For example, persons born outside the United States are at increased risk for infectious diseases such as tuberculosis and for being chronic carriers of infections such as hepatitis B. Screening programs targeted to these populations, with subsequent interventions such as isoniazid prophylaxis for persons with M. tuberculosis infection or immunization of susceptible household contacts of HBV carriers, can serve as important community-based strategies to prevent infectious disease occurrence. [115] [116] [117] Another example of defining risk at the community level is assessing behavior that increases the risk for specific diseases, such as injection drug use as a risk behavior for acquiring HIV or HCV infection. Education and drug treatment programs targeted to this population can serve as an important disease prevention and control strategy. Finally, assessing the population of species-specific mosquitoes and viability of local breeding sites can provide a risk assessment of the likelihood of vector-borne disease transmission (e.g., West Nile virus infection). 118, 119 In developing control programs, the feasibility of a strategy also needs to be assessed. Feasibility is dependent on the sociodemographic factors of the population involved. For example, high immunization rates can clearly prevent the occurrence of infectious diseases. In the United States, immunizations should be readily available; however, in the late 1980s, numerous large outbreaks of measles occurred in U.S. inner-city populations because of low immunization rates. 120 A variety of sociodemographic factors contributed to these low rates, such as inadequate access to medical care and other barriers to immunization. Until such barriers are removed and control strategies are developed to specifically target at-risk populations, adequate control of vaccinepreventable diseases in the United States cannot be accomplished. 121 Cost and availability of resources also need to be considered when developing control strategies. Adequate water treatment facilities and distribution systems in developing countries would do much to eliminate the spread of cholera. However, in many countries, resources to build and develop such facilities are not available. Consequently, control strategies need to be focused on simpler, less expensive methods, such as boiling water or improving water storage in the home.","Another study showed that an educational intervention consisting of lecture and practice sessions for operating room staff increased compliance with use of protective eyewear from 54% to 66% and double gloving from 28% to 55%. 37 It was unclear, however, how much of this effect was due to awareness by staff that they were being observed. Another study on UP found that, even when HCWs have adequate information and knowledge, they still need to enhance their skills by practicing how to use PPE. 14 The DeJoy study, which showed that safety climate was a strong predictor of perceived job hindrance, also offers some insight into what kind of training programs are needed. 29 If perceived job hindrance is an important predictor of compliance with UP, then training programs may need to focus less on knowledge-based training and more on helping workers overcome or reduce the barriers associated with compliance. There are no studies examining the effectiveness of measures that emerge from these suggestions.","\u2610Types of facilitators and barriers that were considered \u2610Methods by which information regarding the facilitators and barriers to implementing recommendations were sought (e.g., feedback from key stakeholders, pilot testing of guidelines before widespread implementation) \u2610Information/description of the types of facilitators and barriers that emerged from the inquiry (e.g., practitioners have the skills to deliver the recommended care, sufficient equipment is not available to ensure all eligible members of the population receive mammography)","\u2610Types of facilitators and barriers that were considered \u2610Methods by which information regarding the facilitators and barriers to implementing recommendations were sought (e.g., feedback from key stakeholders, pilot testing of guidelines before widespread implementation) \u2610Information/description of the types of facilitators and barriers that emerged from the inquiry (e.g., practitioners have the skills to deliver the recommended care, sufficient equipment is not available to ensure all eligible members of the population receive mammography)","\u2610Types of facilitators and barriers that were considered \u2610Methods by which information regarding the facilitators and barriers to implementing recommendations were sought (e.g., feedback from key stakeholders, pilot testing of guidelines before widespread implementation) \u2610Information/description of the types of facilitators and barriers that emerged from the inquiry (e.g., practitioners have the skills to deliver the recommended care, sufficient equipment is not available to ensure all eligible members of the population receive mammography)","\u2610Types of facilitators and barriers that were considered \u2610Methods by which information regarding the facilitators and barriers to implementing recommendations were sought (e.g., feedback from key stakeholders, pilot testing of guidelines before widespread implementation) \u2610Information/description of the types of facilitators and barriers that emerged from the inquiry (e.g., practitioners have the skills to deliver the recommended care, sufficient equipment is not available to ensure all eligible members of the population receive mammography)","\u2610Types of facilitators and barriers that were considered \u2610Methods by which information regarding the facilitators and barriers to implementing recommendations were sought (e.g., feedback from key stakeholders, pilot testing of guidelines before widespread implementation) \u2610Information/description of the types of facilitators and barriers that emerged from the inquiry (e.g., practitioners have the skills to deliver the recommended care, sufficient equipment is not available to ensure all eligible members of the population receive mammography)","\u2610Types of facilitators and barriers that were considered \u2610Methods by which information regarding the facilitators and barriers to implementing recommendations were sought (e.g., feedback from key stakeholders, pilot testing of guidelines before widespread implementation) \u2610Information/description of the types of facilitators and barriers that emerged from the inquiry (e.g., practitioners have the skills to deliver the recommended care, sufficient equipment is not available to ensure all eligible members of the population receive mammography)","Although the principles of the surveying protocol are derived from the animal health realm, where they have had extensive use [e.g. 4-5-6-7-8-9-10], a similar approach in surveillance of the human population could be applicable [11] , and requires public health leadership. At a first glance, t he application of the proposed principles and protocol ( Fig. 1 to 3) , could appear as unfeasible; because it could require overpassing some social, logistic and economical barriers; as never seen before. Nevertheless, we must also consider that this is a particular situation, which is challenging the health and economy as rarely seen in history. If the virus has been able to adapt across species, the human society should be able adapting quickly too, by working across countries, sectors and communities. The protocol is not a strict guideline with which everybody must comply. Rather, is a proposal for potential solutions and it is only a \"starting\" point open to improvements and adaptations across different capacities and realities. In Table 1 , are resumed some considerations on: strengths, limitations, and possible solutions for the protocol applications. Permission to sample at random in the human needs to be considered quickly. However, it is very likely that the vast majority of randomly selected people will agree to participate, because of the urgency and a good understanding among the public. Some considerations on survey\u00b4s setting and comparing their outputs for human populations can be found in [13] [14] \uf0b7 Applying the protocol on a National scale in a population of several million people could be unfeasible if the costs are perceived as too high and participation/capacity is low. Nevertheless if the protocol can be used only in part of the affected countries, then the estimated TP could be generalized to other areas/cities/regions that seem to be in a similar: environmental, demographic, logistical and epidemiological situation.","\u2610Types of facilitators and barriers that were considered \u2610Methods by which information regarding the facilitators and barriers to implementing recommendations were sought (e.g., feedback from key stakeholders, pilot testing of guidelines before widespread implementation) NR \u2610Information/description of the types of facilitators and barriers that emerged from the inquiry (e.g., practitioners have the skills to deliver the recommended care, sufficient equipment is not available to ensure all eligible members of the population receive mammography) \u2610Types of cost information that were considered (e.g., economic evaluations, drug acquisition costs)","Another surprising outcome of the present model is that, within limits, any decline of the population's compliance through time has a comparatively weak effect on cumulative mortality: a three-fold increase in the rate of compliance decline led to less than a doubling of the median number of fatalities in the model. The reason for this is that in our model governments can counteract declining compliance by introducing new regulatory measures once the number of infections raises again. In practice this might simply involve reinforcing messages about the importance of compliance and/or increasing enforcement of the existing measures: during previous influenza pandemics declines in compliance have coincided with reductions in reported cases and deaths and associated media coverage (Lau et al. 2003; Wong &amp; Sam 2010) . This result is reassuring, given the scarcity of systematic knowledge about how compliance with NPI changes through the course of an epidemic.","The pharmacy-related needs of community patients have similarities with the traditional patient 79 population, but with different emphasis. For example, when providing consulting services to 80 community patients, instead of focusing on medications as usual, their questions are mainly on 81 the scientific prevention knowledge and basic information about COVID-19, such as mask 82 selection and typical signs and symptoms of COVID-19. For chronic disease patients, especially 83 those in communities under quarantine, drug supply and patients' compliance are facing a greater 84 challenge, though the safety and effectiveness of treatment is also important for this patient 85 population. Thus, community pharmacists shall learn to switch gears when needed from 86 providing professional knowledge on medication use only to fulfilling community patients' 87 various needs. 88","\u2610Types of facilitators and barriers that were considered \u2610Methods by which information regarding the facilitators and barriers to implementing recommendations were sought (e.g., feedback from key stakeholders, pilot testing of guidelines before widespread implementation) \u2610Information/description of the types of facilitators and barriers that emerged from the inquiry (e.g., practitioners have the skills to deliver the recommended care, sufficient equipment is not available to ensure all eligible members of the population receive mammography) \u2610How the information influenced the guideline development process and/or formation of the recommendations 19.

We thus tested the ability of the iSAVE to compensate for static changes in compliance and resistance of one lung while minimizing effects on the other patient. For all tests, we 1) measured the baseline ventilation values (graphed in gray), 2) performed an intervention (changing compliance or resistance, graphed in red), 3) noted any safety features or alarms that were activated and 4) titrated valves to return to the baseline values (within 5% error) (graphed in purple).","Despite the possible promise of this NPI for both COVID-19 and influenza, it is unclear if symptom-based isolation would be truly effective in controlling outbreaks because the CDC-recommended one day policy might not be enough to achieve a meaningful reduction in transmission, and a high rate of asymptomatic infections and partial compliance might weaken the ability to implement the policy. When the attack rate is high, transmission might occur regardless of isolation and the policy might merely create a burden on the isolated individuals and their families, without a tangible public health benefit. If the policy is proven effective, it is not known whether the CDC-recommended one day of symptom-based isolation is sufficient, and if not, how many days would be most beneficial. At the outset of our project, we hypothesized that these policies would have a small beneficial effect on reducing attack rate, delay the peak of the outbreak and reduce the height of its peak. We did not expect these policies to reduce the overall incidence because there would be many other opportunities to become infected. Furthermore, practical barriers may reduce the strictness with which the policies are enforced, which would reduce the policies' effectiveness.","(which was not peer-reviewed) The copyright holder for this preprint . https: //doi.org/10.1101 //doi.org/10. /2020 behavioural changes to the progress of epidemics (Ferguson 2007; Bauch &amp; Galvani 2013; Yan, Tang &amp; Xiao 2018) , behavioural changes over time are rarely incorporated into epidemic models (Funk et al. 2015) . The factors determining how an individual's behaviour changes with respect to an epidemic threat will include the degree of perceived risk and the perceived benefits from a particular behavioural change (Yan et al. 2018) , cultural and religious beliefs, expectations and norms and the interaction between an individual and both traditional news media and social media influences. These will all vary between nations and so the degree of initial compliance and the rate of decline of compliance over time will vary and thus it is important to explore the potential impacts of this heterogeneity on the development of the epidemic.","Perceived barriers in the HBM are things that the individual feels may prevent them from making the desired behavior change. In general, as perceived barriers increase, the individual's likelihood to engage with the behavior decreases. Therefore, exploring ways to mitigate or remove perceived barriers will help individuals engage with the behavior in question.","Individual factors in self-protective behavior at work Knowledge acquired through training and personal experience. Knowledge of the appropriate use of PPE is necessary but not sufficient for HCWs to adopt safe work practices. 41 The study by Gershon et al from 1995 27 found that most HCWs surveyed had high levels of knowledge regarding UP practices but that this knowledge did not lead to high levels of compliance. Repeated exposures without consequences may also decrease compliance. In a study examining this issue, HCWs who had repeated exposures to blood and body fluids and did not acquire infection perceived a decreased risk of acquiring infection than those who had not been exposed. This experience may lead to a false sense of invulnerability and therefore increased risk taking. 14 Another study found that HCWs who were younger than 40 years of age were more likely to comply with UP. 28 The authors suggested that this may reflect more recent training, rather than a direct effect of age. HCWs surveyed were found to have realistic risk perceptions about exposure to BBF: Few were fearful of contagion. The level of experience did not necessarily lead to a lack of understanding of risks involved. Nurses who were educated in a more disease-driven infection control model, in which precautions were used only when the patient was known to be infected by a given pathogen, appear to be less comfortable with the UP model, as compared with recent graduates. 42 Students and other HCWs may look to attending physicians as role models. However, younger physicians, house staff, and medical students have been found to be more complaint with UP than senior physicians. 37 The increased compliance again probably reflects more recent training. Another study found that compliance with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) precautions (which included use of gloves and gowns and handwashing) was related to the occupational group, with physicians showing the lowest compliance (22%) and physiotherapists and occupational therapists having the highest compliance (89%). 43 Compliance with gown and glove requirements was 65% and for hand hygiene, 35%. Angtuaco et al 44 found that fewer gastroenterologists than GI endoscopy nurses used face shields for all procedures (14% vs 21%). Gershon et al has observed that physicians are ''out of the loop'' with regard to safety climate within hospitals and that special efforts need to be made to involve them in training, safety programs, and safety committees. 28 Nurses have reported confusion at the ward level and uncertainty concerning the rationale for the uses of PPE recommended in infection control guidelines and perceive existing guidelines to lack specificity to their practice. 45 They also may doubt the effectiveness of isolation precautions to prevent disease transmission and report frustration with the lack of adherence by allied professionals. 45 Jeffe et al cited the need to teach medical students the importance of the use of PPE before they become set in their ways. 46 Teaching medical students early in their clinical training about the risk of exposure to BBF and specific prevention measures may be associated with more positive attitudes and better compliance with precautions. Attitudes and beliefs. Demographic factors such as gender, education levels, shift work, or occupation have not consistently found to be associated with compliance with infection control procedures. 27 Compliance is affected by attitudes and perception of risk; however, having a positive attitude toward the patients, lower risk-taking tendencies, and greater knowledge of modes of transmission have been shown to lead to greater compliance. 14 Use of PPE only when there is visible blood may demonstrate that HCWs make personal judgements concerning their own potential risk instead of following a consistent policy. 47 HCWs do not appear to dismiss or underestimate their personal risk of acquiring an occupational infectious disease [48] [49] [50] ; in fact, HCWs are more likely to overestimate their risk. However, several studies suggest that adherence may often be poorest when the risk of exposure is highest. 22 Perceived barriers may be one of the most important factors affecting compliance. Godin et al found that HCW perceptions of their ability to adopt the use of PPE into their practice affected their level of compliance. 51 If they believe that the barriers to their adherence to recommended use of PPE cannot be circumvented, they will not comply. Actual working conditions resulting in overwork, lack of time with patients, and having to deal with emergencies were reported to have significant negative affects on compliance. HCWs are influenced by the subjective norm, ie, the perception of social expectation to adopt a given behavior. 51 This suggests that, if HCW believe that key persons in their work and social environment expect them to be compliant with the use of PPE, they are more likely to do so.","Another important research development is the adoption of methods that depend on community or multistakeholder participation in order to better address issues that span environmental health and sustainability concerns (Merrifield, 1993; O\u2019Fallon and Dearry, 2002; Witten et al., 2000; Parkes and Panelli, 2001; Bunch, 2003; Waltner-Toews, 2003; Brown et al., 2005). Infectious disease researchers are beginning to follow this lead, informed not only by the positive impact of participatory research on communities, but also by the increased attention to the rights of underrepresented and indigenous communities around the world that is changing the political landscape of donor participation in development, the environment (Chapin, 2004), and health (GFHR, 2004). Innovative research projects that bridge disciplines and engage with place-based knowledge sets of communities vulnerable to EID infection, as well as with nonacademic stakeholders who work with such communities, have great potential not only to increase our capacity to prevent and control emerging infections, but also to meet maturing demands of 21st century funders and donors.","With the commencement of large-scale human activities of trans-regional conquest, infectious diseases have become another major threat to individuals and groups besides the war and conflicts. Infectious disease refers to that, after being infected by the pathogenic microorganisms, the human bodies produce infectious factors that can cause epidemic diseases under certain conditions. Viruses, bacteria, fungi, and mycoplasma can cause infectious diseases, but the spread of infectious diseases need to meet three conditions: there must be a source of infection, a path of transmission, and susceptible populations. Source of infection refers to human or animals, which already have the growth and reproduction of the pathogen in their body and have been able to excrete the pathogen in certain ways. This includes a patient and a human or animal that carries the pathogen. The way that pathogens leave the source of infection and then reach another susceptible object is known as the route of transmission, including the transmission through respiratory tract (droplets), digestive tract, insect-borne, blood and other body fluids. People who suffer from a specific immune deficiency toward a certain disease are known as susceptible populations. The spread of infectious disease must meet the three prerequisites mentioned above at the same time.1 In addition to the three basic conditions, there are other factors that will affect the spread of infectious diseases, including natural factors and social factors. Natural factors mainly refer to the temperature, humidity, ecological conditions, animals and plants. Different pathogens have different growth and reproduction in different environment. Their capabilities to adapt to temperature and humidity, and their pH tolerance also vary. Social factors include population density, life habits, economic status and communication degree. First discovered in Guangdong, China, in 2002, the \u201cSevere Acute Respiratory Syndrome\u201d virus (SARS-CoV) is currently considered to spread across species lines from civet cats to human bodies. Nevertheless, we cannot deny that there is a link between the spread of the disease and the local eating habits. Historically, it will take months for worldwide pandemic disease to spread to different countries. However, nowadays, with the advanced aviation industry, the virus can spread from Asia to the Americas overnight, and soon causes worldwide epidemic diseases.","SARS-CoV-2 in the UK population, we explore the potential effects of two important aspects of pandemic management: the frequency at which of management interventions are reviewed, and the potential decline in population compliance with NPI. Responses to COVID-19 have varied widely between nations in both the speed and the stringency of the interventions used (Hale &amp; Webster 2020) . South Korea, for example, intervened very quickly once the first cases were reported whereas the response has been considerably slower in countries such as the UK and the USA (Fig. 1) . It is likely that the continuing response to the pandemic will also vary between nations, with different governments choosing to relax the stringency of their interventions at different stages of epidemic decline. The importance of early intervention at the start of a pandemic to reduce mortality is well known, but there has been little assessment to date of the effects of removing management interventions at different points once the epidemic in a particular nation or area has started to decline. Figure 1 . Government intervention stringency (blue) and the log 10 numbers of reported cases (red) and deaths (black) per million people plotted against the days since the first reported case for four nations. Data from the Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker (Hale &amp; Webster 2020) , downloaded 30th March 2020.","Recommendations on face masks vary across countries and we have seen that the use of masks increases substantially once local epidemics begin, including the use of N95 respirators (without any other protective equipment) in community settings. This increase in use of face masks by the general public exacerbates the global supply shortage of face masks, with prices soaring, 9 and risks supply constraints to frontline healthcare professionals. As a response, a few countries (eg, Germany and South Korea) banned exportation of face masks to prioritise local demand. 10 WHO called for a 40% increase in the production of protective equipment, including face masks. 9 Meanwhile, health authorities should optimise face mask distribution to prioritise the needs of frontline health-care workers and the most vulnerable populations in communities who are more susceptible to infection and mortality if infected, including older adults (particularly those older than 65 years) and people with underlying health conditions. People in some regions (eg, Thailand, China, and Japan) opted for makeshift alternatives or repeated usage of disposable surgical masks. Notably, improper use of face masks, such as not changing disposable masks, could jeopardise the protective effect and even increase the risk of infection.","[7] Our results may not be representative of the prevalence rates of facemask in these geographic locations. Given that the population seen in airports are transient, facemask use rate observed in international airports may vary by the geographic area of origin of persons seen at ariports. Other factors are variation in exposure to facemask relevant advisories, the availability of facemasks in their respective home communities, and in perceived threat of COVID-19 transmission at the time of travel. Photoepidemiologic method of assessing facemask is inadequate toverify the type of facemask used such as loosely fit surgical masks or fit-tested N95 masks. Also, this method is unable to distinguish airport staff from non-staff, and travelers from non-travelers, whose habits with respect to facemask use may vary. Finally, this method is unable to ascertain the continuity of mask use while at airport or during travel.","\u2022 Does the plan provide guidance towards compliance with protection of personal information legislation and regulations? \u2022 Will the families and communities (and media) be able to rely on regular, reliable and transparent communication from competent source that represents all response agencies and groups?

The type subspecies, Pan troglodytes troglodytes, is found in West Africa in southern Cameroon, Gabon, and Congo ( Fig.  8.12) . Pan t. schweinfurthii is further east, primarily in the Democratic Republic of Congo but penetrating northward into the Central African Republic and eastward into a swath from southern Sudan down to Tanzania. Pan t. vellerosus is north of the range of troglodytes, in northern and western Cameroon. Finally, Pan t. verus is west of the range of vellerosus, in a broad zone from Senegal to Ghana. Subspeciation has resulted in part because chimps do not swim and large rivers fragment the various populations. Of these four subspecies only two, troglodytes and schweinfurthii, are naturally infected by SIV. Rates of infection vary in different populations but average about 20%, with some populations exhibiting almost 50% infected individuals. Thus, SIVcpz is a naturally occurring, widespread virus for which two subspecies of chimps are the reservoir. The virus does not appear to cause disease in chimps, similar to the case for other SIVs that infect African monkeys.","Lockdown: We collect local governments' lockdown information city by city from news media and government announcements.

Infection Control Center, Chi mei Medical Center, Liouying, Tainan, Taiwan Background: Respiratory-related pneumonia not only increases patient mortality, prolonged hospital days and medical expenses, more seriously affect the patient's prognosis. Intervention of respirator-associated pneumonia combined with compliance with the rate of compliance audits, can effectively reduce the respiratory rate of pneumonia associated. Methods: There are five adult intensive care units in a district hospital in the south, and a combination of respirator-associated pneumonia is based on the 2015-2016 Intrusive Care Disposal Quality Improvement Program. July-December 2015 for the first phase after implementation, January-June 2016 for the second phase after implementation, July to December 2016 for the third stage after implementation. Results: Statistics of the first phase of compliance: daily extubation assessment 100%, 100% stabilization agent, oral care 98%, 87% bedside, 100% of the emptying. Due to bedside elevation compliance is low, by the respiratory therapist and unit care chief to enhance the reminder and feedback. The second stage of the audit effectiveness of bedside elevation compliance rate of 86%, the third stage audit results bedside compliance compliance rate of 92%. Oral care from the first stage compliance rate of 98% to upgrade to the third stage of 99% compliance. Respiratory associated pneumonia infection rate decreased from 2.64\u2030 before intervention to the third stage 2.12\u2030. Conclusion: The establishment of regular feedback and audit mechanism is very important, and then through teamwork, can effectively improve the compliance rate, thereby reducing the respiration rate of respiratory-related pneumonia. So the third phase of the hospital compliance rate of up to 91.4%, can reduce the respiration of 24.5% of pneumonia."],"title":["Predictors for compliance of standard precautions among nursing students","Predictors for compliance of standard precautions among nursing students","Washing our hands of the problem","Severe airport sanitarian control could slow down the spreading of COVID-19 pandemics in Brazil","Taking the right measures to control COVID-19","Protecting health care workers from SARS and other respiratory pathogens: Organizational and individual factors that affect adherence to infection control guidelines","Refugee and migrant health in the COVID-19 response","Predictors for compliance of standard precautions among nursing students","Predictors for compliance of standard precautions among nursing students","Q&amp;A: The novel coronavirus outbreak causing COVID-19","The neglected health of international migrant workers in the COVID-19 epidemic","The value of early transmission dynamic studies in emerging infectious diseases","How will this continue?
