These dynamics will depend on seasonality, the duration of immunity, and the strength of cross-immunity to/from the other human coronaviruses. Using data from the United States, we measured how these factors affect transmission of human betacoronaviruses HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1. We then built a mathematical model to simulate transmission of SARS-CoV-2 through the year 2025. We project that recurrent wintertime outbreaks of SARS-CoV-2 will probably occur after an initial pandemic wave. We summarize the full range of plausible transmission scenarios and identify key data still needed to distinguish between them, most importantly longitudinal serological studies to determine the duration of immunity to SARS-CoV-2.","Summary The novel severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus caused severe disease and heavy economic losses before apparently coming under complete control. Our understanding of the forces driving seasonal disappearance and recurrence of infectious diseases remains fragmentary, thus limiting any predictions about whether, or when, SARS will recur. It is true that most established respiratory pathogens of human beings recur in wintertime, but a new appreciation for the high burden of disease in tropical areas reinforces questions about explanations resting solely on cold air or low humidity. Seasonal variation in host physiology may also contribute. Newly emergent zoonotic diseases such as ebola or pandemic strains of influenza have recurred in unpredictable patterns. Most established coronaviruses exhibit winter seasonality, with a unique ability to establish persistent infections in a minority of infected animals. Because SARS coronavirus RNA can be detected in the stool of...","Nearly every country is now combating the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19). It has been hypothesized that if COVID-19 exhibits seasonality, changing temperatures in the coming months will shift transmission patterns around the world. Such projections, however, require an estimate of the relationship between COVID-19 and temperature at a global scale, and one that isolates the role of temperature from confounding factors, such as public health capacity. This paper provides the first plausibly causal estimates of the relationship between COVID-19 transmission and local temperature using a global sample comprising of 166,686 confirmed new COVID-19 cases from 134 countries from January 22, 2020 to March 15, 2020. We find robust statistical evidence that a 1\u00b0C increase in local temperature reduces transmission by 13% [-21%, -4%, 95%CI]. In contrast, we do not find that specific humidity or precipitation influence transmission. Our statistical approach separates effects of climate variation...","BACKGROUND: Bronchiolitis is considered as the most frequent lower respiratory tract infection in infants and young children. This disorder is marked by acute inflammation, edema, damage of epithelial cells lining small airways, and augmentation of mucus production. OBJECTIVE: The goal of the study was to identify agents triggering bronchiolitis in the State of Qatar. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional retrospective study was performed at Hamad Medical Corporation, the only tertiary and academic medical center in the State of Qatar. The study included infants and young children aged 0\u201324 months who were admitted to our pediatric ward with diagnosis of acute bronchiolitis (2010\u20132012) RESULTS: Eight hundred thirty-five infants and young children met the study inclusion criteria with mean age at diagnosis of 3.61\u00b13.56 months. Respiratory virus real-time polymerase chain reaction was performed on 769 (92.0%) of the participants. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) was positive in 352 (...","BACKGROUND: Surveillance of influenza-like illness (ILI) in Central Africa began only recently, and few data are therefore available on the circulation of influenza virus and other respiratory viruses. In Gabon, a Central African country, we established a surveillance network in four major towns in order to analyze cases of ILI among patients who visited health centers between March 2010 and June 2011, and to determine the viral etiology. METHODS: Nasal swabs were sent for analysis to the Centre International de Recherches M\u00e9dicales de Franceville, where they were screened for 17 respiratory viruses in a multiplex real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction for all pathogens according the following pairs: adenovirus/parainfluenza virus 4, respiratory syncytial virus/human metapneumovirus, parainfluenza virus 1/parainfluenza virus 2, pandemic influenza virus A/seasonal influenza virus A (H1N1, H3N2)/seasonal influenza virus B, human coronaviruses 229E/OC43, human coronavir...","Abstract Human parainfluenza virus type 3 (HPIV-3) is one of the most common respiratory viruses particularly among young children and immunocompromised patients. The seasonality, prevalence and genetic diversity of HPIV-3 at a Spanish tertiary-hospital from 2013 to 2015 are reported. HPIV-3 infection was laboratory-confirmed in 102 patients (76%, under 5 years of age). Among &lt;5 years-old patients, 9 (11.5%) were under any degree of immunosuppression, whereas this percentage was significantly higher (19; 79.2%) among patients older than 5 years. HPIV-3 was detected at varying levels, but mainly during spring and summer. All characterized HN/F sequences fell within C1b, C5 and in other two closely C3a-related groups. Furthermore, a new genetic lineage (C1c) was described. Genetic similarity and epidemiological data confirmed some nosocomial infections, highlighting the importance of the HPIV-3 surveillance, particularly in high-risk patients. This study provides valuable information on ...","Viral infection accounts for a substantial proportion of cases of acute pneumonia especially among young children and the elderly, the immunocompromised, and those with comorbidities. Influenza A and respiratory syncytial virus are by far the most common causes of viral pneumonia followed by adenovirus, parainfluenza virus types 1, 2 and 3, and influenza B. Other less common agents include picornaviruses, varicella-zoster virus, herpes simplex virus, cytomegalovirus, and hantavirus. The newly identified human metapneumovirus also plays a role. Zoonotic infections caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus and avian influenza A/H5N1 are examples of acute \u2018atypical\u2019 pneumonia with epidemic and pandemic potentials. In general, there are no reliable clinical or radiological features to distinguish viral from other causes of pneumonia. Respiratory viruses often show seasonality and a predilection for certain host groups. These epidemiological features are helpful in ...","Resumen Introducci\u00f3n A partir de m\u00faltiples estudios ejecutados alrededor del planeta, se ha concluido la existencia de un efecto estacional en los nacimientos de los pacientes que luego desarrollan esquizofrenia.

Understanding the state of the disease and planning for future trajectories relies heavily on data on the spread and mortality. Yet official data coming from various countries are highly unreliable: symptoms similar to common cold in majority of cases and limited screening resources and delayed testing procedures may contribute to under-estimation of the burden of disease. Anecdotal and more limited data are available, but few have systematically combined those with official statistics into a coherent view of the epidemic. This study is a modeling-in-real-time of the emerging outbreak for understanding the state of the disease. Our focus is on the case of the spread of disease in Iran, as one of the epicenters of the disease in the first months of 2020. Method: We develop a simple dynamic model of the epidemic to provide a more reliable picture of the st...","Background: An outbreak of the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has led to 46,997 confirmed cases as of 13th February 2020. Understanding the early transmission dynamics of the infection and evaluating the effectiveness of control measures is crucial for assessing the potential for sustained transmission to occur in new areas. Methods: We combined a stochastic transmission model with data on cases of novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in Wuhan and international cases that originated in Wuhan to estimate how transmission had varied over time during January and February 2020. Based on these estimates, we then calculated the probability that newly introduced cases might generate outbreaks in other areas. Findings: We estimated that the median daily reproduction number, Rt , declined from 2.35 (95% CI: 1.15-4.77) one week before travel restrictions were introduced on 23rd January to 1.05 (95% CI: 0.413-2.39) one week after. Based on our estimates of Rt,we calculated that in locations with si...","We assess the impact of asymptomatic transmission on epidemic potential of novel respiratory pathogens (like COVID-19) -- as measured both by the basic reproduction number (i.e., the expected number of secondary cases generated by an average primary case in a fully susceptible population) and the fraction of new secondary cases attributable to asymptomatic individuals. We show that the impact of asymptomatic transmission depends on generation intervals (i.e., time between when an individual is infected and when that individual infects another person). If the generation-interval distribution of asymptomatic transmission differs from that of symptomatic transmission, then estimates of the basic reproduction number which do not explicitly account for asymptomatic cases may be systematically biased. Specifically, if asymptomatic cases have a shorter generation interval than symptomatic cases, R_0 will be over-estimated, and if they have a longer generation interval, R_0 will be under-estim...","The world is braced for a public health emergency of international concern caused by a novel emerging infectious disease, a coronavirus with similarities to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV). Person-to-person transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), started in December, 2019, in Wuhan, China and has spread to become a global pandemic, with, as of Feb 26, 2020, community transmission in Italy, Iran, and South Korea. Modelling studies have aided understanding of COVID-19 dynamics from the first announcement of the epidemic and publication of the genetic sequence of the causative virus. Initial phylogenetic analysis of closely related viruses suggested highly linked person-to-person spread of SARS-CoV-2 originating from mid-November to early December, 2019.1, 2 Following this, modellers provided simple calculations that identified a mismatch between reported cases in China and reported importations of cases from travell...","Background: As the COVID-19 epidemic is spreading, incoming data allows us to quantify values of key variables that determine the transmission and the effort required to control the epidemic. We determine the incubation period and serial interval distribution for transmission clusters in Singapore and in Tianjin. We infer the basic reproduction number and identify the extent of pre-symptomatic transmission. Methods: We collected outbreak information from Singapore and Tianjin, China, reported from Jan.19-Feb.26 and Jan.21-Feb.27, respectively. We estimated incubation periods and serial intervals in both populations. Results: The mean incubation period was 7.1 (6.13, 8.25) days for Singapore and 9 (7.92, 10.2)days for Tianjin. Both datasets had shorter incubation periods for earlier-occurring cases. The mean serial interval was 4.56 (2.69, 6.42) days for Singapore and 4.22 (3.43, 5.01) for Tianjin. We inferred that early in the outbreaks, infection was transmitted on average 2.55 and 2....","We report temporal patterns of viral shedding in 94 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients and modelled COVID-19 infectiousness profile from a separate sample of 77 infector-infectee transmission pairs. We observed the highest viral load in throat swabs at the time of symptom onset, and inferred that infectiousness peaked on or before symptom onset. We estimated that 44% of transmission could occur before first symptoms of the index. Disease control measures should be adjusted to account for probable substantial pre-symptomatic transmission.","Abstract: The 2019-nCoV outbreak has raised concern of global spread. While person-to-person transmission within the Wuhan district has led to a large outbreak, the transmission potential outside of the region remains unclear. Here we present a simple approach for determining whether the upper limit of the confidence interval for the reproduction number exceeds one for transmission in the United States, which would allow endemic transmission. As of February 7, 2020, the number of cases in the United states support subcritical transmission, rather than ongoing transmission. However, this conclusion can change if pre-symptomatic cases resulting from human-to-human transmission have not yet been identified.","Summary Background An outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has led to 95 333 confirmed cases as of March 5, 2020. Understanding the early transmission dynamics of the infection and evaluating the effectiveness of control measures is crucial for assessing the potential for sustained transmission to occur in new areas. Combining a mathematical model of severe SARS-CoV-2 transmission with four datasets from within and outside Wuhan, we estimated how transmission in Wuhan varied between December, 2019, and February, 2020. We used these estimates to assess the potential for sustained human-to-human transmission to occur in locations outside Wuhan if cases were introduced. Methods We combined a stochastic transmission model with data on cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Wuhan and international cases that originated in Wuhan to estimate how transmission had varied over time during January, 2020, and February, 2020. Based on these estimates, we...","Background: The COVID-19 pandemic caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is straining health systems around the world. Although the Chinese government implemented a number of severe restrictions on people's movement in an attempt to contain its local and international spread, the virus had already reached many areas of the world in part due to its potent transmissibility and the fact that a substantial fraction of infected individuals develop little or no symptoms at all. Following its emergence, the virus started to generate sustained transmission in neighboring countries in Asia, Western Europe, Australia, Canada and the United States, and finally in South America and Africa. As the virus continues its global spread, a clear and evidence-based understanding of properties and dynamics of the global transmission network of SARS-CoV-2 is essential to design and put in place efficient and globally coordinated interventions. Methods: We employ molecular...","A novel \u03b2-coronavirus (2019-nCoV) caused severe and even fetal pneumonia explored in a seafood market of Wuhan city, Hubei province, China, and rapidly spread to other provinces of China and other countries. The 2019-nCoV was different from SARS-CoV, but shared the same host receptor the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). The natural host of 2019-nCoV may be the bat Rhinolophus affinis as 2019-nCoV showed 96.2% of whole-genome identity to BatCoV RaTG13. The person-to-person transmission routes of 2019-nCoV included direct transmission, such as cough, sneeze, droplet inhalation transmission, and contact transmission, such as the contact with oral, nasal, and eye mucous membranes. 2019-nCoV can also be transmitted through the saliva, and the fetal\u2013oral routes may also be a potential person-to-person transmission route. The participants in dental practice expose to tremendous risk of 2019-nCoV infection due to the face-to-face communication and the exposure to saliva, blood, an...","Background: To assess the viability of isolation and contact tracing to control onwards transmission from imported cases of 2019-nCoV. Methods: We developed a stochastic transmission model, parameterised to the 2019-nCoV outbreak. We used the model to quantify the potential effectiveness of contact tracing and isolation of cases at controlling a 2019 nCoV-like pathogen. We considered scenarios that varied in: the number of initial cases; the basic reproduction number R0; the delay from symptom onset to isolation; the probability contacts were traced; the proportion of transmission that occurred before symptom onset, and the proportion of subclinical infections. We assumed isolation prevented all further transmission in the model. Outbreaks were deemed controlled if transmission ended within 12 weeks or before 5000 cases in total. We measured the success of controlling outbreaks using isolation and contact tracing, and quantified the weekly maximum number of cases traced to measure feas...","Objectives: The novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) originating from Wuhan has rapidly spread throughout China. While the origin of the outbreak remains uncertain, accumulating evidence links a wet market in Wuhan for the early spread of 2019-nCoV. Similarly, the influence of the marketplace on the early transmission dynamics is yet to be investigated. Methods: Using the daily series of COVID-19 incidenceincluding contact history with the market, we have conducted quantitative modeling analyses to estimate the reproduction numbers (R) for the market-to-human and human-to-human transmission together with the reporting probability and the early effects of public health interventions. Results: Our mean R estimates for China in 2019-2020 are estimated at 0.37 (95%CrI: 0.02-1.78) for market-to-human transmission, and 3.87 (95%CrI: 3.18-4.78) for human-to-human transmission, respectively. Moreover we estimated that the reporting rate cases stemming from market-to-human transmission was 3-31 fold h...","BACKGROUND: Isolation of cases and contact tracing is used to control outbreaks of infectious diseases, and has been used for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Whether this strategy will achieve control depends on characteristics of both the pathogen and the response. Here we use a mathematical model to assess if isolation and contact tracing are able to control onwards transmission from imported cases of COVID-19. METHODS: We developed a stochastic transmission model, parameterised to the COVID-19 outbreak. We used the model to quantify the potential effectiveness of contact tracing and isolation of cases at controlling a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-like pathogen. We considered scenarios that varied in the number of initial cases, the basic reproduction number (R(0)), the delay from symptom onset to isolation, the probability that contacts were traced, the proportion of transmission that occurred before symptom onset, and the proportion of subclinic...","OBJECTIVES: The outbreak of Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) was one of the major events in South Korea in 2015. In particular, this study pays attention to formulating a mathematical model for MERS transmission dynamics and estimating transmission rates. METHODS: Incidence data of MERS-CoV from the government authority was analyzed for the first aim and a mathematical model was built and analyzed for the second aim of the study. A mathematical model for MERS-CoV transmission dynamics is used to estimate the transmission rates in two periods due to the implementation of intensive interventions. RESULTS: Using the estimates of the transmission rates, the basic reproduction number was estimated in two periods. Due to the superspreader, the basic reproduction number was very large in the first period; however, the basic reproduction number of the second period has reduced significantly after intensive interventions. CONCLUSION: It turned out to be the intensive i...","Background: An outbreak of a novel coronavirus, named CoVID-19, was first reported in China on 31 December 2019. As of 9 February 2020, cases have been reported in 25 countries, including probable cases of human-to-human transmission in England. Methods: We adapted an existing national-scale metapopulation model to capture the spread of CoVID-19 in England and Wales. We used 2011 census data to capture population sizes and population movement, together with parameter estimates from the current outbreak in China. Results: We predict that a CoVID-19 outbreak will peak 126 to 147 days (~4 months) after the start of person-to-person transmission in England and Wales in the absence of controls, assuming biological parameters remain unchanged. Therefore, if person-to-person transmission persists from February, we predict the epidemic peak would occur in June. The starting location has minimal impact on peak timing, and model stochasticity varies peak timing by 10 days. Incorporating realisti...","AbstractAs reported by the World Health Organization, a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) was identified as the causative virus of Wuhan pneumonia of unknown etiology by Chinese authorities on 7 January, 2020. In this study, we developed a Bats-Hosts-Reservoir-People transmission network model for simulating the potential transmission from the infection source (probable be bats) to the human infection. Since the Bats-Hosts-Reservoir network was hard to explore clearly and public concerns were focusing on the transmission from a seafood market (reservoir) to people, we simplified the model as Reservoir-People transmission network model. The basic reproduction number (R0) was calculated from the RP model to assess the transmissibility of the 2019-nCoV.","ABSTRACTThe outbreak of pneumonia originating in Wuhan, China, has generated 830 confirmed cases, including 26 deaths, as of 24 January 2020. The virus (2019-nCoV) has spread elsewhere in China and to other countries, including South Korea, Thailand, Japan and USA. Fortunately, there has not yet been evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission outside of China. Here we assess the risk of sustained transmission whenever the coronavirus arrives in other countries. Data describing the times from symptom onset to hospitalisation for 47 patients infected in the current outbreak are used to generate an estimate for the probability that an imported case is followed by sustained human-to-human transmission. Under the assumptions that the imported case is representative of the patients in China, and that the 2019-nCoV is similarly transmissible to the SARS coronavirus, the probability that an imported case is followed by sustained human-to-human transmission is 0.37. However, if the mean ...","BACKGROUND: Since its identification on the 7th of January 2020, SARS-CoV-2 has spread to more than 180 countries worldwide, causing &gt;11,000 deaths. At present, viral disease and transmission amongst children is incompletely understood. Specifically, there is concern that children could be an important source of SARS-CoV-2 in household transmission clusters. METHODS: We performed an observational study analysing literature published between December 2019 and March 2020 of the clinical features of SARS-CoV-2 in children and descriptions of household transmission clusters of SARS-CoV-2. In these studies the index case of each cluster defined as the individual in the household cluster who first developed symptoms. FINDINGS: Drawing on studies from China, Singapore, South Korea, Japan, and Iran a broad range of clinical symptoms were observed in children. These ranged from asymptomatic to severe disease. Of the 31 household transmission clusters that were identified, 9.7% (3/31) were ident...","The outbreak of pneumonia originating in Wuhan, China, has generated 24,500 confirmed cases, including 492 deaths, as of 5 February 2020. The virus (2019-nCoV) has spread elsewhere in China and to 24 countries, including South Korea, Thailand, Japan and USA. Fortunately, there has only been limited human-to-human transmission outside of China. Here, we assess the risk of sustained transmission whenever the coronavirus arrives in other countries. Data describing the times from symptom onset to hospitalisation for 47 patients infected early in the current outbreak are used to generate an estimate for the probability that an imported case is followed by sustained human-to-human transmission. Under the assumptions that the imported case is representative of the patients in China, and that the 2019-nCoV is similarly transmissible to the SARS coronavirus, the probability that an imported case is followed by sustained human-to-human transmission is 0.41 (credible interval [0.27, 0.55]). Howev...","Background The outbreak of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) started in the city of Wuhan, China, with a period of rapid initial spread. Transmission on a regional and then national scale was promoted by intense travel during the holiday period of the Chinese New Year. We studied the variation in transmission of COVID-19, locally in Wuhan, as well as on a larger spatial scale, among different cities and even among provinces in mainland China. Methods In addition to reported numbers of new cases, we have been able to assemble detailed contact data for some of the initial clusters of COVID-19. This enabled estimation of the serial interval for clinical cases, as well as reproduction numbers for small and large regions. Findings We estimated the average serial interval was 4.8 days. For early transmission in Wuhan, any infectious case produced as many as four new cases, transmission outside Wuhan was less intense, with reproduction numbers below two. During the rapid growth phase ...","Since mid-December of 2019, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been spreading from Wuhan, China. The confirmed COVID-19 patients in South Korea are those who came from or visited China. As secondary transmissions have occurred and the speed of transmission is accelerating, there are rising concerns about community infections. The 54-year old male is the third patient diagnosed with COVID-19 in Korea. He is a worker for a clothing business and had mild respiratory symptoms and intermittent fever in the beginning of hospitalization, and pneumonia symptoms on chest computerized tomography scan on day 6 of admission. This patient caused one case of secondary transmission and three cases of tertiary transmission. Hereby, we report the clinical findings of the index patient who was the first to cause tertiary transmission outside China. Interestingly, after lopinavir/ritonavir (Kaletra, AbbVie) was administered, \u03b2-coronavirus viral loads significantly decreased and no or little coronavi...","Background Transmission of Middle East respiratory syndrome-coronavirus (MERS-CoV) among health care workers (HCWs) and patients has been documented with mortality rate approximating 36%. We propose advanced infection control measures (A-IC) used in conjunction with basic infection control measures (B-IC) help reduce pathogen transmission. B-IC include standard and transmission-based precautions. A-IC are initiatives implemented within our center to enhance effectiveness of B-IC. Objective Study effectiveness of combining B-IC and A-IC to prevent transmission of MERS-CoV to HCWs. Methods A retrospective observational study was undertaken. A-IC measures include administrative support with daily rounds; infection control risk assessment; timely screening, isolation, and specimen analysis; collaboration; epidemic planning; stockpiling; implementation of contingency plans; full personal protective equipment use for advanced airway management; use of a real-time electronic isolation flaggin...","ABSTRACTOn December 31, 2019, the World Health Organization was notified about a cluster of pneumonia of unknown aetiology in the city of Wuhan, China. Chinese authorities later identified a new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) as the causative agent of the outbreak. As of January 23, 2020, 655 cases have been confirmed in China and several other countries. Understanding the transmission characteristics and the potential for sustained human-to-human transmission of 2019-nCoV is critically important for coordinating current screening and containment strategies, and determining whether the outbreak constitutes a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC). We performed stochastic simulations of early outbreak trajectories that are consistent with the epidemiological findings to date. We found the basic reproduction number, R0, to be around 2.2 (90% high density interval 1.4\u20143.8), indicating the potential for sustained human-to-human transmission. Transmission characteristics appear t...","Background: Global spread of COVID-19 created an unprecedented infectious disease crisis that progressed to a pandemic with &gt;180,000 cases in &gt;100 countries. Reproductive number (R) is an outbreak metric estimating the transmission of a pathogen. Initial R values were published based on the early outbreak in China with limited number of cases with whole genome sequencing. Initial comparisons failed to show a direct relationship viral genomic diversity and epidemic severity was not established for SARS-Cov-2. Methods: Each country's COVID-19 outbreak status was classified according to epicurve stage (index, takeoff, exponential, decline). Instantaneous R estimates (Wallinga and Teunis method) with a short and standard serial interval examined asymptomatic spread. Whole genome sequences were used to quantify the pathogen genome identity score that were used to estimate transmission time and epicurve stage. Transmission time was estimated based on evolutionary rate of 2 mutations/month. F...","The transmission potential of a novel infection depends on both the inherent transmissibility of a pathogen, and the level of susceptibility in the host population. However, distinguishing between these pathogen- and population-specific properties typically requires detailed serological studies, which are rarely available in the early stages of an outbreak. Using a simple transmission model that incorporates age-stratified social mixing patterns, we present a novel method for characterizing the transmission potential of subcritical infections, which have effective reproduction number R&lt;1, from readily available data on the size of outbreaks. We show that the model can identify the extent to which outbreaks are driven by inherent pathogen transmissibility and pre-existing population immunity, and can generate unbiased estimates of the effective reproduction number. Applying the method to real-life infections, we obtained accurate estimates for the degree of age-specific immunity against...","Summary Background Three clusters of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) linked to a tour group from China, a company conference, and a church were identified in Singapore in February, 2020. Methods We gathered epidemiological and clinical data from individuals with confirmed COVID-19, via interviews and inpatient medical records, and we did field investigations to assess interactions and possible modes of transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Open source reports were obtained for overseas cases. We reported the median (IQR) incubation period of SARS-CoV-2. Findings As of Feb 15, 2020, 36 cases of COVID-19 were linked epidemiologically to the first three clusters of circumscribed local transmission in Singapore. 425 close contacts were quarantined. Direct or prolonged close contact was reported among affected individuals, although indirect transmission (eg, via fomites and shared food) could not be excluded. The median incubation period of SARS-C...","Reanalysis of the epidemic curve from the initial cluster of cases with novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) in December 2019 indicates substantial human-to-human transmission. It is possible that the common exposure history at a seafood market in Wuhan originated from the human-to-human transmission events within the market, and the early, strong emphasis that market exposure indicated animal-to-human transmission was potentially the result of observer bias. To support the hypothesis of zoonotic origin of 2019-nCoV stemming from the Huanan seafood market, the index case should have had exposure history related to the market and the virus should have been identified from animals sold at the market. As these requirements remain unmet, zoonotic spillover at the market must not be overemphasized.","The COVID-19 pandemic caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has spread globally, resulting in &gt;300,000 reported cases worldwide as of March 21st, 2020. Here we investigate the genetic diversity and genomic epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 in Northern California using samples from returning travelers, cruise ship passengers, and cases of community transmission with unclear infection sources. Virus genomes were sampled from 29 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 infection from Feb 3rd through Mar 15th. Phylogenetic analyses revealed at least 8 different SARS-CoV-2 lineages, suggesting multiple independent introductions of the virus into the state. Virus genomes from passengers on two consecutive excursions of the Grand Princess cruise ship clustered with those from an established epidemic in Washington State, including the WA1 genome representing the first reported case in the United States on January 19th. We also detected evidence for presumptive transmission of SARS-CoV-2 lineages from on...","AbstractA discrete dynamic model for human epidemics was developed in present study. The model included major parameters as transmission strength and its decline parameters, mean incubation period, hospitalization time, non-hospitalization daily mortality, non-hospitalization daily recovery rate, and hospitalization proportion, etc. Sensitivity analysis of the model indicated the total cumulative cases significantly increased with initial transmission strength, hospitalization time. The total cumulative cases significantly decreased with transmission strength\u2019s decline and hospitalization proportion, and linearly decreased with non-hospitalization daily mortality and non-hospitalization daily recovery rate. In a certain range, the total cumulative cases significantly increased with mean incubation period. Sensitivity analysis demonstrated that dynamic change of transmission strength is one of the most important and controllable factors. In addition, reducing the delay for hospitalizati...","Abstract Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is caused by SARS-COV2 and represents the causative agent of a potentially fatal disease that is of great global public health concern. Based on the large number of infected people that were exposed to the wet animal market in Wuhan City, China, it is suggested that this is likely the zoonotic origin of COVID-19. Person-to-person transmission of COVID-19 infection led to the isolation of patients that were subsequently administered a variety of treatments. Extensive measures to reduce person-to-person transmission of COVID-19 have been implemented to control the current outbreak. Special attention and efforts to protect or reduce transmission should be applied in susceptible populations including children, health care providers, and elderly people. In this review, we highlights the symptoms, epidemiology, transmission, pathogenesis, phylogenetic analysis and future directions to control the spread of this fatal disease.","Summary The Zika epidemic in the Americas has challenged surveillance and control. As the epidemic appears to be waning, it is unclear whether transmission is still ongoing, which is exacerbated by discrepancies in reporting. To uncover locations with lingering outbreaks, we investigated travel-associated Zika cases to identify transmission not captured by reporting. We uncovered an unreported outbreak in Cuba during 2017, a year after peak transmission in neighboring islands. By sequencing Zika virus, we show that the establishment of the virus was delayed by a year and that the ensuing outbreak was sparked by long-lived lineages of Zika virus from other Caribbean islands. Our data suggest that, although mosquito control in Cuba may initially have been effective at mitigating Zika virus transmission, such measures need to be maintained to be effective. Our study highlights how Zika virus may still be \u201csilently\u201d spreading and provides a framework for understanding outbreak dynamics. Vi...","AbstractThe outbreaks of 2002/2003 SARS, 2012/2015 MERS and 2019/2020 Wuhan respiratory syndrome clearly indicate that genome evolution of an animal coronavirus (CoV) may enable it to acquire human transmission ability, and thereby to cause serious threats to global public health. It is widely accepted that CoV human transmission is driven by the interactions of its spike protein (S-protein) with human receptor on host cell surface; so, quantitative evaluation of these interactions may be used to assess the human transmission capability of CoVs. However, quantitative methods directly using viral genome data are still lacking. Here, we perform large-scale protein-protein docking to quantify the interactions of 2019-nCoV S-protein receptor-binding domain (S-RBD) with human receptor ACE2, based on experimental SARS-CoV S-RBD-ACE2 complex structure. By sampling a large number of thermodynamically probable binding conformations with Monte Carlo algorithm, this approach successfully identifi...","Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV [SARS-COV-2]) was detected in humans during the last week of December 2019 at Wuhan city in China, and caused 24 554 cases in 27 countries and territories as of 5 February 2020. The objective of this study was to estimate the risk of transmission of 2019-nCoV through human passenger air flight from four major cities of China (Wuhan, Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou) to the passengers' destination countries. We extracted the weekly simulated passengers' end destination data for the period of 1\u201331 January 2020 from FLIRT, an online air travel dataset that uses information from 800 airlines to show the direct flight and passengers' end destination. We estimated a risk index of 2019-nCoV transmission based on the number of travellers to destination countries, weighted by the number of confirmed cases of the departed city reported by the World Health Organization (WHO). We ranked each country based on the risk index in four quantiles (4(th) quantile being the hig...","Background: Cases with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) emigrated from Wuhan escalated the risk of spreading in other cities. This report focused on the outside-Wuhan patients to assess the transmission and clinical characteristics of this illness. Methods: Contact investigation was conducted on each patient who admitted to the assigned hospitals in Hunan Province (geographically adjacent to Wuhan) from Jan 22, 2020 to Feb 12, 2020. Demographic, clinical, laboratory and radiological characteristics, medication therapy and outcomes were collected and analyzed. Patients were confirmed by PCR test. Results: Of the 104 patients, 48 (46.15%) were imported cases and 56 (53.85%) were indigenous cases; 93 (89.42%) had a definite contact history with infections. Family clusters were the major body of patients. Transmission along the chain of 3 &amp;ldquo:generations\u201d was observed. Mean age was 43 (rang, 8-84) years (including 3 children) and 49 (47.12%) were male. Most patients had typical sympt...","AbstractBackgroundThe ongoing outbreak of COVID-19 has spread rapidly and sparked global concern. While the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 through human respiratory droplets and contact with infected persons is clear, the aerosol transmission of SARS-CoV-2 has been little studied.MethodsThirty-five aerosol samples of three different types (total suspended particle, size segregated and deposition aerosol) were collected in Patient Areas (PAA) and Medical Staff Areas (MSA) of Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University (Renmin) and Wuchang Fangcang Field Hospital (Fangcang), and Public Areas (PUA) in Wuhan, China during COVID-19 outbreak. A robust droplet digital polymerase chain reaction (ddPCR) method was employed to quantitate the viral SARS-CoV-2 RNA genome and determine aerosol RNA concentration.ResultsThe ICU, CCU and general patient rooms inside Renmin, patient hall inside Fangcang had undetectable or low airborne SARS-CoV-2 concentration but deposition samples inside ICU and air sample in Fa...","Background: After the outbreak of novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) starting in late 2019, a number of researchers have reported the predicted the virus transmission dynamics. However, under the strict control policy the novel coronavirus does not spread naturally outside Hubei Province, and none of the prediction closes to the real situation. Methods and findings: We used the traditional SEIR model, fully estimated the effect of control measures, to predict the virus transmission in Wuhan, the capital city of Hubei Province, and Beijing. We forecast that the outbreak of 2019-nCoV would reach its peak around March 6\u00b110 in Wuhan and March 20\u00b116 in Beijing, respectively. The infectious population in Beijing would be much less (only 0.3%) than those in Wuhan at the peak of this transmission wave. The number of confirmed cases in cities inside Hubei Province grow exponentially, whereas those in cities outside the province increase linearly. Conclusions: The unprecedented province lockdown subs...","Importance: Although the COVID-19 epidemic in some countries such as China are in the last phase by large effort for containment of the disease, another outbreaks can occur because huge susceptible population remains. Further, there remain countries in the early phase of outbreak with zero or limited number of cases in southern hemisphere countries. In those countries at risk of future outbreak, ascertaining whether cases are imported or the result of local secondary transmission is important for government to shape appropriate public health strategies. Objective: To develop a method to estimate timing of infection establishment, which helps differentiate imported and autochthonous cases. Design, Setting and Participants: Of the first 18 cases reported in Singapore, 12 were used in our study (1 case with insufficient data and 5 on anti-viral treatment were excluded from the analysis). The viral load data from these initial cases considered imported due to their travel history to Wuhan ...","The Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) emerged in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in 2012 causing a critical challenge to public health. The epidemiology of MERS-CoV remain enigmatic as human-to-human transmission is not fully understood. One possible scenario that might play a role in the virus transmission is the cultural waterpipe smoking. Caf\u00e9s providing waterpipe smoking in cities within Saudi Arabia have been moved to areas outside city limits that frequently place them close to camels markets. We report results of a surveillance study wherein waterpipe hoses throughout several regions in Saudi Arabia were tested for the presence of MERS-CoV. A total of 2489 waterpipe samples were collected from cities where MERS-CoV cases were continuously recorded. MERS-CoV RNA wasn\u2019t detected in collected samples. Irrespective of the negative results of our survey, the public health risk of waterpipe smoking should not be underestimated. To avoid a possible transmission within country whe...","The Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) was first described in 2012 and, subsequently, many cases were reported with a lower case fatality rate than initial cases. Humans can become infected within their communities and transmission can then be amplified in the healthcare setting. Contact investigation among cases shows a variable amount of spread among family members and healthcare workers. So far, circulating virus strains remain similar under continuous monitoring, with no genetic changes. Here, we discuss the transmission pattern, phylogenetic evolution, and pathogenesis of MERS-CoV infection.","Background The emergence of a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) in Wuhan, China in early December 2019 has caused widespread transmission within the country, with over 1,000 deaths reported to date. Other countries have since reported coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) importation from China, with some experiencing local transmission and even case importation from countries outside China. We aim to estimate the number of cases imported from Wuhan to each country or territory outside mainland China, and with these estimates assess the risk of onward local transmission and the relative potential of case importation between countries outside China. Methods We used the reported number of cases imported from Wuhan and flight data to generate an uncertainty distribution for the estimated number of imported cases from Wuhan to each location outside mainland China. This uncertainty was propagated to quantify the local outbreak risk using a branching process model. A COVID-19 introduction index w...","Abstract The coronavirus (CoV) family consists of viruses that infects a variety of animals including humans with various levels of respiratory and fecal-oral transmission levels depending on the behavior of the viruses' natural hosts and optimal viral fitness. A model to classify and predict the levels of respective respiratory and fecal-oral transmission potentials of the various viruses was built before the outbreak of MERS-CoV using AI and empirically-based molecular tools to predict the disorder level of proteins. Using the percentages of intrinsic disorder (PID) of the nucleocapsid (N) and membrane (M) proteins of CoV, the model easily clustered the viruses into three groups with the SARS-CoV (M PID=8%, N PID = 50%) falling into Category B, in which viruses have intermediate levels of both respiratory and fecal-oral transmission potentials. Later, MERS-CoV (M PID=9%, N PID =44%) was found to be in Category C, which consists of viruses with lower respiratory transmission potential...","Since December 2019, China has been experiencing a large outbreak of a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) which can cause respiratory disease and severe pneumonia. We estimated the basic reproduction number R(0) of 2019-nCoV to be around 2.2 (90% high density interval: 1.4\u20133.8), indicating the potential for sustained human-to-human transmission. Transmission characteristics appear to be of similar magnitude to severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and pandemic influenza, indicating a risk of global

The model was run for each catchment area independently, as we did not model population movements between catchment areas. Although it is theoretically feasible, it seems unnecessary in this context. Infected cases are already present in most locations, meaning transmission is likely to be mainly driven locally, not by inter-areas transfers. Moreover, control measures are already implemented to limit population movements. We are only presenting forecasts at one month, as long term predictions may be unreliable due to the few data available to calibrate the model concerning the epidemic in France. The critical factor that remains unknown to this date is the potential impact of seasonality on the transmission dynamic of COVID-19. Danon and colleagues modeled seasonal transmission by introducing a time-varying transmission rate. 21 They estimated that a 50% reduction in transmission during summer months would result in a smaller epidemic before the summer, followed by a resurgence in cases in the following winter. However, whether SARS-CoV-2 transmission will be affected by seasonal variations remains unclear. Although many infectious diseases have seasonal patterns, like influenza or other coronaviruses, newly introduced viruses can behave differently. Several experts suggest that the impact of seasonality on COVID-19 7 .

Our findings suggest that the height of the epidemic and the attack rate is highly dependent on seasonality of transmission and that even small changes in transmission risk can lead to large changes in attack rate due to the spatial disaggregation of the population at risk.","is the (which was not peer-reviewed) The copyright holder for this preprint . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.12.20022566 doi: medRxiv preprint However, seasonality in transmission has a large impact on epidemic timing, peak incidence, and final attack rates. Assuming no difference in transmission rate during the year leads to a single large epidemic after approximately 4 months (June time if transmission starts in February), as above. With a 25% reduction in transmission the epidemic is smaller and peaks later, reducing the overall attack rate by 20%. A 50% reduction in transmission results in a smaller epidemic before the summer, followed by a resurgence in cases in the following winter. The attack rate is 10% less than a non-seasonal epidemic. A 75% reduction in transmission over the summer resulted in a delayed large outbreak, but with a similar attack rate. If transmission decreases to zero over the summer then the resulting outbreak is much reduced, with an attack rate of less than 1% ( Figure 5 , Table 2 ). .

Although MERS-CoV cases were reported throughout the year in Saudi Arabia, a seasonality pattern appears to be higher during certain months of the year [8] . Similar seasonality may exist in the Riyadh Region as well.","Winter conditions are known to accelerate transmission of influenza and also the other coronaviruses which cause common cold like symptoms [31] . Enveloped viruses show strong seasonality with winter peaks [32] , and SARS-Cov-2 is an enveloped virus. Even though there are many uncertainties relating to seasonality and this novel coronavirus [33] , it seems prudent to assume some seasonal fluctuation so we increased the average by 25% in winter and reduced it by 25% in summer (with a sinusoidal variation throughout the simulated year), using a mid-winter peak for Europe of 15 January (i.e., day 334 of the simulation).","To understand the process of respiratory disease transmission and mitigation, we developed a metapopulation model that represents age-specific contact between children and adults within metropolitan areas and is spatially divided into metropolitan areas linked through air tra c flows. The model is described in detail in [7] . We simulated a seasonal influenza epidemic in the US, including typical holiday school closure, and seasonality with the season ending at April 30, 2020. We then incorporated reduction in age-structured transmission by (1 \u2327 (t)), where is the intensity of transmission decrease, which relates to the increase in risk perception level of \u2327 (t). We parameterize \u2327 (t) based on daily Google trends for COVID-19 and fit to assess the degree to which influenza transmission is reduced in the early stages of COVID-19 in the US. We consider two main possible mechanisms by which COVID-19 may have resulted in decreased transmission: 1) increased risk perception of respiratory transmitted disease resulting in precautionary behaviors, like increased handwashing, that reduce potentially transmissible contacts and 2) isolation of infected individuals, either due to undetected COVID-19 spread, or increased messaging surrounding remaining home if one is feeling ill for any reason.","See Online for appendices 2, 3 R 0 of 2\u00b75 or higher, reductions in transmission by social distancing would have to be large; and much of the changes in transmission of pandemic influenza in the summer of 2009 within Europe were thought to be due to school closures, but children are not thought to be driving transmission of COVID-19. Data from the southern hemisphere will assist in evaluating how much seasonality will influence COVID-19 transmission.","The primary mode of transmission is via direct or indirect mucous membrane contact with infectious respiratory droplets or fomites. 10 Fecal-oral transmission may be an important secondary means, as virus is found in large quantities in stool and profuse, watery diarrhea is not uncommon. 5,11,12 Transmission is not described before clinical illness onset,which corresponds with peak viral load at day 12 to 14 of symptoms. As such, early patient isolation may facilitate transmission prevention. 11 Transmission occurs with close patient contact, with passage to casual contacts being unusual. Transmission is facilitated by aerosol-generating procedures in medical settings. Seasonality is suspected but remains to be elucidated. SARS affects individuals of all age groups and immune status, although children appeared less severely affected in the 2003 epidemic. Infected individuals initially experience fever, myalgias, and chills. Cough is common early, but tachypnea and shortness of breath are more prominent later in the illness. The elderly may not present with fever but may manifest decreased appetite and malaise. 13 Upper respiratory symptoms are uncommon, perhaps serving as one clinical clue differentiating a cluster of epidemiologically linked SARS patients from those with other atypical pneumonias. Pulmonary findings, such as rales, occurred in less than one third of SARS cases, and often did not correlate clinically with chest radiography (CXR) findings. 7,14 Twenty percent of patients had prominent gastrointestinal symptoms, including watery diarrhea. CXR findings appear to correlate with the rapidity at which patients require hospitalization. The most common initial findings on CXR are ground-glass opacifications or focal consolidations of the peripheral, subpleural lower lung fields. In 67% of patients with an initially normal CXR, findings appear on subsequent high-resolution chest tomography (HRCT). Pleural effusions, mediastinal lymphadenopathy, and cavitation are rare. 16 One third of SARs patients showed improvement, with defervescence and radiographic resolution over several weeks. In the remainder, fever persisted and progressive shortness of breath, hypoxia, tachypnea, increasing auscultative findings, and often diarrhea were noted. Serial radiography, or HDCT, revealed progression to multifocal unilateral or bilateral air-space consolidation, and often non-iatrogenic pneumomediastinum. Approximately 20% to 30% of patients require intensive care. Death is usually due to respiratory failure and/or multiple organ failure, sepsis, or accompanying cardiac decompensation. Later lung findings include diffuse alveolar damage, edema, hyaline membrane formation, pneumocyte desquamation, giant cells, a high viral load, and an inflammatory infiltrate. 6, 14, 17 Mortality risk factors, determined by multivariate regression analysis, include advanced age, co-morbid cardiovascular disease and diabetes, and high neutrophil and lactate dehydrogenase levels on presentation. 17, 18 Between 6% and 20% of recovered patients have some residual respiratory impairment. 3 Clinical manifestations are nonspecific. In one study, the WHO case definition was shown to be 96% specific but only 26% sensitive. 3 Laboratory data are nondiagnostic; however, lymphocytopenia is common and thrombocytopenia may be noted. Alanine aminotransferase, lactate dehydrogenase, and creatine kinase levels may be elevated. Although RT-PCR has been shown to be diagnostic in respiratory and fecal specimens, and viral RNA is detectable in serum and urine, the CDC and WHO do not deem RT-PCR currently reliable to rule out SARS infection. 19 Lower respiratory tract specimens are the most useful but place healthcare providers at the most risk of transmission via aerosol generation. 20 Seroconversion 21 to 28 days after symptom onset (wholevirus immunoassay via IFA or ELISA) remains the gold standard to confirm SARS infection. 21","Seasonality of MERS has been previously hypothesized from the high incidence of cases during spring and early summer months and it has been postulated that this may be correlated to the camel birthing pattern; young, newborn camels encountering MERS-CoV for the first time may get ill and transmit the virus to humans [13, 94, 95]. However, outbreaks in latter half of 2015 and early 2016 countered against the expected seasonality [96].","A key parameter is the basic reproduction number (R 0 ), which determines how fast SARS-CoV-2 can spread through the population during the early stages of the outbreak. This is an inherently difficult parameter to estimate, since the true number of cases that can transmit infection at a given time is unknown (reported cases are likely to be just a small fraction of true cases) and probably varies over time (because of different interventions being introduced and population behaviour changing in response to the epidemic). In our analysis, we used an existing model that inferred time-dependent R e based on the growth of reported cases in Wuhan and the number of exported cases outside China originating from Wuhan. 14 We acknowledge that the underlying reproduction number in Wuhan could have been larger than that used in our study. However, other studies of early SARS-CoV-2 transmission dynamics in Wuhan, using different methods, arrived at the same estimate with similar ranges. 1, 9 Although the precise effects of interventions might vary by country and different estimates of key parameters, our model highlights the usefulness of physical distancing interventions and the need to carefully calibrate their lifting to avoid second and subsequent waves of a COVID-19 epidemic. Areas of China outside Hubei and other east or southeast Asian regions have managed to avert a major outbreak locally and delayed the peak of the epidemic, without resorting to Hubei's extreme measures. 38 Policy makers are advised to reapportion their resources to focus on mitigating the effects of potentially soon-to-be overwhelmed health systems. 39 Non-physical distancing factors play a part in mitigating potential spikes in cases, especially when physical distancing measures are relaxed. The effects of seasonality on SARS-CoV-2 are difficult to predict without long time series; supporting evidence for the link between climate and COVID-19 has been largely anecdotal and based on spread in different settings and such analyses are subject to confounding. 40, 41 Consequently, we have not incorporated climatic factors into our mathematical model. Future research should be directed towards understanding the potential seasonality of COVID-19 and the climatic factors that could affect its transmission dynamics. Other innovations, such as the rapid expansion of hospital capacity and testing capabilities, would shorten diagnostic and health system delays, 3, 38, 39 thus reducing effective interactions between infectious and susceptible individuals and interrupting transmission. Effective vaccines 42 and antivirals 43 that are being developed could counteract this global public health threat. The extent to which these strategies can detect cases earlier and isolate infectious individuals from the susceptible pool or protect against infection is less well-understood, hence nece ssitating further evaluation.","The modelling techniques that we used in this study are very similar to those used by other researchers who are working towards the same goal of characterising the epidemic dynamics of 2019-nCoV (Zhanwei Du, University of Texas at Austin, personal communication). [42] [43] [44] [45] The consensus on our methodology provides some support for the validity of our nowcasts and forecasts. An additional strength of our study is that our model is parameterised with the latest mobility data from OAG and Tencent. Nonetheless, our study has several major limitations. First, we assumed that travel behaviour was not affected by disease status and that all infections eventually have symptoms (albeit possibly very mild). We would have underestimated the outbreak size in Greater Wuhan if individuals with increased risk of infection (eg, confounded by socioeconomic status) were less likely to travel internationally or if the proportion of asymptomatic infections were substantial. Second, our estimate of transmis sibility and outbreak size was somewhat sensitive to our assumption regarding the zoonotic mechanism that initiated the epidemic at Wuhan. However, our overall conclusion regarding the extent of case exportation in major Chinese cities would remain the same even for our lowest estimate of transmissibility ( figure 3) . Third, our epidemic forecast was based on inter-city mobility data from 2019 that might not necessarily reflect mobility patterns in 2020, especially in the presence of current public vigilance and response regarding the health threat posed by 2019-nCoV (appendix p 5). Fourth, little is known regarding the seasonality of coro navirus transmission. If 2019-nCoV, similar to influenza, has strong seasonality in its transmission, our epidemic forecast might not be reliable.","Some respiratory viruses have a predictable seasonality, which varies regionally. For example, in the USA and other parts of the world with similar climates, RSV affects children during fall, winter, and spring.3 Previous studies have shown that RSV infection in the tropics is more common in the rainy season.10\u201312 The reason for such seasonality is not well known yet, but atmospheric factors such as high humidity and temperature may assist virus survival in small particle droplets or aerosols, and on infected surfaces. Other factors that might affect seasonality are crowdedness such as initiation of school term.12","The strength of this model lies in the spatial heterogeneity which tempers transmission. As a comparison, an equivalent non-spatial model results in the epidemic peaking after 34 days, nearly four times faster than this spatial model, and would be unable to capture the interaction between spatial transmission and seasonality. The estimated total number of people infected in the spatial model is marginally smaller than for a non-spatial model, as the infection has the opportunity to die-out in local parts of the country. As the model framework was developed and published in 2009, it was possible to re-deploy the model for these new circumstances; developing such a model from scratch during an outbreak would be a significant challenge.","Intermittent social distancing can prevent critical care capacity from being exceeded (Figure 3 , Figure S6 ). Due to the natural history of infection, there is an approximately 3-week lag between the start of social distancing and the peak critical care demand. When transmission is seasonally forced, summertime social distancing can be less frequent than when R0 remains constant at its maximal wintertime value throughout the year. The length of time between distancing measures increases as the epidemic continues, as the accumulation of immunity in the population slows the resurgence of infection. Under current critical care capacities, however, the overall duration of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic could last into 2022, requiring social distancing measures to be in place between 25% (for wintertime R0 = 2 and seasonality, Figure  S3A ) and 70% (for wintertime R0 = 2.5 and no seasonality, Figure S2C ) of that time.","(maximum seasonality with no transmission at the peak of the summer).","A5: The COVID-19 has weak seasonality in its transmission, unlike influenza.","The modelling techniques that we used in this study are based on SEIR and system dynamics. And our model is parameterized with the latest official released data of 2019-nCoV. An additional strength of our study is that simulation of the baseline scenario is well fit the trajectory of the official data of epidemic spreading. Nonetheless, our study has several major limitations. First, we assumed that the transmission of 2019-nCoV mainly caused by exposed individuals (without symptoms) and the transmission ability of identified (without symptoms) is ignored. Second, our transmission model was somewhat sensitive to several key parameters: the starting date of epidemic spreading, the exposed (incubation) period and the identified (treatment) period. And our assumption regarding the exposed (incubation) period and the identified (treatment) period is keeping stable. If 2019-nCoV, similar to influenza, has strong seasonality in its transmission, our epidemic forecast might not be reliable.","These two scenarios differ slightly in the time of year at which peak transmissibility \u03b8 occurs: When transmission is mostly local and seasonality is amplified by .

To examine nonlinearity in the relationship between new cases and temperature, in some specifications we also include a quadratic in temperature. W it is a vector of other weather controls, including population-weighted daily total precipitation (in mm) and population-weighted daily specific humidity (in kg/kg). Z it is a vector of semi-parametric controls designed to isolate random variation in weather conditions. 29 In our baseline specification, Z it includes a full set of country-specific dummies, which remove any time-invariant differences in COVID-19 transmission rates across countries. These spatial \"fixed effects\" address the concern that baseline population characteristics (e.g. economic activity, population density) may be correlated both with transmission and with average temperature. Second, Z it includes day-specific dummies to remove any common global dynamics in COVID-19 transmission. These temporal fixed effects account for global trends or idiosyncratic shocks in COVID-19 transmission as the disease spreads globally. Finally, in some specifications, Z it also includes separate quadratic time trends for all countries lying within regularly spaced latitudinal bands (ranging from 5 \u2022 to 25 \u2022 wide). These controls, which vary over space and time, remove any potential seasonality in COVID-19 transmission rates that may differ by distance to equator and be correlated with gradually changing seasonal population dynamics, such as time spent outside or work and school schedules. Finally, standard Poisson models impose that the first and second moments of the outcome be equal. To address this overdispersion issue, we cluster standard errors at the country level. This adjustment relaxes the assumption of equal first and second moments by allowing arbitrary forms of within-county heteroskedasticity and serial correlation in the error term it . 30 To conduct our seasonal temperature projections, for each country i, we calculate","Humid wet conditions might stimulate contact transmission of RSV, by augmenting the quantity of virus that is deposited on surfaces and by boosting virus survival in droplets on surfaces. Our results go along with this proposition, keeping in mind that climate change might just be one of the many factors that can have an impact of the prevalence and seasonality of RSV infection.28 The month of July is one of the most humid months in the State of Qatar, and the surge in RSV infection during the said period can also be explained by the above proposition.","transmission might be very modest, 30,31 therefore we did not included such a seasonality in our model at the time. Also, we decided to explore only R 0 values between 1.5 and 3, as it seems to be the most reliable estimates at the moment, according to Abbott and colleagues 20 . Finally, we did not make a distinction between symptomatic and asymptomatic cases, whereas some modelers decided to create two compartments (infectious asymptomatic and infectious symptomatic). We believed it was unnecessary in this context as we are not focusing on detection or control measures, and it should not impact the interpretation of our results.","It is important to remark that these results stem from very idealized assumptions about the course of the epidemic. The inclusion of transmission or contact level heterogeneities within the population [19] (e.g., age structure) may play a significant role in the quantitative description of the results in this paper, as would the inclusion of seasonality effects. Additionally, since we are using a deterministic mean-field approach, these analyses do not account for the effects of stochastic fluctuations (which could lead to epidemic extinction if the number of infected is low enough during the social distancing phase) and as a consequence, the findings herein apply more closely to very large populations (i.e., in the thermodynamic limit) where stochastic fluctuations are less relevant. Similarly, the model assumes homogeneous mixing among individuals, thus the contact network structure of the population is not accounted for; as a result this model cannot realistically predict the epidemic-hampering effects that social distancing measures (e.g., limiting the size of crowds) have in the context of contact structured populations [20] .","Historical clues and physical findings can be helpful in focusing the search for an etiological agent. Travel or residence in areas where arboviruses are endemic during the appropriate season for arthropod transmission (typically summer months) and a history or evidence of insect bites should raise suspicion for arboviruses. Seasonality also plays a role in enteroviral diseases because in temperate climates enteroviruses are more prevalent during summer and fall months. History of a mother with recent symptoms consistent with viral illness (fever, sore throat, gastroenteritis, rash) should raise suspicion of enterovirus in a neonate with encephalitis or sepsislike illness. VZV encephalitis and myelitis typically follow chickenpox or zoster by weeks to months and commonly occur in older individuals or those with immunosuppression, such as transplant recipients. 73 VZV encephalitis may be complicated by CNS vasculopathy and resulting infarctions. Chronic encephalitis/meningitis due to enteroviruses occur in individuals with agammaglobulinemia. Chronic or relapsing encephalitis may also be due to VZV, measles (SSPE), or rubella (progressive rubella panencephalitis), though the latter two are extremely rare with the current widespread use of the MMR vaccine. HIV itself may cause encephalopathy/encephalitis or may also be associated with certain opportunistic infections such as PML. Significant exposure to rodent droppings should raise concern for LCMV. Finally, history of exposure to a bat should raise the concern for rabies.","A great deal is known about a range of animal coronaviruses, and this understanding may provide some insights into the possible future behaviour of the newest coronavirus. Many of these coronaviruses do exhibit a distinct seasonal pattern of incidence in their natural hosts. This is true for the bovine coronavirus associated with winter dysentery of calves, 34, 35 as well as for the feline infectious peritonitis virus and others. 36 The two previously described human coronaviruses (229E and OC43) both show distinct winter seasonality. 37 The forces underlying these seasonal patterns are not well understood, but a common feature of most coronaviruses is their ability to establish long-term persistence in a subset of infected animals. For example, most cats recover from their feline influenza virus (FEIV) infection and stop shedding virus, but a minority are persistently infected, shedding virus in their stools for up to 7 years or more, and it is these animals that are the continuing source for FEIV outbreaks in catteries. 36, 38 Symptomless and intermittent shedding of porcine coronavirus was documented on 24 occasions over a period of 18 months in one sow, and virulence of the shed virus was documented by the ability to infect 3-day-old piglets. 39 Human coronaviruses may also establish persistent infections in vitro. 40 Persistence of these RNA viruses involves changes in both virus and host cell, but evidence points to features of the host immune response to the initial infection that determines whether the animal will become a persistent shedder or will eradicate the infection. 38, 40 It is plausible that the infection of animal SARS coronavirus in its natural host, be it palm civets or other animals yet to be identified, also assumes seasonality in such a way that it might increase the likelihood of animalto-human transmission in the winter season. In January 2004, after the first two cases of SARS were reported in Guangdong, the Chinese government banned trading and farming of all civets in Guangdong province as soon as it was noted that civets shed high titres (10 9 ) of virus. Decision making for such a policy clearly included considerations for the impending winter high season of SARS virus activity.","Annual seasonal epidemics of RSV occur worldwide. A clear seasonality is seen in the temperate zone with peaks at fall, winter, or spring. In the tropical and subtropical areas, epidemics occur in rainy seasons.","Holt's Linear Exponential Smoothing (LES) uses two smoothing constants to smoothen the level and trend in the data [30] [31] . It is an important method if the data shows trend and not seasonality. In the current case, there is a clear upward trend in the number of infected cases from COVID-19 in India but seasonality is yet not a concern as the data is limited to a few days only. So this technique should work well for the current series. In the Holt's LES, if the estimated level and trend at time t-1 are L t-1 and T t-1 , respectively, then the forecast for Y t that would have been made at time t-1 is equal to L t-1 + T t-1 . When the actual value is observed, the updated estimate of the level is computed recursively by interpolating between Y t and its forecast, L t-1 + T t-1 , using weights of \u03b1 and 1-\u03b1 as shown in equation 3.","Parainfluenza viruses have a worldwide distribution, and almost all persons are infected initially during childhood. Parainfluenza type 3 virus may cause infection in infancy, whereas infections by type 1 and 2 viruses appear to be prevented by maternal antibody and usually arise later. National surveillance has demonstrated distinct seasonality for type 1 viruses, with biennial outbreaks in the fall of oddnumbered years. In contrast, yearly outbreaks of type 3 virus take place in the spring, with smaller autumn outbreaks in those years without type 1 outbreaks. Type 2 viruses are detected much less frequently but appear to be more prevalent in the autumn; type 4 does not exhibit notable seasonality. 227 Parainfluenza viruses appear to be transmitted from person to person by direct contact with infectious respiratory secretions or by large-particle aerosols. The incubation period is approximately 3 to 6 days. Virus is transmitted readily in families. Outbreaks of infection have been seen in closed populations, such as nurseries, day care centers, and hospitals, in which susceptible populations have high attack rates (40% to 80%).","is the (which was not peer-reviewed) The copyright holder for this preprint . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.04.20031112 doi: medRxiv preprint Table S3 .

Quantitative and qualitative data values were expressed as frequency along with percentage and mean \u00b1 SD or median and range as appropriate. The primary outcome was to estimate the types of respiratory viruses triggering bronchiolitis. In addition, we examined the trend in RSV over the different months. Test for seasonality was evaluated by fitting the data to a series of Box\u2013Jenkins regression-autoregressive integrated moving average models. These models are stochastic models in that describe a univariate time series as a function of its past values.

Specifically, our scenarios about seasonality include no effect (status quo), moderate effect (infectivity of the virus decreases linearly from April 1 st and halves by June 1 st , then stays the same for the rest of the simulation), and very strong mitigating effect (infectivity of the virus decreases from April 1 st to a quarter of its base value by June 1 st , then stays the same for the rest of the simulation). For policy, our focus is on contact rate, and we include two conditions of status quo and aggressive efforts to decrease contact rate by half what it would be otherwise. These six conditions provide intuitions for a potentially wide range of cases. Both intervention and weather impacts are assumed to include rather strong options, which is to offer a feel for the range of possibilities, but not necessarily be representative of most likely scenarios. Moreover, we also note that the wide cone of uncertainty in the baseline simulations will continue and expand in future projections.","is the (which was not peer-reviewed) The copyright holder for this preprint . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.04.20031112 doi: medRxiv preprint Table S2 .

Only influenza remained more important in our prospective study, as described previously. 36 Some authors have shown that HRV infections have the most prolonged seasonality among viral causes of pneumonia in adults, surpassing influenza, adenovirus, coronavirus, respiratory syncytial virus, or parainfluenza. 3 Second, as indicated by others, HRV-associated hospitalization affected elderly and frail patients with chronic comorbidities and with a past or current history of smoking. 12, 33, 35 Third, admissions were relevant because they were prolonged, required intermediate or intensive care resources in nearly 30% of cases, and had a case fatality rate over 10%. This profile has been described in the literature and underscores the relevance of this viral agent. 3, 33, 34 As a way of comparison, mortality by seasonal or pandemic influenza A is similar. 3, 5 The proportion of HRV infected patients that requires hospitalization (\u223c2-10%) depends on the population studied and intensity of search. 3, 13, 25, 27, 35 In addition, HRV is more frequently encountered in symptomatic adult patients than in controls demonstrating its pathogenic relevance. 1, 2, 26 All of these facts indicate that HRV infections can no longer be considered a minor nuisance and its diagnostic search is justified.","is the (which was not peer-reviewed) The copyright holder for this preprint . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.24.20042705 doi: medRxiv preprint to know where exactly on the epidemic curve we currently find ourselves. Any model involves trade-offs between simplicity and realism, and in the current work we have not attempted to model social distancing measures in a highly realistic way, but rather generically as reductions in contact frequency. Our understanding of the natural history of SARS-CoV-2 infection continues to evolve and the precise role of pre-symptomatic and subclinical transmission is uncertain. Social distancing becomes a more important control measure in the face of incomplete case ascertainment due to asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic cases. The model does not include seasonality; it is possible that transmission will attenuate in the summer (31), resulting in a decline in cases that would be expected to resurge with the return of colder weather. All of these factors mean that the quantitative findings are subject to uncertainty.","Next, we incorporated a third strain into the dynamic transmission model to represent SARS-CoV-2. Using the maximum likelihood parameter values, we simulated transmission of HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 for 20 years and then simulated the establishment of sustained SARS-CoV-2 transmission using another half-week pulse in the force of infection. We assumed that the incubation period and infectious period for SARS-CoV-2 were the same as the best-fit values for the other betacoronaviruses (5.0 and 4.9 days, respectively; see Table S7 ), in broad agreement with other estimates (23) (24) (25) . We allowed the cross immunities, duration of immunity, degree of seasonal variation in R0, and establishment time of SARS-CoV-2 to vary. In particular, we allowed the cross immunity from SARS-CoV-2 to the other betacoronaviruses to range from 0 to 1, the cross immunity from the other betacoronaviruses to SARS-CoV-2 to range from 0 to 0.5 (following the observation that SARS infection can induce long-lasting neutralizing antibodies against HCoV-OC43 but not vice-versa (15)),the duration of immunity to SARS-CoV-2 to range from 40 weeks to permanent, the seasonal variation in R0 to vary between none and equivalent to the other human betacoronaviruses, and the establishment time to vary throughout 2020. To adjust the amount of seasonal variation in R0, we held the maximum wintertime value of the sinusoid fixed and adjusted the minimum summertime (baseline) value. This way, smaller degrees of seasonal forcing translated into smaller summertime declines in R0; for the no-seasonality scenario, R0 was therefore held fixed at its maximal wintertime value. This choice was informed by observations on the seasonal variation in R0 for influenza, for which the wintertime R0 was similar between geographic locations with distinct climates, while the summertime R0 varied substantially between locations (11) . For a representative set of parameter values within these ranges, we measured the annual incidence of infection due to SARS-CoV-2 and the annual SARS-CoV-2 outbreak peak size for the five years following the simulated time of establishment. We summarized the post-pandemic SARS-CoV-2 dynamics into the categories of annual outbreaks, biennial outbreaks, sporadic outbreaks, or virtual elimination.","The copyright holder for this preprint . https: //doi.org/10.1101 //doi.org/10. /2020 reported that Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-associated Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) had an R0 value of approximately 2.2 to 3.6 (Lipsitch et al. 2003) . The transmission capacity of COVID-19 appeared to be similar or higher compared to SARS-CoV. As a continuous unconventional public health event that can lead to economic recession and health damage, it is of great importance to timely estimate the epidemic stage of the outbreak and determine whether it is possible to return to normal work and life. Faced with such a sudden outbreak of new infectious diseases, we have no history to learn from and no evidence to count on. The traditional epidemic prediction models, including SEIR, are highly sensitive to the pre-specified epidemiological parameters, and the prediction results may be highly inconsistent due to different assumptions and data sources. The reliability of the SEIR model can be affected by many factors that are difficult to estimate, including seasonality of coronavirus, inter-city mobility, transmission of travel behavior, and the number of asymptomatic infections. The model may underestimate the scale of the outbreak (Wu et al. 2020) . Traditional models prove to be most reliable only under ideal conditions.","Keeping the uncertainty considerations in mind (but not graphed due to clutter), Figure 4 shows results based on best-fit parameters. If our best case scenario on the reduction of contacts and benefits of seasonality for containment hold, the number of infected cases will peak soon at approximately 494,000 (90% CI: 274K-813K), and will go down later on. This optimistic scenario will still lead to over a million infections and some 58,000 deaths (90% CI: 32K-97K) by the end of June. The less aggressive scenarios point to continued spread of the epidemic. A reduction in contagion is realized only when reproduction number remains below one as a result of natural contact reduction in response to recent deaths, government interventions that reduce contacts, and seasonality. Among these three, the first (behavioral response) is endogenous to recent death rate. When death rate comes under control (due to the combination of all those factors), our model assumes the contract rate rebounds, weakening the first channel. Economic pressures, normalization of death, and behavioral modeling after the more risk seeking (or those already recovered and thus presumably immune) could all weaken the behavioral response when the perceived risks have faded. The increased contact would then, with a delay, bring up the death rate close to levels sustaining a reproduction number around or slightly above one. This creates a strong attractor in the dynamics where in steady state contact rate is high enough to sustain the contagion but not so high to lead to the rapid infection of all the population. Therefore it is only with strong weather and/or government interventions that reduced reproduction number brings the epidemic under control. This dynamic offers a cautionary tale against declaring victory early in the fight against the epidemic. However the actual magnitude of such rebound effect is not known in this setting and our data offers no guidance on the relevant parameters. Therefore these results are only qualitatively suggestive but not quantitatively reliable.","Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV). This virus is distributed worldwide and is found wherever it has been sought. It is the leading cause of bronchiolitis and the most commonly detected virus in children under 2 years of age hospitalized for lower respiratory infection (Figure 19 .2). It is estimated that half of all children are infected during the first year of life, and that by 3 years of age all have experienced at least one infection. Immunity following primary infection does not prevent secondary or subsequent infections, caused by both antigenic differences and failure of RSV to induce (persistent) neutralizing antibodies. In temperate regions, large seasonal epidemics occur annually over cold winter months, but this seasonality is more variable in the tropics (see below). Two subtypes (A and B) have been described and may co-circulate, with one usually predominating in any given year. No obvious differences in disease severity or pathogenesis have been documented between these two subtypes. 18, 19 RSV causes a substantial but variable LRTI disease burden in tropical countries. In a population-based study of infants in Kenya, it was found that RSV was common; approximately 36% of infections led to LTRI, 23% were severe and 3% of infected children were hospitalized. 20 RSV was also the most commonly detected respiratory pathogen in hospitalized children in Vietnam. 21 More recently, it has become clear that RSV causes significant morbidity in the elderly as well as in infants. 22 Human Metapneumovirus (hMPV). This virus was discovered in 2001. 23 The disease it causes, its distribution and seasonality are very similar to those of RSV. It also has two subtypes and causes infections in children under 2 years old and in the elderly. Retrospective serology, has shown that this is not a new human pathogen, but has been around for a long time. 24 severe leucopenia and lymphopenia, progressing to ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome) and multi-organ dysfunction that fail to respond to standard antibiotic therapy for pneumonia. Early diagnosis and treatment with oseltamivir are associated with a better prognosis.","Comparing and contrasting SARS-CoV-2 with the other six HCoVs reveal similarities and differences of great interest. First, the incubation period and the duration of the course of HCoV disease are very similar. In this regard, SARS-CoV-2 follows the general trend of the other six HCoVs. Second, the severity of symptoms of COVID-19 lies between SARS-CoV and the four community-acquired HCoVs (i.e. HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63). On one hand, SARS-CoV-2 infection exhibits features that are more commonly seen during infection with community-acquired HCoVs, including the presentation of non-specific, mild or even no symptoms. On the other hand, a small subset of severe cases of COVID-19 can also be seen as in the case of SARS-CoV infection, although the ratio is a bit lower. Third, the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 also shows interesting patterns characteristic of both community-acquired HCoVs and SARS-CoV. On one hand, the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 is at least as high as that of community-acquired HCoVs. On the other hand, it remains to be verified whether the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 decreases after passages in humans as in the cases of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. Finally, same as the other HCoVs 41, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in fecal samples. Whether fecal-oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2 plays an important role as in the case of SARS-CoV at least under some circumstance remains to be clarified by future studies. It is also of particularly great interest to see whether SARS-CoV-2 might exhibit seasonality as in the cases of community-acquired HCoVs. Nevertheless, the features of SARS-CoV-2 including its transmissibility, pathogenicity and sustainable spreading after passages in humans will be influential on the ultimate fate of the ongoing outbreak of COVID-19.","Kaiser Permanente (KP) is a medical care organisation (MCO) with 3.2 million members in Northern California. They have complete electronic medical records on all members. The VSD (Vaccine Safety Datalink), a collaborative project with the CDC Immunization Safety Office (ISO), is composed of 8 medical care organisations which collect medical and vaccination data on more than 5.5 million members annually. Data from these organisations is compiled to conduct studies of vaccine adverse advents. Methods: In a preliminary analysis, we looked at GBS occurring within 3, 6, or 10 weeks after vaccination, in KP NCAL members of all ages from 1994-2005. For the analysis we used a novel \"case series\"-like approach. Instead of looking at a vaccination and potential GBS in a time window related to it (the usual case series approach), we looked at all vaccinated persons with GBS, and examined the proportion of vaccinated cases that were vaccinated in the window vs. the remainder of the year. We used logistic regression to compare the proportion of vaccinated cases whose vaccination occurred in the window versus the expected assuming there is no association with the vaccine. For seasonal vaccines, like influenza, we estimate the expected odds from the proportion of vaccines given inside vs. outside the window. This new method controls for seasonality and other confounders. In this exploratory analysis of multiple vaccines and risk windows, using a novel analytical method, we found a possible increase in the risk of GBS in the 6-week period after vaccination with Td. After verification by chart review we plan to extend the analysis to the entire VSD study population. As the analytical method controlled very well for confounders, including seasonality, this model may be applicable to other vaccine safety studies. Objectives: Brucellosis is the most important common bacterial zoonoses. Various vaccines such as subunit vaccine were proposed for prevention of this disease. The immunogenic Brucella abortus ribosomal protein L7/L12 is a promising candidate antigen for the development of subunit vaccines against brucellosis. In this research, protection of recombinant HSA-L7/L12 fusion protein in Balb/c mouse was evaluated. Methods: The amplified gene was cloned in pYHSA5 vector then pYHSA5-L7/L12 construct was transformed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and expressed protein from supernatant was purified by affinity chromatography column. Balb/c mouses were immunised in four groups by HSA-L7/L12 fusion protein (group 1), Brucella abortus S19 (group 2), HSA (group 3), PBS (group 4). ELISA, LTT tests and challenging one week after last injection were carried out. Bacterial count of spleen of immunised Balb/c mouse was done one month after challenging with virulent strain B. abortus 544.","Our study has several limitations. Our use of ILI data relies on healthcare-seeking behavior which is known to be heterogeneous spatially and across age groups [15] . Additionally, we selected seasons antigenically similar to the 2019-2020 season for comparison, but the current season displayed unusually high levels of influenza B activity. Our regression analysis is limited by known factors or available data. The humidity data assumes that each US state is represented by a random weather station. We use information seeking behavior measured by Google Trends as representative of COVID-19 and flu risk perception; while past work has shown such data to be a useful proxy [18] , they are limited in aggregate and have not been fully validated. Lastly, our epidemiological model, while it captures local and global contact structures relevant to influenza transmission, models interventions and seasonality simplistically.","HRV is the predominant agent of ARI in the world and infections occur in people from all continents, including remotely located population groups, such as Bushmen from the Kalahari Desert, native Alaskans, and isolated Amazon Indian tribes. Rhinoviruses have been clearly shown as frequent cause of colds in the United States and in Western Europe and are frequently associated with ARI in children throughout the world. HRV has been estimated to cause up to 80% of all autumn colds in adults in the United States and around 50% of all respiratory infections in ambulatory children in tropical areas. Evidence suggests that indoor HRV transmission is favored by high relative humidity and crowding of young children, as occurs in the United States at the beginning of the school term, which may explain the autumn seasonal peak of HRV. In tropical regions, however, where relative humidity remains above 70%, reaching 90% during the rainy season, longitudinal studies have found no obvious HRV seasonality.","We used a deterministic (ordinary differential equation) mathematical model to simulate the transmission of SARS-CoV-2. The model is an adapted Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered (SEIR) model with three tracks (Figure S1 ) to account for individuals who are asymptomatic or have mild symptoms (95.6%), individuals who are hospitalized but do not require critical care (3.08%), and individuals who are hospitalized and require critical care (1.32%) (7) . The mean incubation period was 4.6 days, the infectious period/mean time to hospitalization was 4 days, the mean duration of non-critical hospital stay was 8 days for those not requiring critical care and 6 days for those requiring critical care, and the mean duration of critical care was 10 days (7). Seasonal forcing was incorporated by allowing the basic reproduction number (R0) to follow a cosine curve that peaks in early December (4). We varied the peak (wintertime) R0 between 2 and 2.5 and allowed the summertime R0 to vary between 70% and 100% (i.e. no seasonality) of the wintertime R0 (4).","The strength of this study is the large number of MERS-CoV patients included in the analysis, and the study identifies important factors affecting MERS-CoV viral seasonality. In agreement with previous reports [11, 13] , the study highlights the need for considering climate factors on MERS-CoV guidelines for control measures and prevention. The overall findings of the study are that the higher the temperature and ultraviolet index, the higher incidence of MERS-CoV infections, and vice versa for humidity and wind speed. However, we noted limitations in this study. A number of potential confounding factors such as patient characteristics and source of the infections were not included in our investigation. The climate data were taken retrospectively from Google reports on a monthly basis during the span in which the cases were reported. The authors were not able to assess the influence of climate factors on the source of infection, the route of transmission, or the susceptible population. The impact of climate factors on incidence of MERS-CoV in small environments such as families and hospitals can be addressed in future studies.","The authors declare no conflict of interest that are relevant for the present work. A) Viral spread is fastest in immunologically naive population at the outbreak and eventually immunity limits transmission. The success of the vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, currently being in preparation for clinical phase one trial, might be a turning point. B) Viral evolution causes adaption to their host, and trade off high virulence for a better transmissibility and lower virulence. While it is early days to predict how exactly virulence will evolve in SARS-CoV-2, its evolution is ongoing and there are indications that SARS-CoV-2 has evolved into two strains since its emergence, the ancestral S-strain and a more \"aggressive\" L-strain [6] . C) Viruses survive much easier in a cold environment, as is reflected for example in the seasonality of influenza. D) Increased and effective public health efforts are the foundation of all strategies to limit spread of the virus and contribute to ending the outbreak. As the decreasing number of cases of SARS-CoV-2 in China depicts, rigid public health methods can be very successful in containing outbreaks.","All relevant data and script that generate the graphs
