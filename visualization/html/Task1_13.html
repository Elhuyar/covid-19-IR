In light of the variable success in protecting health care workers (HCWs) from Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2003, organizational and individual factors related to self-protective behavior in health care settings may also play an important role. Methods A critical review of the literature was conducted, directed at understanding what organizational and individual factors are important in protecting HCWs from infectious diseases at work. Results Organizational factors, such as a positive safety climate, have been associated with increased HCW adherence to universal precautions. There is some evidence that appropriate training of HCWs could be effective in changing HCW behavior if appropriate follow-up is applied. Very little research into these factors has been conducted with regard to preventing exposures to respiratory tract...","ABSTRACT THE CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL and Prevention has published updated guidelines for isolation precautions that outline how health care workers can prevent the transmission of infectious agents to their patients and to themselves. THE GUIDELINES RE-EMPHASIZE standard precautions, which guide clinicians in the use of appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE), depending on the expected type of exposure. Respiratory hygiene/cough etiquette is incorporated into infection control practices as a new component of standard precautions. THE ARTICLE PROVIDES information on the new guidelines as well as information on newly emerging patho gens and methods to prevent disease transmission in health care settings.","Personal protective equipment (PPE), including surgical masks and N95 respirators, is crucially important to the safety of both patients and medical personnel, particularly in the event of infectious pandemics. As the incidence of Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) is increasing exponentially in the United States and worldwide, healthcare provider demand for these necessities is currently outpacing supply. As such, strategies to safely expand the lifespan of the supply of medical equipment are critically important. In the recent days, weeks, and months, in the midst of the current pandemic, there has been a concerted effort to identify viable ways to conserve Personal Protective Equipment, including sterilization after use. Some hospitals have already begun using UV-C light to sterilize N95 respirators, but many lack the space or equipment to implement existing protocols. In this study, we outline a procedure by which N95 respirators may be sterilized using ultraviolet (UV) radiation in bi...","Background: The overall objective of this rapid overview of reviews (overview hereafter) was to identify evidence from systematic reviews (SRs) for infection control and prevention practices for adults aged 60 years and older in long-term care settings. Methods: Comprehensive searches in MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, biorxiv.org/medrxiv.org, clinicaltrials.gov and the Global Infectious Disease Epidemiology Network (GIDEON) were carried out in early March 2020. Title/abstract and full-text screening, data abstraction, and quality appraisal (AMSTAR 2) were carried out by single reviewers. Results: A total of 6 SRs published between 1999 and 2018 were identified and included in the overview. The SRs included between 1 and 37 primary studies representing between 140 to 908 patients. All of the primary studies included in the SRs were carried out in long-term care facilities (LTCF) and examined pharmacological, non-pharmacological, or combined interventions. One high quality SR fou...","Background Transmission of Middle East respiratory syndrome-coronavirus (MERS-CoV) among health care workers (HCWs) and patients has been documented with mortality rate approximating 36%. We propose advanced infection control measures (A-IC) used in conjunction with basic infection control measures (B-IC) help reduce pathogen transmission. B-IC include standard and transmission-based precautions. A-IC are initiatives implemented within our center to enhance effectiveness of B-IC. Objective Study effectiveness of combining B-IC and A-IC to prevent transmission of MERS-CoV to HCWs. Methods A retrospective observational study was undertaken. A-IC measures include administrative support with daily rounds; infection control risk assessment; timely screening, isolation, and specimen analysis; collaboration; epidemic planning; stockpiling; implementation of contingency plans; full personal protective equipment use for advanced airway management; use of a real-time electronic isolation flaggin...","Importance A large number of healthcare workers (HCWs) were infected by SARS-CoV-2 during the ongoing outbreak of COVID-19 in Wuhan, China. Hospitals are significant epicenters for the human-to-human transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 for HCWs, patients, and visitors. No data has been reported on the details of hospital environmental contamination status in the epicenter of Wuhan. Objective To investigate the extent to which SARS-CoV-2 contaminates healthcare settings, including to identify function zones of the hospital with the highest contamination levels and to identify the most contaminated objects, and personal protection equipment (PPE) in Wuhan, China. Design A field investigation was conducted to collect the surface swabs in various environments in the hospital and a laboratory experiment was conducted to examine the presence of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Setting Six hundred twenty-six surface samples were collected within the Zhongnan Medical Center in Wuhan, China in the mist of the CO...","Abstract Background The safety of performing spinal anaesthesia for both patients and anaesthetists alike in the presence of active infection with the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is unclear. Here, we report the clinical characteristics and outcomes for both patients with COVID-19 and the anaesthetists who provided their spinal anaesthesia. Methods Forty-nine patients with radiologically confirmed COVID-19 for Caesarean section or lower-limb surgery undergoing spinal anaesthesia in Zhongnan Hospital, Wuhan, China participated in this retrospective study. Clinical characteristics and perioperative outcomes were recorded. For anaesthesiologists exposed to patients with COVID-19 by providing spinal anaesthesia, the level of personal protective equipment (PPE) used, clinical outcomes (pulmonary CT scans), and confirmed COVID-19 transmission rates (polymerase chain reaction [PCR]) were reviewed. Results Forty-nine patients with COVID-19 requiring supplementary oxygen before sur...","First, although COVID-19 is spread by the airborne route, air disinfection of cities and communities is not known to be effective for disease control and needs to be stopped. The widespread practice of spraying disinfectant and alcohol in the sky, on roads, vehicles, and personnel has no value; moreover, large quantities of alcohol and disinfectant are potentially harmful to humans and should be avoided.3 , 4 Second, in the use of personal protective equipment, we should try to distinguish different risk factors, adopt different epidemic prevention measures, and reduce the waste of personal protective equipment, as these resources are already in short supply. Although surgical masks are in widespread use by the general population, there is no evidence that these masks prevent the acquisition of COVID-19, although they might slightly reduce the spread from an infected patient. High-filtration masks such as N95 masks and protective clothing (goggles and gowns) should be used in hospitals...","BACKGROUND: Cases of emerging infectious diseases, including H5N1 influenza, H7N9 influenza, and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, have been reported in recent years, and the threat of pandemic outbreaks persists. In Japan, primary care is the frontline against emerging infectious diseases in communities. Although the importance of pandemic preparedness in primary care has been highlighted previously, few studies have thus far investigated the preparedness among primary care practices (PCPs) or differences in the preparedness of different institutional settings. We examined PCP preparedness and response to the 2009 influenza pandemic in Japan, and explored the role of a pandemic preparedness plan during the pandemic. METHODS: We used a survey questionnaire to assess how well individual PCPs in Okinawa, Japan, were prepared for the 2009 influenza pandemic. The questionnaire was mailed to all eligible PCPs (N = 465) in Okinawa, regardless of their institutional setting. In addition, we a...","The current COVID-19 pandemic has led to a dramatic shortage of masks and other personal protective equipment (PPE) in hospitals around the globe. One component of PPE that is in particular demand are disposable N95 face masks. To alleviate this, many methods of N95 mask sterilization have been studied and proposed with the hope of being able to safely reuse masks. Two major considerations must be made when re-sterilizing masks: (1) the sterilization method effectively kills pathogens, penetrating into the fibers of the mask, and (2) the method does not degrade the operational integrity of the N95 filters. We studied Cobalt-60 gamma irradiation as a method of effective sterilization without inducing mask degradation. Significant literature exists supporting the use of gamma radiation as a sterilization method, with viral inactivation of SARS-CoV reported at doses of at most 10 kGy, with other studies supporting 5 kGy for many types of viruses. However, concerns have been raised about t...","","Abstract We argue that enhanced Traffic Control Bundling (eTCB) can interrupt the community-hospital-community transmission cycle, thereby limiting COVID-19\u2019s impact. Enhanced TCB is an expansion of the traditional TCB that proved highly effective during Taiwan\u2019s 2003 SARS outbreak. TCB\u2019s success derived from ensuring that Health Care Workers (HCWs) and patients were protected from fomite, contact and droplet transmission within hospitals. Although TCB proved successful during SARS, achieving a similar level of success with the COVID-19 outbreak requires adapting TCB to the unique manifestations of this new disease. These manifestations include asymptomatic infection, a hyper-affinity to ACE2 receptors resulting in high transmissibility, false negatives, and an incubation period of up to 22 days. Enhanced TCB incorporates the necessary adaptations. In particular, eTCB includes expanding the TCB transition zone to incorporate a new sector \u2013 the quarantine ward. This ward houses patients...","ABSTRACT Within weeks, COVID-19 has transformed our practice of palliative care and clinical medicine as we know it. Telemedicine has emerged as a critical technology to bring medical care to patients while attempting to reduce the transmission of COVID-19 among patients, families, and clinicians. It is also increasingly necessary to preserve scarce resources like personal protective equipment. In this article, we share just-in-time tips to support palliative care clinicians and program leaders in providing the best care possible by telemedicine. These quick, practical tips cover telemedicine set-up, patient considerations, and clinician considerations. Next steps include ensuring equitable access to affordable telemedicine technology for vulnerable populations through creative solutions and financing, and dedicated attention to telemedicine evaluation and quality improvement.","A possible threat in the ophthalmology clinic While the 2019-nCoV transmission route is still unknown, countries have been preparing measures based on past experiences with coronaviruses namely SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. These viruses transmit primarily through droplets and other bodily secretions. In the ophthalmology practice, healthcare workers may be particularly susceptible to these infections. Firstly, ophthalmologists are extremely reliant on physical examination during patient consultation. Of particular concern is the proximity between the patient and ophthalmologist during the slit lamp microscope examination. It has been shown that droplets from a cough or sneeze can be propelled for up to 6?m [8], a range that definitely encompasses the distance between the patient and ophthalmologist. Secondly, during the SARS-CoV epidemic, clinical reports have suggested tears as a medium of infection. In a case series by Loon et al., it was shown that viral RNA of the SARS-CoV can be detecte...","Background: The overall objective of this rapid review was to identify infection protection and control recommendations from published clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) for adults aged 60 years and older in long-term care settings Methods: Comprehensive searches in MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, and relevant CPG publishers/repositories were carried out in early March 2020. Title/abstract and full-text screening, data abstraction, and quality appraisal (AGREE-II) were carried out by single reviewers. Results: A total of 17 relevant CPGs were identified, published in the USA (n=8), Canada (n=6), Australia (n=2), and the United Kingdom (n=1). All of the CPGs dealt with infection control in long-term care facilities (LTCF) and addressed various types of viral respiratory infections (e.g., influenza, COVID-19, severe acute respiratory syndrome). Ten or more CPGs recommended the following infection control measures in LTCF: hand hygiene (n=13), wearing personal protective equipment...","The number of confirmed COVID-19 cases admitted in hospitals is continuously increasing in the Philippines. Frontline health care workers are faced with imminent risks of getting infected. In this study, we formulate a theoretical model to calculate the risk of being infected in health care facilities considering the following factors: the average number of encounters with a suspected COVID-19 patient per hour; interaction time for each encounter; work shift duration or exposure time; crowd density, which may depend on the amount of space available in a given location; and availability and effectiveness of protective gears and facilities provided for the frontline health care workers. Based on the simulation results, we recommend the following: (i) decrease the rate of patient encounter per frontline health care worker, e.g., maximum of three encounters per hour in a 12-hour work shift duration; (ii) decrease the interaction time between the frontline health care worker and the patient...","Abstract The World has changed dramatically since the COVID-19 pandemic began. Together with our social, occupational, and personal life, the new corona virus poses novel challenges for all physicians, including dermatologists. Despite the virus not being dermatotropic, several skin conditions have emerged, mainly as a result of prolonged contact to personal protective equipment and excessive personal hygiene. Pressure injury, contact dermatitis, itch, pressure urticaria, and exacerbation of pre-existing skin diseases, including seborrheic dermatitis and acne, have been described. We have focused on the dermatologic aspects of COVID-19 infection, so that dermatologist may be aware of the skin complications and the preventive measures to be taken in the COVID-19 pandemic.","Background Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is a novel coronavirus that causes a severe respiratory disease with high case fatality rate. Starting in March 2014, a dramatic increase of cases has occurred in the Arabian Peninsula, many of which were acquired in health care settings. As of May 9, 2014, 536 laboratory-confirmed cases and 145 deaths have been reported globally. Methods Review of publicly available data about MERS-CoV health care\u2013associated transmission. Results We identified 11 events of possible or confirmed health care\u2013associated transmission with high morbidity and mortality, mainly among patients with comorbidities. Health care workers are also frequently affected; however, they tend to have milder symptoms and better prognosis. Gaps in infection control were noted in all events. Currently, health care\u2013associated outbreaks are playing a pivotal role in the evolution of the MERS-CoV epidemic in countries in the Arabian Peninsula. Conclusion There ...","In a patient with acute respiratory illness (cough, sputum production, chest pain, and/or dyspnea), the need for chest imaging depends on the severity of illness, age of the patient, clinical history, physical and laboratory findings, and other risk factors. Chest radiographs seem warranted when one or more of the following are present: age \u2265 40; dementia; a positive physical examination; hemoptysis; associated abnormalities (leukocytosis, hypoxemia); or other risk factors, including coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, or drug-induced acute respiratory failure. Chest CT may be warranted in complicated cases of severe pneumonia and in febrile neutropenic patients with normal or nonspecific chest radiographic findings. Literature on the indications and usefulness of radiologic studies for acute respiratory illness in different clinical settings is reviewed.","Background The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was first reported in China, which caused a respiratory disease known as Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). Since its discovery, the virus has spread to over 100 countries and claimed more than 4000 deaths. This study aimed to assess the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of various response public health measures. Method The stochastic agent-based model was used to simulate the process of COVID-19 outbreak in scenario I (imported one case) and II (imported four cases) with a series of public health measures, involving the personal protection, isolation-and-quarantine, gathering restriction, and community containment. The virtual community was constructed following the susceptible-latent-infectious-recovered framework. The epidemiological and economic parameters derived from the previous literature and field investigation. The main outcomes included avoided infectors, cost-effectiveness ratios (CERs), and i...","Abstract Background The novel coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19), which was first detected in Wuhan City, has now became a pandemic that affecting patients around the world. Particularly, the community patient population are at high risk of infection and are facing potential failure of proper medication use during the pandemic. Objective To discuss community pharmacists\u2019 role and the content of pharmaceutical care (PC) during the novel coronavirus pandemic to promote effective prevention and control and safe drug use of the community patient population. Method Collect and summarize the experience Chinese community pharmacies gained from providing pharmacy services during the COVID-19 outbreak, and taking the PC needs into consideration, analyze and discuss the methods and strategies that community pharmacies and pharmacists shall use to provide PC during the pandemic. Results Community pharmacy management teams shall support PC services by providing adequate supply of COVID-19 related me...","Abstract This document outlines recommendations for physiotherapy management for COVID-19 in the acute hospital setting. It includes: recommendations for physiotherapy workforce planning and preparation; a screening tool for determining requirement for physiotherapy; and recommendations for the selection of physiotherapy treatments and personal protective equipment. It is intended for use by physiotherapists and other relevant stakeholders in the acute care setting caring for adult patients with suspected and/or confirmed COVID-19.","Fifteen years ago, United Nations world leaders defined millenium development goal 4 (MDG 4): to reduce under-5-year mortality rates by two-thirds by the year 2015. Unfortunately, only 27 of 138 developing countries are expected to achieve MDG 4. The majority of childhood deaths in these settings result from reversible causes, and developing effective pediatric emergency and critical care services could substantially reduce this mortality. The Ebola outbreak highlighted the fragility of health care systems in resource-limited settings and emphasized the urgent need for a paradigm shift in the global approach to healthcare delivery related to critical illness. This review provides an overview of pediatric critical care in resource-limited settings and outlines strategies to address challenges specific to these areas. Implementation of these tools has the potential to move us toward delivery of an adequate standard of critical care for all children globally, and ultimately decrease globa...","In late December 2019, a previous unidentified coronavirus, currently named as the 2019 novel coronavirus#, emerged from Wuhan, China, and resulted in a formidable outbreak in many cities in China and expanded globally, including Thailand, Republic of Korea, Japan, United States, Philippines, Viet Nam, and our country (as of 2/6/2020 at least 25 countries). The disease is officially named as Coronavirus Disease-2019 (COVID-19, by WHO on February 11, 2020). It is also named as Severe Pneumonia with Novel Pathogens on January 15, 2019 by the Taiwan CDC, the Ministry of Health and is a notifiable communicable disease of the fifth category. COVID-19 is a potential zoonotic disease with low to moderate (estimated 2%-5%) mortality rate. Person-to-person transmission may occur through droplet or contact transmission and if there is a lack of stringent infection control or if no proper personal protective equipment available, it may jeopardize the first-line healthcare workers. Currently, ther...","Over the past several decades, we have witnessed the emergence of many new infectious agents, some of which are major public threats. New and emerging infectious diseases which are both transmissible from patient-to-patient and virulent with a high mortality include novel coronaviruses (SARS-CoV, MERS-CV), hemorrhagic fever viruses (Lassa, Ebola), and highly pathogenic avian influenza A viruses, A(H5N1) and A(H7N9). All healthcare facilities need to have policies and plans in place for early identification of patients with a highly communicable diseases which are highly virulent, ability to immediately isolate such patients, and provide proper management (e.g., training and availability of personal protective equipment) to prevent transmission to healthcare personnel, other patients and visitors to the healthcare facility.","Abstract Introduction Rapid worldwide spread of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has resulted in a global pandemic. Objective This review article provides emergency physicians with an overview of the most current understanding of COVID-19 and recommendations on the evaluation and management of patients with suspected COVID-19. Discussion Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus responsible for causing COVID-19, is primarily transmitted from person-to-person through close contact (approximately 6 ft) by respiratory droplets. Symptoms of COVID-19 are similar to other viral upper respiratory illnesses. Three major trajectories include mild disease with upper respiratory symptoms, non-severe pneumonia, and severe pneumonia complicated by acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Emergency physicians should focus on identifying patients at risk, isolating suspected patients, and informing hospital infection prevention and public health authorities. Patien...","Summary Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) emerged recently as a new infectious disease that was transmitted efficiently in the healthcare setting and particularly affected healthcare workers (HCWs), patients and visitors. The efficiency of transmission within healthcare facilities was recognised following significant hospital outbreaks of SARS in Canada, China, Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan and Vietnam. The causative agent of SARS was identified as a novel coronavirus, the SARS coronavirus. This was largely spread by direct or indirect contact with large respiratory droplets, although airborne transmission has also been reported. High infection rates among HCWs led initially to the theory that SARS was highly contagious and the concept of \u2018super-spreading events\u2019. Such events illustrated that lack of infection control (IC) measures or failure to comply with IC precautions could lead to large-scale hospital outbreaks. SARS was eventually contained by the stringent application of I...","Background: Controlling the transmission of respiratory infections such as influenza and COVID-19 is a critical public health priority. Non-pharmaceutical intervention policies such as community quarantines, closures and travel bans are often implemented in emergencies but many of them are disruptive and difficult to maintain for extended periods of time. A promising alternative recommended by the CDC for influenza is requiring individuals showing fever symptoms to remain isolated at home until they are fever-free for at least one day, but there is limited evidence to support the effectiveness of such symptom-based isolation policies. Methods: Here we introduce a computational model of symptom-based isolation that accounts for the timing of symptoms, viral shedding and the population structure. It was validated on outbreaks of influenza in schools and modified to account for COVID-19. It was then used to estimate the outbreak curves and the attack rates (the proportion of the populatio...","Background Despite available recommendations on infection control for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), information is limited on actual practices in Asian hospitals during the epidemic. We describe practices observed by mobile SARS containment teams (mobile teams) during outbreak investigations. Methods We retrospectively summarized infection control practices observed in hospitals visited by mobile teams in the Lao People's Democratic Republic (PDR), Taiwan, and Thailand, during March and April 2003. Results Mobile teams investigated 22 reports of SARS in 20 hospitals (1, 5, and 14 hospitals in Lao PDR, Taiwan, and Thailand, respectively). Facilities ranged from urban hospitals with negative-pressure isolation rooms and high-efficiency particulate air filtration to rural hospitals with patient rooms open to outside air circulation and intermittent running water. At the time of mobile team visits, 5 (25%) hospitals implemented infection control practices consistent with World ...","The Diamond Princess (DP) cruise ship was put under quarantine offshore Yokohama, Japan, after a passenger who disembarked in Hong Kong was confirmed as a COVID-19 case. We performed whole genome sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 directly from PCR-positive clinical specimens and conducted a haplotype network analysis of the outbreak. All tested isolates exhibited a transversion at G11083T, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 dissemination on the DP originated from a single introduction event before the quarantine started. Although further spreading might have been prevented by quarantine, some progeny clusters were linked to transmission through mass-gathering events in the recreational areas and direct transmission among passengers who shared cabins during the quarantine. This study demonstrates the usefulness of haplotype network analysis in identifying potential infection routes.","Summary Background We investigated the temporal progression of the clinical, radiological, and virological changes in a community outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). Methods We followed up 75 patients for 3 weeks managed with a standard treatment protocol of ribavirin and corticosteroids, and assessed the pattern of clinical disease, viral load, risk factors for poor clinical outcome, and the usefulness of virological diagnostic methods. Findings Fever and pneumonia initially improved but 64 (85%) patients developed recurrent fever after a mean of 8.9 (SD 3.1) days, 55 (73%) had watery diarrhoea after 7.5 (2.3) days, 60 (80%) had radiological worsening after 7.4 (2.2) days, and respiratory symptoms worsened in 34 (45%) after 8.6 (3.0) days. In 34 (45%) patients, improvement of initial pulmonary lesions was associated with appearance of new radiological lesions at other sites. Nine (12%) patients developed spontaneous pneumomediastinum and 15 (20%) developed acute resp...","Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) not only paralysed economic activities in SARS-affected cities, it also affected sporting activities. SARS was identified in Hong Kong in late February 2003 and the WHO issued a global alert on 12 March, 2003. The incubation period of SARS is usually 4\u20136 days and patients commonly present with high fever (temperature &gt;38\u00b0C), dry cough, chills and rigor, dyspnoea and diarrhoea. Although a specific antiviral agent and vaccines for SARS are not available at the time of writing, a standard treatment protocol for SARS has been developed. The average mortality rate is about 16% in Hong Kong. The coronavirus is a common pathogen for upper respiratory tract infection and is the most probable pathogen for SARS. Transmission methods may, therefore, be similar for both these infections. Transmission is possible when aerosolised viral particles come into contact with the susceptible host\u2019s mucous membrane, most commonly the nose, but also the mouth and eyes...","The impact of COVID-19 pandemic on the global health and world's economy have been profound and unseen since the Spanish flu of 1918-19. As of now, many countries have been severely affected, partly because of slow responses to the crisis, ill-preparedness of their health system, and the fragile health infrastructure and the shortage of protective equipment. This note evaluates various scenarios, based on an estimation of number of identified and unidentified infected cases, and examines the effectiveness of different policy responses to contain this pandemic. Our result, based on an estimation of the model for Iran, show that in many instances the number of unidentified cases, including asymptomatic individuals, could be much bigger than the reported numbers. The results confirm that in such circumstances, social distancing alone cannot be an effective policy unless a large portion of the population confine themselves for an extended period of time, which is not only difficult to impl...","Abstract Timeliness is a critical issue in preventing the spread of emerging/notifiable infectious diseases, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) or avian influenza (bird flu). Current computerized surveillance systems in many countries have demonstrated their usefulness in detecting specified communicable-diseases. However, the off-line, daily or weekly data reporting mode induces a time lag in data collection, transmission, processing, and responses. This paper proposes an on-line real-time mechanism, named EDICTS, for emerging/notifiable infectious diseases control, tracking and surveillance. It is based on the on-line health IC card system and works at the registration process of primary care practices and emergency departments. Hence, should a disease defined by CDC (Center for disease control) be detected at the registration station, EDICTS responds in real time. Note that EDICTS is a mechanism; it is CDC that determines the policy and activates it. A prototype is des...","Italy recorded its first case of confirmed acute respiratory illness because of coronavirus on February 18, 2020, soon after the initial reports in China. Since that time, Italy and nations throughout the world have adopted very stringent and severe measures to protect populations from spread of infection. Despite these measures, the number of infected people is growing exponentially, with a significant number of patients developing acute respiratory insufficiency. Endoscopy departments face significant risk for diffusion of respiratory diseases that can be spread via an airborne route, including aspiration of oral and fecal material via endoscopes. The purpose of this article is to discuss the measures, with specific focus on personal protection equipment and dress code modalities, implemented in our hospital to prevent further dissemination of COVID-19 infection.","Background: Community responses are important for outbreak management during the early phase when non-pharmaceutical interventions are the major preventive options. Therefore, this study aims to examine the psychological and behavioral responses of the community during the early phase of the COVID-19 epidemic in Hong Kong. Method: A cross-sectional online survey was launched within 36 hours after confirmed COVID-19 cases were first reported. Councilors of all 452 district council constituency areas were approached for survey dissemination. Respondent demographics, anxiety level, risk perception, sources to retrieve COVID-19 information, actual adoption and perceived efficacy of precautionary measures were collected. Result: Analysis from 1715 complete responses indicated high perceived susceptibility (89%) and high perceived severity (97%). Most respondents were worried about COVID-19 (97%), and had their daily routines disrupted (slightly/greatly: 98%). The anxiety level, measured by ...","Estimates suggest that COVID-19 will stress bed capacity, equipment, and health care personnel in U.S. hospitals in ways not previously experienced. How can health systems prepare to care for a large influx of patients with this disease?","Abstract The current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia pandemic, caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus, is spreading globally at an accelerated rate, with a basic reproduction number (R0) of 2 \u2013 2.5, indicating that 2 \u2013 3 persons will be infected from an index patient. A serious public health emergency, it is particularly deadly in vulnerable populations and communities in which healthcare providers are insufficiently prepared to manage the infection. As of March 16, 2020, there are more than 180,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19 worldwide, with over 7,000 related deaths. The SARS-CoV-2 virus has been isolated from asymptomatic individuals, and affected patients continue to be infectious two weeks after cessation of symptoms. The substantial morbidity and socioeconomic impact have necessitated drastic measures across all continents, including nationwide lockdowns and border closures. Pregnant women and their fetuses represent a high-risk populat...","Surveillance is essential for communicable disease prevention and control. Traditional notification of demographic and clinical information, about individuals with selected (notifiable) infectious diseases, allows appropriate public health action and is protected by public health and privacy legislation, but is slow and insensitive. Big data\u2013based electronic surveillance, by commercial bodies and government agencies (for profit or population control), which draws on a plethora of internet- and mobile device\u2013based sources, has been widely accepted, if not universally welcomed. Similar anonymous digital sources also contain syndromic information, which can be analysed, using customised algorithms, to rapidly predict infectious disease outbreaks, but the data are nonspecific and predictions sometimes misleading. However, public health authorities could use these online sources, in combination with de-identified personal health data, to provide more accurate and earlier warning of infectio...","BACKGROUND: Strategies are urgently needed to mitigate the risk of zoonotic disease emergence in southern China, where pathogens with zoonotic potential are known to circulate in wild animal populations. However, the risk factors leading to emergence are poorly understood, which presents a challenge in developing appropriate mitigation strategies for local communities. METHODS: Residents in rural communities of Yunnan, Guangxi and Guangdong provinces were recruited and enrolled in this study. Data were collected through ethnographic interviews and field observations, and thematically coded and analysed to identify both risk and protective factors for zoonotic disease emergence at the individual, community and policy levels. RESULTS: Eighty-eight ethnographic interviews and 55 field observations were conducted at nine selected sites. Frequent human\u2013animal interactions and low levels of environmental biosecurity in local communities were identified as risks for zoonotic disease emergence...","OBJECTIVE: To assess the public health risk to Singapore posed by the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) outbreak in the Republic of Korea in 2015. METHODS: The likelihood of importation of MERS cases and the magnitude of the public health impact in Singapore were assessed to determine overall risk. Literature on the epidemiology and contextual factors associated with MERS coronavirus infection was collected and reviewed. Connectivity between the Republic of Korea and Singapore was analysed. Public health measures implemented by the two countries were reviewed. RESULTS: The epidemiology of the 2015 MERS outbreak in the Republic of Korea remained similar to the MERS outbreaks in Saudi Arabia. In addition, strong infection control and response measures were effective in controlling the outbreak. In view of the air traffic between Singapore and MERS-affected areas, importation of MERS cases into Singapore is possible. Nonetheless, the risk of a serious public health impact to Singapo...","Respiratory protection against airborne pathogens is crucial for pandemic/epidemic preparedness in the context of personal protection, healthcare systems, and governance. We expect that the development of technologies that overcome the existing challenges in current respiratory protective devices will lead to a timely and effective response to the next outbreak.","A new Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Confirmed-Removed (SEICR) model with consideration of intercity travel and active intervention is proposed for predicting the spreading progression of the 2019 New Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19). The model takes into account the known or reported number of infected cases being fewer than the actual number of infected individuals due to insufficient testing. The model integrates intercity travel data to track the movement of exposed and infected individuals among cities, and allows different levels of active intervention to be considered so that realistic prediction of the number of infected individuals can be performed. The data of the COVID-19 infection cases and the intercity travel data for Japan (January 15 to March 20, 2020) and the USA (February 20 to March 20, 2020) are used to illustrate the prediction of the pandemic progression in 47 regions of Japan and 50 states (plus a federal district) in the USA. By fitting the model with the data, we r...","Background: So far, the psychological impact of COVID-19 epidemic among family members of Health care workers (HCWs) in China has been neglected. The present cross-sectional study aimed to investigate the mental health status and related factors of families of HCWs in Designated Hospitals in Ningbo, China. Method: Family members of HCWs working in five designated hospitals in Ningbo, China were recruited between February 10th and 20th, 2020. Information on demographic variables, the COVID-19-related events in the lives, knowledge of COVID-19 and the working status of family members (that is, HCWs) was collected using online self-administered questionnaires. The mental health status were assessed using the Chinese version of Patient Health Questionnare-9 (PHQ-9) and Chinese version of Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7 ). Multivariable logistic regression analyses were conducted to identify the main factors associated with the mental health conditions. Results: A total of 822 partici...","Abstract Lim PA, Ng YS, Tay BK. Impact of a viral respiratory epidemic on the practice of medicine and rehabilitation: severe acute respiratory syndrome. Arch Phys Med Rehabil 2004;85:1365\u201370. Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a new respiratory viral epidemic that originated in China but has affected many parts of the world, with devastating impact on economies and the practice of medicine and rehabilitation. A novel coronavirus has been implicated, with transmission through respiratory droplets. Rehabilitation was significantly affected by SARS, because strict infection control measures run counter to principles such as multidisciplinary interactions, patients encouraging and learning from each other, and close physical contact during therapy. Immunocompromised patients who may silently carry SARS are common in rehabilitation and include those with renal failure, diabetes, and cancer. Routine procedures such as management of feces and respiratory secretions (eg, airway sucti...","The 2009 influenza A (H1N1) pandemic highlighted the importance of quality hospital care of the severely ill, yet there is evidence that the impact of the 2009 pandemic was highest in low\u2010 and middle\u2010income countries with fewer resources. Recent data indicate that death and suffering from seasonal influenza and severe illness in general are increased in resource\u2010limited settings. However, there are limited clinical data and guidelines for the management of influenza and other severe illness in these settings. Life\u2010saving supportive care through syndromic case management is used successfully in high\u2010resource intensive care units and in global programs such as the Integrated Management of Childhood Illness (IMCI). While there are a variety of challenges to the management of the severely ill in resource\u2010limited settings, several new international initiatives have begun to develop syndromic management strategies for these environments, including the World Health Organization's Integrated M...","Abstract Background The objective of the study was to investigate the effectiveness of non-pharmacological interventions in preventing cases of influenza requiring hospitalization. Methods We performed a multicenter case-control study in 36 hospitals, in 2010 in Spain. Hospitalized influenza cases confirmed by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction and three matched controls (two hospital and one community control) per case were selected. The use of non-pharmacological measures seven days before the onset of symptoms (frequency of hand washing, use of alcohol-based hand sanitizers and handwashing after touching contaminated surfaces) was collected. Results We studied 813 cases hospitalized for influenza and 2274 controls. The frequency of hand washing 5-10 times (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]=0.65) and &gt;10 times (aOR=0.59) and handwashing after contact with contaminated surfaces (aOR=0.65) were protective factors and were dose-responsive (p&lt;0.001). Alcohol-based hand sanitizers we...","BACKGROUND: Viral epidemics or pandemics of acute respiratory infections like influenza or severe acute respiratory syndrome pose a global threat. Antiviral drugs and vaccinations may be insufficient to prevent their spread. OBJECTIVES: To review the effectiveness of physical interventions to interrupt or reduce the spread of respiratory viruses. SEARCH METHODS: We searched The Cochrane Library, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2010, Issue 3), which includes the Acute Respiratory Infections Group's Specialised Register, MEDLINE (1966 to October 2010), OLDMEDLINE (1950 to 1965), EMBASE (1990 to October 2010), CINAHL (1982 to October 2010), LILACS (2008 to October 2010), Indian MEDLARS (2008 to October 2010) and IMSEAR (2008 to October 2010). SELECTION CRITERIA: In this update, two review authors independently applied the inclusion criteria to all identified and retrieved articles and extracted data. We scanned 3775 titles, excluded 3560 and retrieved full pape...","School closures have been enacted as a measure of mitigation during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic due to their ability to reduce transmission. It has been shown that school closures could cause absenteeism amongst healthcare workers with dependent children, but there is a need for detailed high-resolution analysis of the relationship between school closures and healthcare worker absenteeism to inform local community preparedness. We provide national- and county-level simulations of school closures and absenteeism across the United States. At the national level, we estimate the projected absenteeism rate to range from 7.5% to 8.6%, and the effectiveness of school closures to range from 172 to 218 fewer hospital beds used per 100,000 people at peak demand. At the county-level, we find substantial variations of projected absenteeism and school closure effects, ranging from 2.0% to 18.6% absenteeism and 88 to 280 fewer hospital beds used per 100,000 people at peak demand. We also find sign...","Summary Objective To review the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic in Beijing using basic epidemiological principles omitted from the original analysis. Study design Analysis of Prospective surveillance data for Beijing collected during the outbreak. Methods Surveillance data were reclassified according to World Health Organization criteria. Cases previously excluded without date of onset of illness were included in the epidemic curve from estimates using the average time between date of onset and date of hospitalization for cases with both dates. Cases who failed to give a contact history were now included; 7% ( n = 5 ) of cases during the import phase and 61% ( n = 365 ) during the peak phase. Previously excluded cases were included for plotting on an epidemic curve, and basic spot mapping for distribution of cases was used from attack rates recalculated for age, gender, occupation, residential location, date of onset of illness and demographics.

Literature searches were conducted in 5 databases (Medline, EMBASE, CINAHL, Web of Science, and OSHROM) for articles published in English in the last 15 years that related to infection control practices, occupational health and safety issues, and environmental factors and other issues of importance in protecting workers against infections in health care settings. This produced an initial list of 841 publications. From the initial literature search results, a series of research topics were developed under 3 broad categories: (1) basic science and efficacy of facial protective equipment, (2) the effectiveness of specific infection control procedures, and (3) organizational and individual factors that influence infection control and occupational health in health care settings.","Recommendation 1: In health care workers performing upper GI procedures, regardless of COVID-19 status*, the AGA recommends use of N95 (or N99, or PAPR) masks instead of surgical masks, as part of appropriate personal protective equipment (Strong recommendation, moderate certainty of evidence) Recommendation 2: In health care workers performing lower GI procedures, regardless of COVID-19 status*, the AGA recommends the use of N95 (or N99 or PAPR) masks instead of surgical masks as part of appropriate personal protective equipment. (Strong recommendation, low certainty of evidence) Recommendation 3: In health care workers performing any GI procedure, in known or presumptive COVID-19 patients, the AGA recommends against the use of surgical masks only, as part of adequate personal protective equipment (Strong recommendation, low certainty of evidence) *These recommendations assume the absence of widespread reliable and accurate rapid testing for the diagnosis of COVID-19 infection or immunity Summary of the Evidence Our systematic literature search did not identify any studies that provided direct evidence to inform our clinical questions for PPE in COVID-19. However, several studies from the SARS outbreak were identified that provide indirect evidence. The SARS outbreak reinforced the vital role of PPE in protecting health care workers from occupationally acquired infection. We used data from two existing systematic reviews by Offeddu 2017 and Tran 2012 to inform our recommendations. 58, 59 First, the systematic reviews by Offeddu et al included a meta-analysis of 3 observational studies that showed a benefit in using N95 respirators over standard masks in protecting health care workers from SARS (OR = 0.86; 95% CI: 0. 22 Table 4B ). Second, a systematic review from Tran et al revealed an increased risk of viral transmission in health care workers performing aerosol-generating procedures (mostly bronchoscopy or tracheal intubation). 59 (Supplemental Figure 3 ). Zamora and colleagues investigated the amount of contamination on the neck and face from individuals using a PAPR mask (in combination with N95) compared with a N95 mask alone 60 ; Individuals who used the PAPR-based strategy experienced a lower risk of face and neck contamination compared to N95 mask alone (RR = 0.08; 95% CI: 0.03-0.19). See Evidence Profile Table 5 , Supplemental Figure 4 . Limitations of these studies include small numbers of health care workers, and data on tracheal intubation or bronchoscopy, not GI endoscopy.","Preventing respiratory illness in long-term care facilities: One high quality SR found mixed results for the effectiveness of hand hygiene to prevent infection with 2 studies reporting statistically significant positive results in favour of hand hygiene and 1 study reporting nonstatistically significant results. One moderate quality SR with meta-analysis found a moderate non-statistically significant effect in favour of personal protective equipment (PPE) in preventing infection. The same SR and meta-analysis also examined the effectiveness of social isolation to prevent infection and found no statistically significant results. One moderate quality SR reported statically significant evidence for the effectiveness of amantadine and amantadine + PPE to prevent the spread of viral respiratory infections in long-term care facilities.","In less than four months, the outbreak has rapidly escalated from a World Health In the midst of this chaotic pandemic, the health care systems and its providers are endangered. In particular, front-line health care workers -emergency medicine physicians, intensivists, anesthesiologists, nurses, and many others -have continued to care for massive surges of COVID-19 patients in the setting of health systems illprepared for the level of disease severity with dangerous, worldwide shortages of personal protective equipment (PPE) and protocols that might attenuate health worker risk overwhelmed. Over 9,000 health care workers have developed infection internationally including 3,400 in China and over 6, 200 in Italy, as well as hundreds of infections in United States personnel. 4 During this time of a global health emergency, rapid communication, international collaboration, and transparency are critical to better inform and adapt the guidance of precautionary measures when new evidence becomes available. Countries around the world have responded in different ways in managing risk to ophthalmologists and patients in the absence of signs or symptoms of COVID-19. Preparedness through risk mitigation strategies for the public, patient and providers are warranted and should be informed by available evidence and our collective, global experience. The gaps in evidence that we face also need to be addressed during this pandemic to guide international consensus and inform preparedness measures for future outbreaks. Limiting ambulatory care services to time-sensitive or urgent conditions, particularly in high-volume specialties such as ophthalmology, have also been recommended to reduce the potential for transmission in the community and physician offices. However, measures within the clinic are also needed to mitigate risk for patients with urgent or emergent complaints, and routine evaluations as the outbreak abates.","Overall, the results of the included systematic reviews suggest that high quality evidence supports treating residents with antiviral chemoprophylaxis with adamantine, as well as adamantine in combination with personal protective equipment. For the rest of the strategies, there was either no evidence of effectiveness (e.g., social isolation) or mixed evidence of effectiveness (e.g., rimantadine, zanamivir, hand hygiene, personal protective equipment). The mixed evidence on hand hygiene and use of personal protective equipment does not imply these should not be used in outbreaks.","Personal protective equipment (PPE) is worn to reduce exposure to hazards that cause workplace injuries and illnesses. PPE may include gloves, goggles, face shields, gowns, and respiratory protective equipment. 15 One of the most important pieces of protective equipment is the facemask, whose primary function is to keep respiratory particles from the source such as splashes, saliva, or mucus from contaminating the work environment. Medical or surgical facial masks are defined as loose-fitting, disposable devices that create a physical barrier between the mouth and nose of the wearer and potential contaminants in the immediate environment. The standard facial mask may be effective in blocking splashes and large-particle droplets but by design does not filter or block very small particles in the air that may be transmitted by coughs, sneezes, or certain medical procedures and does not provide complete protection from germs and other contaminants.","Many authors have noted with concern that some HCWs acquired SARS when wearing what should have been adequate PPE 11 and have called for the use of PPE with better efficacy versus airborne particles. 62 However, in light of the wide variation in organizational factors that exist in health care settings, we feel that a closer examination of these factors is warranted before concluding that these breakthrough events were due to inadequate equipment. Some attitudes such as the use of PPE interfering with patient interactions and the discomfort associated with PPE use may not change until less obtrusive and more comfortable equipment is developed. In this regard, the use of PPE with higher protection factors, but which is less comfortable, may ultimately result in less protection for HCWs. Clearly, concerns regarding field effectiveness must be considered when recommendations are made for the use of specific PPE.","Subsequently, the patient to be transferred back to an isolated room as an inpatient. During treatment, the patient and involved staff will need to don appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE). These may include N95 respirators, surgical masks and gloves depending on institutional policy, available resources and procedural risks. Appropriate high dusting cleaning of the linac room is done on completion of treatment. (Table 1) 1. Be proactive in anticipating and planning for the impact of COVID-19 2. Engage and coordinate with the parent institution in formulating policies for identifying patients at risk or who are already infected and contextualizing these to the department during implementation 3. Reduce clinical load where possible in anticipation of depletion of resources. This may involve temporarily reducing frequency of follow-up appointments, reducing fractionation schedules where possible, and considering alternative treatment modalities apart from radiotherapy that achieves the same therapeutic goals. 4. Employ staff segregation either spatially or temporally to reduce risk of the entire service succumbing to infection or quarantine. Special attention needs to be paid to \"bottleneck\" personnel (e.g. physicists) where redundancy cannot be built in. 5. Prepare for the possibility of a COVID-19 patient requiring treatment. Plan in advance which indications warrant emergency radiotherapy treatment when proven infectious or merely suspected, what personal protective equipment is required, and how to decontaminate the facility after treatment.","An N95 mask, when fitted correctly, blocks 95% of 0.3 micron particles, and provides an important barrier against disease transmission as part of a healthcare provider's personal protective equipment (PPE). Unfortunately, a shortage of N95 masks globally amidst the COVID-19 pandemic [1] has forced healthcare providers in hard hit areas to use a single mask for hours or days at time-or simply go without adequate personal protective equipment (PPE) [8, 9] .","No co-exposed person was identified for Case 1. Two contacts were evaluated at low risk of infection, the taxi driver who drove the case from the airport to his home (30-min drive) and the general practitioner who took care of the patient before wearing appropriate personal protection equipment (3-min non-close contact). Seventeen contacts were evaluated at moderate/high risk of infection. Four of them shared the same waiting room in the general practitioner\u2019s office while Case 1 was coughing, seated ca 1\u20131.5 m away from the case during 5\u201330 min. The other 13 contacts were the persons sitting in the two seats around Case 1 in the Shanghai\u2013Paris and Paris\u2013Bordeaux flights (Figure). They were considered at moderate risk of exposure despite the fact that Case 1 reported wearing a mask during the whole flight; this was based on the length of one of the flights (&gt; 6 h) and the fact that it was unclear whether or not Case 1 removed his mask during short periods (e.g. meals) and kept the same mask during the whole flights. None of the contacts of the Shanghai\u2013Paris flight were French nationals and their contact tracing was referred to their home countries\u2019 health authorities. All other identified contacts were evaluated at negligible risk of infection because the contacts were short and/or distant in public settings and did not imply face-to-face conversations or because appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) was worn by the healthcare personnel who took care of the patient, including those involved in the transfer from the general practitioner to the referring hospital.","The open-circuit system is less complex than the closed-circuit system, requiring fewer parts and having fewer backflow issues. While the expired air is filtered before being vented through the expiratory limb, the high aerosolization risk of a virus such as COVID-19 may present a contamination risk to other patients and healthcare personnel. Thus, a closed-circuit system may be preferred in some settings. However, in settings where multiple patients are cohorted in a single, large space, where healthcare providers continuously wear full personal protective equipment (PPE), the preference for a closed-circuit (dual limb) ventilator may not apply. In these settings it may be preferable to use single limb devices for their simplicity. The iSAVE is intended to be used in a negative pressure room, or other isolation setting that would not be entered by healthcare workers without PPE.","At the time of this writing, cases continue to be reported. Furthermore, there are also many unknowns regarding this outbreak, including the reservoir host, modes of transmission/transmission potential, and the effectiveness of potential vaccine candidates. Here we have attempted to address some of these issues using foundations from previous coronavirus outbreaks as well as our own analysis. What is certain is that the numbers of reported cases are increasing and will continue to increase before the knowledge gaps surrounding 2019-nCoV are filled. Cooperation among public health officials, healthcare workers, and scientists will be key to gaining a foothold and containing virus spread. Acknowledgement of coronaviruses as a constant spillover threat is important for pandemic preparedness. Two key take-away messages are important at this time: 1) As noted by the previous lopsided cases of healthcare, healthcare workers and care givers should exercise extreme caution and use personal protective equipment (PPE) in providing care to 2019-nCoV infected patients; and 2) The research community should endeavour to compile diverse CoV reagents that can quickly be mobilized for rapid vaccine development, antiviral discovery, differential diagnosis, and specific diagnosis.","As the international community responds to SARS-CoV-2, public health authorities in humanitarian crises begin at a disadvantage to enact appropriate infection control to prevent transmission in healthcare settings, identify infectious cases, administer supportive care and novel treatments for the seriously ill, and trace contacts. These standard public health measures are particularly difficult to perform in humanitarian settings. For example, limited public health, laboratory, and primary care services represent a barrier to testing. Providing the limited healthcare worker cadre with appropriate training and personal protective equipment, and ensuring a continuous supply chain for such, is a challenge in all settings, exacerbated in complex humanitarian crises. Frequent displacement and limited contact information may prevent effective contact tracing. Finally, intractable structural challenges such as overcrowding limit the implementation of both quarantine of those exposed and isolation of those who are ill. Given these increased vulnerabilities, humanitarian crises should be viewed as a priority for national and international bodies that seek to combat this unfolding pandemic. Resources must be identified to protect healthcare workers, develop and deploy rapid testing, improve surveillance, and enact quarantine and isolation of contacts and cases.","With the initial discovery of a new potential public health threat, it will likely be unclear how patients become sick. For example, rather than a contagion, there could be a contaminant or a toxin responsible for signs and symptoms. In this case, the possibility of an environmental toxin in the Wuhan Market was a consideration early on when limited to no human-to-human transmission was reported. The mode of transmission has implications for the types of personal protective equipment (PPE) needed to protect healthcare providers in the prehospital, clinic, and hospital settings.25 In addition, patients may need decontamination after exposure to certain toxins.26","Finally, the panel's decision to extend this recommendation to all patients, regardless of COVID-19 status, is specifically in the context of documented community spread during a pandemic. It also assumes a small proportion of persons who are negative or have recovered from COVID-19; this may change with the availability of wider testing and the ability to test for past infection or immunity. Recent data from China, by Chang et al, revealed the greatest risk of COVID-19 exposure to health care workers during early stages of the pandemic when testing was not yet widely available. 61 In a JAMA report published from Zhongnan Hospital in Wuhan, 29.3% (40 of 138) of COVID-19 infected patients were health care workers who presumably had hospital-acquired infections. 27 Among 493 health care workers caring for hospitalized patients, 10/493 health care workers became infected with COVID-19; all 10 were unprotected health care workers (no mask) caring for patients on medical wards with a low risk of exposure (no known or suspected COVID-19 patients). In contrast, none of the 278 protected health care workers (N95 mask) caring for high risk patients (known or suspected COVID-19) became infected (aOR 464.82; 95% CI: 97.73 to infinite). 62 One study, evaluating health care worker exposure in the care of one COVID-19 positive patient, revealed that none of 41 health care workers (surgical masks only) developed infection despite absence of N95 mask, although studies evaluating health care workers in context of larger cohorts of COVID-19 positive patients are not yet available. 63 The decision to extend the recommendation to lower GI procedures is based on evidence of possible aerosolization during colonoscopy especially during the insertion and removal of instruments through the biopsy channel. 53 and the uncertain risks associated with evidence of the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in fecal samples. These data provided indirect evidence to extend the recommendation to lower GI procedures pending more definitive evidence. 33 Limited resource settings Recommendation 4: In extreme resource-constrained settings involving health care workers performing any GI procedures, regardless of COVID-19 status, the AGA suggests extended use/re-use of N95 masks over surgical masks, as part of appropriate personal protective equipment. (Conditional recommendation, very low certainty evidence).","A second consideration was the implementation of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) preservation, which has been a core strategy to maintain healthcare worker safety. Given this priority, we decided that the palliative care consult service should only utilize PPE when absolutely necessary for the delivery of care and the goal should be to try remote approaches through digitalhealth and telephonic options when possible. In addition, our palliative care consult service is interdisciplinary, including physicians, nurse practitioners, nurses, social workers, and spiritual care providers, and our usual operating procedure often entails more than one palliative care clinician visiting a patient or family at the same time. During the COVID-19 pandemic, we decided that if an in-person encounter is necessary, generally only one palliative care provider would see the patient in-person regardless of whether the patient has COVID-19 to conserve palliative care specialists to see more patients and, for patients with COVID-19 or other PPE-utilizing infections, to preserve PPE.","\u2022 Fill gaps in understanding of the natural history of infection to better define the period of infectiousness and transmissibility; more accurately estimate the reproductive number in various outbreak settings and improve understanding the role of asymptomatic infection. \u2022 Comparative analysis of different quarantine strategies and contexts for their effectiveness and social acceptability \u2022 Enhance and develop an ethical framework for outbreak response that includes better equity for access to interventions for all countries \u2022 Promote the development of point-of-care diagnostic tests \u2022 Determine the best ways to apply knowledge about infection prevention and control in health-care settings in resource-constrained countries (including identification of optimal personal protective equipment) and in the broader community, specifically to understand behaviour among different vulnerable groups \u2022 Support standardised, best evidence-based approach for clinical management and better outcomes and implement randomised, controlled trials for therapeutics and vaccines as promising agents emerge \u2022 Validation of existing serological tests, including those that have been developed by commercial entities, and establishment of biobanks and serum panels of well characterised COVID-19 sera to support such efforts \u2022 Complete work on animal models for vaccine and therapeutic research and development include some identified by the global community and by the Research and Development Blueprint Scientific Advisory Group. The STAG-IH emphasises the importance of the continued rapid sharing of data of public health importance in medical journals that provide rapid peer review and online publication without a paywall. It is sharing of information in this way, as well as technical collaboration among clinicians, epidemiologists, and virologists, that has provided the world with its current understanding of COVID-19.","Close contacts were defined as individuals who 1) had any contact within 2 meters or were in the same care area as confirmed cases without wearing personal protective equipment (PPE; gowns, gloves, respirators, and eye protection); 2) had direct contact with respiratory secretions from MERS cases; or 3) shared hospital equipment with confirmed cases or received care from a healthcare worker (HCW) who was caring for confirmed cases [11]. The risk of transmission from asymptomatic cases was assumed to be negligible. The time of symptom onset was defined as the first identified time of persistent fever (\u226537.5\u2103) [11] &gt;24 hours among febrile patients and as the first day of new relevant symptoms among afebrile patients. Based on the duration and proximity of contact, symptoms of cases, and adequacy of PPE, the level of infection risk was assessed, and the most likely source of exposure was determined for those who had been possibly exposed to more than one symptomatic case (Supplementary Table 1) [12] The duration of exposure days was defined as the total number of hospital days of those who stayed in the same ward as the index case.","We provide adequate education to nurses, and training content includes the use of personal protective equipment (PPE), hand hygiene, ward disinfection, medical waste management, and sterilization of patient-care devices and management of occupational exposure. The PPE sets include (listed in the order they are to be put on) a disposable work hat, an N95 respirator, inner gloves, a protective eye mask, protective clothing, disposable waterproof shoe covers, disposable isolation gowns, outer gloves, and a face shield. Due to the complicated procedure of putting on and removing the PPE, we recorded a teaching video and sent it to a WeChat group where all nurses could review the operation details any time.","Patients suspected or confirmed to have influenza should be cared for in single rooms if possible. Perform a risk assessment to determine patient placement and/or suitability for cohorting when single rooms are limited or if in a LTC setting. Patients who are known to have influenza should be cohorted with suitable roommates. If cohorting is not possible and a cubicle or designated bedspace is used in a shared room, privacy curtains should be drawn between beds. Infection control signage should be placed at the room entrance indicating Droplet and Contact Precautions required upon entry to the room. 8 . Patient Flow/Activities Patients with ILI 5 should be restricted to their room until symptoms have resolved. Participation in group activities should be restricted while the patient is symptomatic. Movement/transport of patients with suspected or confirmed influenza should be restricted to essential diagnostic and therapeutic tests only. Transfer within facilities should be avoided unless medically indicated. If transport is necessary, transport services and personnel in the receiving area should be advised of the required precautions for the patient being transported. Patients with influenza who leave their room for medical reasons (i.e., essential diagnostic and therapeutic tests) should wear a mask and adhere to respiratory hygiene. 9 . Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) a) PPE in addition to Routine Practices \u2022 Facial protection (masks and eye protection, face shields, mask with visor attachment) should be worn when within 2 metres of a patient with suspected or confirmed influenza. \u2022 In acute care settings, gloves should be worn when entering the room of a patient with suspected or confirmed influenza. \u2022 In LTC settings, gloves should be worn for direct personal care with the patient or if direct contact with frequently touched environmental surfaces is anticipated. \u2022 A long-sleeved gown should be worn if it is anticipated that clothing or forearms will be in direct contact with the patient or with environmental surfaces or objects in the patient care environment. \u2022 Remove all PPE just before leaving the patient's room and discard in a hands-free waste or linen receptacle within the room. \u2022 Hand hygiene should be performed after removing gloves and gown, before removing facial protection, and after leaving the room. Note: In a shared room/cohort setting, facial protection may be worn for the care of successive patients. b) Aerosol generating medical procedures (AGMPs) \u2022 AGMPs should only be performed on patients with confirmed or suspected influenza if medically necessary.","First of all, we inventory personal protective equipment (PPE) immediately. According to the usual daily consumption amount of PPE, five-time amount of PPE were prepared, such as surgical masks, gowns, gloves, hand disinfectants etc. Because of the shortage of PPE worldwide, we recruited all PPE back to central storehouse, especially surgical masks, were allocated by the number of hospital staffs and we made the usage rules such as all staffs need signature when taking new equipment to prevent inappropriately waste or individual storage due to panic.","Assessing and managing the threat of an emerging infectious disease requires an understanding of the biology of the pathogen, its epidemiology, the clinical manifestations of infection, the methods of diagnosis, and therapies (if available). 10 All health care facilities should have a highly communicable disease plan for agents that are transmitted by droplet or aerosols (eg, severe acute respiratory syndrome [SARS] , MERS) or are transmitted by contact (eg, Ebola, Lassa). 10 Detailed information is best found, especially early in an epidemic, on the web pages of local and state health department, the CDC, and the WHO. For highly communicable diseases, there are 2 major areas that place a health care facility and the personnel at substantial risk for disease acquisition and transmission. 10 First, inadequate screening procedures when patients enter a health care facility can potentially allow transmission from an ill patient to health care personnel, other patients, or visitors. Second, inadequate supplies of personal protective equipment (PPE) and/or training of health care personnel (HCP) in proper donning and doffing procedures can increase the risk of exposure for HCP.","9. Access to personal protective equipment (PPE) for health workers: is another key concern. Even developed countries like the UK and USA report extreme shortages, and these concerns are multiplied in parts of the developing world which may be most hit by the epidemic. PPE shortages have been described in almost all affected facilities. Many physicians are forced to put themselves at risk and are already managing these patients using equipment which does not measure up to standard recommendations. The majority of the deaths in HCWs in Wuhan and Northern Italy occurred at the start of the outbreak when the importance of PPE whilst dealing with these patients had not yet been clearly recognised.","At the individual level, surgical face masks have often been a particularly visible image from affected cities in China. Face masks are essential components of personal protective equipment in healthcare settings, and should be recommended for ill persons in the community or for those who care for ill persons. However, there is now a shortage of supply of masks in China and elsewhere, and debates are ongoing about their protective value for uninfected persons in the general community.","Fever 1 and symptoms of respiratory illness (not necessarily pneumonia; e.g., cough, shortness of breath) Fever 1 or symptoms of respiratory illness (not necessarily pneumonia; e.g., cough, shortness of breath) and Close contact 3 with a confirmed MERS case while the case was ill. Footnotes 1 Fever may not be present in some patients, such as those who are very young, elderly, immunosuppressed, or taking certain medications. Clinical judgment should be used to guide testing of patients in such situations. 2 Countries considered in the Arabian Peninsula and neighboring include: Bahrain; Iraq; Iran; Israel, the West Bank, and Gaza; Jordan; Kuwait; Lebanon; Oman; Qatar; Saudi Arabia; Syria; the United Arab Emirates (UAE); and Yemen. 3 Close contact is defined as a) being within approximately 6 feet (2 meters), or within the room or care area, of a confirmed MERS case for a prolonged period of time (such as caring for, living with, visiting, or sharing a healthcare waiting area or room with, a confirmed MERS case) while not wearing recommended personal protective equipment or PPE (e.g., gowns, gloves, NIOSH-certified disposable N95 respirator, eye protection); or b) having direct contact with infectious secretions of a confirmed MERS case (e.g., being coughed on) while not wearing recommended personal protective equipment. See CDC's Interim Infection Prevention and Control Recommendations for Hospitalized Patients with MERS(https:// www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/mers/infection-prevention-control.html). Data to inform the definition of close contact are limited; considerations when assessing close contact include the duration of exposure (e.g., longer exposure time likely increases exposure risk) and the clinical symptoms of the person with MERS (e.g., coughing likely increases exposure risk). Special consideration should be given to those exposed in healthcare settings. ","42,000 medical workers, including 28,600 nurses across China had been sent to Hubei province date to February 29, 2020 (THE STATE COUNCIL THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA, 2020). A retrospective analysis showed that patients had received oxygen uptake (38%), mechanical ventilation (6.1%), antibiotics (57.5%), oseltamivir (35.85%), intensive care (5%) and invasive ventilation therapy ( In order to protect themselves, the nurses knew they should wear personal protective equipment (PPE), including goggles, N95 mask and protective suits when they were caring patients. However, working with and in these equipment for a long time is exhausting, for example, when wearing a N95 mask nurses needed to speaking loudly to make sure patients could hear. Some of the nurses\" skins and facial features were temporarily disfigured because of wearing N95 masks for a long time. They wore diapers and tried their best to have less food and water while working in order to save PPE supplies. Many nurses cut their long hair and even shaved their heads to reduce the risk of contamination between patients and between themselves and the patient.","These include infection control decisions regarding the limited availability of isolation rooms and personal protective equipment (PPE), particularly in more resource-constrained settings. This will be of particular importance as the outbreak develops, if the prevalence of hospitalised COVID-19 patients increases.","Personnel training is essential to ensure preparedness and success in dealing with a pandemic. Ensuring staff safety must be a high institutional priority. Training in use of ECMO should be site-specific and should involve team members with interdisciplinary experience. Apart from ECMO-specific training, team members should become familiar with general intensive-care management practices (largely supportive) 26 20, 32 The correct use of personal protection devices and handling of infected bodily secretions and laboratory specimens are essential skills to empower health-care workers and all other institutional staff to manage any pandemic. After adequate PPE training, use of all ECMOrelated equipment must be practiced as a team in a highfidelity simulation environment while wearing PPE or PAPR. Practice scenarios should simulate critical events that might be stressful even without added burdens such as accidental decannulation, pump failure, air in the circuit, and cardiac arrest. Operators should be familiar with the ECMO cannula sizes and dilators and be able to deal with cannulation complications while wearing PPE Developing organisations that support systems, equipment, facilities, and personnel is crucial to ensure optimal patient care, as well as family and staff safety during outbreaks of emerging infectious diseases. PAPR=power air-purifying respirator. PPE=personal protective equipment. Although ECMO can be a viable rescue strategy for some patients, 32 it is not a substitute for optimal conventional ARDS management. Typically, this management includes ventilation with low tidal volumes and at least moderate positive end-expiratory pressure, while restricting plateau airway and driving pressures, 33 and accepting some hypercapnia. This strategy can include a neuromuscular blockade and should always include prone positioning unless contraindicated or technically unfeasible. Some patients can be considered too unstable for prone positioning and might have to be administered rescue ECMO expeditiously if possible. Equally, in unstable patients and in patients who are likely to deteriorate during transfer, ECMO can be used to facilitate safe transport from a non-expert centre to an expert centre. 34 All infection control and personal protection measures should be followed when ECMO is being initiated for a patient in extremis, as such uncontrolled situations can put team members at high risk of exposure to pathogens.","First, although COVID-19 is spread by the airborne route, air disinfection of cities and communities is not known to be effective for disease control and needs to be stopped. The widespread practice of spraying disinfectant and alcohol in the sky, on roads, vehicles, and personnel has no value; moreover, large quantities of alcohol and disinfectant are potentially harmful to humans and should be avoided. 3, 4 Second, in the use of personal protective equipment, we should try to distinguish different risk factors, adopt different epidemic prevention measures, and reduce the waste of personal protective equipment, as these resources are already in short supply. Although surgical masks are in widespread use by the general population, there is no evidence that these masks prevent the acquisition of COVID-19, although they might slightly reduce the spread from an infected patient. Highfiltration masks such as N95 masks and protective clothing (goggles and gowns) should be used in hospitals where health-care workers are in direct contact with infected patients. 5 Third, the practice of blocking traffic and lockdown of villages is of no value for the prevention and control of COVID-19. Since the outbreak of COVID-19, some countries have suspended flights to and from China, and prevented Chinese people from travelling to their countries; both of these actions violate WHO International Health Regulations. 6 Similarly, in community prevention and control of the disease, the measures taken by individual villages and communities to seal off roads are of no value. 7 Such measures could result in civil unrest and reduce compliance with infection prevention and control advice.","\u2022 Ensure proper use of personal protection equipment (PPE). Healthcare personnel including technologists, radiologists and cardiac imagers who come in close contact with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 should wear the appropriate personal protective equipment (5, 6) . Patients should wear a surgical mask during imaging to ensure standard droplet precautions. \u2022 Appropriate environmental cleaning and decontamination of rooms by thorough cleaning of the surfaces by a staff member with appropriate PPE as per CDC and local institutional guidelines for airborne viral diseases (7).","All health care facilities should have a highly communicable disease management plan (Table 4) . A detailed discussion of each of these components is beyond the scope of this article. Detailed information is best found, especially early in an epidemic, on the Web pages of local and state health departments, the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention, and the World Health Organization. General recommendations have been provided by infection control experts. [39] [40] [41] [42] [43] [44] There are 2 areas that place a health care facility and the personnel at substantial risk for disease acquisition and transmission. First, inadequate screening procedures when patients enter a health care facility can potentially allow transmission from an ill patient to HCP, other patients, or visitors. Second, inadequate supplies of personal protective equipment (PPE) or inadequate training of HCP in proper donning and doffing procedures can increase the risk of exposure for HCP.","Prompted by the rapid expansion of the epidemic from April 16 to April 19, the Beijing Municipal Government established a Joint SARS Leading Group to oversee crisis management through 10 task forces. The medical and public health task force set up an emergency command center on April 24 and organized fever clinics for triage, designated SARS areas within hospitals for isolation and specialized care, provided personal protective equipment and training for healthcare workers, and introduced community-based prevention and control through case detection, isolation, quarantine, and community mobilization. To reduce transmission within healthcare settings, Beijing authorities issued protocols for triage, isolation, case management, and administrative controls, which prohibited visitors to hospitals and separated patients who were under medical observation or suspected of having SARS from areas with other patients.","In China, most psychiatrists do not receive adequate training in the prevention and treatment of infectious diseases. Furthermore, in the past decade, internship period in internal medicine has been reduced for medical students whose major is psychiatry in many medical schools in order to extend their training in mental health. All these factors could limit their clinical competence to control the potential transmission of COVID-19 in psychiatric hospitals. In addition, the lack of community-based mental health services has led to an over-reliance on psychiatric services provided by large psychiatric hospitals 10, 11. For the vast majority of patients with serious mental illness, they can only access appropriate mental health care in hospital settings, which are mostly located in city areas. Therefore, they are more prone to exposure to infectious diseases such as the COVID-19, unless the psychiatric hospitals themselves implement stringent measures of infection control similar to general hospitals. Clearly, preventive measures such as the provision of adequate medical supplies and protective equipment, public education on the risks of COVID-19 for hospital staff and patients, and restricting family visits to hospitals, are essential to reduce the likelihood of disease transmission in major psychiatric hospitals. Moreover, all people including patients' families and health care workers need to be advised to wash hands regularly and maintain good personal hygiene. Measurement of body temperature should be performed at least once a day to closely monitor any suspected infectious symptoms. Activities involving group interaction in communal areas should be avoided. Moreover, in order to minimize the potential risk of nosocomial infection, isolation units should be established and hospital access should be restricted for inpatients 9.","Make necessary Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) available in areas where resident care is provided. Put a trash can near the exit inside the resident room to make it easy for staff to discard PPE prior to exiting the room, or before providing care for another resident in the same room.","The goal is to attain zero percent infection rates among HCP while providing essential services to patients. For the GI community, the key element will be to prevent exposure during any endoscopic procedure. As the outbreaks continue to occur, masks and personal protective equipment (PPE) may become scarce in quantity. An early inventory of what is available to the institute is essential to formulate a plan for PPE usage.","1 Beyond the assistance: additional exposure situations to COVID-19 for healthcare workers Sir, Although many workers may be exposed to the novel coronavirus, healthcare workers (HCWs) have an increased risk of contracting COVID-19 due to their close contact with patients affected by SARS-CoV-2 [1, 2] . For this reason, the World Health Organization (WHO) and other authorities have recommended the adoption of adequate prevention and control measures for HCWs. WHO has recommended that HCWs should use proper personal protective equipment (PPE), such as medical masks, gowns, gloves and eye protection [3] . In some cases, such as in aerosol-generating procedures, WHO has recommended the use of FFP2 respirator masks [3] . Strict compliance with these recommended measures and with good practice procedures for managing infectious diseases may minimize the risk of virus transmission from patients to HCWs. We also want to emphasize the continued need to provide HCWs with adequate PPE in order to reduce the high risk of contracting COVID-19 whilst caring for patients.","Various papers and textbooks plainly describe wearing level-D protective clothing against respiratory viruses, but in practice this is not a simple task. It takes at least five minutes to wear it. If you try to see the patient after wearing, it is very difficult to communicate. With the N95 respirator, basic conversation is not easy. Physical examination is also difficult to conduct. For example, can you properly auscultate a patient while wearing such heavy personal protective equipment (PPE)? Moreover, if you are wearing this heavy PPE in the summer, the heat and stuffiness are really unbearable. When suspected of novel coronavirus infection (2019-nCoV), another ordeal is encountered when a telephone call is made with the community health center to discuss patient transfer. At first it is not connected well because telephone call to public health center is congested. Even with the connection, the voice over there is hard to hear. And because of wearing gloves, the phone keyboard touch is not good. Sometimes the decision of the public health center is inconsistent with ours, resulting in disagreements or conflicts. Doffing (taking off) the level-D protective clothing is more difficult than donning (putting on). Each time you take off one PPE, you will need to do a hand hygiene. So doffing takes at least 10 minutes.","Lack of clear knowledge of the mechanisms of COVID-19 transmission makes it difficult to develop evidence-based infection control protocols to prevent transmission to healthcare workers (HCW) and other patients. Certainly, ICU HCW are at particularly high risk of nosocomial transmission because of potential exposure to aerosolised respiratory secretions during intubation, tracheal suctioning, bronchoscopy and respiratory circuit disconnection, as well as environmental contamination [15] [16] [17] [18] . Thus, it is currently prudent to assume higher precautionary measures in ICU than those currently recommended by the CDC (respiratory droplet and contact precautions). Suspected or confirmed cases should ideally be isolated in a negative pressure airborne infection isolation room (AIIR) with sufficient air changes (&gt; 12/h) and personnel trained to use personal protective equipment (PPE) for airborne precautions. All support and sanitary staff, often forgotten, should also receive appropriate PPE and infection control training, particularly as there may be a risk of faecal transmission [9] . If full airborne precautions are not possible due to limited facilities or overwhelming numbers of cases, other measures that may decrease risk of nosocomial transmission include cohorting of patients in dedicated wards, or physical separation, supported by disciplined use of PPE, universal contact and droplet precautions and adequate ward ventilation [15, [19] [20] [21] . Encouragingly, with strict PPE protocols combined with rigorous implementation, the reported risk of staff contracting SARS-CoV in one ICU was low, despite suboptimal physical space, ventilation and complete absence of AIIR facilities [22] .","Measures to be taken is determined according to the quarantine and isolation decision tree, and a certain risk-benefit analysis is required. If the symptoms are not contagious before onset, the travel and social distance will not be limited, but necessary disease surveillance should be carried out to determine whether the intervention of public health agencies is needed to ensure the effectiveness of the latent disease surveillance based on the monitoring effect. Different public health measures need to be selected based on the disease to which the individual assessed is exposed. On the other hand, the difference transmission can significantly affect the speed of disease spreading and the choice of personal protective equipment (PPE). At the same time, legal basis, jurisdiction, impact on mental health and the potential negative consequences of restrictions on human rights and free actions need to be considered. The scientific significance of quarantine lies in the fact that quarantined disease is likely to spread during the incubation period to minimize the probability of infectious disease outbreaks (Barbisch et al., 2015) . The third step of the 3I tool is to promptly report to the infection control department of hospitals, superior supervisors, and law enforcement departments based on the location of the identified and confirmed patient.","The most important control for SARS is to ensure no more outbreaks within the hospitals as well as the community. Details on such measures would be beyond the scope of this article. Very briefly, patients should be isolated promptly to ensure no more spread of SARS-CoV to other fellow patients and staff. Isolated nursing could be achieved in dedicated single rooms or on open wards, as long as these are closely supervised and maintained. An air exchange rate of 12 times per hour and a temperature of 20 C appeared desirable, as the wearing of personal protective equipment (PPE) by staff could be too warm at times. Personal protective equipment should be provided to trained staff including the use of full-body gowns and high-specification masks (such as N95 masks). All staff are required to follow strict and stepwise 'gowning' and 'degowning' procedures. Strict personal hygiene and common sense are important. Diluted bleach is used to wipe all work surfaces and the floor every hour or after any potential contamination. As nebulizer therapy was alleged to be the cause of a major hospital outbreak in Hong Kong, this mode of therapy is forbidden for patients with suspected or probable SARS in Hong Kong.","Protective equipment for CV health care workers. The Central Illustration demonstrates key considerations for treating patients in the current era of the COVID-19 pandemic. Early reports from the outbreak have suggested that transmission occurs most commonly via respiratory droplets that are produced when an infected individual coughs or sneezes. These droplets can land on exposed mucous membranes or be inhaled into the lungs of those within close proximity and the virus may remain active on surfaces for several days (83) . While the CDC had previously recommended airborne precautions for the care of patients with COVID-19, this recommendation was recently changed such that only patients undergoing aerosol-generating procedures require airborne isolation. Recommendations made by the WHO and CDC for personal protective equipment (PPE) are in agreement that standard, contact precautions with face mask, eye protection, gown, and gloves are necessary (51) .","During this epidemic students and staff regularly visited and worked in clinical settings within local hospitals in Riyadh, some of these sites had laboratory confirmed MERS-CoV patients. Ensuring staff and students were appropriately informed of the risks and their role in using standard precautions to reduce cross infection, was a priority for the Task Force. As the recent cases of MERS-CoV indicate, visitors and health care workers in Riyadh and throughout Saudi Arabia carry a measure of risk by being in the hospital environment. Our students became more resilient against the virus by increased education and awareness, heightened use and skill with personal protective equipment and protective policies.","Until the questions above are answered, the main disease control strategies should focus on 1. Enhanced disease surveillance to detect new cases early 2. Travel -the main route of global spread. Strategies include airport screening, health communication to passengers at risk, reduction or prevention of travel (such as the lock down of Wuhan which occurred on January 23 rd 2020). 3. Hospitals and the health system -both SARS and MERS CoV caused nosocomial outbreaks. Patients with 2019nCoV will present to the health system, and if they are not suspected as cases and isolated rapidly, they may infect others. Triage, isolation and infection control are key, as well as personal protective equipment (PPE) for health care workers. Health workers paid a heavy price with SARS, with many preventable deaths due to delayed diagnosis or inadequate PPE.","Recommendations and guidance on case definitions, infection control (including use of personal protective equipment), case investigation, and specimen collection and shipment for testing are available at the CDC coronavirus Web site. Additional information and potentially frequent updates will be posted on that site. State and local health illnesses are almost always caused by known respiratory pathogens, emergency physicians should recognize the risk of novel pathogens and be familiar with current recommendations for evaluating patients who may be infected with emerging pathogens from specific geographic areas. This report of a new coronavirus (now referred to as Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, or MERS-CoV) identified in patients in the United Kingdom after travel to the Arabian Peninsula illustrates some important points about identifying infections with novel pathogens and implementing infection control procedures when specific transmission risk may be unknown. The 3 confirmed cases demonstrate that the virus has the capability of human-to-human transmission and coinfection with another pathogen (influenza A). 1 Subsequent clusters of disease confirm that the novel coronavirus can spread from person to person, including from patients to health care workers. Although MERS-CoV has a different genetic sequence than the virus that caused SARS, the implications for emergency medicine are similar. 2 Health care providers, hospital administrators, and global health organizations learned many important lessons during the 2003 SARS outbreak. The subsequent improvement in infection control measures is especially important for the ED in the event of infectious outbreaks with new pathogens. Transmission in the health care setting to a large number of health care workers and other patients was a notable feature of the SARS coronavirus. The greatest risk of transmission was to individuals who had close contact with infected subjects and who were not properly trained in the use of protective equipment. 3 Exposure of health care providers to procedures that aerosolized droplets such as nebulizers, suctioning, and intubation was another source of virus transmission. 4 N95 respirators may offer protection to individuals involved in highrisk procedures. 5 CDC recommendations for respiratory hygiene/cough etiquette evolved during the SARS outbreak. These concepts have since been incorporated into CDC planning documents for SARS and pandemic influenza. Although basic precautions such as hand washing are intended for health care workers associated with direct patient contact, respiratory hygiene/cough etiquette applies to everyone in the hospital setting: providers, patients, and visitors. 6 This concept was developed in response to observations that visitors and patients without diagnoses were contributing to hospital transmission. 3 Recommendations included posted signs in different languages about containment of respiratory secretions, convenient hand sanitizers and tissue receptacles, and sitting at least 3 feet apart if coughing. Screening patients with respiratory symptoms for recent travel, placing a mask, and isolation from others in the waiting room/ ED are important for early detection and prevention. 7 For pathogens that emerge in specified geographic areas, risk assessment is based on where the organism is currently circulating, ie, within the local community, limited geographic areas, or not actively circulating anywhere in the world. 8 If","Mobile SARS containment teams (mobile teams), a joint program by the Center for Disease Control in Taiwan and various teaching hospitals, were initiated three days after the first suspected SARS case was reported. Seventeen mobile teams, comprising infection control physicians, infection control nurses, rotating staff from the County Department of Health, staff from the Center for Disease Control, Taiwan, and staff from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the USA, were deployed from 16 March to 10 May 2003. They observed and demonstrated the recommended SARS infection control practices and also provided personal protective equipment (PPE) to hospitals actively evaluating patients for SARS infection. Each team was equipped with an infection control checklist, personal protective equipment (PPE), blood specimen tubes, nasopharyngeal swabs, culture media, and a specimen cooler. Mobile teams evaluated infection control practices through observing hospital personnel, questioning current practices, and detecting the negative pressure of the isolation room using a strip of tissue paper at the entrance of a patient's isolation room.","For patients presenting with fever, contact history of SARS patients within 10 days, or recovered SARS patients shortly discharged from hospital, we have adopted a special outpatient follow-up strategy based on initial epidemiological and microbiological evidences that the main mode of transmission of SARS is by droplets, direct contact with patient's secretions, and subsequent inoculation into mucous membranes.3 Infection control measures accentuating droplet precautions, with the application of barrier apparels and environmental cleaning as well as universal precautions, being the pivot of success in containing the infection, are of paramount importance. The personal protective equipment (PPE) with disposable caps, N95 respirator, goggles, face-shields, gloves, top and pants, and long protective gowns with high neck and long cuffed sleeves should be worn all the time when attending to these patients (Table 1). Under circumstances such as between cases and immediately following a high-risk procedure, all health-care workers have to abide by the decontamination process consisting of removal of all potentially contaminated protective wear in proper sequence and putting on clean protective wear. Once again, hand washing is strongly advised after removal of gloves and before attending another patient in order to minimize risk of crossinfection.","Hospital-acquired infections (HAIs) are serious public health problems that increase the morbidity, mortality, and avoidable healthcare cost worldwide. Millions of people suffer from HAIs, ranging from the common cold to severe infections, annually. Data from 66 hospitals in 23 countries show that the prevalence rate of HAIs is 7.1% in Europe, and this number is doubled or more in developing countries, such as Uganda [1, 2]. Furthermore, HAIs are partly responsible for the repeated outbreaks of several fatal infectious diseases in Asia and West Africa, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), and Ebola [3, 4]. Hospital-borne outbreaks of these diseases reflect the vulnerability of the affected hospitals in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) [5]. For example, at the early stage of the Ebola outbreak in 2013, the human resource policy of public health in Guinea was blamed for failing to provide adequate manpower for research, information system, and transportation of medical supplies [6]. The lack of personal protective equipment (PPE), a common problem in most hospitals in West African counties affected by Ebola, increased the exposure risk of health care workers (HCWs). A scientific and effective emergency plan is important for the early response and comprehensive interventions of HAI outbreaks [7]. The World Health Organization (WHO) suggests that all countries should have a plan in place, even if the risk of highly contagious condition seems remote. The lack of proper communication contributes to the spread of diseases. Effective public health response plans could reduce fatalities during outbreaks of SARS and MERS in Asia [8]. In addition to the policies, emergency plans, and equipment, education and training are also very important for the prevention and control of HAIs, especially for those caused by unusual, novel, or fatal pathogens. The data and knowledge of these pathogens should be communicated effectively from laboratories to leaders, managers, and HCWs to improve the response plan and diagnostic capabilities [9].","Immune system 233 Cytokines produced by T-helper (Th) lymphocytes regulate immunity and inflammation.

In a recent report from Wuhan, China, 16 bronchoscopy, open tracheal suctioning, intubation, extubation, non-invasive positive pressure ventilation, endoscopy, or transesophageal echocardiography. (6) As the prevalence of COVID-19 increases exponentially, patients presenting with seemingly non-related medical problems may expose health care providers to increased risk of contracting the disease if not properly protected. Such exposure puts electrophysiology (EP) staff, physicians, and other clinical personnel at increased risk of contracting COVID-19. Reducing contact between health care personnel and COVID-19 patients is an integral step in limiting its spread and resource utilization, including use of personal protective equipment (PPE).","Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) emerged in China in December 2019 and as of 3rd March 2020, more than 90,800 cases and 3100 deaths have been reported from 72 countries ( World Health Organisation (WHO) 2020 ). Most of the cases and deaths have occurred in Wuhan city in China where the outbreak started. As drugs or vaccines are not yet available, various non-pharmaceutical measures have been recommended to reduce the spread of infection, including hygiene and disinfection, improving environmental control, early detection and reporting, isolation, quarantine, use of personal protective equipment, social distancing and travel restrictions (( World Health Organization (WHO) 2014 ; Bell et al., 2006 ) ). In most pandemic plans, tiered strategies which target front line health workers first, followed by the general community, are usually defined. Yet many of these strategies have some level of controversy attached and lack a large evidence base . Some are starting to be phased out in some settings such as the use of thermal scanners at airports, due to a lack of evidence, especially for infections with pre-symptomatic transmission ( Gunaratnam et al., 2014 ) . However, the use of other interventions continues to be debated."],"title":["Protecting health care workers from SARS and other respiratory pathogens: Organizational and individual factors that affect adherence to infection control guidelines","AGA Institute Rapid Recommendations for Gastrointestinal Procedures During the COVID-19 Pandemic","Preventing respiratory illness in older adults aged 60 years and above living in long-term care: A rapid overview of reviews","Preparedness among Ophthalmologists: During and Beyond the COVID-19 Pandemic","Preventing respiratory illness in older adults aged 60 years and above living in long-term care: A rapid overview of reviews","Coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak: what the department of endoscopy should know","Protecting health care workers from SARS and other respiratory pathogens: Organizational and individual factors that affect adherence to infection control guidelines","Navigating the challenges of the COVID-19 outbreak: perspectives from the radiation oncology service in singapore","Disposable N95 Masks Pass Qualitative Fit-Test But Have Decreased Filtration Efficiency after Cobalt-60 Gamma Irradiation","First cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in France: surveillance, investigations and control measures, January 2020","Individualized System for Augmenting Ventilator Efficacy (iSAVE): A Rapidly deployable system to expand ventilator capacity","2019-nCoV (Wuhan virus), a novel Coronavirus: Human-to-human transmission, travel-related cases, and vaccine readiness","Responding to the COVID-19 pandemic in complex humanitarian crises","2019-nCoV: The Identify-Isolate-Inform (3I) Tool Applied to a Novel Emerging Coronavirus","AGA Institute Rapid Recommendations for Gastrointestinal Procedures During the COVID-19 Pandemic","Creating a Palliative Care Inpatient Response Plan for COVID19 \u2013 The UW Medicine Experience","COVID-19: towards controlling of a pandemic","Outbreaks of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome in Two Hospitals Initiated by a Single Patient in Daejeon, South Korea","Special attention to nurses\u2019 protection during the COVID-19 epidemic","Guidelines for preventing respiratory illness in older adults aged 60 years and above living in long-term care: A rapid review of clinical practice guidelines","The Preventive Strategies of Community Hospital in the Battle of Fighting Pandemic COVID-19 in Taiwan","New and emerging infectious diseases (Ebola, Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome coronavirus, carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae, Candida auris): Focus on environmental survival and germicide susceptibility","How to protect the protectors: 10 lessons to learn for doctors fighting the COVID-19 Coronavirus","Epidemiological research priorities for public health control of the ongoing global novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak","MIDDLE EAST RESPIRATORY SYNDROME CORONAVIRUS \u2013 MERS, MERS CoV","The performance and professionalism of nurses in the fight against the new outbreak of COVID-19 epidemic is laudable","Systematic review and meta-analysis of predictive symptoms and comorbidities for severe COVID-19 infection","Planning and provision of ECMO services for severe ARDS during the COVID-19 pandemic and other outbreaks of emerging infectious diseases","Taking the right measures to control COVID-19","Society of Cardiovascular Computed Tomography Guidance for Use of Cardiac Computed Tomography Amidst the COVID-19 Pandemic","Emerging infectious diseases: Focus on infection control issues for novel coronaviruses (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-CoV and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome-CoV), hemorrhagic fever viruses (Lassa and Ebola), and highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses, A(H5N1) and A(H7N9)","Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, Beijing, 2003","The COVID-19 outbreak and psychiatric hospitals in China: managing challenges through mental health service reform","Guidelines for preventing respiratory illness in older adults aged 60 years and above living in long-term care: A rapid review of clinical practice guidelines","Considerations in performing endoscopy during the COVID-19 pandemic","Beyond the assistance: additional exposure situations to COVID-19 for healthcare workers","The Fight against the 2019-nCoV Outbreak: an Arduous March Has Just Begun","COVID-19: A critical care perspective informed by lessons learnt from other viral epidemics","Which Measures are Effective in Containing COVID-19?
