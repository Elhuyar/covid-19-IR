In fact, 13% of laboratory-confirmed cases were asymptomatic which is notable as this is certainly an underestimation of the true rate of asymptomatic infection, since many children without symptoms are unlikely to be tested for obvious reasons. Recent virologic data demonstrated that such asymptomatic or oligosymptomatic individuals carry potentially infectious SARS-CoV-2 particles in their nasopharyngeal secretions thereby very likely contributing to early transmission to close contacts [11, 12] . In addition, the evidence of fecal shedding of SARS-CoV-2 in the stool of an asymptomatic child for a prolonged period raises the concern that infants and children who are not toilet-trained could facilitate fecal-oral transmission of the virus [13] . The potentially prolonged shedding of the virus in nasal secretions and stool of children and infants has substantial implications for spread of the virus in daycare centers, schools, and in the home.","The prevalence of AdV was far higher here than in many previous studies, in which AdV infection was infrequent [41,51,52]. A similar prevalence of AdV was observed in a Kenyan study in which the median age (1 year) was similar to that of our population (2 years) [13]. In young children, asymptomatic porting has been shown for some respiratory viruses such as adenovirus or rhinovirus [53]. More specifically, asymptomatic adenovirus infections are common in young children [53,54]. In our study, adenoviruses have a predominant prevalence. They are also common in co-infection. Asymptomatic carriage of the virus among young people and their high prevalence in co-infection suggested that they might not be the cause of the disease. RSV, the main etiologic agent of bronchiolitis and pneumonia in young children, has a reported prevalence of 14% to 34% in children with respiratory tract infection, and is particularly frequent in infants less than one year old [42,52,55]. The prevalence of RSV was lower in our study than in many previous reports, in which it reached 50% among children aged between 0 and 4 years [10,56]. However, the children in these latter studies were hospitalized with acute lower respiratory tract infections, whereas the children in our study did not always require hospitalization. RSV was none the less one of the five main viruses detected in our study (13.5%). All PIV types were detected in our study, with a predominance of PIV3 as in several previous studies [57-59]. The prevalence of influenza virus (11.9%) was similar to that observed in other countries (10% to 13%) after the pH1N1 pandemic [17]. Among the influenza viruses, A(H1N1)pdm09 and type B represented 57.3% and 42.7% of cases, respectively. These results could be explained by the fact that our study took place after the global emergence of A(H1N1)pdm09: pandemic influenza and influenza B was more frequent than non A(H1N1)pdm09 influenza A. From November 2010 to February 2011, the subtypes of influenza virus which were mostly prevalent in North Africa, the Near East, Europe and Asia, were the subtype B and the A(H1N1)pdm09 [60]. Our results match those described in the world for this time of year and show that these two types of influenza are predominant.","An alternative vaccine, the 248/404/1030/ SH virus was also tested and found to have lower rate of infection and titer of shedding. Additional testing with these attenuated strains showed that increasing the initial vaccine inoculum titer does not substantially increase viral shedding or immunogenicity. Finally, studies in children less than 3 months old showed a comparable level of viral shedding in the presence or absence of maternal antibodies. The young infants had minimal antibody responses, although there were detectable serum levels of IgG and IgA to the G protein. Mucosal antibodies were produced but at far lower levels than are seen in children older than 3 months of age. A second dose of vaccine, the response to which can be used as a surrogate for reinfection, resulted in rare shedding of the virus and no evidence of enhanced RSV illness once infected. These findings suggest that the vaccine may be protective without detectable increases in antibody level. Finally, a NS-2 protein deleted 248/404 virus, a change that may make the virus more susceptible to interferon, has been found to have markedly reduced viral shedding, particularly in seronegative children, when compared to the other attenuated vaccine strains. Although the study of these live-attenuated vaccines against RSV have given limited information about efficacy, they have given significant data to support continued develop of these vaccines.","Parainfluenza virus causes significant direct and indirect morbidity and mortality among immunocompromised adults and children. 174 PIV can cause asymptomatic shedding, particularly among HSCT been described more frequently among immunocompromised patients and the elderly. 248, 251, 253 Most children are infected by 5 years of age. 254 hMPV is the second most frequently isolated viral pathogen, after RSV, in children presenting with bronchiolitis. 248 Infections typically occur in the late winter and spring in temperate climates and in the spring and summer in subtropical regions. 254, 255 Epidemic peaks typically occur 1-2 months later than RSV epidemics annually. 248 Pathogenicity hMPV is likely to be transmitted by direct or close contact with contaminated secretions; large particle aerosols, droplets and fomites may also result in transmission. There is typically a 5-day interval between onset of symptoms in an index case and the onset of symptoms in household exposed contacts. 256 hMPV G protein binds to the integrin \u03b1-V-\u03b2-1 receptors on respiratory epithelial cells. 248, 257 Local replication in the airway is associated with upper respiratory tract signs and significant airway inflammation. 258 Viral replication also induces mucus hyperproduction and hyperplasia of the respiratory epithelium which may result in airway obstruction and hyperresponsiveness to methacholine challenge. 259 Replication results in an increase in IL-8, IL-12, tumor necrosis factor, IL-6, and IL-1\u03b2, although levels are lower than those observed with RSV infection. 260 ","Asymptomatic carriers of other HCoVs including 229E, OC43, NL63, and HKU1 have been well documented. Importantly, the detection rate of the virus in this group was lower and viral loads were much lower compared to patients with upper respiratory tract symptoms [55]. This is generally consistent with the notion that asymptomatic or presymptomatic shedding of SARS-CoV-2 might be less common than some estimates such as half to half. In this regard, epidemiological studies to determine the percentages of asymptomatic carriers and in selected large cohorts of subjects in Wuhan should help clarify the role of asymptomatic virus shedding in SARS-CoV-2 transmission. This analysis will also rule in or rule out our prediction that asymptomatic virus shedding exists but is uncommon. Since patients with non-specific and mild symptoms as well as asymptomatic carriers can go undetected easily, the chance that SARS-CoV-2 will be established in humans is increased. It will likely become either endemic in some regions or pandemic.","An asymptomatic carrier of SARS-CoV-2 was reported in the first study of a family cluster [51]. Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from an asymptomatic carrier to close contacts was later suggested, but this has subsequently been challenged. However, even if family members and close contacts could be infected by the index patient in the presymptomatic window period as claimed, it is still worthy of a significant concern. Presumed transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from an asymptomatic carrier to family members has recently been documented [54]. The existence of many asymptomatic carriers, presymptomatic patients, and patients with very mild symptoms posts a huge challenge to infection control, as the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from these people to susceptible groups would be difficult to prevent. The number of people infected with SARS-CoV-2 could be underestimated. However, existing evidence suggests that the risk might probably be lower than expected. First, asymptomatic carriers are not common. In the first family cluster that was carefully studied, only one of the six family members was found to be asymptomatic or present with non-specific and mild symptoms with the typical ground-glass opacities in only one but not both lungs [51]. Second, the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from asymptomatic carriers and presymptomatic patients could be even less common, if their viral loads are low and virus shedding is not substantial. The key questions concern how often asymptomatic and presymptomatic virus shedding might occur as well as whether their viral loads could be high.","Viruses are important causes of pneumonia in both adults and children. They have been associated with up to 40% of radiographically proven pneumonias in hospitalized adults and are estimated to cause 16% of total pneumonias in pediatric outpatients and up to 49% in hospitalized infants. These figures may underestimate the importance of viral infections as a cause of pneumonia, particularly in outpatients, because of the insensitivity of viral diagnostic methods and because of the lack of chest radiographs in 1 and 2, routinely infect infants and young children, who then have prolonged asymptomatic viral shedding from the respiratory and gastrointestinal (GI) tracts. Other types, including those that have been most often implicated in respiratory disease (e.g., types 3, 4, and 7), are acquired later in life, characteristically in epidemic settings. In most instances, viral transmission probably takes place by direct contact with infectious secretions. However, the explosive nature of adenoviral acute respiratory disease in military recruits probably reflects airborne spread.","Influenza viral shedding appears to vary by subtype, but the patterns of shedding were similar in both children and adults [63, 64] , and between the seasonal and p(H1N1) outbreaks [64] [65] [66] , although the reproductive number appears different [65] . We allowed for some of the infections to be asymptomatic [59, 63] , which in our model increases the rates of return to the community and transmission, while also reducing the effectiveness of control policies. Meta-analysis of influenza studies [14] was used to determine shedding and symptom rates by disease state (see Table A ","We included environmentally mediated transmission and transmission from asymptomatic individuals in our general mathematical framework. However, the relative importance of these transmission routes remain speculative based on current data. Cleaning and decontamination are being deployed to varying levels in different settings, and improved estimates of their relative importance would help inform this as a priority. Asymptomatic infection has been widely reported for COVID-19, e.g., (14) , unlike for SARS where this was very rare (37). We argue that the reports from Singapore imply that even if asymptomatic infections are common, onward transmission from this state is probably uncommon, since forensic reconstruction of the transmission networks has closed down most missing links. There is an important caveat to this: the Singapore outbreak to date is small and has not implicated children. There has been widespread speculation that children could be frequent asymptomatic carriers and potential sources of SARS-CoV-2 (38,39).","It is however likely that immunosuppressed patients may be prone to acquiring the virus at higher risk due to its high efficiency in transmission. The virus shedding has been noted not only in respiratory specimens but also in serum and stool. Importantly, viral shedding can occur for days for weeks furtively in asymptomatic carrier individuals especially children (3, 9, 10) and fecal shedding has been noted in patients without diarrhea.(10) Significant environmental contamination has been noted, including wash-basin, toilet bowl and air outlet fan surfaces in hospitalized patients.(11) Thus, it is prudent to advise transplant recipients to ardently practice mitigation strategies such as social distancing, sanitization, hand hygiene and avoidance of areas known to harbor potentially infected individuals. These recommendations extend to their care providers as well.","The modes of transmission for HBoV1 are largely unknown, but may be similar to those of other parvoviruses that can be transmitted by various routes, including respiratory, urine, and fecal-oral. 47 Seroepidemiology studies indicate that HBoV1 is distributed worldwide and that more than 90% of individuals have been exposed, often early in life. 48, 49 HBoV genotypes 2 to 4 may also be distributed globally, but their seroepidemiology has been complicated by cross-reactivity. 50 HBoV1 seropositivity is common in infants younger than 2 months owing to transfer of maternal antibody, after which it declines and then increases again because of primary infections, until 6 years of age when most children are seropositive. 48, [51] [52] [53] [54] [55] The prevalence of HBoV1 in respiratory infections ranges from 1.6% to 21.5%, mainly in children younger than 3 years during the winter and spring months. 16, [55] [56] [57] [58] [59] HBoV1 is detected infrequently in older age groups including adults, 58,60 although most have antibodies to HBoV1. 48, 54, 61 HBoV1 is estimated to be among the 4 most prevalent viruses along with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), rhinoviruses, and adenoviruses in children hospitalized for respiratory disease. 54,62-64 However, serologic studies have shown that the mere presence of HBoV1 DNA in the respiratory tract is not proof of an acute primary infection. 48, 50, 65 Prolonged viral shedding could explain why some studies found HBoV1 DNA more frequently in asymptomatic than symptomatic cases, 58, 66, 67 and the high percentage of coinfections. 55, 60 HBoV1 DNA has been detected in stool samples in 0% to 13% of patients with or without gastroenteritis 55 and in 0% to 44% of respiratory specimens from asymptomatic individuals. 55, 58, 68 ","A key difficulty in paediatric otolaryngology practice is examining and operating in anatomical locations with high possibility of aerosol generation within a potentially asymptomatic population affected by COVID-19. [2] Asymptomatic patients are at risk of viral shedding during examination and procedural work involving these areas should also recognize the risk of transmission across adjacent surfaces. [6] Our current recommendation is all paediatric patients undergoing urgent otolaryngology procedures should be treated as suspected COVID-19 cases until proven otherwise due to the higher proportion of asymptomatic children carrying COVID-19. This is in keeping with guidance emerging from surgical societies and professional organisations. [7] While universal screening of patients prior to surgery would be ideal, few institutions around the world are currently equipped to do so due to restricted availability of testing resources. False negative test results remain an area of concern. As such, specific recommendations about which patients to test is currently evolving day by day and is beyond the scope of our discussion.","Adenovirus disease in immunocompromised adults and children ranges from asymptomatic shedding to progressive, often fatal disseminated disease. 28, [60] [61] [62] [63] Risk factors for adenoviral infection in the HSCT population includes allogeneic donor (8.5-30% vs 2-12% for autologous donor), pediatric age groups (20-47% vs 9-13.6% for adults), T cell-depleted grafts (45% vs 11%), use of alemtuzumab, cord blood donor and patients with acute graft-versus-host disease Kong, Vietnam, Singapore, Taiwan and Canada in a matter of weeks; at the end of the 6-month epidemic, more than 30 countries were affected, resulting in 8096 confirmed infections, and 774 deaths (9.6%). 87 The primary mode of transmission was via respiratory droplets; the basic reproductive number (R0) of SARS was in the range of 2.2-3.7. 79, 82, 87 However, frequent nosocomial outbreaks and 'superspreading events' had greatly exacerbated its transmission. 88 Notably, 21% of SARS victims were healthcare workers; and the disease attack rate in hospitals was between 10% and 60%. 78,82 Viral kinetics (peak at the time of clinical deterioration), application of aerosol-generating procedures and devices (e.g. intubation, resuscitation, oxygen or nebulizer therapy, bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP)), overcrowdedness and lack of proper isolation facilities in hospitals are some of the explanations. [88] [89] [90] A community 'super-spreading event' that occurred in a private housing estate in Hong Kong involved over 300 residents. Drying up of a 'U-shaped' bathroom floor drain and backflow of contaminated sewage (from a SARS patient with diarrhea), coupled with the toilet's exhaust fan, might have created infectious aerosols that rose with warm air along the building's air-shaft; these were then dispersed by wind flow, causing long-range transmission to nearby buildings. 90 This and other evidence suggested that SARS could be 'opportunistically' airborne. 78, 89 The first cases of MERS-CoV infections emerged in June 2012 in Saudi Arabia and Qatar. As of May 2015, a total of 1180 confirmed infections and 483 (41%) deaths had been reported. 78, 91 The Middle Eastern countries of Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Jordan and United Arab Emirates were predominantly affected, but imported cases to UK, Netherlands, USA and Asia were reported. 91, 291 The largest outbreak outside the Middle East occurred in South Korea in 2015, which involved multiple hospitals and 185 individuals, causing 36 (19.5%) deaths. Although zoonotic transmission is implicated, the majority of infected cases did not report a history of direct animal contact. Epidemiological investigations suggested sporadic transmission of disease with multiple introductions into the at-risk population. It was found that occupational exposure to camels (e.g. shepherds, slaughter-house works) was associated with 15-23 times higher risk of seroconversion (2.3-3.6%) than the general population (&lt;0.2%). Also, a large number of younger (15-44 years) infected individuals, who develop no or mild symptoms might exist and serve as the source of infection for those without direct animal contact. 78, 91, 92, 292 Secondary transmission in household is not uncommon, which occur in over 20% of case clusters. Transmission is typically highly efficient in the hospital settings via infectious droplets/aerosols, leading to frequent occurrence of nosocomial outbreaks, as in the case of SARS. 78, [93] [94] [95] [96] 293, 294 Pathogenicity The cellular receptor for HCoV-229E is aminopeptidase N (APN) or CD13; the cellular receptor for HCoV-OC43 is 9-O-acetylated sialic acid on the cell surface. Like SARS-CoV, HCoV-NL63 binds to the ACE2. 85 Humans have no pre-existing immunity to SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV. These novel viruses have the ability to evade innate host defenses (e.g. type I interferon responses and related mechanisms), and replicate efficiently in host tissues (respiratory and intestinal tract cells; kidney cells also for MERS-CoV). 78, 80, 82, 83 In addition to lytic cell damage, uncontrolled replication of SARS-CoV leads to unabated inflammatory cytokine activation (commonly known as 'cytokine storms'), which is implicated in the development of progressive pneumonitis, diffuse alveolar damage and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and hemophagocytic syndrome. 79, 97 High viral load and slow viral clearance due to inefficient host responses are associated with progressive disease and fatal outcomes. 82, 98, 99 Pathogenesis data for MERS-CoV are limited; a macaque model has shown active viral replication in lung tissues causing localized-to-widespread lesions and clinical illness, which only abates after 1 week of illness. Infected marmosets can develop severe interstitial pneumonia similar to humans cases. Neutrophil and macrophage infiltration and alveolar oedema are noted. 78, 100, 101 (GVHD). 4, 28, [63] [64] [65] Although disseminated disease only effects 1-7% of HSCT recipients it is associated with a significant risk of mortality (8-26%). 4, 28, 63, 66 Incidence among solid organ transplant recipient populations is highest in small bowel and liver transplant recipients, pediatric transplant recipients, patients who receive antilymphocyte antibodies, and patients with donor-positive/recipient-negative adenovirus status. 60 Asymptomatic adenovirus DNAemia is common among solid organ transplant recipients and generally is not associated with progression to symptomatic disease. 67, 68 Management Although no antivirals are specifically approved for the treatment of adenovirus, several have in vitro and in vivo experimental data to support their use. 4 63,69-73 While no single agent has consistently been effective in all cases, existing data suggest that cidofovir and its lipid ester analogs (CMX001 or brincidofovir) are most effective in managing adenovirus infections. 4, 63, 74 Adenovirus-and multi-virus-specific T cells are an emerging potential therapy that can safely be used with a low frequency of de novo graft-versus-host disease and a complete or partial response in the adenovirus infection. 75, 76 Serial measurement of quantitative viral load is predictive of response to any therapeutic intervention.","Contact tracing has identified asymptomatic infections, but studies of their frequency and transmissibility have been limited. Many of those infected are health care workers in whom these questions could be systematically studied. Relatively little is known about the natural history of human asymptomatic infections. Further studies of virus shedding, seroconversion, and transmission in asymptomatic infections are needed. Some evidence suggests that secondary cases have lower average CFRs and that subsequent links in the chain of MERS-CoV infection may decrease in severity.","Quantification of the reporting rate, i.e. the ratio of confirmed and suspected cases to total infections, is vital for delineation of the prevalence, scope and potential spread of nCoV. Indeed, the speed and geographic extent of its translocation throughout China and internationally are likely tied to the true prevalence of the pathogen and suggest that there are many more infections (i.e. the reporting rate is low), that contagiousness is not negligible among these undetected infected persons, and that nCoV will be difficult to contain. To contextualize the issue of unreported infection, we here present the findings from a recent proactive sampling project carried out in New York City (NYC) that documented rates of asymptomatic infection and clinical care-seeking among individuals shedding seasonal CoV (types: HKU1, 229E, NL63 and OC43).","Our knowledge about the epidemiologic characteristics of MERS-CoV that impact health care transmission is very limited. To interrupt in-hospital transmission, routes of efficient exposure and virus shedding should be well studied. The contribution of primary cases to the so-called hospital-acquired cases in the recent upsurge of detected cases in the Arabian Peninsula is still unclear, and further epidemiologic data and analyses are necessary. In 1 analysis, 60 of 95 (63.2%) cases with evidence of secondary transmission acquired the infection in the hospital environment; nevertheless, 49 of them had additionally reported exposure to animals, therefore not eliminating an alternative source of infection. 21 The stability of the proportion of asymptomatic versus symptomatic cases is an argument against increasing testing as a possible explanation for either primary or secondary cases. 10 On the other hand, a reverse scenario could be that additional cases are missed because cases at the early incubation period or with low viral loads may be missed with molecular testing. A transmission event under similar circumstances has been described in the community for the first imported MERS-CoV case in the United States that tested negative by molecular assays but subsequently tested positive by serology. 25, 40 Research for the future Active surveillance and testing are of outmost importance to provide answers about the epidemiology of MERS-CoV and evolution of the current epidemic. Case-control, serologic studies in exposed HCWs are needed to better define the effectiveness of infection control measures. Transmission of the virus via asymptomatic shedding in feces or other routes (eg, fomites, environment) is another topic for investigation. Studies of viral kinetics in affected patients with molecular analyses of samples from various body sites will provide answers for infection control as well.","Theoretically, asymptomatic carriers might arise when host antiviral defence is either strong or decoupled. When the immune response effectively limits but could not completely block SARS-CoV-2 replication, asymptomatic shedding might occur. In this scenario, the risk of transmitting to others is relatively low because of a low viral load. Alternatively, if the immune response against SARS-CoV-2 is decoupled from viral replication as in the infection of natural primate hosts with SIVs, the viral load would be higher, posing a higher risk for person-to-person transmission. A careful quantitative analysis of the replication dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 in asymptomatic carriers over time is required to clarify the validity of the two models.","There are a number of important questions still to be answered about the transmission dynamics. These include information about the infectivity during the incubation period; the length of time and virus load during incubation and during the symptomatic period of virus shedding; the incidence and infectiousness of asymptomatic cases, the risk of vertical transmission from mother to fetus35, and other modes of transmission, such as from faeces, saliva and urine. There is some evidence that virus can be isolated from saliva36 and while the initial family cluster found no evidence of virus in stools or urine8, it has since been detected in faeces by PCR in other patients30,37,38 and cultured in one patient, but there has been no evidence of virus in urine. The number of mild or asymptomatic cases has not been determined and relatively few cases have been recorded, but it is probable that current figures only see the tip of the iceberg, and many cases remain undiagnosed19. They pose the greatest threat for increased virus spread27. Information is also needed on the stability of the virus in the environment to better determine transmission risks, and especially the survival of the virus in aerosols and on hard surfaces under different conditions of temperature and humidity.","In an analysis of the first 425 confirmed cases of infection, 73% of cases with illness onset between 12 and 22 January reported no exposure to either a wet market or another person with symptoms of a respiratory illness [2]. The lack of reported exposure to another ill person could be attributed to lack of awareness or recall bias, but China\u2019s health minister publicly warned that pre-symptomatic transmission could be occurring [6]. Determining the extent to which asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic transmission might be occurring is an urgent priority, because it has direct implications for public health and hospital infection control. Data on viral shedding dynamics could help in assessing duration of infectiousness. For severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (SARS-CoV), infectivity peaked at around 10 days after illness onset [7], consistent with the peak in viral load at around that time [8]. This allowed control of the SARS epidemic through prompt detection of cases and strict isolation. For influenza virus infections, virus shedding is highest on the day of illness onset and relatively higher from shortly before symptom onset until a few days after onset [9]. To date, transmission patterns of 2019-nCoV appear more similar to influenza, with contagiousness occurring around the time of symptom onset, rather than SARS.","The copyright holder for this preprint . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.24.20038828 doi: medRxiv preprint were not observed ( Figure 1D ). H. influenzae/haemolyticus was also significantly differentially 72 abundant between HCoV-negative cases and HCoV-negative controls, though the effect size 73 was smaller than between HCoV-positive cases and HCoV-positive controls. Importantly, we 74 community-dwelling children, which is in line with previous reports [7, 8] . HCoV carriage and 79 disease seems, as most viral infections, highly seasonal in children. As aforementioned, mild 80 and asymptomatic paediatric cases with high viral loads are also observed in the current 81 COVID-19 pandemic [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] . The contribution to the spread of the disease by these children 82 currently remains unknown, but is potentially substantial given significant viral shedding also 83 occurs in asymptomatic children [6] , and because they keep mixing with family members and 84 other individuals in the community [12] . is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.","Here, we focus on a third effect. If asymptomatic cases are important for transmission, they also have the potential to affect estimates of key parameters of disease spread such as the basic reproduction number R 0 (i.e., the expected number of secondary cases generated by an average primary case in a fully susceptible population [5] ). Thus, we investigate the relationship between individual-level features of asymptomatic cases (e.g., the probability that an infection is asymptomatic, asymptomatic case duration, transmission by asymptomatic individuals) to dynamics at the population scale.","Some viruses (e.g., the herpes viruses including herpes simplex virus types 1 and 2, cytomegalovirus, varicella-zoster virus, and Epstein-Barr virus) cause infections that persist long after the acute illness. Recovery of any of these viruses other than in the classic acute infection may reflect asymptomatic viral shedding or an opportunistic reactivation causing clinical illness. The viral quantities are greater in clinically significant conditions.","Increasing urinary tract infections among chronic kidney disease patients with asymptomatic bacteriuria Nan-Yao Lee 1 , An-Bang Wu 2 , Yu-Tzu Chang 2 , Chin-Chung Tseng 2 , Wen-Chien Ko 1 *. Background: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is more common, and its prevalence is increasing over the world. Asymptomatic bacteriuria, also referred to as bacteriuria or asymptomatic urinary infection, is a common finding among CKD patients with varying prevalence by age, sex, sexual activity, and in both men and women with abnormalities of the genitourinary tract. The aims of the present study were to determine the prevalence of and the risk factors for asymptomatic bacteriuria among CKD patients. Methods: A prospective study will be conducted at a center in Tainan, Taiwan. Participants if they are aged &gt;20 years with chronic renal disease attending the outpatient clinic will be enrolled in this prospective, observational study. At the initial visit, all subjects were interviewed with a standardized questionnaire and submitted a midstream urine specimen for evaluation of bacteriuria and pyuria. During the subsequent follow-up for one year, the care of participants will be followed the treatment guidelines and clinical practices for CKD according decision of attending physicians. Clinical data will be obtained from a standardized medical chart abstraction by use of uniform data abstraction forms. Results: 482 participants were enrolled, asymptomatic bacteriuria was identified among 41 participants (8.5%). The incidence was 85.1 per 1000 person-years. Participants with diabetes were risk for asymptomatic bacteriuria (P &lt; 0.001). Of 19 (4.0%) cases developed urinary tract infections during following period and there was no fatal case. The participants with asymptomatic bacteriuria (P = 0.017) and diabetic (P = 0.014) participants were risk for development of UTIs. Escherichia coli (30, 70.7%) following Enterococcus species (6, 14.6%) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (3, 7 .3%) were most common identified bacteria of asymptomatic bacteriuria. Conclusion: The diabetic was risk factor associated with asymptomatic bacteriuria and developing UTIs among participants with chronic kidney disease.","Our finding that treatment with FP significantly increased the incidence of AOM during rhinovirus infections was entirely unexpected. This observation may have substantial clinical implications because rhinoviruses are the most common causative agents of URI 33 and steroids are widely used in the treatment of various conditions in both children and adults. No explanations are readily available for the increased risk of AOM caused by FP treatment during rhinovirus infections. Systemic effects of FP are very unlikely because the systemic bioavailability of this drug after intranasal administration is very low (&lt;2%). 34 In adults the use of steroids during rhinovirus infections has been shown to increase the viral titers in the nasopharynx 30 and result in prolonged shedding of rhinoviruses. 32 In this way steroids might inten- sify, rather than suppress, the inflammatory reaction in the nasopharynx, which could lead to more severe dysfunction of the eustachian tube. This theory may not, however, sufficiently explain our present observation because steroids have been reported to increase viral shedding also in infections with causes other than rhinovirus. [35] [36] [37] Furthermore, a recent in vitro study suggested that steroids have no direct effect on rhinovirus replication in cultured respiratory epithelial cells. 38 We found no effect of FP on the incidence of AOM in children with URI caused by enteroviruses or any other viruses. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that intranasal FP might even prevent AOM during some viral infections because the incidence of many viral infections was too low for any meaningful analysis. Taken together, our findings suggest that the effect of FP, and perhaps that of steroids in general, may vary significantly during different viral infections. The use of extensive methods for detection of viruses in nasopharyngeal aspirates enabled us to determine the specific viral cause of URI in more than 80% of the children. Despite the high recovery rate of viruses, the relative distribution of different types of viruses in this study is not generalizable to unselected groups of children because we had to exclude almost one third of all children brought to the study clinic because they already had AOM. Also, it is probable that the parents of the sickest children did not want to participate in any clinical trial. These reasons might at least partly explain the low rates of respiratory syncytial virus and influenza viruses in the study children. In spite of these limitations, our results suggest that enteroviruses have a prominent role in the cause of URI in children. Although enteroviruses have been identified as a cause of URI in children previously, 39 descriptions of enterovirus infections have mostly concentrated on large outbreaks with severely ill patients, 40 and URI is infrequently included in the list of manifestations of enterovirus infections. 41 We conclude that intranasally administered FP does not prevent the development of AOM during URI in children and may even increase the risk of AOM during rhinovirus infections. These findings suggest that the effect of steroids may vary significantly during different respiratory viral infections. Because of the widespread use of steroids and the high prevalence of rhinovirus infections in the community, further studies in this area are needed.","We showed that of the 31 recorded SARS-CoV-2 household transmission clusters there were only three incidences of children being identified as the index case in the family. This observation is supported by previous evidence from China, where a study of 66 family transmission clusters showed that children were never the first in the family to be diagnosed with COVID-19. 62 Similarly, a separate study of 419 household SARS-CoV-2 transmission clusters in China did not detect a single cluster where the index case was under the age of 15, and only three where the index case was under the age of 18. 63 Early observations from Wuhan also suggested that children were most likely to be diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 following an exposure history to a household infection, indicating that even in epidemic areas children were more likely to be contact, rather than index cases. 64, 65 The reasons for these observations remain unclear. These data may reflect an overall lower incidence of infection in children. 2 Alternatively, these data may reflect altered viral shedding (either in titre or duration) in children or an alternate, less efficient route of virus transmission from infected children to adults. 24, 66 It is also possible that children simply have fewer interactions outside .

For children with croup, glucocorticoids and nebulized epinephrine have been associated with improved clinical outcomes. 231, 232 When approved antivirals such as ribavirin have been studied, typically in immunocompromised patients, treatment was not associated with reduction in viral shedding or mortality. 175, 202, [216] [217] [218] [219] 223, 227, [233] [234] [235] [236] [237] [238] [239] [240] One investigational agent, DAS181, which acts by cleaving the sialic acid receptors from the surface of human respiratory epithelial cells, has been shown to improve symptoms, oxygenation, pulmonary function and nasopharyngeal viral loads in treated subjects with PIV infection. [241] [242] [243] [244] Human Metapneumovirus Nature Human metapneumovirus (hMPV) is a nonsegmented negative-sense RNA virus that is a member of the Pneumovirinae subfamily of the Paramyxoviridae. There are two subgroups each with two clades of hMPV (A1, A2, B1 and B2); although all four subtypes typically co-circulate, each season often has one subtype that predominates. 245, 246 hMPV codes for similar genes to RSV except that the order is slightly different (3'-N-P-M-F-M2-SH-G-L-5') and there are no NS1 or NS2 genes. 247 Epidemiology hMPV results in typically self-limited upper and lower respiratory tract infections in all age groups with a global distribution. 248 Symptomatic disease appears to be more common among young children and the elderly. 249 Risk factors for hospitalization from hMPV infections in children include age &lt;6 months and the presence of three or more children in the home, whereas female gender, prematurity and genotype B infection were risk factors for severe disease. 250 About 4-9% of children require hospitalization for severe respiratory symptoms or pneumonia. 248, 250 hMPV is identified in 8.5% of adults hospitalized with acute cardiorespiratory illness. 251 Risk factors for hospitalization and severe disease in the elderly include a diagnosis of COPD, asthma, cancer or lung transplantation. The average rate of hospitalization for hMPV (9.8 per 10 000 residents) is similar to the rate for influenza (11.8 per 10 000 residents) in adults \u2265 50 years old. 252 Severe, sometimes fatal infections, including pneumonia, have infection in immunocompetent individuals. In studies of wheezing children, 64% had serologic evidence of primary infection. Further, several studies that include asymptomatic control patients have documented an association between presence of HBoV and clinical symptoms. Additionally, these studies have documented a positive correlation between high copy numbers of HBoV1 DNA and HBoV1 monoinfection and respiratory symptoms. 275 Although the exact route of transmission of human bocaviruses is unknown, transmission by inhalation or contact with infectious sputum, feces or urine is probable. The mechanism of cell entry and host range are not known. Although most HBoV1 is detected in the upper airway, clinical symptoms and positive BAL specimens suggest that HBoV1 is capable of infecting the lower airways down to at least the bronchioles. 275 HBoV1 DNA is detectable in the serum suggesting dissemination beyond the airway. Likewise, HBoV1 can rarely be detected in stool with and without gastrointestinal symptoms suggesting passive spread from the respiratory to the gastrointestinal tract. 275 In vitro, HBoV1 induces IL-13, IFN-\u03b3 and IL-10 in CD4+ T cells. Children with HBoV1-associated bronchiolitis have increased levels of IFN-\u03b3, IL-2 and IL-4 in nasopharyngeal aspirates. [280] [281] [282] Prevention There is no vaccine available for HBoV. 275 Specialist advice should be sought regarding appropriate isolation practice for patients with proven HBoV infections.","Simultaneously with the discovery of HBoV in 2005, multiplexing methods started to become an accepted diagnostic tool and as a consequence detection of multiple infections, especially in respiratory tract diseases, has become a common phenomenon. 53, [139] [140] [141] [142] [143] Nowadays, multiple infections with up to six pathogens being simultaneously present in a single respiratory sample are frequent 53, [139] [140] [141] [142] [143] [144] and have misled some researchers to the statement that the human bocavirus, also occurring in asymptomatic patients, is a harmless bystander rather than a pathogen. 145, 146 This hypothesis seems to be supported by the fact that for HBoV a formal fulfilment of Koch's modified postulates was not yet possible 147 because no animal model exists so far and also because volunteer transmission trials cannot be recommended based on our current knowledge. 127 On the contrary, although there is a cohort of asymptomatic carriers, 53, 104, 139, 146, 148, 149 several studies have shown that HBoV induces clinical symptoms. 50, 77, 111, 112, 139, [150] [151] [152] [153] [154] [155] [156] The asymptomatic viral shedding is meanwhile believed to originate from a long term shedding after an acute infection or from persisting viruses, 26, 27, 81, 122, [157] [158] [159] [160] most recently confirmed by a long term prospective cohort study. 53, 161 Thereby, it was shown that the rate of asymptomatic HBoV infections is similar to the rate of rhinovirus infections, and no one would doubt that rhinoviruses are true pathogens. 53 Moreover, HBoV induces a serious cytopathic effect in infected cell cultures, which is a typical feature of a pathogen. 14,32,45,157","Correction of hypoxemia is the most important aspect of managing RSV lower respiratory tract disease. Ribavirin is highly active against RSV in vitro, and aerosolized ribavirin has been shown to reduce viral shedding and shorten the course of illness in some but not all studies. Aerosolized ribavirin is currently recommended for use only in selected infants and young children who are at high risk for serious RSV disease. 262 In immunosuppressed patients, particularly hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients, both aerosolized ribavirin and high-dose oral ribavirin have been used for early treatment to prevent progression to pneumonia. 263 Recent studies suggest that intermittent aerosolized ribavirin is as effective as continuous aerosolized ribavirin in these patients. 264 Once RSV pneumonia has developed, intravenous ribavirin alone is ineffective but, if treatment is initiated before the onset of respiratory failure, combinations of aerosolized ribavirin with intravenous immunoglobulin, and particularly paluvizumab (see later) may be beneficial. 265, 266 In adults, short courses of systemic corticosteroids for RSV-related wheezing did not affect viral loads or shedding and only mildly diminished antibody responses. 267 An effective vaccine for prevention of RSV has not yet been developed. In a study of formalin-inactivated RSV vaccine conducted in the 1960s, vaccinated infants developed more severe disease compared with unvaccinated children. 268 The mechanisms of this enhancement remain uncertain, although studies in those vaccine recipients and in rodent models have implicated low levels or low affinity of the antibodies induced by the formalin-inactivated vaccine, which permitted excessive cytolytic T-cell responses to develop and cause tissue damage. Low-affinity antibodies may also have contributed to immune complex formation and deposition, leading to local inflammation. 269, 270 Formalin-inactivated RSV also primes a T helper 2 response, with high levels of interleukin 4 and interleukin 5, which can promote inflammation of small airways. 271 Although this adverse experience has prompted extra caution, current RSV vaccine development efforts are ongoing and focus on live attenuated and recombinant subunit vaccines.","Next, a two-dose study in 1-2-month-old infants was conducted, with the second dose being used as a surrogate challenge infection. The first dose of vaccine was well tolerated; similar frequencies of fever, congestion, LRI, and OM occurred in vaccinated and unvaccinated children. When children were revaccinated a month after their first exposure, there was much less shedding of vaccine virus with the second dose. In patients who received their second dose 3 months after the first, virus shedding was detected with greater frequency than after the 1-month challenge. Vaccination resulted in a significant rise in serum IgA anti-HN in 84% of children but did not result in significant HAI titer changes. Five children had temperature-sensitive intermediate viruses recovered during follow-up. All five formed plaques at 39 \u2022 C, represented a small fraction (1%) of the total viral population, presented at the peak of viral shedding and were cleared at the same rate as fully temperature-sensitive viruses, and were not associated with changes in clinical status. From these studies, it is clear that the cp45 HPIV3 vaccine is well-tolerated and immunogenic in infants and children but uncommonly may partially revert. Multiple doses will be needed in infancy and the interval between doses should not be more than 2 months.","The shedding of MERS-CoV was more extensive in the immunosuppressed animals, both in duration as in peak shedding. This suggests that the immune status has direct influence on virus shedding and subsequent potential of transmission. The epidemiological analyses of the 2015 MERS-CoV outbreak in South Korea clearly showed that only the level of MERS-CoV shedding was directly associated with transmission potential. Where spreaders had statistically lower Ct values compared to non-spreaders (25). The persistent MERS-CoV shedding in immunocompromised patients (23) could, therefore, contribute to enhanced nosocomial transmission.","\u2022 Are camels the source of sporadic human infections and if so, why is MERS-CoV seroprevalence among humans working closely with camels, so low? \u2022 What is the route of transmission to humans and between humans and what is the best personal protective equipment to be adopted by frontline HCWs? \u2022 Which hospital IPC measures are insufficient or insufficiently employed to halt the transmission of MERS-CoV and what is the extent of transmission and clinical impact of, and nosocomial infection by, other co-occurring respiratory viruses in these settings in the KSA? \u2022 Why are males more often afflicted than females?

Most coronaviruses cause diseases in their particular host species; 1 those that can infect humans through cross-species transmission have become an important threat to public health. Two serious coronavirus disease outbreaks have happened in the past two decades: severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003, 2 and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) in 2012. 3 Since December, 2019, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been recognised as the causal factor in a series of severe cases of pneumonia originating in Wuhan in Hubei province, China. 4 This disease has been named coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) by WHO. SARS-CoV-2 has been shown to cause disease via a mechanism analogous to the SARS coronavirus, with potential damage to vital organs such as lung, heart, liver, and kidney, and infection poses a considerable risk to patients by the high prevalence of pneumonia. 5 By March 1, 2020, SARS-CoV-2 had led to 80 981 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in China, and 44 067 cases in 117 countries. 6 A cohort study of 44 672 Chinese cases reported that 2\u00b71% of patients were younger than 20 years, and 1\u00b72% were asymptomatic. 7 Pneumonia is the leading cause of mortality in children. 8 Distinct immunological responses to viral infections can exist in children and result in severe damage to vital organs. 9 Although short-to-medium-term outcomes for children who recovered from SARS seemed good, the disease caused exercise impairment after more than 6 months. 10 A comprehensive literature search indicated that MERS was rare in children (31 cases identified between 2012 and 2016), 11 because transmission depends heavily on animal exposure and direct contact in the household or health-care facilities. Collectively, these two coronavirus diseases did not widely affect children because of the short-term epidemic of SARS and the strict transmission route of MERS. In a study of 15 children with COVID-19 (aged 4-14 years), six patients had small nodular ground-glass opacities in the lungs. 12 At the time of the COVID-19 outbreak, all schools were on the spring festival holiday, which might have prevented children from exposure to transmission sources. However, the school community is a place that can enhance rapid spread of the highly infectious SARS-CoV-2.","Asymptomatic infections experienced by children infected with SARS-CoV-2 could have important implications for transmission. Specifically, a number of asymptomatic or mild paediatric cases could result in children driving the intra-household transmission of SARS-CoV-2. 8 To investigate this hypothesis, we examined the available published data on SARS-CoV-2 household transmission clusters. A total of 31 household transmission clusters were identified with sufficient information available to include in this analysis (Table 2 ). These cases were drawn from China, Singapore, the USA, Vietnam, and South Korea. Of these transmission clusters, only three (9\u00b77%) were identified as having a paediatric index case (Table 2) . Importantly, these data do not suggest that children are not becoming infected with SARS-CoV-2, as isolated paediatric SARS-CoV-2 infections would not be captured in reports of household transmission (and are indeed shown in Table 1 ). Rather, these data suggest that to date, children have not been the primary source of household SARS-CoV-2 infections.","Adenoviruses are medium-sized DNA viruses that attach to host cells through the coxsackie B virus-adenovirus receptor. 70 The variation in tissue tropism of individual adenovirus species or serotypes may be attributable to differential receptor expression or binding to alternative receptors. Following endocytosis and nuclear localization, early gene expression inhibits various host immune responses and initiates viral replication, whereas late gene expression directs viral assembly and release through host cell lysis. Human adenoviruses have no animal reservoir and do not infect other species; nonhuman adenoviruses that infect other species do not cause zoonotic disease. The traditional classification of human adenoviruses is complex and includes at least 52 serotypes. Adenoviruses have also been divided into 7 species (A-G) based on various biological and biochemical characteristics; each species includes more than 1 serotype and each serotype includes multiple genotypes. Although there is no strict correlation between species or serotype and disease manifestation, it is possible to make certain generalizations; for example, respiratory disease is caused by species B, C, and E, whereas species F causes gastroenteritis. A comprehensive review of serotype associations with disease has recently been published. 71 Adenoviruses lack an outer envelope and are relatively resistant to dessication, low pH, and gastric or biliary secretions. The predominant routes of transmission include direct contact with aerosolized droplets in military settings, fecal-oral spread among children or those with prolonged shedding in the stool, and exposure to infected fomites, blood, or tissues. After an incubation period that varies from 2 days to 2 weeks, adenoviruses may be cleared or may cause long-standing asymptomatic infection of","\u2022 DAS181 is an investigational compound with activity against parainfluenza and influenza viruses. \u2022 An orally inhaled sialidase, it reduces virus binding to epithelial cells. \u2022 It has been used to treat parainfluenza virus type 3 infections in immunosuppressed patients. 18 Approximately 30% of drugtreated ambulatory children and adults and 80% of hospitalized children or immunocompromised patients shed resistant virus. 1921 Immunocompetent individuals shedding resistant virus resolve their illness promptly, 22 whereas immunocompromised hosts may experi ence prolonged illness associated with persistent virus shedding. 20 Transmission of M2 inhibitor-resistant virus, associated with failure of drug prophylaxis, occurs in household contacts of treated index cases 23 and in nursing home residents. 24 Resistant variants can cause typical influenza illness. It is prudent to avoid contact between treated patients and susceptible highrisk contacts and to avoid use of treat ment (specifically of young children) and postexposure prophylaxis in the same household.","Human bocavirus, a member of the Parvoviridae family, was discovered in 2005 in nasopharyngeal aspirates from children with respiratory tract infections. 7 Although suspected, establishing its role as a respiratory pathogen has been difficult for several reasons. First, human bocavirus is not related to any known human respiratory pathogen. Second, it is commonly detected with other respiratory viruses, which have established pathogenic potential. Third, detection may simply reflect asymptomatic persistence or prolonged viral shedding, since other human parvoviruses also show this capacity. It has been suggested that human bocavirus may be reactivated or produce a transient asymptomatic super-infection triggered by the presence of another replicating respiratory agent.","Although less than 1% of infections with these viruses results in FHF, the hepatotropic viruses, hepatitis A and B, cause most cases of FHF with a definitive viral diagnosis. Studies in adults with FHF have found hepatitis A to be the cause in 4% to 10% and hepatitis B in 10% to 45% of the reported cases. 19 A greater percentage of cases of FHF in children may be due to hepatitis A. 20 Many other viruses have been implicated in fulminant hepatitis including hepatitis C, D, E, and G, as well as HSV. Infants with perinatally acquired hepatitis B and C rarely have symptoms, and fulminant hepatitis in infants is more likely to be associated with systemic illness due to enteroviruses, HSV, human herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6), or CMV. 21 Infants born to women with both HBsAg (hepatitis B surface antigen) and anti-HBeAb (hepatitis B e-antibody) appear to be at greater risk for fulminant hepatitis due to perinatally acquired hepatitis B. 22 Infection with hepatitis C rarely causes FHF; however, there are case reports of fulminant hepatitis both with postnatally and perinatally acquired hepatitis C in children. 23, 24 The prevalence of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection as a cause of FHF appears to have geographic variability. Most studies from the United States and Europe have failed to show the presence of HCV-RNA in patients with non-A, non-B FHF 25 ; however, in several Japanese series, HCV-RNA has been shown in a significant number of patients with non-A, non-B FHF. 26 Coinfection with hepatitis B virus (HBV) and HCV has been associated with a worse prognosis. 19 HSV should be considered as a cause of FHF, particularly in patients with minimally elevated bilirubin levels. Risk factors for HSV hepatitis include pregnancy and immune suppression. 27 Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is an enterically transmitted virus that causes epidemic hepatitis in many areas of the world, particularly the Indian subcontinent and Southeast Asia. It is not endemic in Western countries.","This study provides unique data on the circulation of viruses associated with upper respiratory tract infections in Gabon. The highest prevalence of viral infections concerned AdV, EV, RSV, HRV, PIV3, SIB. Theses pathogens have the highest prevalence among children under five years old. The responsible viruses were similar to those reported on other continents except for adenoviruses whose prevalence is higher. However adenoviruses can be detected in asymptomatic persons. The prevalence of RSV, influenza virus, PIV3, EV and HRV increased during the rainy season. Ongoing surveillance is necessary to identify circulating strains of influenza virus and thus to respond rapidly to outbreaks. Our findings should help to improve the therapeutic management of patients presenting with influenza-like illness, especially regarding the use of antibacterial agents.","Enteric fever (the inclusive term for typhoid and paratyphoid fever) is caused by infection with Salmonella enterica serotype Typhi (S. typhi) or serotype Paratyphi (S. paratyphi). The disease is transmitted via the fecal-oral route from food or water contaminated by an acutely ill person or a chronic carrier. 188 Human beings are the only known reservoir. Most infections today occur in countries where sanitary conditions are poor; the Indian subcontinent has a particularly high incidence. 188 Travelers to these areas can also be affected. Although S. typhi causes 80% of infections, S. paratyphi may be more important among travelers, possibly due to a vaccine effect that only protects against S. typhi. 188 In indigenous populations, enteric fever is a disease of young children and adolescents, whereas among travelers, the age of the patients reflects the age of travelers. 188 Ingestion of the organism is followed by an asymptomatic period of about 7 days, during which the organism multiplies within mononuclear phagocytic cells in Peyer patches, mesenteric lymph nodes, liver, and spleen. 189 This is followed by a bacteremic phase, with fever, chills, headache, and rose spots. During this phase, invasion of the gallbladder occurs, either directly or from infected bile. Chronic biliary carriage occurs in 2% to 5% of cases, even after treatment, particularly among women, the elderly, and patients with cholelithiasis. 188, 189 In these cases, shedding of virus continues for more than a year and is a public health risk. The majority of patients experience minor degrees of hepatomegaly and elevated transaminases. However, the presentation can resemble acute viral hepatitis, with very high transaminases or even fulminant hepatic failure, although coinfection with HAV or HEV may be responsible for some of these the blood, they have a predilection for the central nervous system and placenta. 197 Hepatic involvement can manifest as solitary liver abscess, multiple liver abscesses, or hepatitis ( Fig. 10-24) . 157, 197 Solitary liver abscess is associated with diabetes mellitus, absence of bacteremia or extrahepatic manifestations, and a relatively good prognosis. 157, 197 Multiple liver abscesses are more often associated with bacteremia, extrahepatic sites of involvement, and meningitis and carry a worse prognosis. 157, 197 Diffuse hepatitis is associated with underlying conditions such as viral hepatitis, pregnancy, or alcohol abuse. 197, 198 Bacteremia is highly likely in cases with diffuse hepatitis. The histology is that of chronic active hepatitis with extensive necroinflammatory activity and occasionally granulomas. 198 The diagnosis is made by culture of the organism from blood or abscess material.","The present study has 2 shortcomings. Viral PCR was studied approximately 6 years after the acute episode, and therefore good-quality frozen NPA specimens obtained on entry into the study were available for only 80% of the children. Thus the risk analyses for the later outcome at early school age had to be restricted to those 66 cases with both NPA specimens and adequate follow-up data available. In addition, we did not have a control group with no history of early childhood wheezing. Nevertheless, there was a recent Finnish study on RV, enterovirus, and coronavirus findings by RT-PCR in asymptomatic children 24 that showed the viral detection rate by RT-PCR to be low (5%) when no preceding, concurrent, or following respiratory symptoms were reported. In the present study, the viral detection rate by RT-PCR in wheezing children was greater than 8-fold (44% in all). In case of RVs, the detection rate in wheezing children was approximately 3-fold. Consequently, we consider RVs to be important infective agents that are able to induce wheezing in susceptible children. In addition, the prevalence of school-age asthma has been carefully studied in our area in recent years, the criteria for asthma being with minor modifications similar to the criteria used in the present study; the prevalence in those studies has been stable (4% to 4.5%). 16, 32 Thus, RVinduced wheezing in infancy was associated with multiplied occurrence of asthma (up to 70%) in later childhood.","White blood cells ( unclear routes of transmission, were identified. This transmission feature means that identification of these paediatric patients was straightforward. However, previous work has shown that potential transmission routes of SARS-CoV-2 can be highly variable, 20 compared with MERS coronavirus, which is less transmissible. 11 This situation could be altered if COVID-19 persists for a long time in an area with increased risk for communityacquired infections. Among the paediatric patients in our study, just under a third were asymptomatic. Moreover, a fifth had pneumonia only and needed radiographic examination to be identified. Symptoms seen on admission were variable, including cough and fever. All asymptomatic patients and children who did not present with pneu monia needed laboratory and radiographic examinations for diagnosis. The large proportion of children with asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection contrasts with paediatric patients with H1N1 influenza 19 and SARS, 10 and adult patients with 17 in terms of presenting symptoms such as cough and pharyngeal congestion (table 3) , indicating SARS-CoV-2 has little effect on the upper respiratory tract of children. COVID-19 is highly transmissible, similar to SARS and H1N1 influenza, but can have a covert presentation in children.","Since zoonotic diseases can easily be transmitted to man in several ways, they target persons who work closely with animals; this plays a big role in zoonotic transmission. Such persons working with animals include veterinarians, slaughterers/butchers, farmers, researchers, pet owners (e.g., through bites and/or scratches of owners of indoor pet-animals), and animal feeders in animal companies using animal products, via animals used for food (e.g., meat, dairy, eggs, birds, infected domestic poultry, and other birds). Furthermore, transmission can also occur through animal vectors (e.g., tick bite, and insects like mosquitoes or flea) [4,14,15]. In addition, in the transmission of bacteria in comparison with viruses, the role of contaminated food and water, the importance of international travels as well as changes in land use and agriculture, are important [4,9]. According to recent WHO data, more than 75% of the different zoonotic diseases that may cause illnesses in humans are transmitted through animals and/or animal products [16]. Nevertheless, several zoonotic pathogens may be transmitted from various animals to man via several direct and/or indirect pathways such as close contact with the infected animals that might be shedding the infectious pathogen, when humans use contaminated sources of food or water, and/or by outdoor or indoor animal scratches or bites [17,18,19,20,21]. The prevention and control strategies against zoonotic pathogens are considered important issues and a global challenge requiring efforts of all veterinarian and medical staff [22].","Primary HPIV infection occurs early in childhood and by age 5 virtually all children are seropositive. Reinfections are frequent, but disease severity in reinfections is inversely proportional to the titer of serum-neutralizing antibody elicited by the previous infection. HPIV-1 and -3 are the types most frequently associated with LRI in children, the immunocompromised, the chronically ill, and the elderly, whereas HPIV-4 causes mostly URI in children and adults. In most temperate regions of both hemispheres, HPIV-1 causes outbreaks in the fall of alternate years, either alone or in cocirculation with HPIV-2. HPIV-3 causes spring and summer outbreaks in temperate areas, but circulates endemically throughout the year, especially in immunocompromised or chronically ill, whereas HPIV-4 occurs sporadically throughout the year in children and adults. In tropical regions, higher HPIV activity occurs during rainy seasons. HPIV spreads mainly within families and closed communities, such as nurseries, day care centers, and pediatric wards, with high secondary attack rates. The virus does not persist long in the environment and is transmitted mainly by large droplets and fomites. Viral shedding usually lasts 3-10 days, but prolonged shedding for months has been reported in very young children and immunosuppressed hosts. The rate of HPIV infection in infants is similar to that of HRSV, but HPIV causes less hospitalizations than HRSV.","The fact that we have subsequently identified milder or asymptomatic cases of MERS in HCWs, children and family members of contacts of MERS cases indicates that the severe cases represent only the tip of the iceberg, and there is a spectrum of milder clinical disease that requires definition. Our data indicate that MERS-CoV affects both genders, and, although a few cases of MERS-CoV in children have been detected, it remains mainly a disease of adults across all age groups. To date, there is still no evidence of sustained community transmission. Despite extensive investigation and testing of thousands of contacts by the KSA-MoH, only a few instances of transmission to HCWs or family contacts have been identified. Almost all patients who died or who had been hospitalized had severe disease or other comorbidities [9, 10] . The mortality rate and severity of disease are exaggerated to some degree by the detection of such cases. The case-fatality rate has fallen in recent months, owing to the detection of milder and asymptomatic cases [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] . The most critical characteristic of pandemic MERS-CoV strains would be progression to efficient human-to-human transmission. The number of sporadic MERS cases being reported has been small, and indicates that the virus appears to be not readily capable of rapid human-to-human transmission. Two million pilgrims from over 180 countries, and 1 million local KSA pilgrims, have very recently visited Makkah and Madinah, KSA to perform the 2013 annual Hajj pilgrimage, and have returned home after stays of between 2 and 8 weeks [28] . Millions of others will visit the KSA throughout the year for the mini-pilgrimage UMRAH, and although MERS-CoV infection rates in the KSA remain at steady, low levels, and no significant increase in the incidence of MERS-CoV infection over time is occurring, pro-active surveillance for MERS-CoV in newly diagnosed patients and their contacts will continue. The availability of more rapid and accurate serological tests will help to better define the community prevalence of MERS-CoV.","Hospitalization for wheezing in infancy is a wellknown risk factor for later asthma. 13 In accord with earlier findings considering the same study cohort, 12,13 RSV infection was found to be associated with a relatively low risk of later childhood asthma among young children hospitalized for wheezing. However, when the later occurrence of asthma among RSV-positive children (15%) is compared with the prevalence of asthma (4%) among nonselected school-aged children of our area, 16 the risk for asthma is increased among RSV-positive children as well. However, the RSV-associated risk for later asthma was not as high as that in a controlled study by Sigurs et al, 20 in which the risk was increased up to 12-fold. Enteroviruses were as common as parainfluenza viruses in the wheezing infants. Similar proportions-5% to 10%-have been suggested in earlier studies of respiratory infections in wheezing children. [3] [4] [5] No association was found, however, between enteroviruses and atopy or later asthma. There is 1 previous study stressing the role of coronaviruses in lower respiratory tract infections in children. 21 In accord with findings by Rakes et al, 5 we were not able to identify any coronavirus positive cases. RVs are considered the most common causative agents in upper respiratory infections at all ages. 22 There is evidence that RVs might also cause lower respiratory infections in young children. 1 The figure in the present study (33%) is close to that published by Juv\u00e9n et al 2 for pneumonia in children. In asymptomatic children with no preceding or concurrent respiratory symptoms, RVs have been detected in 12% to 13% of the NPAs by RT-PCR. 23, 24 Those detection rates are clearly lower than the RV detection rate in wheezing children in the present study.","There were clear differences in periods of virus shedding after corticosteroid treatment between the groups of calves primary infected with different BHVl strains, e.g. calves given the Cooper strain had by far the longest virus shedding periods from nose and eye. These differences in virus shedding did, however, not result in marked differences in isotypespecific antibody responses between the groups of calves.","This Article documents the first known person-to-person transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in the USA. Transmission occurred between close household contacts, from an index travel-associated case who subsequently transmitted the infection to her husband. Their prolonged, unprotected close contact occurred across multiple days early in her illness, before Patient 1 sought clinical care. No additional cases of COVID-19 were identified through active symptom monitoring of several hundred community and health-care personnel contacts, testing of symptomatic PUIs, or screening of a subset of asymptomatic healthcare personnel contacts. These data suggest that personto-person transmission of COVID-19 might be most likely to occur through unprotected, prolonged exposure to a patient with symptomatic COVID-19. Our experience of limited transmission of SARS-CoV-2 differs from that documented in Wuhan, where transmission has been reported to occur across the wider community and in health-care personnel, 6 and from experiences of other similar coronaviruses. [17] [18] [19] The severity of illness, the extent of viral shedding, and timing of exposures to a symptomatic patient might all have contributed to the limited transmission described here. Infection control measures within the hospital setting and an aggressive public health response might also have prevented further exposures.","In conclusion, these data indicate that BBG2Na + alum is immunogenic in the elderly and that a single dose regimen probably suffices. However, safety monitoring would be an essential component for the phase III efficacy studies. (Peter Wright, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN) RSV affects 75% of children during their first year of life and is responsible for over 100,000 hospitalizations and 500 deaths per year in children. The additional costs attributable to RSV infection has been calculated to be over US$ 300 million per year. Although 53% of children have no risk factors, many children that have infections severe enough to require hospitalization were born premature, had congenital heart disease, or bronchopulmonary dysplasia. RSV causes illness from December to March and accounts for 4% of URIs among community-dwelling children and 17% of LRIs. To help combat this disease, a cold-passage, live-attenuated vaccine was created using reverse genetics. The resultant 248/404/ SH temperature-sensitive, attenuated virus has been used to vaccinate unscreened adults, RSV seropositive children 15-59 months old, RSV seronegative children 6-24 months, and 1-2-month-old infants. After a 10 5 initial dose, only 1/15 adults and 1/10 seropositive children had recoverable virus. Of those with recoverable virus, the titer was quite low (1.6 log 10 ). Seronegative children shed virus in nasal secretions with a peak viral titer of 2-4 log 10 ; most of the seronegative children ceased shedding within 12 days.","Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is an enveloped, single-stranded RNA paramyxovirus that includes two major groups, A and B, each of which consists of 5 to 6 genotypes. The RSV genome encodes two nonstructural (NS1 and NS2) and nine structural proteins, including the F (fusion) and G (attachment) glycoproteins on the viral envelope. Antibodies against the F and G proteins are neutralizing, and have been shown to confer protection against RSV infection in animal models. Immunity after primary infection (which generally occurs by 2 years of age) is partial and short-lived; thus, reinfections can occur throughout life. 120 Low serum neutralizing antibody levels in adults predicts infection risk and disease severity. 121 Immunologic mechanisms (e.g. cytokine responses) have been implicated in the pathogenesis of severe RSV diseases; however, emerging evidence suggests that uncontrolled viral replication, as indicated by high respiratory tract viral load, drives disease manifestations and is associated with severe clinical outcomes. 120, [122] [123] [124] [125] Such findings provide an important rationale for the approach to antiviral drug development against RSV. 122 Epidemiology RSV is known to be an important cause of lower respiratory tract infection in infants and young children (e.g. acute bronchiolitis, wheezy attacks), resulting in hospitalizations and deaths. 126 In adults, it has been estimated that RSV infects 3-10% of the population Prevention There is no vaccine or chemoprophylaxis available for coronaviruses at present. 102 Droplet and contact precautions, including the use of face masks, are advisable to prevent transmission. As transmission could be opportunistically airborne, appropriate isolation precautions (in negative-pressure facilities if available) should be implemented in all hospitalized patients confirmed with novel coronavirus infections, particularly when respiratory procedures and devices are applied. [88] [89] [90] [91] Diagnostic Microbiology A high index of suspicion, together with detailed clinical and epidemiological assessments (e.g. travel history to affected areas, case clustering), is required for the diagnosis of novel coronavirus infections. 88, 103 RT-PCR is the diagnostic test of choice. A combination of upper respiratory (nasal, pharyngeal, nasopharyngeal), lower respiratory (higher yield due to higher viral levels, e.g. sputum, tracheal aspirate, bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) whenever available), blood and fecal samples, and repeated sampling should be considered to maximize the chance of virus detection. [103] [104] [105] A single negative test from an upper respiratory sample may be insufficient to rule out the diagnosis. For SARS-CoV, plasma RT-PCR can detect viremia as early as day 2-3 after symptom onset, and its level may have prognostic value. 88, 99 Virus culture (e.g. using Vero cells) is confirmatory, but the delay to a result prevents its use for clinical management; also biosafety level-3 facilities are required. Serological diagnosis is retrospective and largely used for epidemiological surveillance purposes. 103 Clinicians should refer to their local reference laboratories for coronavirus testing (e.g. pancoronavirus RT-PCR, specific SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV RT-PCR). 87, 91 Clinical Manifestations","The comparison of paediatric patients with COVID-19 with adult patients with COVID-19 in the same city (table 3) showed that paediatric patients had a significantly lower prevalence of abnormal values of several variables indicating disease severity, such as fever (36% for children and 86% for adults), cough (19% and 62%), pneumonia (53% and 95%), elevated C-reactive protein (3% and 49%), and severe disease type (0% and 23%; p&lt;0\u00b70001 for all features). Nevertheless, no differences were noted between children and adults in prevalence of leucopenia, lymphopenia, and elevated myocardial enzymes. When compared with children with SARS, paediatric patients with COVID-19 had much milder disease in terms of the prevalence of fever, cough, pneumonia, and severe case type. Compared with children with H1N1 influenza, paediatric patients with COVID-19 had fewer upper respiratory symptoms (eg, cough and pharyngeal congestion) but pneumonia was more frequent. Notably, when the three groups of patients with coronavirus infections were compared with the paediatric patients with H1N1 influenza, the most striking difference was that patients with H1N1 influenza had a much higher prevalence of pharyngeal congestion and a lower prevalence of pneumonia.

We show that the impact of asymptomatic transmission depends on generation intervals (i.e., time between when an individual is infected and when that individual infects another person). If the generation-interval distribution of asymptomatic transmission differs from that of symptomatic transmission, then estimates of the basic reproduction number which do not explicitly account for asymptomatic cases may be systematically biased. Specifically, if asymptomatic cases have a shorter generation interval than symptomatic cases, R_0 will be over-estimated, and if they have a longer generation interval, R_0 will be under-estim...","Lack of evidence on SARS-CoV-2 transmission dynamics has led to shifting isolation guidelines between airborne and droplet isolation precautions. During the initial isolation of 13 individuals confirmed positive with COVID-19 infection, air and surface samples were collected in eleven isolation rooms to examine viral shedding from isolated individuals. While all individuals were confirmed positive for SARS-CoV-2, symptoms and viral shedding to the environment varied considerably. Many commonly used items, toilet facilities, and air samples had evidence of viral contamination, indicating that SARS-CoV-2 is shed to the environment as expired particles, during toileting, and through contact with fomites. Disease spread through both direct (droplet and person-to-person) as well as indirect contact (contaminated objects and airborne transmission) are indicated, supporting the use of airborne isolation precautions.","We report temporal patterns of viral shedding in 94 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients and modelled COVID-19 infectiousness profile from a separate sample of 77 infector-infectee transmission pairs. We observed the highest viral load in throat swabs at the time of symptom onset, and inferred that infectiousness peaked on or before symptom onset. We estimated that 44% of transmission could occur before first symptoms of the index. Disease control measures should be adjusted to account for probable substantial pre-symptomatic transmission.","Diagnosis is the key point for confirmation and treatment of COVID-19. we focused on comparative analysis of virus dynamics between the upper respiratory and feces specimens in the COVID-19 patients. A total of 66 upper respiratory swabs, 51 feces, 56 urine and 56 plasma samples were sequentially collected from 23 patients in a designated hospital. The plasma and urine samples were all negative, except for urine samples from two severe cases at the latest available detection point. Conversely, virus was shed in respiratory swabs and feces samples during the diseased period. Ten of 12 (83.3%) cases were positive for feces samples, while 14 of 21 (66.7%) were positive for respiratory samples. In addition, the median duration of virus shedding was 10.0 days (IQR 8.0 to 17.0) in the upper respiratory swabs, but was 22.0 days (IQR 15.5 to 23.5) for the feces. Notably, at 26 days after discharge, case 3 (a 45-year-old) was detected positive again in the feces samples, but appears to be healt...","Abstract SARS-CoV-2 can be shed in the stool of patients in the recovery phase. Children show a longer shedding time than adults. We analyzed the possible causes of this finding and recommend that a negative stool sample be included in a patient\u2019s discharge criteria.","The number of confirmed COVID-19 cases admitted in hospitals is continuously increasing in the Philippines. Frontline health care workers are faced with imminent risks of getting infected. In this study, we formulate a theoretical model to calculate the risk of being infected in health care facilities considering the following factors: the average number of encounters with a suspected COVID-19 patient per hour; interaction time for each encounter; work shift duration or exposure time; crowd density, which may depend on the amount of space available in a given location; and availability and effectiveness of protective gears and facilities provided for the frontline health care workers. Based on the simulation results, we recommend the following: (i) decrease the rate of patient encounter per frontline health care worker, e.g., maximum of three encounters per hour in a 12-hour work shift duration; (ii) decrease the interaction time between the frontline health care worker and the patient...","Abstract Objective To determine the dynamic changes of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA in respiratory and fecal specimens in children with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Methods From January 17, 2020 to February 23, 2020, three paediatric cases of COVID-19 were reported in Qingdao, Shandong Province, China. Epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment data were collected. Patients were followed up to March 10, 2020, and dynamic profiles of nucleic acid testing results in throat swabs and fecal specimens were closely monitored. Results Clearance of SARS-CoV-2 in respiratory tract occurred within two weeks after abatement of fever, whereas viral RNA remained detectable in stools of pediatric patients for longer than 4 weeks. Two children had fecal SARS-CoV-2 undetectable 20 days after throat swabs showing negative, while that of another child lagged behind for 8 days. Conclusions SARS-CoV-2 may exist in child...","BACKGROUND: Since its identification on the 7th of January 2020, SARS-CoV-2 has spread to more than 180 countries worldwide, causing &gt;11,000 deaths. At present, viral disease and transmission amongst children is incompletely understood. Specifically, there is concern that children could be an important source of SARS-CoV-2 in household transmission clusters. METHODS: We performed an observational study analysing literature published between December 2019 and March 2020 of the clinical features of SARS-CoV-2 in children and descriptions of household transmission clusters of SARS-CoV-2. In these studies the index case of each cluster defined as the individual in the household cluster who first developed symptoms. FINDINGS: Drawing on studies from China, Singapore, South Korea, Japan, and Iran a broad range of clinical symptoms were observed in children. These ranged from asymptomatic to severe disease. Of the 31 household transmission clusters that were identified, 9.7% (3/31) were ident...","Abstract Since the emergence of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in 2012, many questions remain on modes of transmission and sources of virus. In outbreak situations, especially with emerging organisms causing severe human disease, it is important to understand the full spectrum of disease, and shedding kinetics in relation to infectivity and the ability to transmit the microorganism. Laboratory response capacity during the early stages of an outbreak focuses on development of virological and immunological methods for patient diagnosis, for contact tracing, and for epidemiological studies into sources, modes of transmission, identification of risk groups, and animal reservoirs. However, optimal use of this core public health laboratory capacity requires a fundamental understanding of kinetics of viral shedding and antibody response, of assay validation and of interpretation of test outcomes. We reviewed available data from MERS-CoV case reports, and compared this...","Background: Severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a newly identified virus which mainly spreads from person-to-person. Fecal shedding of SARS-CoV-2 has been constantly reported in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Most published studies focus on adult populations, whereas data concerning pediatric patients is relatively scarce. Methods: From January 17, 2020 to March 6, 2020, three pediatric cases of COVID-19 were reported in Qingdao, Shandong Province, China. Epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment data of these children were collected. Real-time fluorescence reverse-transcriptase-polymerase-chain reaction (RT-PCR) was performed to detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA in throat swabs and fecal specimens. Results: All the three pediatric cases were household contacts of adults whose symptoms developed earlier. There has been no evidence showing the virus was transmitted from the children to others. Severity of disease of ...","During the current COVID-19 pandemic, testing kit and RNA extraction kit availability has become a major limiting factor in the ability to determine patient disease status and accurately quantify prevalence. Current testing strategies rely on individual tests of cases matching restrictive diagnostic criteria to detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA, limiting testing of asymptomatic and mild cases. Testing these individuals is one effective way to understand and reduce the spread of COVID-19. Here, we develop a pooled testing strategy to identify these low-risk individuals. Drawing on the well-studied group testing literature, modeling suggests practical changes to testing protocols which can reduce test costs and stretch a limited test kit supply. When most tests are negative, pooling reduces the total number of tests up to four-fold at 2% prevalence and eight-fold at 0.5% prevalence. At current SARS-CoV-2 prevalence, randomized group testing optimized per country could double the number of tested ind...","Abstract Background It is unknown to what extent the human coronaviruses (HCoVs) OC43, HKU1, 229E and NL63 infect healthy children. Frequencies of infections are only known for hospitalized children. Objectives Comparing infection frequencies in children who have mild infections with frequencies in children needing hospital uptake will determine whether infection by one of the four HCoVs leads to more severe disease. In addition, the sequence of seroconversions can reveal whether infection by one HCoV protects from infection by other HCoVs. Study design Two distinct study groups were monitored: healthy children and children hospitalized due to respiratory infection. HCoV natural infection rates in healthy children were obtained by serology in 25 newborns (followed 0\u201320months). The frequencies of severe HCoVs infection was determined by real time RT-PCR among 1471 hospitalized infants (&lt;2-years old) with acute respiratory tract disease. Results The majority of healthy children seroconve...","Abstract Medicine shortages have been spreading in European countries. In many cases, the unavailability of medicinal products has a substantial impact on the capability of National Healthcare Systems in ensuring the continuity of care. Shortages originate from multifactorial causes. In particular, they can be due to supply-related factors (e.g., manufacturing issues, regulatory issues, logistics, distribution) and demand-related ones (e.g., fluctuating drug demand, parallel market, tendering, price and reimbursement policies). However, some extraordinary geopolitical events (e.g., Brexit) may also affect medicines\u2019 availability. The capability of European Regulatory Authorities and other stakeholders, which are involved in the pharmaceutical distribution chain and the healthcare assistance services, to define suitable problem-solving strategies has been limited for years by the fragmentation of the European regulatory framework, starting from the lack of a univocal definition of a med...","Abstract Human parainfluenza virus type 3 (HPIV-3) is one of the most common respiratory viruses particularly among young children and immunocompromised patients. The seasonality, prevalence and genetic diversity of HPIV-3 at a Spanish tertiary-hospital from 2013 to 2015 are reported. HPIV-3 infection was laboratory-confirmed in 102 patients (76%, under 5 years of age). Among &lt;5 years-old patients, 9 (11.5%) were under any degree of immunosuppression, whereas this percentage was significantly higher (19; 79.2%) among patients older than 5 years. HPIV-3 was detected at varying levels, but mainly during spring and summer. All characterized HN/F sequences fell within C1b, C5 and in other two closely C3a-related groups. Furthermore, a new genetic lineage (C1c) was described. Genetic similarity and epidemiological data confirmed some nosocomial infections, highlighting the importance of the HPIV-3 surveillance, particularly in high-risk patients. This study provides valuable information on ...","Background Rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2 in Wuhan prompted heightened surveillance in Shenzhen and elsewhere in China. The resulting data provide a rare opportunity to measure key metrics of disease course, transmission, and the impact of control. Methods The Shenzhen CDC identified 391 SARS-CoV-2 cases from January 14 to February 12, 2020 and 1286 close contacts. We compare cases identified through symptomatic surveillance and contact tracing, and estimate the time from symptom onset to confirmation, isolation, and hospitalization. We estimate metrics of disease transmission and analyze factors influencing transmission risk. Findings Cases were older than the general population (mean age 45) and balanced between males (187) and females (204). Ninety-one percent had mild or moderate clinical severity at initial assessment. Three have died, 225 have recovered (median time to recovery is 21 days). Cases were isolated on average 4.6 days after developing symptoms; contact tracing reduced thi...","Background: SARS-CoV-2 has been a global pandemic, but the emergence of asymptomatic patients has caused difficulties in the prevention of the epidemic. Therefore, it is significant to understand the epidemiological characteristics of asymptomatic patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Methods: In this single-center, retrospective and observational study, we collected data from 167 patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection treated in Chongqing Public Health Medical Center (Chongqing, China) from January to March 2020. The epidemiological characteristics and variable of these patients were collected and analyzed. Findings: 82.04% of the SARS-CoV-2 infected patients had a travel history in Wuhan or a history of contact with returnees from Wuhan, showing typical characteristics of imported cases, and the proportion of severe Covid-19 patients was 13.2%, of which 59% were imported from Wuhan. For the patients who was returnees from Wuhan, 18.1% was asymptomatic patients. In different infection perio...","Abstract Previous studies with calves and other species have provided evidence that blood serum-derived proteins and fructooligosaccharides (FOS) may benefit intestinal health. We assessed the effects of supplementing products containing serum proteins as a component of arrival fluid support or serum proteins plus FOS (in addition to additional solids, minerals, and vitamins) in an early life dietary supplement on performance, morbidity, and mortality of stressed (transport, cold) male calves. Male Holstein calves (n=93) &lt;1 wk old were stratified by arrival body weight (BW) and plasma protein concentration, and then randomly assigned to 1 of 4 treatment groups in a 2\u00d72 factorial arrangement of one-time administration of fluid support [either control electrolyte solution (E) or the serum protein-containing arrival formula (AF)] and 14d of either no supplementation (NG) or supplementation with Gammulin (G; APC Inc., Ankeny, IA), which contains serum proteins and FOS in addition to other ...","The COVID-19 pandemic has shown a markedly low proportion of cases among children. Age disparities in observed cases could be explained by assortative mixing patterns and reactive school closures which decrease mixing between children, or by children exhibiting lower susceptibility to infection, or by children having a lower propensity to show clinical symptoms. We formally test these hypotheses by fitting an age-structured mathematical model to epidemic data from six countries, finding strong age dependence in the probability of developing clinical symptoms, rising from around 20% in under 10s to over 70% in older adults. We find that interventions aimed at halting transmission in children may have minimal effects on preventing cases depending on the relative transmissibility of subclinical infections. Our estimated age-specific clinical fraction has implications for the expected global burden of clinical cases because of demographic differences across settings. In younger populations...","This study aims to analyze the different clinical characteristics between children and their families infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. Clinical data from nine children and their 14 families were collected, including general status, clinical, laboratory test, and imaging characteristics. All the children were detected positive result after their families onset. Three children had fever (22.2%) or cough (11.2%) symptoms and six (66.7%) children had no symptom. Among the 14 adult patients, the major symptoms included fever (57.1%), cough (35.7%), chest tightness/pain (21.4%), fatigue (21.4%) and sore throat (7.1%). Nearly 70% of the patients had normal (71.4%) or decreased (28.6%) white blood cell counts, and 50% (7/14) had lymphocytopenia. There were 10 adults (71.4%) showed abnormal imaging. The main manifestations were pulmonary consolidation (70%), nodular shadow (50%), and ground glass opacity (50%). Five discharged children were admitted again because t...","Abstract Respiratory viral infections, particularly respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and rhinovirus, are the most importance risk factors for the onset of wheezing in infants and small children. Bronchiolitis is the most common acute respiratory infection in children under 1 year of age, and the most common cause of hospitalization in this age group. RSV accounts for approximately 70% of all these cases, followed by rhinovirus, adenovirus, metapneumovirus and bocavirus. The association between bronchiolitis caused by RSV and the development of recurrent wheezing and/or asthma was first described more than 40 years ago, but it is still unclear whether bronchiolitis causes chronic respiratory symptoms, or if it is a marker for children with a genetic predisposition for developing asthma in the medium or long term. In any case, sufficient evidence is available to corroborate the existence of this association, which is particularly strong when the causative agent of bronchiolitis is rhino...","Background: Novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) is extending its range of transmission in all parts of the world, with substantial variation in rates of transmission and severity of associated disease. Methods: We evaluated whether and under which conditions it is possible to control and slow down a COVID-19 epidemic in the early stages by isolation and contact tracing. We used a stochastic transmission model in which every person generates novel infections according to a probability distribution that is affected by the incubation period distribution (time from infection to symptoms), distribution of the latent period (time from infection to a person becoming infectious), and overall transmissibility. The model distinguishes between close contacts (e.g., within a household) and other contacts in the population. Findings: The analyses showed that transmissibility and the duration of the latent period relative to the duration of incubation period have strong impact on the controllability of t...","Abstract Background The Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) emerged in 2012 and attracted an international attention as the virus caused multiple healthcare associated outbreaks. There are reports of the role of asymptomatic individuals in the transmission of MERS-CoV, however, the exact role is not known. Method The MEDLINE/PubMed and Scopus databases were searched for relevant papers published till August 2018 describing asymptomatic MERS-CoV infection. Results A total of 10 papers were retrieved and included in the final analysis and review. The extent of asymptomatic MERS infection had increased with change in the policy of testing asymptomatic contacts. In early cases in April 2012\u2013October 2013, 12.5% were asymptomatic among 144 PCR laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV cases while in 2014 the proportion rose to 25.1% among 255 confirmed cases. The proportion of asymptomatic cases reported among pediatric confirmed MERS-CoV cases were higher (41.9%\u201381.8%). Overall, the...","Social distancing is an effective way to contain the spread of a contagious disease, particularly when pharmacological interventions are not available. Conventional wisdom suggests that social distancing measures should be introduced as soon as possible after the beginning of an outbreak. Using a simple epidemiological model we show, however, that there is in fact an optimal time to initiate a temporal social distancing intervention if the goal is to reduce the final epidemic size or flatten the epidemic curve. The optimal timing depends strongly on the effective reproduction number (R0) of the disease, such that as the R0 increases, the optimal time decreases non-linearly. Additionally, if pharmacological interventions (e.g., a vaccine) become available at some point during the epidemic, the sooner these interventions become available the sooner social distancing should be initiated to maximize its effectiveness. Although based on a simple model, we hope that these insights inspire fu...","Abstract There are many diseases for which a microbial aetiology is suspected. The hypothesis that a disease has an infectious cause is supported by: clinical features (similar to those of known infectious diseases, e.g. fever, leucocytosis), epidemiology (case clustering in time or location), histology (inflammation of affected tissues, e.g. granulomata) or characteristic microbial structures, treatment (clinical response to antimicrobial treatment), and prevention of disease by vaccines targeting microbial antigens. Proof that a microbe causes a disease requires more rigorous evidence. Future attempts to identify novel microbes associated with human disease may use sequence-based approaches. High-throughput sequencing may allow identification of unique microbial nucleic acid sequences in a background of host DNA. The complete sequencing of the human genome and multiple microbial genomes make this approach more feasible. DNA microarrays are also likely to be used in the search for nov...","Background A pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been spreading over the world. However, the viral dynamics, host serologic responses, and their associations with clinical manifestations, have not been well described in prospective cohort. Methods We conducted a prospective cohort and enrolled 67 COVID-19 patients admitting between Jan 26 and Feb 5, 2020. Clinical specimens including nasopharyngeal swab, sputum, blood, urine and stool were tested periodically according to standardized case report form with final follow-up on February 27. The routes and duration of viral shedding, antibody response, and their associations with disease severity and clinical manifestations were systematically evaluated. Coronaviral particles in clinical specimens were observed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Results The median duration of SARS-CoV-2 RNA shedding were 12 (3-38), 19 (5-37), and 18 (7-26) days i...","Prolonged viral shedding is associated with severe status and poor prognosis of COVID-19 patients. Unexpectedly, here we report a non-severe patient with the longest duration of viral shedding. According to the investigation on the clinical and epidemiological information of this case, we concluded that this type of virus might have a low toxicity and transmissibility, but have a prolonged infective ability and was hardly to be eliminated in the body with regular therapy. However, infusion of plasma from recovered patients showed high efficiency in elimination of this virus. Our findings might shed light on the management of COVID-19.","Background: The ongoing outbreak of novel corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Wuhan, China, is arousing international concern. This study evaluated whether and when the infected but asymptomatic cases during the incubation period could infect others. Methods: We collected data on demographic characteristics, exposure history, and symptom onset day of the confirmed cases, which had been announced by the Chinese local authorities. We evaluated the potential of transmission during the incubation period in 50 infection clusters, including 124 cases. All the secondary cases had a history of contact with their first-generation cases prior to symptom onset. Results: The estimated mean incubation period for COVID-19 was 4.9 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.4 to 5.4) days, ranging from 0.8 to 11.1 days (2.5th to 97.5th percentile). The observed mean and standard deviation (SD) of serial interval was 4.1\u00b13.3 days, with the 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles at -1 and 13 days. The infectious c...","BACKGROUND: Surveillance of influenza-like illness (ILI) in Central Africa began only recently, and few data are therefore available on the circulation of influenza virus and other respiratory viruses. In Gabon, a Central African country, we established a surveillance network in four major towns in order to analyze cases of ILI among patients who visited health centers between March 2010 and June 2011, and to determine the viral etiology. METHODS: Nasal swabs were sent for analysis to the Centre International de Recherches M\u00e9dicales de Franceville, where they were screened for 17 respiratory viruses in a multiplex real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction for all pathogens according the following pairs: adenovirus/parainfluenza virus 4, respiratory syncytial virus/human metapneumovirus, parainfluenza virus 1/parainfluenza virus 2, pandemic influenza virus A/seasonal influenza virus A (H1N1, H3N2)/seasonal influenza virus B, human coronaviruses 229E/OC43, human coronavir...","Abstract With the outbreak of unknown pneumonia in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, a new coronavirus, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), aroused the attention of the entire world. The current outbreak of infections with SARS-CoV-2 is termed Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). The World Health Organization declared COVID-19 in China as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. Two other coronavirus infections\u2014SARS in 2002-2003 and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) in 2012\u2014both caused severe respiratory syndrome in humans. All 3 of these emerging infectious diseases leading to a global spread are caused by \u03b2-coronaviruses. Although coronaviruses usually infect the upper or lower respiratory tract, viral shedding in plasma or serum is common. Therefore, there is still a theoretical risk of transmission of coronaviruses through the transfusion of labile blood products. Because more and more asymptomatic infections are being found among COVID-19 c...","World Health Organization has declared the ongoing outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. The virus was named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses. Human infection with SARS-CoV-2 leads to a wide range of clinical manifestations ranging from asymptomatic, mild, moderate to severe. The severe cases present with pneumonia, which can progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome. The outbreak provides an opportunity for real-time tracking of an animal coronavirus that has just crossed species barrier to infect humans. The outcome of SARS-CoV-2 infection is largely determined by virus-host interaction. Here, we review the discovery, zoonotic origin, animal hosts, transmissibility and pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 in relation to its interplay with host antiviral defense. A comparison with SARS-CoV, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, community-...","Several cases of life threatening respiratory disease with no identifiable cause were reported from Guangdong Province, China; these were soon followed by reports from many other countries. The disease was named as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). A novel coronavirus, isolated from the respiratory secretions of patients, has been implicated in the causation of SARS. The modes of transmission include droplet spread, close contact, and Fomites; shedding of virus from respiratory tract is the primary mode of transmission. SARS clinically presents with high-grade fever, chills and rigors, myalgia, headache, cough with or without sputum production, dyspnea, and dizziness. Chest radiographs reveal unilateral or bilateral, predominantly peripheral, areas of consolidation progressing with in a short time of bilateral patchy consolidation. Preliminary reports suggest a milder illness in young children. The case definition of probable SARS cases, laboratory investigations and precaution...","To reliably estimate the demand on regional health systems and perform public health planning, it is necessary to have a good estimate of the prevalence of infection with SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19) in the population. In the absence of wide-spread testing, we provide one approach to infer prevalence based on the assumption that the fraction of true infections needing hospitalization is fixed and that all hospitalized cases of COVID-19 in Santa Clara are identified. Our goal is to estimate the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infections, i.e. the true number of people currently infected with the virus, divided by the total population size. Our analysis suggests that as of March 17, 2020, there are 6,500 infections (0.34% of the population) of SARS-CoV-2 in Santa Clara County. Based on adjusting the parameters of our model to be optimistic (respectively pessimistic), the number of infections would be 1,400 (resp. 26,000), corresponding to a prevalence of 0.08% (resp. 1.36%). If t...","Abstract In order to evaluate mucosal antibody responses to rotavirus, an enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISPOT) assay was adapted to enumerate antibody-secreting cells (ASC) in the mesenteric lymph nodes (MLN), lamina propria (LP) of the small intestine and spleens of gnotobiotic pigs orally inoculated with porcine rotaviruses (SB1A and Gottfried). Rotavirus-specific IgM ASC occurred by post-inoculation day (PID) 3, and numbers peaked in spleen and MLN tissues by PID 7 and in intestinal LP by PID 7\u201314. Numbers of rotavirus specific IgA and IgG ASC in these tissues peaked at PID 14\u201321. Rotavirus specific IgA ASC were predominant in the gut and IgA to IgG rotavirus specific ASC ratios were highest for all rotavirus antigen coatings in the gut LP. However, the relative ratios of specific IgA to IgG ASC were lower (ratios of 5 to 7) against combined structural and nonstructural viral antigens (rotavirus-infected fixed cell ELISPOT plates) than ratios (13 to 46) against only viral structural a...","In 2012, a novel coronavirus associated with severe respiratory disease in humans emerged in the Middle East. Epidemiologic investigations identified dromedary camels as the likely source of zoonotic transmission of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Here we provide experimental support for camels as a reservoir for MERS-CoV. We inoculated 3 adult camels with a human isolate of MERS-CoV and a transient, primarily upper respiratory tract infection developed in each of the 3 animals. Clinical signs of the MERS-CoV infection were benign, but each of the camels shed large quantities of virus from the upper respiratory tract. We detected infectious virus in nasal secretions through 7 days postinoculation, and viral RNA up to 35 days postinoculation. The pattern of shedding and propensity for the upper respiratory tract infection in dromedary camels may help explain the lack of systemic illness among naturally infected camels and the means of efficient camel-to-camel an...","SARS-CoV-2 viral infection is a global pandemic disease (COVID-19). Reaching a swift, reliable diagnosis of COVID-19 in the emergency departments is imperative to direct patients to proper care and to prevent disease dissemination. COVID-19 diagnosis is based on the identification of viral RNA through RT-PCR from oral-nasopharyngeal swabs, which however presents suboptimal sensitivity and may require several hours in overstressed laboratories. These drawbacks have called for an additional, complementary first line approach. CT is the gold standard method for the detection of interstitial pneumonia, a hallmark feature of COVID-19, often present in the asymptomatic stage of the disease. Here, we show that CT scan presents a sensitivity of 95.48% (std.err=0.35%), vastly outperforming RT-PCR. Additionally, as diagnostic accuracy is influenced by disease prevalence, we argue that predictive values provide a more precise measure of CT reliability in the current pandemics. We generated a mode...","BACKGROUND: Coronavirus causes respiratory infections in humans. To determine the prevalence of human coronavirus (HCoV) infection among patients with influenza-like illness, 5833 clinical samples from nasopharyngeal swabs and aspirates collected between January 2012 and December 2013 were examined. RESULTS: HCoV was found in 46 (0.79 %) samples. There were 19 (0.32 %) HCoV-HKU1, 19 (0.32 %) HCoV-NL63, 5 (0.09 %) HCoV-229E, and 3 (0.05 %) HCoV-OC43. None of the sample tested positive for MERS-CoV. The majority (54 %) of the HCoV-positive patients were between the ages of 0 and 5 years. HCoV was detected throughout the 2-year period and generally peaked from May to October, which coincided with the rainy season. Phylogenetic trees based on the alignment of the spike (S) gene sequences suggest an emergence of a new clade for HCoV-229E. CONCLUSIONS: The data in this study provide an insight into the prevalence of the recent circulating HCoVs in the region.","Background: Previous studies have showed clinical characteristics of patients with the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and the evidence of person-to-person transmission. Limited data are available for asymptomatic infections. This study aims to present the clinical characteristics of 24 cases with asymptomatic infection screened from close contacts and to show the transmission potential of asymptomatic COVID-19 virus carriers. Methods: Epidemiological investigations were conducted among all close contacts of COVID-19 patients (or suspected patients) in Nanjing, Jiangsu Province, China, from Jan 28 to Feb 9, 2020, both in clinic and in community. Asymptomatic carriers were laboratory-confirmed positive for the COVID-19 virus by testing the nucleic acid of the pharyngeal swab samples. Their clinical records, laboratory assessments, and chest CT scans were reviewed. Findings: None of the 24 asymptomatic cases presented any obvious symptoms before nucleic acid screening. Five cas...","Background: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a newly identified pathogen which mainly spreads by droplets. Most published studies focused on adult patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), but data concerning pediatric patients is limited. This study aimed to determine epidemiological characteristics and clinical features of pediatric patients with COVID-19. Methods: We reviewed and analyzed data on pediatric patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19, including basic information, epidemiological history, clinical manifestations, laboratory and radiologic findings, treatment, outcome and follow-up results. Results: From January 20th to February 27th of 2020, a total of 74 pediatric patients with COVID-19 were included in this study. Of the 68 cases whose epidemiological data were complete, 65 (65/68, 95.59%) cases were household contacts of adults whose symptoms developed earlier. Forty (59.46%) of the infected children were male, and the median...","R\u00e9sum\u00e9 Objectifs. \u2013 L\u2019utilisation des nouvelles techniques d\u2019identification par les m\u00e9thodes mol\u00e9culaires apporte de nouvelles donn\u00e9es \u00e9pid\u00e9miologiques.

A solution would be significant as protein structure information could be utilized in the medical field, e.g. in the development of vaccines for new viruses. This paper focuses on predicting the protein structure based on 3D images of the proteins captured through cryogenic electron microscopes (cryo-EM). A fully automated computationally efficient protein structure prediction method would be particularly beneficial in the field of cryo-EM as the technology allows researchers to photograph multiple large protein complexes in a single study, which means that a fast prediction method could allow for a high throughput of derived protein structures. We present a deep learning approach, DeepTracer, for predicting locations of the backbone atoms, secondary structure elements, and the amino acid types. In order to connect the predicted amino aci...","The potential infectiousness of asymptomatic COVID-19 cases together with a substantial fraction of asymptomatic infections among all infections, have been highlighted in clinical studies. We conducted statistical modeling analysis to derive the delay-adjusted asymptomatic proportion of the positive COVID-19 infections onboard the Princess Cruises ship along with the timeline of infections. We estimated the asymptomatic proportion at 17.9% (95% CrI: 15.5%-20.2%), with most of the infections occurring before the start of the 2-week quarantine.","Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) has recently emerged in the Middle East. Since 2012, there have been approximately 2,100 confirmed cases, with a 35% case fatality rate. Disease severity has been linked to patient health status, as people with chronic diseases or an immunocompromised status fare worse, although the mechanisms of disease have yet to be elucidated. We used the rhesus macaque model of mild MERS to investigate whether the immune response plays a role in the pathogenicity in relation to MERS-CoV shedding. Immunosuppressed macaques were inoculated with MERS-CoV and sampled daily for 6 days to assess their immune statues and to measure viral shedding and replication. Immunosuppressed macaques supported significantly higher levels of MERS-CoV replication in respiratory tissues and shed more virus, and virus disseminated to tissues outside of the respiratory tract, whereas viral RNA was confined to respiratory tissues in non-immunosuppressed animals. Desp...","Ginkgolic acids (GA) are alkylphenol constituents of the leaves and fruits of Ginkgo biloba. GA has shown pleiotropic effects in vitro, including: antitumor effects through inhibition of lipogenesis; decreased expression of invasion associated proteins through AMPK activation; and potential rescue of amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) induced synaptic impairment. GA was also reported to have activity against Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus. Several mechanisms for this activity have been suggested including: SUMOylation inhibition; blocking formation of the E1-SUMO intermediate; inhibition of fatty acid synthase; non-specific SIRT inhibition; and activation of protein phosphatase type-2C. Here we report that GA inhibits Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) by inhibition of both fusion and viral protein synthesis. Additionally, we report that GA inhibits human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) genome replication and Zika virus (ZIKV) infection of normal human astrocytes (NHA). We show a broad spectrum of fus...","Abstract Ocular transmission of COVID-19 is uncertain. 64 tear samples were collected from 17 COVID-19 patients between Day 3 to Day 20 from initial symptoms. Neither viral culture nor reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) detected the virus, suggesting a low risk of ocular transmission.","The fourth outbreak of the Coronaviruses, known as the 2019-nCoV, has occurred in Wuhan city of Hubei province in China in December 2019. We propose a time-varying sparse vector autoregressive (VAR) model to retrospectively analyze and visualize the dyamic transmission routes of this outbreak in mainland China over January 31 - February 19, 2020. Our results demonstrate that the influential inter-province routes from Hubei have become unidentifiable since February 4, whereas the self-transmission in each province was accelerating over February 4-15. From February 16, all routes became less detectable, and no influential transmissions could be identified on February 18 and 19. Such evidence supports the effectiveness of government interventions, including the travel restrictions in Hubei. Implications of our results suggest that in addition to the origin of the outbreak, virus preventions are of crucial importance in provinces with the largest migrant workers percentages (e.g., Jiangxi,...","Objective: Establishing a social contact data sharing initiative and an interactive tool to assess mitigation strategies for COVID-19. Results: We organized data sharing of published social contact surveys via online repositories and formatting guidelines. We analyzed this social contact data in terms of weighted social contact matrices, next generation matrices, relative incidence and R0. We incorporated location-specific isolation measures (e.g. school closure or telework) and capture their effect on transmission dynamics. All methods have been implemented in an online application based on R Shiny and applied to COVID-19 with age-specific susceptibility and infectiousness. Using our online tool with the available social contact data, we illustrate that social distancing could have a considerable impact on reducing transmission for COVID-19. The effect itself depends on assumptions made about disease-specific characteristics and the choice of intervention(s). Keywords: social contact ...","Human coronaviruses (HCoVs), including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV, also known as SARS-CoV-2), lead global epidemics with high morbidity and mortality. However, there are currently no effective drugs targeting 2019-nCoV/SARS-CoV-2. Drug repurposing, representing as an effective drug discovery strategy from existing drugs, could shorten the time and reduce the cost compared to de novo drug discovery. In this study, we present an integrative, antiviral drug repurposing methodology implementing a systems pharmacology-based network medicine platform, quantifying the interplay between the HCoV\u2013host interactome and drug targets in the human protein\u2013protein interaction network. Phylogenetic analyses of 15 HCoV whole genomes reveal that 2019-nCoV/SARS-CoV-2 shares the highest nucleotide sequence identity with SARS-CoV (79.7%). Specifically, the envelope and nucleocapsid proteins of 2019-nCoV/SARS-CoV-2 are two evolutionarily co...","Abstract Objectives were to determine effects of lactation and pregnancy on endometrial gene expression on d 17 of the estrous cycle and pregnancy. Heifers (n=33) were assigned randomly after parturition to lactating (L, n=17) or nonlactating (NL, n=16) groups. Cows were subjected to an ovulation synchronization program for a timed artificial insemination (TAI); 10 cows in L and 12 in NL were inseminated. Slaughter occurred 17 d after the day equivalent to TAI, and intercaruncular endometrial tissues were collected. Gene expression was determined by DNA microarray analysis for pregnant (L, n=8; NL, n=6) and noninseminated cyclic (L, n=7; NL, n=4) cows. Differentially expressed genes were selected with a P-value &lt;0.01 and absolute expression &gt;40. In addition, a fold effect &gt;1.5 was used as a criterion for genes affected by pregnancy. In total, 210 genes were differentially regulated by lactation (136 downregulated and 74 upregulated), and 702 genes were differentially regulated by pregn...","Background: Cases with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) emigrated from Wuhan escalated the risk of spreading in other cities. This report focused on the outside-Wuhan patients to assess the transmission and clinical characteristics of this illness. Methods: Contact investigation was conducted on each patient who admitted to the assigned hospitals in Hunan Province (geographically adjacent to Wuhan) from Jan 22, 2020 to Feb 12, 2020. Demographic, clinical, laboratory and radiological characteristics, medication therapy and outcomes were collected and analyzed. Patients were confirmed by PCR test. Results: Of the 104 patients, 48 (46.15%) were imported cases and 56 (53.85%) were indigenous cases; 93 (89.42%) had a definite contact history with infections. Family clusters were the major body of patients. Transmission along the chain of 3 &amp;ldquo:generations\u201d was observed. Mean age was 43 (rang, 8-84) years (including 3 children) and 49 (47.12%) were male. Most patients had typical sympt...","BACKGROUND: Bats are amongst the natural reservoirs of many coronaviruses (CoVs) of which some can lead to severe infection in human. African bats are known to harbor a range of pathogens (e.g., Ebola and Marburg viruses) that can infect humans and cause disease outbreaks. A recent study in South Africa isolated a genetic variant closely related to MERS-CoV from an insectivorous bat. Though Madagascar is home to 44 bat species (41 insectivorous and 3 frugivorous) of which 34 are endemic, no data exists concerning the circulation of CoVs in the island\u2019s chiropteran fauna. Certain Malagasy bats can be frequently found in close contact with humans and frugivorous bats feed in the same trees where people collect and consume fruits and are hunted and consumed as bush meat. The purpose of our study is to detect and identify CoVs from frugivorous bats in Madagascar to evaluate the risk of human infection from infected bats. METHODS: Frugivorous bats belonging to three species were captured in..."],"title":["The time scale of asymptomatic transmission affects estimates of epidemic potential in the COVID-19 outbreak","Transmission Potential of SARS-CoV-2 in Viral Shedding Observed at the University of Nebraska Medical Center","Temporal dynamics in viral shedding and transmissibility of COVID-19","Virus shedding patterns in nasopharyngeal and fecal specimens of COVID-19 patients","Do children need a longer time to shed SARS-CoV-2 in stool than adults?","A COVID-19 Infection Risk Model for Frontline Health Care Workers","Prolonged Viral Shedding in Feces of Pediatric Patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019","Children are unlikely to have been the primary source of household SARS-CoV-2 infections","MERS coronavirus: Data gaps for laboratory preparedness","Prolonged presence of SARS-CoV-2 in feces of pediatric patients during the convalescent phase","Evaluation of Group Testing for SARS-CoV-2 RNA","The dominance of human coronavirus OC43 and NL63 infections in infants","New regulatory strategies to manage medicines shortages in Europe","A molecular epidemiological study of human parainfluenza virus type 3 at a tertiary university hospital during 2013\u20132015 in Catalonia, Spain","Epidemiology and Transmission of COVID-19 in Shenzhen China: Analysis of 391 cases and 1,286 of their close contacts","High incidence of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection, Chongqing, China","Evaluation of serum protein-based arrival formula and serum protein supplement (Gammulin) on growth, morbidity, and mortality of stressed (transport and cold) male dairy calves","Age-dependent effects in the transmission and control of COVID-19 epidemics","The different clinical characteristics of corona virus disease cases between children and their families in China \u2013 the character of children with COVID-19","Pediatric Asthma and Viral Infection","Effectiveness of isolation and contact tracing for containment and slowing down a COVID-19 epidemic: a modelling study","Asymptomatic Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection: Extent and implications for infection control: A systematic review","Optimal timing for social distancing during an epidemic","The infectious aetiology of disease: the search for new agents","Viral Kinetics and Antibody Responses in Patients with COVID-19","A special case of COVID-19 with long duration of viral shedding for 49 days","Transmission of corona virus disease 2019 during the incubation period may lead to a quarantine loophole","Viral etiology and seasonality of influenza-like illness in Gabon, March 2010 to June 2011","Coronavirus Disease 2019: Coronaviruses and Blood Safety","A tug-of-war between severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 and host antiviral defence: lessons from other pathogenic viruses","Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)","Estimation of SARS-CoV-2 Infection Prevalence in Santa Clara County","Enumeration of isotype-specific antibody-secreting cells derived from gnotobiotic piglets inoculated with porcine rotaviruses","Replication and Shedding of MERS-CoV in Upper Respiratory Tract of Inoculated Dromedary Camels","Why is chest CT important for early diagnosis of COVID-19?
