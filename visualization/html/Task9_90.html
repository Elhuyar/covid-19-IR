1996, the Foodborne Diseases Active Surveillance Network (FoodNet)-a collaboration with CDC, ten state health departments, academic institutions, the US Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service (USDA-FSIS), and FDA-has done active, population-based surveillance of laboratory-confi rmed infections caused by major foodborne pathogens. Although progress to address several key foodborne pathogens has been made, 86 particularly with Shiga toxinproducing E coli serotype O157, in recent years progress has stalled. 87, 88 The rate of Salmonella infections-the most commonly reported foodborne infection-has been largely unchanged. 88 In the USA, Salmonella causes around 1 million infections 82 and $365 million in direct medical costs every year. 86 An important component in eff orts to identify and stop foodborne disease outbreaks is PulseNet, a national network of public health and food regulatory agency laboratories that use pulsed-fi eld gel electrophoresis (PFGE) patterns to identify clusters of foodborne illnesses that might signal an outbreak. In the USA, more than 80 state and federal laboratories participate in this For more on PulseNet see http:// www.cdc.gov/pulsenet/ surveillance system and submit PFGE patterns from six bacterial pathogens to a CDC database to identify similar cases of foodborne illnesses that might signal an outbreak. Over the past 15 years, this system has detected hundreds of outbreaks, enabling faster and more accurate responses. PulseNet-triggered investigations have resulted in the recall of more than 1\u00b75 billion pounds of contaminated food and have prompted new actions by industry and food regulatory agencies to make food safer. Since 2006, data from foodborne disease investigations have identifi ed more than a dozen newly implicated foods in foodborne disease outbreaks (panel). Data from nearly 4600 outbreaks in 1998-2008 were used to help to establish the proportion of foodborne illnesses attributable to specifi c food commodities across 17 major food categories. Produce accounted for almost half of all foodborne illnesses from these outbreaks, with most deaths caused by meat and poultry. 89 Because many foodborne disease outbreaks occur across many states and countries and therefore could go undetected, eff orts to ensure the continued capability of laboratory-based and cluster-detection surveillance systems such as PulseNet are crucial. Detection of bacterial pathogens is changing from culture to an increased use of point-of-care molecular tests. 90 Although these tests have great potential for broader applications in detection and control of infectious diseases, the increased use of cultureindependent diagnostics brings new challenges to public health laboratory-based surveil lance systems that rely on culture and bacterial isolates for strain identifi cation. Fundamental changes in these systems are needed to ensure their continued eff ectiveness.","Pre-incident actions focus on preparedness, healthcare provider education, and surveillance. Active syndromic surveillance for fever and respiratory symptom clusters should occur. Research focuses on improving testing sensitivity earlier in illness and on finding effective antiviral and immunomodulating agents. 21 Emergency department, hospital, and outpatient facilities should have disaster plans in place that address bioterrorist attack/major infectious disease outbreaks, and they should regularly conduct mock attacks. The importance of incorporating travel, immigration, and contacts into routine history-taking must be reinforced. Facilities should upgrade isolation and ventilation systems, using increased air flow in clustered negative pressure rooms. Strict staff universal precautions, frequent and thorough hand-washing, and the use of properly fitting N95 respiratory masks must be stressed. 22 Measures should be delineated for changing triage guidelines to accommodate rapid increases in patient census; isolating patients; and safely holding large numbers of ill and infectious patients in the likely advent of hospital overloading. These plans, developed in coordination with those of local, state, and federal EMS, public health and government agencies should specify leadership and decisionmaking roles. 23 Policies regarding restricted public gatherings, contact quarantine, and prepared quarantine facilities, if individuals will not maintain home quarantine, should be in place. 24, 25 The possibility of contracting SARS-CoV by particle inhalation from laboratory culture is significant, and negative pressure measures and BSL-3 procedures within laboratories should be used. 26","Rapidly changing environments require the delivery of timely surveillance information [7, 8] . In response, the ALPHA Project is an initiative that started in late 2002. The purpose of the ALPHA Project is to develop a software application architecture based on the philosophy of configuring and reusing common components to produce services that would be used to enable faster development of robust, maintainable public health applications. Public health is practiced through complex relationships of organizations (e.g., local, federal) and functionally organized units (e.g., health departments, disease programs) [9] . As such, the emphasis of the project is not on creating one monolithic application to handle all public health surveillance needs, but rather on creating customizable applications with the same underlying architectural or component structure. The goal is to reduce the amount of new development work required for each new application, in order to reduce its time-to-market. Configuration plays an increasingly larger role in the development cycle, and leads to more flexible applications responsive to new and emerging public health needs. New components or services that have to be built are designed in such a way that other applications can use them, and contribute to the architecture. Consequently, software becomes more maintainable, since applications share many of the same components.","An increasing priority for CDC in the twenty-first century has been better integration of the public health and medical care systems. To address this priority, CDC has increased its collaborations with the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services, the primary source of federal funding for healthcare in the United States. The Affordable Care Act (ACA) also provides opportunities to better integrate prevention with care. For example, the ACA requires that many insurance plans cover a set of evidence-based clinical preventive services without requiring patient co-payment or payment toward a deductible. The ACA is a valuable resource in helping CDC achieve its goals of reducing morbidity and mortality for all Americans.","Novel influenza A virus infections in humans, such as those caused by the H3N2v-M virus, are nationally notifiable conditions in the United States. When US laboratories or health care providers identify a potential infection with a novel influenza A virus they are asked to notify CDC immediately. CDC then collaborates with federal, state, and local human and animal public health colleagues to provide laboratory confirmation of the novel virus and to conduct a case and/or outbreak investigation. Outbreak investigations typically involve case investigation, contact investigations, attempts to determine potential animal or human sources of the infection, and environmental investigations. For each suspected or confirmed case detailed epidemiologic and clinical data are gathered. Notification of these cases is published in the MMWR, and in the weekly FluView national surveillance report.","Whether for health protection or for food safety, we rely on microbiology laboratories to detect, identify, and characterize human pathogens of public health significance. Although health services are a national responsibility in the EU, a cost\u2013benefit analysis study by the European Commission has concluded that the benefits of maintaining EU public health reference laboratory networks were likely to outweigh the costs, both from a Member State and from an EU perspective (55). As outlined in the examples above, EU laboratory networks coordinated by ECDC as well as the European Commission over the last years have brought public health added value through fit-for-purpose harmonization and validation of laboratory methods, quality assurance and training activities as well as contribution to preparedness and response for biological threats. The EULabCap surveys concluded that the EU/EEA as a whole has a strong and improving public health microbiology system (7). Its key assets include harmonized methods for AST, extensive reference laboratory services, and laboratory inputs within national and EU surveillance networks. The use of molecular typing for surveillance and laboratory participation in outbreak response showed significant progress. In an era of rapid progress in electronic recording and transmission of health data, it is noticeable that half of the EU/EEA countries have implemented automated electronic reporting of microbiology laboratory data to their national communicable disease or antimicrobial resistance surveillance systems (7). To track the transmission of resistance genes needed for targeted control measures, ECDC has developed a protocol for genomic-based surveillance of carbapenem-resistant and/or colistin-resistant Enterobacteriaceae at the EU level (56). To deliver their full potential, these encouraging developments require sustained innovation in molecular diagnostic and typing methods and the collaborative engineering of wider connectivity between laboratory and public health information systems from the local to the global level. Collaboration between clinical and public health practitioners, government agencies, and academic institutions is key to develop integrated clinical, epidemiological, and molecular microbiological data collection, recording and exchange protocols as well as build the integrated information technology infrastructure enabling real time, molecular epidemiologic surveillance, and alert systems for infectious diseases. ECDC as convener, funding source and coordinator in close partnership with multidisciplinary experts from EU disease networks continues to act as catalyst for translating these novel approaches into practice and further strengthening the collective laboratory capability for disease control in the EU.","In August 2005, Hurricane Katrina made landfall on the Gulf coast of the USA. The worst consequences were felt in New Orleans, Louisiana, where the levee system was breached and billions of dollars of damage occurred. The storm also caused significant loss of life and many people were displaced from their homes. The magnitude of the hurricane was anticipated, the risk having been communicated at both local and national level. However, this risk warning was not heeded appropriately. For example, although mandatory evacuation was eventually ordered, there was little provision for the large numbers involved or for those citizens who could not evacuate themselves. The aftermath of the storm, with many people left living in squalid conditions, also revealed a risk management process that left much to be desired. 5 One notable example was in the coordination of a bi-partisan emergency federal health policy response, attempts at which were blocked by the White House, citing multiple concerns including relevance and cost. The subsequent delay resulted in profound health, economic and political consequences. 6 Several lessons may be drawn for the risk management of disease outbreaks. Firstly, although risk communication may occur, it does not automatically result in a co-ordinated risk management response. Second, this occurred in the USA, a country which clearly has the public health and disaster management resources to deal with such a problem. However, these resources were not mobilized effectively, efficiently or in a timely manner. At the heart of many of the problems were fractured communication systems. Among operational problems, there were failures in communication technologies subsequent to the weather conditions and, whilst some decisions required extensive information, others were made on the basis of unverified rumours reported by the media, leading to incoherent responses. 5 Communication failures occurred between the local, state and federal agencies, and there was a lack of clear roles and responsibilities. Although New Orleans had experienced previous hurricanes and had a disaster management plan, the plan was clearly operationally fragile.","Stockpiles. Stockpiles are, put simply, an artificial enhancement to current market demand levels in anticipation of periods when supply will be insufficient to meet demand. 2 Government funding of vendor-managed stockpiles of childhood vaccines ensures that some excess vaccine supply is always available to buffer supply problems when they occur. Currently, the United States has a large enough stockpile of smallpox vaccine to vaccinate every person in the country who might need it in the event of an emergency. 70 The government also expects to stockpile nearly 8 million doses of an investigational vaccine against pandemic influenza, and studies are under way to develop mechanisms that could stretch that supply to cover more than one-third of the population. 71 CDC also maintains a large anthrax vaccine stockpile. Advance market commitments. Advance market commitments involve donors who commit to buying yet-to-be-developed vaccines in bulk for poor nations if drug makers are able to deliver a vaccine that meets specifications and a price can be settled on in advance. 72 Supporters of advance market commitments range from the GAVI partners to Pope Benedict XVI. Donors have agreed to test this mechanism for a vaccine for pneumococcal disease. To date, the Gates Foundation, the United Kingdom, Italy, Canada, Norway, and Russia have committed a total of $1.5 billion for the project. Vaccine bonds. The United Kingdom has taken a lead in promoting an International Financing Facility for Immunization (IFFIm) 69 IFFIm has raised more than $1 billion in capital markets to immunize poor children in developing nations against Reviews VACCINE POLICY vaccine-preventable diseases. 73 IFFIm plans to invest $4 billion over the next decade to immunize 500 million people who would not otherwise be protected from diseases that no longer represent public health threats in developed countries. 73 The IFFIm mechanism concentrates on the funding for vaccine research by using long-term government commitments as security bonds issued in the capital markets. The cash received for the bonds then can be used for research and future purchase of vaccines. Whenever the bonds are issued, IFFIm pays bondholders a modest rate of interest. As money pledged by donor governments becomes available gradually over 30 years, these funds will be used to repay the capital value of the bonds. 69 IFFIm was able to double the resources GAVI has been able to allocate-$945.6 million in 2007 compared with $418.3 million in 2006. 74 Vaccine financing programs. Historically, the U.S. immunization system has been financed through public-private sector partnerships. The public sector purchases vaccines for approximately 55% of the birth cohort. 75 Section 317 (a federal discretionary grant program to all states), the Vaccines for Children (VFC) Act of 1993 (P.L. 103-66), and state funds are major public sector sources for vaccine financing. Private sector vaccine purchases are covered through private health insurance and account for 45% to 50% of the pediatric vaccines sold annually in the United States. 75 The federal government has played an evolving role in building the immunization structure in the United States. The earliest legislation pertaining to vaccine financing is the Social Security Act of 1935. Title V of this act pertains to immunization services for children and their mothers. In 1963, Congress enacted the Vaccine Assistance Act (Section 317 of the Public Health Service Act). This legislation provided grants to social service agencies and local health departments for immunization infrastructure and vaccine purchases. 41 However, barriers to immunization access still remained in some areas as a result of considerable variability in immunization efforts by state and local governments.","In 2014, the ACT Government launched the Canberra Innovation Network (CBRIN) to further consolidate collaborations between local government, innovators and education and research institutions. InnovationACT has built strong ties to CBRIN, the Griffin Accelerator which supports local high-growth firms, and the federal intellectual property agency-IP Australia-linking social, research and practice stakeholders (Potocnjak-Oxman, 2018). ANU's College of Business and Economics has now also piloted a Venture Lab for further integration of entrepreneurial ventures created by students, including the promotion of joint innovation efforts. Student-centred activities linked to design thinking are central to this initiative. The start-up entrepreneurial portfolio is managed and developed by one of the co-authors who is currently undertaking research into entrepreneurial opportunities and design.","Although public attention often focuses on CDC's infectious diseases and preparedness activities, most Americans will die from chronic diseases, such as heart disease, cancer, chronic lower respiratory diseases, and stroke. Common underlying risk factors for these conditions include tobacco use, uncontrolled hypertension, poor diet, physical inactivity, and high blood cholesterol. Surveillance systems supported by CDC, including the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, and the National Health Interview Survey, measure the prevalence of these conditions and risk factors and track these data over time. The Million Hearts Initiative, led by CDC and including other federal partners, aims to prevent 1 million heart attacks and strokes between 2012 and 2017 through a combination of public health interventions (reduction of smoking and intake of trans fat and sodium) and clinical interventions (improved blood pressure control and hypertension management, increasing aspirin use for high-risk individuals). CDC also leads the National Diabetes Prevention Program, a public-private partnership to prevent or delay the onset of type 2 diabetes in persons with pre-diabetes.","The model covariates included COVID-19 risk perception, influenza risk perception, humidity (shown to be an important driver of influenza dynamics [15, 16] ), and strain dynamics. To measure COVID-19 risk perception, we collected the weekly mean number of Google Trends searches of \"coronavirus\", \"COVID\", and \"COVID-19\" at the national and state level [17, 18] . To represent ILI risk perception, we collected the weekly mean number of Google Trends searches of \"influenza\" and \"flu\". To measure relative humidity, we collected data from the US Local Climatological Database, which provides summaries of climatological conditions from airport and other prominent weather stations managed by the National Weather Service, Federal Aviation Administration and Department of Defense [19] . For each state, we randomly chose a weather station that covered the appropriate time period, as a marker for humidity levels in that state. To measure strain dynamics, we used the National Respiratory and Enteric Virus Surveillance System (NREVSS) virological surveillance data to identify the proportion of respiratory specimens tested for influenza that tested positive for influenza A or influenza B [11] .","Briefly stated, we need to make concerted efforts to be aware of and remain interested in the afflictions of individuals in remote villages. Global surveillance coupled with a sense of community are the starting points. These concepts need to be embraced and continually articulated by leaders of the Public Health System. These should be supplemented by federal research support for serious illnesses even if the illnesses are thought to belong to \"other\" people. The fact is that the boundaries between foreign or exotic and what is traditionally referred to as domestic or local have blurred. We in the developed world cannot afford to be disengaged or appear to show indifference to the health challenge of less fortunate populations living in remote sectors of the world. The noted ethicist Peter Singer argues that given the advances in transportation and communication, coupled with the emergence of transnational companies and universal problems, we must transcend national boundaries to embrace a new ethic of one world (16) . Our ability to care and reach out defines our humanity and importantly may impact the health of our own communities.","Additionally, government at all levels -federal, state, and local -has become a major consumer of security services and products. This is true even for government units that provide criminal justice or emergency response services to the public. These services and products vendors are numbered in the tens of thousands and constitute the security industry.","The list encompassed such areas as licensing, regulations, consumer services, personnel training, crime prevention systems, hourly compensation, and conduct and ethics. The Report of the Private Security Task Force was not intended as an impetus to achieve federal legislation to regulate aspects of the security industry; rather, its intention was to identify significant issues that would stimulate local and state laws and codes to be passed or strengthened. Also, it would serve as an industry guide to improvement in procedures. An outline of these standards and goals is included (Appendix C) because, despite the passage of these codes, so many of these modest proposals have yet to be enacted by states or the federal government.","There are many public health surveillance systems in operation. A review of current surveillance systems reveals that there are over 66 detection systems in use in the U.S. and elsewhere [6] . At the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC), there are 35 different surveillance system applications in production, ranging from surveillance databases, survey applications, inventory and laboratory systems. Many of these PHAC applications are customized to be disease-specific, or are developed for a particular surveillance function (e.g., subject identification encryption). Furthermore, many of these PHAC applications are developed using different technologies. Maintaining these heterogeneous systems are fiscally and resource expensive.","Healthcare providers entertaining a high level of suspicion for a possible SARS-CoV attack should notify hospital infection control, the administrator on duty, and the local public health officer. Appropriate local, state, and federal public health and law enforcement authorities should be involved. In the healthcare area, provision of adequate supplies and reinforcement of patient isolation, mask placement, and thorough hand-washing precautions should be enforced immediately and strictly. Healthcare provider use of N-95 mask, eye protection, gown, shoe covers, and gloves must be enforced; adequate equipment ensured; and clearly marked biohazardous waste receptacles placed to facilitate use and disposal. Rooms, materials, and surfaces possibly contaminated by SARS-CoV patients should be disinfected appropriately with hypochlorite solution. Aerosol-generating procedures, such as intubation and bronchoscopy, if necessary, should be performed by highly experienced staff under the most strict infection control precautions. Exclusion from duty should be considered for exposed unprotected healthcare workers, with temperature and symptom monitoring. Visitors should be excluded from contact with suspected SARS-CoV patients and their close contacts. 25","In the absence of a federal mandate for school closures, the decision of whether or not to close a school is determined by local authorities. The needs and capabilities of both schools and healthcare systems vary drastically across the United States, so county-level simulations of healthcare worker absenteeism and school closures could be far more impactful and targeted for local communities than state or national-level simulations. China's CDC reports that patients with comorbidities such as cardiovascular disease or diabetes had higher rates of fatality from COVID-19 (0.9% case fatality with no reported comorbidities, 10.5% and 7.3% for comorbidities of cardiovascular disease and diabetes, respectively). 6 The prevalence of these comorbidities also varies geographically in the US, further highlighting the importance of regional analysis. [7] [8] [9] To maintain healthcare systems in the event of a school closure, it could be beneficial to assist healthcare workers with child care. Previous work has shown that increased wages are associated with lower absenteeism, so it is possible that child care subsidies could reduce absenteeism by alleviating the financial burden of child care for healthcare workers as well as further incentivizing them to remain at work. 10, 11 Furthermore, the costs of child care (which is the main barrier to finding child care) and the salaries of healthcare workers vary regionally, so the necessity of child care subsidization for healthcare workers could also vary regionally. 12 Here, we provide county-level microsimulation analyses on the potential effects of COVID-19 school closures on healthcare worker absenteeism and hospital bed demand across the entirety of the United States over a range of plausible scenarios. We estimate projected healthcare worker absenteeism, county-level associations between absenteeism and severe COVID-19 risk factors, and the effectiveness of school closures on reducing hospital bed demand; we also identify child care subsidies as a potential solution to help maintain healthcare systems during a pandemic.

By combining travel surveillance with genomic epidemiology, we were able to reconstruct infectious disease outbreaks when local reporting was insufficient. This framework can be applied more generally to detect hidden outbreaks, and future applications may include the integration of empirical data on vector abundance and population immunity. By combining data and resources across multiple scales, we can thus develop surveillance frameworks to uncover epidemiological dynamics of emerging, re-emerging, and endemic infectious diseases across the world.","Whereas focus on emerging and reemerging infections is paramount, requiring ongoing vigilance and a globally linked infrastructure, priority attention must remain on reducing high-burden infections that account for the majority of disease and disability caused by microbial agents. 5, 6 These efforts should ideally work in tandem, enabling rapid recognition and effective response to emerging infections and other public health emergencies along with implementation of new and proven measures to reduce the burden of endemic infectious diseases and advance global health equity. established in 2000 to address threats from epidemic-prone and emerging infectious threats. GOARN provides an operational framework to ensure the availability of skills, expertise, and resources needed to keep the international community aware of and ready to respond to potential outbreaks. 507 In the aftermath of the 2003 SARS outbreak, the global public health community completed work on new International Health Regulations (IHR), an international treaty that gives the WHO authority over and places requirements on its member states for detecting, reporting, and controlling infectious diseases. 508 Adopted by the World Health Assembly in 2005 and made effective in 2007, the new regulations require prompt reporting of all public health emergencies of international concern, expanding beyond infectious diseases to include events resulting from biological, chemical, or radionuclear threats as well as natural disasters. In addition to reporting of public health emergencies of international concern, the regulations require member states to notify the WHO of a single case of smallpox; poliomyelitis due to wild-type poliovirus; SARS; and human influenza caused by a new subtype. With the goal of controlling health threats at the local level, the new regulations allow for the use of surveillance information beyond official state notification and have established new requirements for member states to support existing global surveillance and response systems and to develop proactive systems for strengthening national and international capacities.","To efficiently cope with the 2019-nCoV outbreak, the Chinese Government has implemented rapid and comprehensive public health emergency interventions. To date, all of the 31 provincial-level regions in mainland China with confirmed 2019-nCoV cases have activated socalled level 1 public health emergency responses (ie, the highest level of emergency public health alerts and responses within the national public health management system). 6 The provincial governments are responsible for organising, coordinating, and handling all emergency public health treatments, disclosing information, and gathering emergency materials and facilities under the guidance of the State Council. For health-care sectors, in addition to public health interventions, dealing with public psychological barriers and performing psychological crisis intervention is included in the level 1 response. The National Health Commission has released guidelines for local authorities to promote psychological crisis intervention for patients, medical personnel, and people under medical observation during the 2019-nCoV outbreak. 7 Peking University is preparing a mental health handbook for the public that describes how to deal with stress and other psychological problems occurring due to the outbreak of 2019-nCoV. 8 The Chinese Government strives to improve the public's awareness of prevention and intervention strategies by providing daily updates about surveillance and active cases on websites and social media. Increasingly, psychologists and psychiatrists use the internet and social media (eg, WeChat, Weibo, etc) to share strategies for dealing with psychological stress. For example, experts from Peking University Sixth Hospital made six suggestions for the public to cope with mental stress. 9 These included assessing the accuracy of information disclosed, enhancing social support systems (eg, families and friends), eliminating stigma associated with the epidemic, maintaining a normal life under safe conditions, and using the psychosocial service system, particularly telephone-based and internet-based counselling for health-care staff, patients, family members, and the public. Numerous psychiatric hospitals, psychological counselling centres, and psychology departments within universities have launched specialised hotlines to provide psychological counselling services for people in need. 7 We believe that including mental health care in the national public health emergency system will empower China and the world during the campaign to contain and eradicate 2019-nCoV.","The deficiencies in this legislation were highlighted by the measles epidemic of 1989-1991, which involved more than 55,000 cases and led to 123 deaths. 35, 76 Substantial numbers of unimmunized preschool children, particularly in inner-city areas, contributed to this event. 76 To ensure that vulnerable children had more reliable access to vaccines, the government refocused their funding resources on helping individual states in building immunization infrastructure. VFC is a state-operated federal entitlement program that provides free Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices-recommended vaccines to children 18 years of age or younger who are uninsured, Alaska Native or Native American, eligible for Medicaid, or receive their vaccines in a federally qualified health center. 77 At the state level, funds are earmarked for vaccine purchase and immunization programs. 35 State funds also have been used to purchase vaccines for children and adolescents not eligible for VFC. A combination of VFC, state/local, and Section 317 program funds (i.e., VFC only, VFC and Underinsured, VFC and Underinsured Select, Universal, and Universal Select) has been used by a number of states to purchase all recommended vaccines for children in the state, including the privately insured. 78 Many states use universal programs that expand the eligibility for VFC vaccines by supplementing VFC purchases at federally discounted prices. The universal purchase states have been successful in raising vaccination rates among the underinsured 79 and increasing access to newer and more expensive vaccines for children without insurance. 75 However, criticisms of the universal purchase programs have been raised, including (1) vaccine manufacturers' claims that universal purchase programs unfairly provide for the purchase of all vaccines at lower government contract prices, thus eliminating the private market for vaccines and decreasing revenue; (2) although immunization charges are reduced under this program, patients still pay for the vaccine administration fee; and (3) some contend that taxpayer money should not be spent to provide free vaccines for children whose insurance would otherwise pay for it. 79 State Medicaid and State Children's Health Insurance Program funds also are provided for vaccine purchase, although the level of Medicaid funding varies from state to state.","\u2022 Flexibility: Tracking and monitoring diseases is a dynamic activity. Emerging diseases, such as SARS can appear very quickly, requiring public health officials and surveillance applications to respond just as quickly [10] . When a disease outbreak occurs, it is essential that the technology tools be in place to track cases and contact information. Public health officials do not have the luxury of time to develop systems in response to each disease outbreak. An application must be flexible to handle new diseases [10] . In addition, given the possible links between outbreak events, epidemiologists analyzing data collected by a surveillance system may need to gather different data as they discover new information. A surveillance application must be able to adapt to these changing data and analysis requirements. \u2022 Maintainability: Applications are inherently expensive to maintain. The cost of supporting a deployed software product can be between 60 and 80% of its lifetime cost [11, 12] . The greater the degree of heterogeneity that exists in the application suite available for an organization, the more expensive it is to maintain. For example, different applications tend to use different technologies and different versions of third party software. Keeping track of all the applications' technology version matrices can be complex, and the licensing costs can be expensive. Making viable the sharing of common architectural components among applications reduces support complexity and licensing costs. \u2022 Jurisdictional configurability: Each jurisdiction collecting public health surveillance data has its own policies or business rules governing the content and format of data to be collected. For instance, larger jurisdictions may be able to collect last names of their subjects, while smaller jurisdictions may only be allowed to collect their initials. Similarly, some jurisdictions may want to include the complete date when collecting a birth date, while others can only record the month and the year. An application distributed to different jurisdictions must be able to handle these variations in policy. Furthermore, since policies can change within jurisdictions, established or already implemented applications must be readily configurable. \u2022 Alert notifications: A core requirement of a surveillance application is to send alert notifications to designated people indicating that a certain event has occurred. An event could be the occurrence of two or more cases of a similar disease being reported in potentially multiple jurisdictions within a certain time frame (i.e., outbreak). Another event may raise attention to data anomalies within a case that requires attention. An event could even be a user accessing an application after hours. Events such as these help users to manage their applications and understand the data being stored. Alerts could take the form of an email notification, a message sent to a Personal Digital Assistant (PDA)/cell phone, or a posting to a web site. \u2022 Security: Due to the sensitive nature of public health surveillance data, security is of the utmost concern. One area of concern within security is authorization. Particular individual users of applications may only see a subset of the data, and only certain functions of the application depending upon their role. For instance, if an application collects data from different jurisdictions, a public health official in one jurisdiction should not be able to see data collected in another jurisdiction. Furthermore, access to different parts of the application should be restricted only to those who are authorized. Auditing functions can also assist in monitoring what applications and which data are being accessed by a specific user. \u2022 Usability: Prior to the analysis and reporting of public health information, data must exist in a repository. Currently, data collection poses the single most resource intensive component of surveillance cost, since data must be manually entered into a repository. A disease case can require the collection of, potentially, a few hundred data elements. Based on our experiences, data entry clerks often complain of user interfaces being crowded with irrelevant data fields since not all data elements need to be collected for a case. To reduce this overhead associated with data collection, the presentation of a surveillance application interface must optimize data entry and filter out irrelevant data. \u2022 Data sharing: Public health surveillance applications collect data about different diseases from different demographics. This data is usually stored in different databases. Valuable information could be discovered if field entries from these databases were cross-referenced, and in line with existing legislation and privacy controls stored in a central database. The Pan-Canadian Electronic Health Record project by Canada Health Infoway is a multi-year initiative focussed on integrating Canadian surveillance systems from a data perspective [13] . To support this important objective, a surveillance application must have the capability of sharing data with other applications. \u2022 Statistical analysis and reporting tools: Once data has been collected and entered into the system, epidemiologists and other public health professionals must be able to analyze the data and report on its contents. A number of commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) statistical analysis and reporting tools adequately support this requirement. Thus, PHAC has elected to integrate COTS products into the surveillance environment to support this need.","The atypical pneumonia case, caused by a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), was reported by the World Health Organization, 1 which has been spreading at high rates since the end of December 2019. 2, 3 The 2019-nCoV case was first detected and confirmed in Wuhan, China, before being identified in other Chinese cities. It has also been reported in most countries of the world. 4,5 On January 30, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. The 2019-nCoVinfected pneumonia is characterized by flu-like symptoms such as fever, cough, severe acute respiratory distress syndrome, and in some cases death. 5 Human-to-human transmission has been confirmed for the virus, 6, 7 which is related to Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome (MERS). Like SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the 2019-nCoV is a serious threat to human health. 2 The aforementioned problems have caused the world health systems (especially health systems in the affected countries) to make changes in order to improve and enhance their health systems. At the same time, development and implementation of surveillance systems are essential to identify and respond quickly to such threats. 8 Therefore, the affected countries need to strengthen the traditional monitoring system, simultaneously developing and implementing a wellknown new surveillance system as a Participatory Surveillance System (PSS) to prevent, control, and reduction 2019-nCoV-related complications and burdens. Traditional passive surveillance systems rely on the confirmation laboratory and may not identify emergent disease until there is a high incidence rate in a community or a severe disease presentation. 9 Participatory Surveillance System (PSS) is an approach to diagnosing illnesses that allow the public to report signals directly, providing a quick visualization of data collected to the user and public health organizations. 8, 9 The main purpose of PSS is early detection of community-based epidemics. In the new system, when the number of cases exceeds the defined threshold, the computer system automatically warns the labs and response teams to launch infectious diseases to counter the outbreak. In order to identify and respond quickly to emerging public health threats such as 2019-nCoV, designing and implementing an innovative electronic surveillance system called the PSS for global health security is essential. The current letter could provide a new perspective for public health officials in affected countries.","In the current age of global travel and bioterrorism threats, there is heightened awareness of the possibility of epidemics of severe disease caused by highly transmissible agents. The experience with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) due to coronavirus in which a high percentage of health care workers were infected offered many lessons in biosafety. 2 The precautions required for such specialized lethal diseases are beyond the scope of this chapter. Suspected cases of these conditions should be referred to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) as soon as possible and hopefully before postmortem examination. Local medical examiners or offices and public health laboratories may provide guidance. 3 The CDC, in association with other federal, state, and local agencies, has designated regional laboratories (Laboratory Response Network) to aid in the diagnosis and containment of lethal transmissible conditions. 4, 5 ","Whole-genome sequencing is empowering high-precision infectious disease surveillance and control (48). ECDC developed multi-annual roadmaps for the integration of molecular typing data on high-priority pathogens into its EU surveillance and epidemic preparedness systems, fact-checking the feasibility, and capacity in the EU countries, in synergy with third-party activities along a global One-Health partnership (49\u201351). The added-value of molecular surveillance and WGS-based outbreak investigation was demonstrated following the introduction among the ECDC FWD public health laboratory surveillance network of a novel Multi-Locus Variable Number Tandem Repeat Analysis (MLVA) typing scheme for Salmonella Enteritidis (52). Increases in salmonellosis cases with an uncommon MLVA profile were posted first by Scotland and then by the Netherlands in January and August 2016 in the Epidemic Intelligence Information System (53, 54). Several other countries reported detection of this MLVA profile. WGS analysis performed either by national reference laboratories or in a central facility through ECDC support confirmed a multi-country outbreak involving two distinct Salmonella Enteritidis genomic types. An outbreak investigation team involving affected countries, ECDC, and EFSA agreed on the outbreak case definition based on WGS and MLVA types, assessed the magnitude of the outbreak, and identified response options. At least 18 EU/EEA countries were affected by the outbreak. Environmental and food investigations by the food safety authorities showed that food establishments or retail shops in eight EU countries had received eggs contaminated with Salmonella Enteritidis of the epidemic MLVA or WGS types from farms located in one EU country (53).","Every year, around one in fi ve patients acquires an HAI in US hospitals. 30 These infections result in about $26-33 billion in excess medical costs and around 99 000 deaths yearly. 30, 31 However, these estimates do not include the substantial burden and consequences of HAIs in non-hospital settings such as long-term care facilities, dialysis settings, and outpatient clinics, where an increasing number of invasive practices are done. HAI reduction strategies largely focus on endemic problems such as catheter-associated urinary tract infections, central-line-associated bloodstream infections, and surgical-site infections, all of which can fuel antimicrobial resistance. Investigations of HAI-related outbreaks can provide important information for improvements in infection control. 32 For example, infections due to unsafe injection practices, 33 including reuse of syringes and inappropriate use of single-use vials, have led to targeted educational campaigns for both patients and health-care providers. 34 Outbreaks have also occurred from contaminated products including those prepared in compounding pharmacies. In 2012-13, a large HAI outbreak in the USA-involving more than 14 000 patients who were potentially exposed and resulting in 751 reported cases of fungal infections, including 384 cases of meningitis and 64 deaths across 20 states 35 -was caused by injections of contaminated steroids produced by a single compounding facility. 36 In the early to mid-2000s, several large-scale US regional and state-wide projects showed substantial decreases for central-line-associated bloodstream infections in intensive care units through focused eff orts to increase adherence to a set of recommended practices for insertion and maintenance of intravascular catheters. 37, 38 Momentum from these and other successes [39] [40] [41] led to new federal, state, and local eff orts to prevent HAIs. In 2009, a national action plan was released, setting goals and metrics for the prevention of HAIs. 42 Additional eff orts included state mandates for HAI reporting to improve accountability and fi nancial incentives off ered by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services for adherence to CDC's infection control guidelines. All 50 states now have HAI prevention plans and state HAI coordinators, resulting in stronger links between health-care facilities, state health departments, state hospital associations, and qualityimprovement organisations.","The COVID19 pandemic has driven rapid change management for many healthcare settings nationally. These rapid changes have caused many healthcare systems, including our own, to move from Conventional capacity, to Contingency capacity delivery in a matter of weeks. It is hoped that Contingency capacity in addition to federal, state, and local government recommendations for social distancing and other measures to reduce transmission, will help avoid a need for Crisis care. However, it is important to develop a strategy for delivery of palliative care in both the Contingency capacity and Crisis capacity. This document details the UW Medicine's experience with Palliative Care Response Planning and we offer this approach for other institutions to adopt and adapt to their local setting. This strategy has several important limitations. First, we describe the strategy for a single healthcare system with a relatively mature palliative care program. Certain aspects of this strategy may not generalize to other locations. Second, this strategy is undergoing constant modifications and is a work in progress. However, we thought that it would be useful to share it with others early given the rapid expansion of this pandemic. Finally, it is important to acknowledge that this strategy is a plan that has not been fully implemented. We are actively using the conventional and some of the contingency capacity approaches, but some contingency and all crisis capacity strategies have not been tested.","More far reaching for security operations management was the Homeland Security Act of 2002 (PL 107-296). This Act created the most significant change in government structure since establishment of the Department of Defense through the National Security Act of 1947. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) resulted from the merging of 22 federal agencies with a mandate to establish a safe and secure homeland. The impact on security operations didn't end at the federal level. Additionally, Homeland Security Presidential Directive/HSPD-5 tasked DHS to develop and administer a National Incident Management System (NIMS) and a National response plan (Nrp). The private sector was to participate in the process. Within a few years following 9/11, every state government and the District of Columbia established an entity to find ways to protect communities from terrorist risks. This structure also facilitated a practical objective: state governments were now able to receive funding from DHS and other entities concerned with protection. The net effect of DHS was to channel billions of dollars for security products, services, systems, and research throughout the nation. Furthermore, agencies within DHS encouraged and mandated changes in security practices in the private sector.","Laissez-faire Approach. Federal, state and local authorities take no mitigation or suppression measures in this scenario. Population can still take precautions if their personal benefits exceed personal costs. This scenario is closest to the approach used in the 2009 flu pandemic and other flu epidemics with lower mortality rates.","The 2019-nCoV has impacted multiple countries, caused severe illness, and sustained person-to-person transmission making it a concerning and serious public health threat. It is unclear how this virus will impact the U.S. over time. For the general population, who are unlikely to be exposed to this virus at the current time, the immediate health risk from 2019-nCoV is considered low. CDC, multiple other federal agencies, state and local health departments, and other partners are implementing aggressive measures to slow U.S. transmission of 2019-nCoV (4,5). These measures require the identification of cases and contacts in the United States and the effective management of the estimated 14,000 travelers arriving from mainland China to the United States each day (3). These measures are being implemented based on the assumption that there will be more U.S. 2019-nCoV cases occurring with potential chains of transmission, with the understanding that these measures might not prevent the eventual establishment of ongoing, widespread transmission of the virus in the United States.","(3) those affected may be contagious during a prolonged asymptomatic incubation period, and many never develop symptoms distinctive from a mild flu, making it difficult to identify and isolate the infected before they pass the virus to others. (4) Broad public mandates for social distancing are also vital to help manage a key multiplier of COVID-19 fatality rates: a substantial fraction of patients require lengthy (on average 8 bed days) intensive care unit (ICU) support to survive acute respiratory distress, and uncontrolled spread of the disease is expected to generate at its peak far greater demand for ICU care than existing capacity can meet.(5; 2; 6) Public health experts have pleaded with officials to quickly mandate social distancing to flatten the curve of coronavirus infections -that is, reduce the peak caseload -before exponential case growth leads to hundreds of thousands or millions of deaths. In particular, it is important to keep peak levels low to prevent the fatality rate from rising to the levels seen in areas where hospitals are overwhelmed with cases. (7) In the United States, the emergence of the coronavirus has created a natural experiment in which elected officials face incredibly urgent and far-reaching policy decisions for which they typically have no personal experience or expertise, and for which the history of policy examples is either mere days old, or so dated as to be largely unknown except by public health experts. The most significant policy decisions of this kindboth in terms of their potential to mitigate the epidemic and their economic consequences -are mandates for social distancing through restrictions on public gatherings; closure or restriction of schools, restaurants, and other non-essential businesses; and orders for the public to stay at home. (8) Under the federal and state constitutions, the key actions fall to executives, and particularly to governors, whose powers in public health emergencies are typically singular and extensive.","There have been a wide range in responses across states since the first case of COVID-19 was announced in Washington State on January 14, 2020. Upon this, the CDC began releasing recommendations to those at risk of being exposed to the virus. The initial recommendations included travel warnings and restricted travel to countries with confirmed cases and sustained COVID-19 spread. These travel restrictions grew to include inbound and outbound travel bans to a list of 26 countries, in both Europe and Asia. 108 Other policies have included social distancing, which has been widely recommended or enforced at various levels of government. This method involves avoiding crowds, staying home, limiting or avoiding visiting vulnerable populations (such as long-term care facilities) and standing at least six feet away from others in public spaces. Some regions have implemented school closures at both the K-12 and higher education level. Business closures have also been recommended or enforced, such that employees should work from home, unless their work is considered essential to the greater public (e.g. health care, grocery stores). To support employees working remotely or staying home when sick, a number of states have also mandated paid sick leave for those who are affected by . Free testing has also been implemented in certain states, so that anyone experiencing symptoms or has been exposed to the virus can now get tested for free. 111 We coded various policies that cancel events and large gatherings as follows: the cancellation of large events, specifically the election postponement in Louisiana, is categorized as \" event_cancel .\" The separate \" no_gathering \" policy variable represents policy measures that banned all events or mass gatherings of a certain size, i.e. no gatherings over a certain number of people (where this number has varied by region). The \" social_distance \" category includes measures that prevent visits to elderly care facilities, close public facilities such as libraries, and require workers to work remotely. The \" emergency_declaration \" encompasses the declarations of a state of emergency at the city, county, state, and federal level. This declaration allows the affected area to immediately marshal emergency funds and resources and activate emergency legislation, while also giving the public an indication of the gravity of the situation.","Methods aimed at limiting population mixing between infected or infectious cases and uninfected individuals can result in the application of isolation or quarantine. Often referred to as \"police powers, \" federal, state, and local governments, depending on specific legal authorities, can control the movement of individuals or populations to protect the general public from communicable diseases. 112, 113 Isolation is the process and procedure used to prevent an infected individual from potentially transmitting a communicable disease to others. Traditionally, it has been applied to individuals with serious, life-threatening infections who have not or cannot be treated so as to be rendered noninfectious. The potential for bioterrorism-related illnesses, such as smallpox or pneumonic plague and the occurrence of SARS, have highlighted this issue. Quarantine, the separation or restriction of movement of persons who are not ill but are believed to have been exposed to infection, to prevent transmission of disease was developed in the 14th century but has been implemented rarely on a large scale during the past century. The SARS pandemic demonstrated that governments might use quarantine as a public health tool to treat infectious diseases, particularly if other preventive interventions (e.g., vaccines and antibiotics) are unavailable. 113, 114 In some instances, the best mechanism to prevent disease occurrence is through modification of the host, such as developing or boosting immunity through active or passive immunization. Other examples of control activities targeted to the host include improving nutritional status and providing chemoprophylaxis against a variety of agents.","Also at the global level, the UN Office for DRR [8] issued a press release on the 12th of March 2020 urging disaster management agencies to prioritize biological hazards. The UNDRR asked national disaster management agencies to continue with the development of their preparedness and response capacities to include health emergencies as a top priority, alongside earthquakes, floods, storms and other natural hazards (UNDRR, 2020). It also highlighted the importance of silo-breaking in disaster prevention and management, notably the silos between disaster management and health workers. The UNDRR reiterates that the Sendai Framework emphasizes the need for resilient health systems and the integration of disaster risk management into health care provision at all levels. After all, Sendai turns the focus from disaster response and management to preparedness, surveillance and disaster risk management in the health context (UNDRR, 2020). Yet it is not clear whether COVID-19 is leading to collaboration between the WHO and the UNDRR. We appraise the speed and scale by which COVID-19 response funds are made available. International funding organisations, regional government bodies and private entities have proposed major financial measures. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) made $50 billion in loans available to deal with the coronavirus, including $10 billion of zero-interest loans to the poorest IMF member countries (IMF, 2020). The EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen announced a \u20ac25 billion coronavirus investment fund for the health care sector, labour market and SMEs (EU, 2020). The World Bank Group increases COVID-19 Response to $14 billion to help sustain economies and protect jobs. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) announces $6.5 billion initial response to COVID-19 pandemic (ADB, 2020). The UN announced $15 million dollars from the UN's Central Emergency Fund to help fund global efforts to contain the spread of the COVID-19 coronavirus, particularly vulnerable countries with weak health care systems (UN, 2020). It is important to note that in the SFDRR, investment and finance are at the core of Sendai Framework, in terms of the resilience investment needed for countries and communities.","Our Series paper describes examples of recent and continuing challenges to control infectious diseases in the USA. We discuss vaccine-preventable diseases and the substantial successes and persistent challenges in their control; health-care-associated infections (HAIs), a leading preventable cause of death; emerging zoonotic and vector-borne diseases and their spread across a globalised world; foodborne infections, increasingly linked to new sources of contamination; and the intersecting epidemics of HIV, sexually transmitted infections (STIs), chronic viral hepatitis, and tuberculosis. Antimicrobial-resistant pathogens, several of which have become or are becoming resistant to all available drugs, are intensifying these threats. In addition to their eff ect \u2022 Despite major advances towards their control, infectious diseases continue to present substantial challenges to health and health-care resources in the USA \u2022 Priority actions to meet these challenges include addressing high-burden diseases such as HIV and chronic hepatitis, foodborne diseases, and health-care-associ ated infections; targeting outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases; and controlling endemic and emerging vector-borne and zoonotic infections \u2022 Antimicrobial resistance has become a global health crisis that demands new multidisciplinary approaches and collaborations across local, state, regional, national, and international levels \u2022 Rapidly evolving molecular technologies and increases in microbial understanding off er new opportunities for treatment, prevention, and control of infectious diseases \u2022 Ongoing enhancements in communication capacities, including social media, are bringing new techniques to monitor infectious diseases and rapidly share prevention information on human health, these diseases cause substantial health-care, workplace, and other societal costs. We discuss priority actions needed to meet these challenges including modernisation of existing surveillance systems to better inform public health action; enhancement of public health laboratories to incorporate the latest molecular technologies for improved disease detection and outbreak response; and strengthening of the clinical and public health interface to facilitate information exchange and leverage changes in health care to improve prevention and control of infectious diseases.","Failure of host countries to protect the health of refugees and migrants; epidemic of devastating rumours and fake news on social media due to increased digital connectivity; emergence of social influencers exerting influence on politicians and institutions; increased resistance and hesitancy within communities to health interventions because of opposition by local experts Environment Geography affecting biological diversity; planned and unplanned urbanisation; climate change; interaction between humans, animals, and vectors; human development; state of the economy; state of health systems Climate change resulting in increased flooding with failed sanitation and safe water; altered distribution of zoonotic disease reservoirs and vectors; emerging zoonosis with increased agricultural production and human encroachment into animal environments; changing national priorities resulting in sharply reduced investment in health systems Pathogenesis Changing disease biomes; relationship between hosts and pathogens; pathogen evolution and changes; technologies such as synthetic biology, and the risks of manufacturing pathogens and their accidental or deliberate release; characteristics of a population such as underlying disease condition Increased opportunities for mutation or reassortment of infectious agents; increasingly reduced effectiveness of conventional vaccines and therapeutics for prevention and treatment of diseases; failure of conventional control measures to break the chain of transmission of infectious agents To tackle the wide-ranging issues, the Commission has brought together experts from academic, public health, policy making, international, non-governmental, and corporate institutions. They bring local and global knowledge and experience, including policy-making and field response, human and animal health (including One Health) approaches, and novel developments in communications, information technology, analytics, public health, diagnostics, and therapeutics. The Commission aims to deliver the report by 2021 and will include key recommendations for countries and international stakeholders, and monitoring indicators to evaluate the effectiveness of preparedness initiatives over time. The Mok Hing Yiu Charitable Foundation is the sole sponsor for the Lancet Infectious Diseases Commission meetings and travel for some commissioners. The foundation is not involved in the technical discussions, data analysis, and drafting of the report. This Comment was written on the behalf of the Lancet Infectious Diseases Commission on Preparedness for Emerging Epidemic Threats; see appendix (pp 1-2) for the Commissions author list.","The US classified the coronavirus disease pandemic (COVID-19) as a national emergency on March 14, 2020 . Cumulative US cases surged beyond 122,000 on March 29, 2020. [2, 3] Its rapid spread in China and Italy quickly overwhelmed available hospital beds. [4, 5] County-level forecasts of demand for hospital beds based on data commonly available to hospitals would help guide US hospital efforts to anticipate and mitigate similar bed shortages. [6, 7] In order to plan their response, hospital and public health officials need to understand how many people in their area are likely to require hospitalization for COVID-19; how these numbers compare to the number of available intensive care and acute care beds; and how to project the impact of socialdistancing measures on utilization. Since the majority of people with COVID-19 are asymptomatic and the rates of cases requiring hospitalization differ significantly across age groups, answering these questions requires understanding the epidemic and accounting for the specific vulnerabilities of the local population. [8, 9] The numbers of people in each age group differ significantly across US counties, as do the available hospital resources [10, 11] . Initial analyses of the potential impact of COVID-19 have spurred governmental action at the federal and state level; however, significant differences remain in the policies implemented across states and counties. [9, 12] In order to help facilitate adequate and appropriate local responses, we developed a simple model to project the number of people in each county in the United States who are likely to require hospitalization as a result of COVID-19 given the age distribution of the county per the US Census. The model compares the projected number of individuals needing hospitalization to the publicly known numbers of available intensive and acute care beds and allows users to model the impact of social-distancing or other measures to slow the spread of the virus. The uncertainty surrounding the numbers of people infected and the rates of spread make it difficult to evaluate the accuracy of projections generated by complex epidemiological models. The model presented errs on the side of simplicity and transparency to allow non-specialist policymakers to fully understand the logic and uncertainty associated with the estimates.","Public health is practiced through complex relationships of organizations (e.g., local, federal) and functionally organized units (e.g., health departments, disease programs) [9] . As a direct consequence, public health applications must be flexible, secure and able to handle differences between jurisdictions. The Profiler Component is designed to meet these requirements. The Profiler is a generic component customized to manage the authorization of an entity across different organizations. An entity is defined as anything that should be restricted at some level (e.g., a disease data element or an application function). The configuration of accessibility to these entities creates a profile. Profiles are handled through the Access Manager in the Configuration Layer, and this tool is used to assign multiple profiles to a user.","In 2002-2003 when China did not identify the SARS epidemic, some other international public health agencies had detected clues on SARS through surveillance using Internet-based data. This low cost and high effective surveillance model was later acknowledged by some Chinese public health professionals, and they attempted to apply the model in practice. In the commonly applied early model, surveillance staff manually searched through media reports on mainstream newspapers, radio and TV on a weekly (or monthly) basis, detected possible abnormal signals, and drafted media surveillance reports which were disseminated to public health professionals and agencies. The 2003 SARS epidemic revealed the overall weakness of Chinese public health system. After that event improvement of traditional surveillance systems were well done; however, few efforts were made to explore and develop infectious disease/emergency public health event-based surveillance by leveraging Internet-based information. The early surveillance using Internet-based data model featured manual searches that were not systematic and long cycles, and could not handle the huge amount of Internet-based information and frequent updating, and therefore tended to miss huge quantity of abnormal signals.","A final category of observational study that integrates multiple epidemiologic methods is the outbreak investigation. A special feature of outbreak investigations is that they are frequently conducted with a sense of urgency because of the ongoing occurrence of cases, the need to rapidly implement control measures, or intense public and media interest in the outbreak. Investigations of the first documented outbreak of legionnaires' disease, the 1993 outbreak of hantavirusassociated respiratory illness in the southwestern United States, and the posting of anthrax-contaminated letters were lead stories for national news media. The importance of rapid investigation of outbreaks has increased with perceptions of the threats posed by such events, whether naturally emerging or intentional. Standard methods for conducting outbreak investigations are available. 43 Specific surveillance systems have been established for outbreaks of foodborne and waterborne diseases, influenza, and a range of infections in institutional settings. At the local or state level, outbreaks may be reported because a physician or the public is aware of the health department's existence and desires some intervention. Once an outbreak has been recognized, it is necessary to determine its extent in terms of person, place, and time. For example, the nationwide outbreak associated with Schwan's ice cream initially appeared as an increased occurrence of cases in southeastern Minnesota. 62 These cases served to index the larger outbreak occurring throughout the distribution area for the implicated product. Similarly, a cluster of four human Salmonella serotype I 4,5,12:i:\u2212 infections with an identical PFGE pattern was identified by the Pennsylvania Department of Health and reported to PulseNet in June 2007. As recognition of the outbreak increased and the case count soared to 401 cases across 41 states, a series of independent and coordinated studies was conducted by state and local health departments in collaboration with CDC. After a cluster of cases was linked to consumption of potpies by the Minnesota Department of Health in October, a multistate case-control study quickly confirmed the association, identified a specific product, and determined that most of the patients cooked the potpies in a microwave oven, without regard to cooking instructions. 70 However, the potpies were not ready-to-eat foods. Undercooking of foods in microwave ovens has surfaced as an important risk factor in several recent outbreaks of salmonellosis. 71 Molecular subtyping by PFGE and comparison of subtype patterns through PulseNet has become the primary method for detecting multistate foodborne outbreaks caused by E. coli O157:H7, Salmonella, and Listeria. 72 However, the recognition of these outbreaks requires the accumulation of multiple cases over time. The timeliness of outbreak investigations is further limited by the need to interview cases, formulate hypotheses, and subsequently recruit and interview controls. Currently, all listeriosis cases in the United States are interviewed as part of a national Listeria initiative. 73 This has allowed the use of case-case comparisons, with the results of subtyping to distinguish outbreak organisms per half-cup serving, levels that rendered microbiologic surveillance of ice cream insensitive. Furthermore, the case-control study established that contamination of the pasteurized ice cream premix occurred during transport in tanker trailers that had previously carried nonpasteurized liquid eggs, even though regulatory officials were not able to isolate S. enteritidis from any environmental samples.","While some researchers continued to build understanding of the larger realms in which infectious disease existed, there was a tendency for social and ecological factors to be considered separately rather than interactively. For instance, in Latin America, unequal distribution and access to resources, as well as institutionalized racism, class, and gender inequalities, were given primacy in theories of disease causation, with emphasis on holistic explanatory accounts of infection based on the triangulation of quantitative and qualitative research methods (Laurell, 1989; Almeida-Filho and Goldbaum, 2004), and the transformative potential of \u201csocial ecosystems\u201d (Breilh, 1991). Elsewhere, scientists studying the \u201cecology of infectious disease\u201d (Real, 1996; Smith et al., 2005) did not necessarily focus on human pathogens but offered biophysical insights with far-reaching implications for epidemiological and biomedical thinking (Wilcox, 2005). As the century ended, calls for integration of social and ecological determinants of health penetrated epidemiology and public health, and ranged from socio\u2013ecologic systems perspective (McMichael, 1999), to a proposal for an \u201cecosocial\u201d approach to health (Krieger, 2001). A convergence of systems-based concepts with health and epidemiological research and policy was finally occurring (Parkes et al., 2003, Table 1), with obvious application in research that responds to the linked social and environmental risk factors of emerging infections (Weiss and McMichael, 2004).","Four variables were included in the model as potential confounders: the cumulative number of imported cases, time since the first reported case (to account for right-censoring), the median age of the national population (United Nations database, https://ourworldindata.org/age-structure, to account for the higher incidence of severe cases in older people, which may be more readily detected), and the capacity of the country to detect an emerging infectious disease. The Global Health Security Index (GHSI) (https://www.ghsindex.org/) publishes a country-level score (out of 100) for capacity for \"early detection and reporting for epidemics of potential concern\". This indicator is a weighted average of indicators related to laboratory systems, real-time surveillance and reporting, epidemiology workforce, and data integration between human, animal and environmental health sectors, each of which reflects a core capacity defined under the International Health Regulations (2005).","Fourth, the three health systems developed plans to sustain routine health-care services, but the integration of services has been problematic. In Japan, as the capacity at designated hospitals becomes overstretched, the coordination between hospitals and local government will be a major challenge. In Singapore, at the beginning of the outbreak, there were difficulties with disseminating information to the private sector. In all locations, intensive-care unit bed capacity is limited.","The incident of melamine-contaminated milk powder in 2008 further strengthened the determination of Chinese public health sector in fully developing surveillance based on Internet information. After the 2008 Olympic Games, China CDC arranged public health surveillance staff to access the Internet for information on public health on a daily basis, and incorporate valuable information into daily report through rapid screening; the risk assessment group consisting of more professional staff members would then analyze and make conclusions, aiming to identify public health event signals and bridge the gaps in traditional surveillance systems. In December 2008, the Chinese Ministry of Health (now the National Health and Family Planning Commission) released the Standards for Disease Prevention and Control Performance Evaluation, in which provincial, prefectural and county level CDCs were required to search international and domestic disease information. From then on, public health surveillance using Internet-based information has become an essential task of CDCs at all levels in China.","Second, transcending disciplinary boundaries also requires consideration of different types of integration (Fig. 1) which are introduced and defined here prior to discussing them in our case examples. \u201cHorizontal\u201d integration is defined as integration across knowledge perspectives, such as disciplines or sectors; \u201cvertical\u201d integration means integration among different types of knowledge users, and may include perspectives from academics, as well as local communities and cultures, and NGO staff, for example.  ","While the two types of integration in Figure 1 function in complementary ways, they are fundamentally different, and should not be conflated. Integration \u201cacross\u201d disciplines is one starting point to facilitate a holistic, social\u2013ecological understanding of the metaphenomenon of increased disease emergence globally. However, vertical integration, by lending opportunities to incorporate what Brown et al. (2005) describe as individual, local, specialized, strategic, and holistic knowledge perspectives, provides a variety of new \u201chands\u201d that can be utilized on deck. Important practical, ethical, and political implications accompany the inclusion of these new \u201chands\u201d and nonacademic voices. This is highlighted by Lebel (2003) in his linking of \u201ctransdisciplinarity,\u201d \u201cparticipation,\u201d and \u201cequity\u201d through their roles as the three pillars of \u201cecosystem approaches to human health.\u201d Breilh (2003) argues that it is impossible to understand the dynamics and conditions of human infectious diseases without embedding them within the (often inequitable) social relations in which they reside. Approaches to EID control that successfully integrate considerations of participation and equity into their strategies are likely to raise questions about global and local forces driving social and ecological change, and about the needs of those most vulnerable to infectious diseases, in particular women and children (Gerberding, 2004; McDonald et al., 2004), thereby engaging explicitly with the political economy of health (Krieger, 2001).","Case reports for use in surveillance can be collected in an active or a passive manner. Active surveillance involves a regular, systematic effort to contact reporting sources or to review records within an institution to ascertain information on the occurrence of newly diagnosed diseases or infections. An example of an active surveillance system for foodborne illnesses is FoodNet, which operates as part of CDC's Emerging Infections Program. 56 Active laboratory-based surveillance for confirmed cases of Campylobacter, Cryptosporidium, Cyclospora, E. coli O157:H7, Listeria, Salmonella, Shigella, and Vibrio increased from five sites, covering 5% of the U.S. population in 1996 to 10 sites covering approximately 15% of the population in 2007. Each clinical laboratory in the surveillance catchment areas is contacted weekly or monthly to ensure that all confirmed infections under surveillance have been reported. These data have been extremely useful in establishing national estimates for the burden of foodborne illness in the United States and for monitoring trends in the incidence of specific foodborne agents. Passive surveillance relies on the individual clinician or laboratory to initiate the report. For many diseases of public health importance, passive surveillance can be almost as comprehensive as active surveillance. Although surveillance systems are labeled as active or passive based on how cases are reported, all surveillance systems require an active review and analysis of reported cases, with dissemination of results to key stakeholders. 44 Two key qualities of community-based surveillance for infectious diseases that must be considered when interpreting surveillance data are representativeness and timeliness. These qualities vary by disease and depend on multiple factors. The first factor of importance is that the patient must seek medical attention. It is not common for persons with mild or limited illnesses to seek medical attention. Second, the physician must seek laboratory testing of appropriate clinical specimens to confirm the diagnosis. Third, the laboratory must have the capability to identify the agent. Fourth, the physician and laboratory must report the clinical and laboratory findings to public health officials in a timely manner. Fifth, the availability of molecular subtyping techniques such as PFGE and the ability to compare PFGE patterns electronically through the national computer network PulseNet can greatly increase both the sensitivity and the specificity of pathogenspecific surveillance. Even in states where laboratory-based infectious disease reporting is required, there may be confusion among physicians and laboratory officials regarding who has the responsibility for reporting. Finally, public health agencies must have the resources to conduct timely and routine follow-up of such reports, to ascertain basic case demographic and other relevant data. Failure at any step of this process results in loss of information to the community-based surveillance system.","Not surprisingly, given that the above developments are recent, hypotheses and research methods that integrate the social and ecological causes and effects of global disease emergence are in their infancy. \u201cEcosystem approaches\u201d to health (Waltner-Toews, 2001; Lebel, 2003; De Plaen and Kilelu, 2004) offer examples of research methods that explicitly engage with the ecological and social systems within which health is created and challenged, although these approaches were not developed specifically for EID investigation. However, these and other systems-based approaches provide some common principles with which to help understand the nested, interdependent systems in which diseases emerge, maintain themselves, and evolve on a multitude of levels\u2014molecular, organismal, communal, national, and global (Wilcox and Colwell, 2005). Understanding of these \u201cnested hierarchies\u201d is complemented by the idea of coupled human\u2013natural systems, in which humans are both part of nature and fundamentally conditioned by social activity. This recognition, in turn, encourages researchers to incorporate into their methods and research design the idea that \u201cdelineation between social systems and ecosystems is artificial and arbitrary\u201d (Berkes et al., 2003, p 2). Research that explicitly engages with the complexity of systems\u2019 interactions (Kay et al., 1999), and the associated concepts of adaptation and resilience (Holling, 2001), offer valuable precedents and fertile ground for understanding the social, ecological, and economic contexts in which EIDs occur. Yet, despite these developments, systematic formulation, development, and application of approaches that integrate the social and ecological aspects of disease emergence into research paradigms has not yet occurred. The role of transdisciplinary approaches in helping to achieve such an integration is the central theme of this article.","The final principle is support. Perianesthesia nursing leaders should ensure that their staff has the proper education and training to care for surge patients, adequate quantities of surge supplies, and sufficient staff reinforcements should a true influenza pandemic present itself. Because of the inherent infection control issues, staff should also receive training regarding which personal protective equipment (PPE) is necessary and how to properly don and doff the PPE. 14,15 Supply shortages will be routine in a pandemic, thereby making it impractical to rely on just-in-time supplies. Some supplies will be available to health care facilities from the federal Strategic National Stockpile; however, these ''push packages'' are delivered to the state level, and it may take time for the supplies to arrive at the local facility requesting the items. 16 As such, par levels should be increased for critical items, in anticipation of high use and broken supply chains.","Mobilizing community leaders, artists, athletes, and local role models would help to convey a 190 unique message to the population, and to gather support from the wealthy that could provide 191 resources to expand the production of medical equipment. Brazil is, in theory, uniquely equipped to respond to the COVID-19 epidemic. It has a free and 202 universal health system, 7 it has one of largest community-based primary care delivery programs 203 that serves 74\u00b78% of the population, 28 it can learn from the mistakes and success that other 204 countries hit by COVID-19 have made, and it has a history of responding to health threats by 205 implementing governmental action and by generating high-quality scientific evidence, such as 206 was done when Zika virus hit the country. 29 Yet, the current moment is unique. It requires a 207 unified message from the country's leadership at various levels: federal, state, and municipal. It 208 requires the industry to work in solidarity to produce needed inputs without aiming profit but the 209 collective wellbeing. It requires the population to realize the importance and the urgency to 210 comply. We hope our results will help to move forward this agenda. 211 212 All rights reserved.

On January 7, 2020, Chinese health officials confirmed that a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) was associated with this initial cluster (1). As of February 4, 2020, a total of 20,471 confirmed cases, including 2,788 (13.6%) with severe illness,* and 425 deaths (2.1%) had been reported by the National Health Commission of China (2). Cases have also been reported in 26 locations outside of mainland China, including documentation of some person-to-person transmission and one death (2). As of February 4, 11 cases had been reported in the United States.

Microbiology has been at the core of European infectious disease surveillance networks for decades. Since 2010, these networks have been coordinated by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC). Activities delivered in these networks include harmonization of laboratory diagnostic, antimicrobial susceptibility and molecular typing methods, multicentre method validation, technical capacity mapping, training of laboratory staff, and continuing quality assessment of laboratory testing. Cooperation among the European laboratory networks in the past 7 years has proved successful in strengthening epidemic preparedness by enabling adaptive capabilities for rapid detection of emerging pathogens across Europe. In partnership with food safety authorities, inte...","Abstract The goal of syndromic surveillance is the earlier detection of epidemics, allowing a timelier public health response than is possible using traditional surveillance methods. Syndromic surveillance application for public health purposes has changed over time and reflects a dynamic evolution from the collection, interpretation of data with dissemination of data to those who need to act, to a more holistic approach that incorporates response as a core component of the surveillance system. Recent infectious disease threats, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), avian influenza (H5N1) and pandemic influenza (H1N1), have all highlighted the need for countries to be rapidly aware of the spread of infectious diseases within a region and across the globe. The International Health Regulations (IHR) obligation to report public health emergencies of international concern has raised the importance of early outbreak detection and response. The emphasis in syndromic surveillance ...","Summary Objective Public health surveillance applications are central to the collection, analysis and dissemination of disease and health information. As these applications evolve and mature, it is evident that many of these applications must address similar requirements, such as policies, security and flexibility. It is important a software architecture is created to meet these requirements. Methods We outline the requirements for a public health surveillance application, and define a set of common components to address these requirements. These components are configured to produce services used in the development of public health applications. Results A layered software architecture, the ALPHA architecture, has been developed to support the development of public health applications. The architecture has been used to build eleven surveillance applications for the Public Health Agency of Canada in the areas of disease surveillance, survey, distributed data collection and inventory mana...","Abstract Purpose The purpose of the study was (1) to identify the requirements for syndromic, disease surveillance and epidemiology systems arising from events such as the SARS outbreak in March 2003, and the deliberate spread of Bacillus anthracis, or anthrax, in the US in 2001; and (2) to use these specifications as input to the construction of a system intended to meet these requirements. An important goal was to provide information about the diffusion of a communicable disease without being dependent on centralised storage of information about individual patients or revealing patient-identifiable information. Methods The method applied is rooted in the engineering paradigm involving phases of analysis, system specification, design, implementation, and testing. The requirements were established from earlier projects\u2019 conclusions and analysis of disease outbreaks. The requirements were validated by a literature study of syndromic and disease surveillance systems. The system was teste...","Since its emergence and detection in Wuhan, China in late 2019, the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has spread to nearly every country around the world, resulting in hundreds of thousands of infections to date. The virus was first detected in the Pacific Northwest region of the United States in January, 2020, with subsequent COVID-19 outbreaks detected in all 50 states by early March. To uncover the sources of SARS-CoV-2 introductions and patterns of spread within the U.S., we sequenced nine viral genomes from early reported COVID-19 patients in Connecticut. Our phylogenetic analysis places the majority of these genomes with viruses sequenced from Washington state. By coupling our genomic data with domestic and international travel patterns, we show that early SARS-CoV-2 transmission in Connecticut was likely driven by domestic introductions. Moreover, the risk of domestic importation to Connecticut exceeded that of international importation by mid-March regardless of our estimated impact...","Summary Background Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), first detected in China in December, 2019. In January, 2020, state, local, and federal public health agencies investigated the first case of COVID-19 in Illinois, USA. Methods Patients with confirmed COVID-19 were defined as those with a positive SARS-CoV-2 test. Contacts were people with exposure to a patient with COVID-19 on or after the patient's symptom onset date. Contacts underwent active symptom monitoring for 14 days following their last exposure. Contacts who developed fever, cough, or shortness of breath became persons under investigation and were tested for SARS-CoV-2. A convenience sample of 32 asymptomatic health-care personnel contacts were also tested. Findings Patient 1\u2014a woman in her 60s\u2014returned from China in mid-January, 2020. One week later, she was hospitalised with pneumonia and tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Her husband (Pat...","Social distancing policies are critical but economically painful measures to flatten the curve against emergent infectious diseases. As the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19 spread throughout the United States in early 2020, the federal government issued social distancing recommendations but left to the states the most difficult and consequential decisions restricting behavior, such as canceling events, closing schools and businesses, and issuing stay-at-home orders. We present an original dataset of state-level social distancing policy responses to the epidemic and explore how political partisanship, COVID-19 caseload, and policy diffusion explain the timing of governors' decisions to mandate social distancing. An event history analysis of five social distancing policies across all fifty states reveals the most important predictors are political: all else equal, Republican governors and governors from states with more Trump supporters were slower to adopt social distancing polici...","A major focus of systems biology is to characterize interactions between cellular components, in order to develop an accurate picture of the intricate networks within biological systems. Over the past decade, protein microarrays have greatly contributed to advances in proteomics and are becoming an important platform for systems biology. Protein microarrays are highly flexible, ranging from large-scale proteome microarrays to smaller customizable microarrays, making the technology amenable for detection of a broad spectrum of biochemical properties of proteins. In this article, we will focus on the numerous studies that have utilized protein microarrays to reconstruct biological networks including protein\u2013DNA interactions, posttranslational protein modifications (PTMs), lectin\u2013glycan recognition, pathogen\u2013host interactions and hierarchical signaling cascades. The diversity in applications allows for integration of interaction data from numerous molecular classes and cellular states, pr...","This year marks the 15th anniversary of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in Canada and the 100th anniversary of the 1918 Spanish influenza pandemic. These, and other recent public health events, provide an opportunity for us to review and reflect on the evolution of Canada\u2019s public health emergency response over the past 15 years\u2014from SARS, to the 2009 H1N1 pandemic influenza, to Ebola virus and Zika virus disease. Key lessons have been learned and milestones achieved that have shaped and sharpened our response approach and structures. While SARS was a wake-up-call to strengthen infection prevention and control capacity in health care settings and led to the formation of the Public Health Agency of Canada, it also strengthened our Federal/Provincial/Territorial (FPT) senior-level governance and led to agreements for pan-Canadian mutual aid and infectious disease information sharing. As well, our collective public health laboratory capacity has been strengthened through ongoing ...","Immunity to respiratory virus infection is governed by complex biological networks that influence disease progression and pathogenesis. Systems biology provides an opportunity to explore and understand these multifaceted interactions based on integration and modeling of multiple biological parameters. In this review, we describe new and refined systems-based approaches used to model, identify, and validate novel targets within complex networks following influenza and coronavirus infection. In addition, we propose avenues for extension and expansion that can revolutionize our understanding of infectious disease processes. Together, we hope to provide a window into the unique and expansive opportunity presented by systems biology to understand complex disease processes within the context of infectious diseases.","News broke on Feb 27, 2020, that an Italian citizen was Nigeria's first case of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The individual had landed at Lagos airport 2 days earlier on a flight from northern Italy, and had subsequently travelled from Lagos to Ogun State, western Nigeria, where he became ill and was promptly isolated. He is currently being treated for mild symptoms of COVID-19 in a hospital in Lagos. Upon identifying the index case, National Emergency Operations Centres were immediately activated to trace his contacts. By March 9, 2020, 27 suspected cases had been identified across five states (Edo, Lagos, Ogun, Federal Capital Territory, and Kano), of which two were confirmed to be positive (ie, the index case and a contact), with no deaths.1 216 contacts were linked to the index case, 136 of whom are being followed up. Similar to COVID-19, the Ebola epidemic of 2014 was imported through Lagos airport. Within weeks, 19 people were diagnosed with Ebola across two states of Nig...","As of March 5, 2020, there has been sustained local transmission of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Hong Kong, Singapore, and Japan.1 Containment strategies seem to have prevented smaller transmission chains from amplifying into widespread community transmission. The health systems in these locations have generally been able to adapt,2 , 3 but their resilience could be affected if the COVID-19 epidemic continues for many more months and increasing numbers of people require services. We outline some of the core dimensions of these resilient health systems4 and their responses to the COVID-19 epidemic. First, after variable periods of adaptation, the three locations took actions to manage the outbreak of a new pathogen. Surveillance systems were readjusted to identify potential cases while public health staff identified their contacts. National laboratory networks developed diagnostic tests once the COVID-19 genetic sequences were published5 and laboratory testing capacity was inc...","ABSTRACT \u2022 ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY and improved surgical techniques have led to new therapeutic uses for allografts. \u2022 DISEASE TRANSMISSION via allograft tissue transplants has prompted federal intervention in the tissue banking industry and resulted in federal regulations. \u2022 NEW STANDARDS from the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations became effective July 1,2005, and apply to all hospitals that store or implant allograft tissues.

The system, based on earlier efforts in The Netherlands and Portugal, works with the participation of the population in each country to collect real-time information on the distribution of influenza-like illness cases through web surveys administered to volunteers reporting their symptoms (or lack of symptoms) every week during the influenza season. Such a large European-wide web-based monitoring infrastructure is intended to rapidly identify public health emergencies, contribute to understanding global trends, inform data-driven forecast models to assess the impact on the population, optimize the allocation of resources, and help in devising mitigation and co...","Summary Several new viral respiratory tract infectious diseases with epidemic potential that threaten global health security have emerged in the past 15 years. In 2003, WHO issued a worldwide alert for an unknown emerging illness, later named severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). The disease caused by a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV) rapidly spread worldwide, causing more than 8000 cases and 800 deaths in more than 30 countries with a substantial economic impact. Since then, we have witnessed the emergence of several other viral respiratory pathogens including influenza viruses (avian influenza H5N1, H7N9, and H10N8; variant influenza A H3N2 virus), human adenovirus-14, and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). In response, various surveillance systems have been developed to monitor the emergence of respiratory-tract infections. These include systems based on identification of syndromes, web-based systems, systems that gather health data from health facilities (suc...","Abstract The outbreak of the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has caused more than 100,000 people infected and thousands of deaths. Currently, the number of infections and deaths is still increasing rapidly. COVID-19 seriously threatens human health, production, life, social functioning and international relations. In the fight against COVID-19, Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and big data technologies have played an important role in many aspects, including the rapid aggregation of multi-source big data, rapid visualization of epidemic information, spatial tracking of confirmed cases, prediction of regional transmission, spatial segmentation of the epidemic risk and prevention level, balancing and management of the supply and demand of material resources, and social-emotional guidance and panic elimination, which provided solid spatial information support for decision-making, measures formulation, and effectiveness assessment of COVID-19 prevention and control. GIS has d...","Background: Global spread of COVID-19 created an unprecedented infectious disease crisis that progressed to a pandemic with &gt;180,000 cases in &gt;100 countries. Reproductive number (R) is an outbreak metric estimating the transmission of a pathogen. Initial R values were published based on the early outbreak in China with limited number of cases with whole genome sequencing. Initial comparisons failed to show a direct relationship viral genomic diversity and epidemic severity was not established for SARS-Cov-2. Methods: Each country's COVID-19 outbreak status was classified according to epicurve stage (index, takeoff, exponential, decline). Instantaneous R estimates (Wallinga and Teunis method) with a short and standard serial interval examined asymptomatic spread. Whole genome sequences were used to quantify the pathogen genome identity score that were used to estimate transmission time and epicurve stage. Transmission time was estimated based on evolutionary rate of 2 mutations/month. F...","Surveillance is essential for communicable disease prevention and control. Traditional notification of demographic and clinical information, about individuals with selected (notifiable) infectious diseases, allows appropriate public health action and is protected by public health and privacy legislation, but is slow and insensitive. Big data\u2013based electronic surveillance, by commercial bodies and government agencies (for profit or population control), which draws on a plethora of internet- and mobile device\u2013based sources, has been widely accepted, if not universally welcomed. Similar anonymous digital sources also contain syndromic information, which can be analysed, using customised algorithms, to rapidly predict infectious disease outbreaks, but the data are nonspecific and predictions sometimes misleading. However, public health authorities could use these online sources, in combination with de-identified personal health data, to provide more accurate and earlier warning of infectio...","Facing the emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), high-volume respiratory testing is demanded in laboratories worldwide. We evaluated the performance of a molecular assay for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 on a high-throughput platform, the cobas 6800, using the \u2018open channel\u2019 for integration of a laboratory-developed assay. We observed good analytical performance in clinical specimens. The fully automated workflow enables high-throughput testing with minimal hands-on time, while offering fast and reliable results.","Abstract Purpose Syndromic surveillance is aimed at early detection of disease outbreaks. An important data source for syndromic surveillance is free-text chief complaints (CCs), which may be recorded in different languages. For automated syndromic surveillance, CCs must be classified into predefined syndromic categories to facilitate subsequent data aggregation and analysis. Despite the fact that syndromic surveillance is largely an international effort, existing CC classification systems do not provide adequate support for processing CCs recorded in non-English languages. This paper reports a multilingual CC classification effort, focusing on CCs recorded in Chinese. Methods We propose a novel Chinese CC classification system leveraging a Chinese-English translation module and an existing English CC classification approach. A set of 470 Chinese key phrases was extracted from about one million Chinese CC records using statistical methods. Based on the extracted key phrases, the system...","Abstract During the first few months of 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic has reached Europe. Health systems all over the world are trying to control the outbreak in the shortest possible time. Exotic disease outbreaks are not uncommon in animal health and randomised surveillance is frequently used as support for decision-making. This editorial discusses the possibilities of practicing One Health, by using methods from animal health to enhance surveillance for COVID-19 to provide an evidence base fort decision-making in communities and countries.","Abstract The development of rapid, accurate, and sensitive diagnostic methods for detecting pathogens is the basis for treating, controlling, and eradicating infectious diseases of veterinary importance. Scientific and technological advancements have revolutionized the field of veterinary diagnostics. Genome sequencing has allowed efficient, sensitive, and specific diagnostic assays to be developed based on the detection of nucleic acids. The integration of advances in biochemistry, proteomics, engineering, and medicine offers enormous potential for the rapid and accurate diagnosis of viral, microbial, genetic, and metabolic disease. In the future, polymerase chain reaction assays, microarray testing, genomic analysis, and metabolic profiling will be accomplished in a rapid, portable, sensitive, and cost-efficient manner.","Outbreaks of infection can be devastating for individuals and societies. In this review, we examine the applications of new high-throughput sequencing approaches to the identification and characterization of outbreaks, focusing on the application of whole-genome sequencing (WGS) to outbreaks of bacterial infection. We describe traditional epidemiological analysis and show how WGS can be informative at multiple steps in outbreak investigation, as evidenced by many recent studies. We conclude that high-throughput sequencing approaches can make a significant contribution to the investigation of outbreaks of bacterial infection and that the integration of WGS with epidemiological investigation, diagnostic assays and antimicrobial susceptibility testing will precipitate radical changes in clinical microbiology and infectious disease epidemiology in the near future. However, several challenges remain before WGS can be routinely used in outbreak investigation and clinical practice.","Pneumonia patients of 2019-ncov in latent period are not easy to be effectively quarantined, but there is evidence that they have strong infectious ability. Here, the infectious ability of patients during the latent period is slightly less than that of the infected patients was assumed. We established a new SEIR propagation dynamics model, that considered the weak transmission ability of the incubation period, the variation of the incubation period length, and the government intervention measures to track and isolate comprehensively. Based on the raw epidemic data of China from January 23, 2020 to February 10, 2020, the dynamic parameters of the new present SEIR model are fitted. Through the Euler integration algorithm to solve the model, the effect of infectious ability of incubation patients on the theoretical estimation of the present SEIR model was analyzed, and the occurrence time of peak number in China was predicted.","WHO's Eastern Mediterranean region (EMR) is facing emergencies on a scale that is perhaps unprecedented in its history. There is armed conflict in 12 of the region's 22 countries.1 , 2 The region's 680 million people3 represent 9% of the global population, yet the EMR is home to 43% of those who need humanitarian assistance4 and is the source of 64% of the world's refugees.5 The health effects of these crises are immense. Direct health consequences include trauma-related deaths and disability, gender-based violence, and mental disorders. Disruption of health systems contributes to increased morbidity and mortality from infectious diseases, malnutrition, obstetric complications, and non-communicable diseases (NCDs). Health indicators in the EMR are among the worst in the world.6 State fragility and conflict are among the biggest challenges to attainment of Sustainable Development Goal 3.7 Conflict is a global health security threat because affected countries are less able to prevent, de...","The Eyrings rate process theory and free volume concept, two very popular theories in chemistry and physics fields, are employed to treat infectious disease transmissions. The susceptible individ- uals are assumed to move stochastically from one place to another. The virus particle transmission rate is assumed to obey the Eyring rate process theory and also controlled by how much free volume available in a system. The transmission process is considered to be a sequential chemical reaction, and the concentrations or fractions of four epidemiological compartments, the susceptible, the exposed, the infected, and the removed, can be derived and calculated. The obtained equations show that the basic reproduction number, R0, is not a constant, dependent on the volume frac- tion of virus particles, virus particle size, and virus particle packing structure, the energy barrier associated with susceptible individuals, and environment temperature. The developed models are applied to treat coronav...","Summary Background Public health measures to prevent, detect, and respond to events are essential to control public health risks, including infectious disease outbreaks, as highlighted in the International Health Regulations (IHR). In light of the outbreak of 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), we aimed to review existing health security capacities against public health risks and events. Methods We used 18 indicators from the IHR State Party Annual Reporting (SPAR) tool and associated data from national SPAR reports to develop five indices: (1) prevent, (2) detect, (3) respond, (4) enabling function, and (5) operational readiness. We used SPAR 2018 data for all of the indicators and categorised countries into five levels across the indices, in which level 1 indicated the lowest level of national capacity and level 5 the highest. We also analysed data at the regional level (using the six geographical WHO regions). Findings Of 182 countries, 52 (28%) had prevent capacities at leve...","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a novel human respiratory disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Asymptomatic individuals in the context of COVID-19 are those subjects who are carriers of the virus but display no clinical symptoms. Current evidence reveals that this sub-population is a major contributing factor in the propagation of this disease, while escaping detection by public health surveillance systems. In this manuscript, we present a mathematical model taking into account asymptomatic carriers. Our results indicate a basic reproduction number as high as 26.5. The first three weeks of the model exhibit exponential growth, which is in agreement with average case data collected from thirteen countries with universal health care and robust communicable disease surveillance systems; the average rate of growth in the number of reported cases is 25\\% per day during this period. The model was applied to every county in the US to give estimates of mild, severe, and critical case...","Summary Emerging and re-emerging zoonoses are a significant public health concern and cause considerable socioeconomic problems globally. The emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1, avian influenza H7N9, and severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS), and the re-emergence of rabies, brucellosis, and other zoonoses have had a significant effect on the national economy and public health in China, and have affected other countries. Contributing factors that continue to affect emerging and re-emerging zoonoses in China include social and environmental factors and microbial evolution, such as population growth, urbanization, deforestation, livestock production, food safety, climate change, and pathogen mutation. The Chinese government has devised new strategies and has taken measures to deal with the challenges of these diseases, including the issuing of laws and regulations, establishment of disease reporting systems, im...","A new Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Confirmed-Removed (SEICR) model with consideration of intercity travel and active intervention is proposed for predicting the spreading progression of the 2019 New Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19). The model takes into account the known or reported number of infected cases being fewer than the actual number of infected individuals due to insufficient testing. The model integrates intercity travel data to track the movement of exposed and infected individuals among cities, and allows different levels of active intervention to be considered so that realistic prediction of the number of infected individuals can be performed. The data of the COVID-19 infection cases and the intercity travel data for Japan (January 15 to March 20, 2020) and the USA (February 20 to March 20, 2020) are used to illustrate the prediction of the pandemic progression in 47 regions of Japan and 50 states (plus a federal district) in the USA. By fitting the model with the data, we r...","Public disclosure from Chinese local Health Commissions show that male and mid-aged index patients are the major source of virus from outside to the households. This implies that two important actions should be taken in disease control. First considers the kindergarten and school closure time. Local kindergarten and primary schools should postpone their admission and regular operation, to at least not earlier than local secondary schools. Second, workplace hygiene is of particular important in the next phase of disease control. As travel restrictions within China are being gradually lifted, we suggest that workplace hygiene should be taken serious care in the next month or two.","SUMMARY The French public health institute is responsible for promoting and coordinating threats the detection and assessment of health risks, and for suggesting possible responses. Transmissible diseases affecting both human and animal health are the focus of surveillance networks. Early detection of potential infectious threats is based on the screening of \u201c alert signals \u201c identified through routine surveillance networks and other systems. The quality and accuracy of these signals is first verified, before assessing, through a multidisciplinary approach, the risk of introduction and dissemination. This article examines specific cases illustrating the process of detection, risk analysis and response, with respect to infectious threats that are endemic in tropical regions and have the potential to be imported into metropolitan France. For both novel pathogens and exotic diseases \u2014 which, not being endemic in France, are less well known \u2014 the analysis and response process must regularl...","Abstract On the Internet, there is a lot of open access information related to infectious diseases, e.g., official announcement, media news, bulletin boards, blogs, and other social media. If proper data retrieval and screening methods were applied on these Internet-based data, it would be very useful to improve the timeliness of early detection for infectious diseases. In China, we practice early warning using Internet-based data with routine intelligence screening assessment every day, and respond to any unusual event in a timely manner. Through this mechanism, the surveillance and early warning of Internet-based data for infectious disease and public health emergency plays an important supplemental role to the traditional surveillance systems.","The recent Ebola and Zika epidemics demonstrate the need for the continuous surveillance, rapid diagnosis and real-time tracking of emerging infectious diseases. Fast, affordable sequencing of pathogen genomes \u2014 now a staple of the public health microbiology laboratory in well-resourced settings \u2014 can affect each of these areas. Coupling genomic diagnostics and epidemiology to innovative digital disease detection platforms raises the possibility of an open, global, digital pathogen surveillance system. When informed by a One Health approach, in which human, animal and environmental health are considered together, such a genomics-based system has profound potential to improve public health in settings lacking robust laboratory capacity. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The online version of this article (doi:10.1038/nrg.2017.88) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.","Background: COVID-19 outbreak poses an unprecedented challenge for societies, healthcare organizations and economies. In the present analysis we coupled climate data with COVID-19 spread rates worldwide, and in a single country (USA). Methods: Data of confirmed COVID-19 cases was derived from the COVID-19 Global Cases by the CSSE at Johns Hopkins University up to March 19, 2020. We assessed disease spread by two measures: replication rate (RR), the slope of the logarithmic curve of confirmed cases, and the rate of spread (RoS), the slope of the linear regression of the logarithmic curve. Results: Based on predefined criteria, the mean COVID-19 RR was significantly lower in warm climate countries (0.12\u00b1 0.02) compared with cold countries (0.24\u00b1 0.01), (P&lt;0.0001). Similarly, RoS was significantly lower in warm climate countries 0.12\u00b1 0.02 vs. 0.25\u00b1 0.01 than in cold climate countries (P&lt;0.001). In all countries (independent of climate classification) both RR and RoS displayed a moderate ...","Abstract Data on the burden of disease and circulation patterns of influenza B lineages for Brazil are limited. This review aims to describe the pattern of influenza B occurrence in Brazil to have a better understanding of its epidemiology and its relevance when considering seasonal influenza vaccine composition. A review of the data including analysis of international and local surveillance data as well as information from online search of databases using Medical Subject Headings terms in conjunction with screening of abstracts from scientific events was performed. Based on international epidemiologic surveillance data, moderate levels of influenza B disease (19%; 2006\u20132014) were observed. Of these nine years, it was possible to compare data from three years (2007, 2008 and 2013) which have information on the circulating influenza B lineage. Co-circulation of influenza B lineages was observed in all these three influenza seasons, of which, during one season, a high degree of mismatch ...","This study reviewed problems in the prevention of outbreak and spread of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and aimed to provide assistance in establishing policies to prevent and manage future outbreaks of novel infectious diseases of foreign origin via in-depth epidemiological investigation of the patient who initiated the MERS outbreak in Korea, 2015. Personal and phone interviews were conducted with the patient and his guardians, and his activities in Saudi Arabia were investigated with the help of the Saudi Arabian Ministry of Health. Clinical courses and test results were confirmed from the medical records. The patient visited 4 medical facilities and contacted 742 people between May 11, 2015, at symptom onset, and May 20, at admission to the National Medical Center; 28 people were infected and diagnosed with MERS thereafter. Valuable lessons learned included: (1) epidemiological knowledge on the MERS transmission pattern and medical knowledge on its clinical course; (2) imp...","Abstract Timeliness is a critical issue in preventing the spread of emerging/notifiable infectious diseases, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) or avian influenza (bird flu). Current computerized surveillance systems in many countries have demonstrated their usefulness in detecting specified communicable-diseases. However, the off-line, daily or weekly data reporting mode induces a time lag in data collection, transmission, processing, and responses. This paper proposes an on-line real-time mechanism, named EDICTS, for emerging/notifiable infectious diseases control, tracking and surveillance. It is based on the on-line health IC card system and works at the registration process of primary care practices and emergency departments. Hence, should a disease defined by CDC (Center for disease control) be detected at the registration station, EDICTS responds in real time. Note that EDICTS is a mechanism; it is CDC that determines the policy and activates it. A prototype is des...","Abstract Concept of \u201crisk analysis\u201d in food safety management needs to be understood to assess, manage, and communicate risks for proper implementation of food safety policies, food laws, and standards, in a country. Science-based approaches, which are an integral part of risk analysis to improve modern food safety systems, are intimately linked to processes such as good quality practices. Risk analysis strengthens the ability of traditional food safety systems to meet current challenges. Risk analysis is just one part of an effective food safety system. Other components of food safety system like food safety policies, food legislation, food inspection, laboratory analysis, epidemiological surveillance of food-borne diseases, monitoring systems for chemical and microbiological contamination in foods, and information, education and communication, also need to be improved continuously. \u201cFood safety controls\u201d are now being replaced by \u201crisk-based controls\u201d in all stages of food production...","Background: The COVID-19 pandemic caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is straining health systems around the world. Although the Chinese government implemented a number of severe restrictions on people's movement in an attempt to contain its local and international spread, the virus had already reached many areas of the world in part due to its potent transmissibility and the fact that a substantial fraction of infected individuals develop little or no symptoms at all. Following its emergence, the virus started to generate sustained transmission in neighboring countries in Asia, Western Europe, Australia, Canada and the United States, and finally in South America and Africa. As the virus continues its global spread, a clear and evidence-based understanding of properties and dynamics of the global transmission network of SARS-CoV-2 is essential to design and put in place efficient and globally coordinated interventions. Methods: We employ molecular...","Abstract The pandemic of new coronavirus disease COVID-19 is threatening our health, economy and life style. Collaborations across countries and sectors as a One Health World could be a milestone. We propose a general protocol, for setting timely active random surveillance of COVID-19, at the human community level, with systematic repeated detection efforts. Strengths and limitations are discussed. If considered applicable by public health, the protocol could evaluate the status of COVID-19 epidemics consistently and objectively.","Early analysis of outbreaks of novel pathogens to evaluate their likely public health impact depends on fitting predictive models to data gathered and updated in real-time. Both transmission rates and the critical threshold (i.e. the pathogen's 'reproductive number') are inferred by finding the values that provide the best model fit to reported case incidence. These models and inferred results are then the basic tools used for public health planning: how many people expected to be infected, at what scales of time and space, and whether potential intervention strategies impact disease transmission and spread. An underlying assumption, however, is that the ability to observe new cases is either constant, or at least constant relative to diagnostic test availability. We present a demonstration, discussion, and mathematical analysis of how this assumption of predictable observability in disease incidence can drastically impact model accuracy. We also demonstrate how to tailor estimations o...","The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared COVID-19 a global pandemic. Healthcare providers should prepare internal guidelines covering all aspect of the organization in order to have their unit ready as soon as possible. This document addresses the current COVID-19 pandemic for maternal-fetal medicine (MFM) practitioners. The goals the guidelines put forth here are two fold- first to reduce patient risk through healthcare exposure, understanding that asymptomatic health systems/healthcare providers may become the most common vector for transmission, and second to reduce the public health burden of COVID-19 transmission throughout the general population. Box 1 outlines general guidance to prevent spread of COVID-19 and protect our obstetric patients. Section 1 outlines suggested modifications of outpatient obstetrical (prenatal) visits. Section 2 details suggested scheduling of obstetrical ultrasound. Section 3 reviews suggested modification of nonstress tests (NST) and biophysic...","Summary Background Three clusters of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) linked to a tour group from China, a company conference, and a church were identified in Singapore in February, 2020. Methods We gathered epidemiological and clinical data from individuals with confirmed COVID-19, via interviews and inpatient medical records, and we did field investigations to assess interactions and possible modes of transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Open source reports were obtained for overseas cases. We reported the median (IQR) incubation period of SARS-CoV-2. Findings As of Feb 15, 2020, 36 cases of COVID-19 were linked epidemiologically to the first three clusters of circumscribed local transmission in Singapore. 425 close contacts were quarantined. Direct or prolonged close contact was reported among affected individuals, although indirect transmission (eg, via fomites and shared food) could not be excluded. The median incubation period of SARS-C...","During the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic, when SARS-CoV-2 was chiefly reported in the city of Wuhan, cases exported to other locations were largely predicted using flight travel data from Wuhan. However, given Wuhan's connectivity to other cities in mainland China prior to the lockdown, there has likely been a substantial risk of exportation of cases from other Chinese cities. It is likely that many of these exportations remained undetected because early international case definitions for COVID-19 required a recent travel history from Wuhan. Here, we combine estimates of prevalence in 18 Chinese cities with estimates of flight volume, accounting for the effects of travel bans and the timing of Lunar New Year, to approximate the number of cases exported from cities outside of Wuhan from early December 2019 to late February 2020. We predict that for every one case from Wuhan exported internationally, there were approximately 2.9 cases from large Chinese cities exported internation...","Background: In the beginning of January 2020, new unknown virus pneumonia cases started to emerge in local hospitals in Wuhan, China. This virus epidemic quickly became a public health emergency of international concern by the WHO. Enormous amount of medical supplies as well as healthcare personals from other provinces were mobilized to support Wuhan. This current work tent to help people understanding how infectious disease spread and the purpose and consequences of various efforts based on simulation model. Method: a simulation model was created using known parameters. R0 set to 3 and mean incubation time to be 7.5days. the epidemic was divided to 3 periods. Simulation would run 50 times to mimic different patient0 status. Personal activity index was used to mimic different level of control measures. 141427709 simulated patients were created. Cumulation number of patients at the end of period 1 (day50) is 2868.7 \u00b1 1739.0. Total infected patients could be 913396.5 \u00b1 559099.9 by the en...","Summary Rhinovirus, parainfluenza, influenza, adenovirus and respiratory syncytial virus respiratory tract infections are frequent causes of asthmatic exacerbations, especially in children. All these viru3es can induce bronchial inflammation which, by adding to the allergic inflammation specific to asthma, can worsen the obstruction and bronchial hyperreactivity of asthmatic patients. Respiratory viral infections can also amplify the bronchial allergic reaction induced by inhalation of an allergen and facilitate the development of asthma or an atopic state. Some viruses can induce the synthesis of specific IgE and an immunological response favouring the TH2 lymphocyte phenotype, promoting allergy. Asthma and atopy predispose to viral infections of the affected organ, possibly via local allergic inflammation (expression of ICAM1, desquamation of the mucosa, mucostasis, etc.) and/or anti-inflammatory effects of histamine","AbstractA novel coronavirus pneumonia initially identified in Wuhan, China and provisionally named 2019-nCoV has surged in the public. In anticipation of substantial burdens on healthcare system following this human-to-human spread, we aim to scrutinise the currently available information and evaluate the burden of healthcare systems during this outbreak in Wuhan. We applied a modified SIR model to project the actual number of infected cases and the specific burdens on isolation wards and intensive care units, given the scenarios of different diagnosis rates as well as different public health intervention efficacy. Our estimates suggest the actual number of infected cases could be much higher than the reported, with estimated 26,701 cases (as of 28th January 2020) assuming 50% diagnosis rate if no public health interventions were implemented. The estimated burdens on healthcare system could be largely reduced if at least 70% efficacy of public health intervention is achieved."],"title":["How outbreaks of infectious disease are detected: a
