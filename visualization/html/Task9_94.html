Given this pandemic situation, robust risk communication is urgently needed particularly in affected countries. Therefore, this study explored the potential use of Google Trends (GT) to monitor public restlessness toward COVID-19 epidemic infection in Taiwan. Methods We retrieved GT data for the specific locations of Taiwan nationwide and subregions using defined search terms related to coronavirus, handwashing, and face masks. Results Searches related to COVID-19 and face masks in Taiwan increased rapidly, following the announcements of Taiwan\u2019 first imported case and reached its peak as local cases were reported. However, searches for handwashing were gradually increased in period of face masks shortage. Moreover, high to moderate correlations between Google relative search volume (RSV) and COVID-19 cases were found in Taipei (lag-3), New Taipei (lag-2), Taoyuan (lag-2), Tainan (...","This case study is the first to be developed in the Middle East region to document what happened during the response to the 2013 MERS outbreak in Qatar. It provides a description of key epidemiologic events and news released from a prime daily newspaper and main Emergency Risk Communication (ERC) actions that were undertaken by public health authorities. Using the Crisis and Emergency Risk Communication (CERC) theoretical framework, the study analyzes how the performed ERC strategies during the first days of the outbreak might have contributed to the outbreak management. Methods: MERS-CoV related events were chronologically tracked, together with the relevant stories that were published in a major newspaper over the course of three distinct phases of the epidemic. The collected media stories were then assessed against the practiced emergency risk communication (ERC) activities during the same time frame. Results: The Crisis &amp; Emergency Risk Communication (CERC) framework was partially ...","Abstract Concept of \u201crisk analysis\u201d in food safety management needs to be understood to assess, manage, and communicate risks for proper implementation of food safety policies, food laws, and standards, in a country. Science-based approaches, which are an integral part of risk analysis to improve modern food safety systems, are intimately linked to processes such as good quality practices. Risk analysis strengthens the ability of traditional food safety systems to meet current challenges. Risk analysis is just one part of an effective food safety system. Other components of food safety system like food safety policies, food legislation, food inspection, laboratory analysis, epidemiological surveillance of food-borne diseases, monitoring systems for chemical and microbiological contamination in foods, and information, education and communication, also need to be improved continuously. \u201cFood safety controls\u201d are now being replaced by \u201crisk-based controls\u201d in all stages of food production...","In current severe global emergency situation of 2019-nCov outbreak, it is imperative to identify vulnerable and susceptible groups for effective protection and care. Recently, studies found that 2019-nCov and SARS-nCov share the same receptor, ACE2. In this study, we analyzed five large-scale bulk transcriptomic datasets of normal lung tissue and two single-cell transcriptomic datasets to investigate the disparities related to race, age, gender and smoking status in ACE2 gene expression and its distribution among cell types. We didn't find significant disparities in ACE2 gene expression between racial groups (Asian vs Caucasian), age groups (&gt;60 vs &lt;60) or gender groups (male vs female). However, we observed significantly higher ACE2 gene expression in former smoker's lung compared to non-smoker's lung. Also, we found higher ACE2 gene expression in Asian current smokers compared to non-smokers but not in Caucasian current smokers, which may indicate an existence of gene-smoking interac...","RAPID COMMUNICATION 22 March 2020 Estimating excess 1- year mortality from COVID-19 according to underlying conditions and age in England: a rapid analysis using NHS health records in 3.8 million adults Background: The medical, health service, societal and economic impact of the COVID-19 emergency has unknown effects on overall population mortality. Previous models of population mortality are based on death over days among infected people, nearly all of whom (to date at least) have underlying conditions. Models have not incorporated information on high risk conditions or their longer term background (pre-COVID-19) mortality. We estimated the excess number of deaths over 1 year under different COVID-19 incidence rates and differing mortality impacts. Methods: Using population based linked primary and secondary care electronic health records in England (HDR UK - CALIBER), we report the prevalence of underlying conditions defined by UK Public Health England COVID-19 guidelines (16 March 2...","Background Many countries have banned groups and gatherings as part of their response to the pandemic caused by the coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2. Although there are outbreak reports involving mass gatherings, the contribution to overall transmission is unknown. Methods We used data from a survey of social contact behaviour that specifically asked about contact with groups to estimate the Population Attributable Fraction (PAF) due to groups as the relative change in the Basic Reproduction Number when groups are prevented. Findings We estimate that PAF due to groups of 50+ people is 2.2% (95%CI 1.1%, 3.6%); the PAF due to groups of 20+ people is 6.4% (5.0%, 8.0%); the PAF due to groups of 10+ is 11.3% (9.9%, 13.0%) Interpretation Large groups of individuals have a small epidemiological impact; small and medium sized groups between 10 and 50 people have a larger impact on an epidemic.","Abstract The impact of communicable diseases (infectious diseases) on human health is obvious. The sudden outbreak of COVID-19 (Corona Virus Disease 2019), making people realize the threat of communicable diseases to mankind. As a city composed of migrants, Zhuhai Special Economic Zone experienced great challenges brought about by COVID-19 epidemic. Experience has been acquired from all aspects. A highly reactive, multifunctional and efficient emergency management system would be established, and the significance of information communication should be fully understood in the future.","The 2019-nCoV outbreak occurred near the Chinese Spring Festival transport period in Wuhan. As an important transportation center, the migration of Wuhan accelerated the spread of 2019-nCoV across mainland China. Based on the cumulative Baidu migration index (CBMI), we first analyzed the proportion of Wuhan's migrant population to other cities. Our results confirm that there is a significant correlation between the export population of Wuhan and reported cases in various regions. We subsequently found that the mortality rate in Hubei Province was much higher than that in other regions of mainland China, while the investigation of potential cases in Wuhan was far behind other provinces in Mainland China, which indicates the effectiveness of early isolation.","Abstract The emergence of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic presents an unprecedented health communications challenge. Healthcare providers should reinforce behaviors that limit the spread of the pandemic, including social distancing and remaining in the home whenever possible. Formal communications toolkits may not be prepared in a timely fashion. Community pharmacists can reinforce mitigation behaviors by applying the health belief model (HBM). This commentary provides an overview of the HBM and offers suggestions on how community pharmacists can use it as a guide to patient communication in these uncertain contexts.","Abstract Children are seeing rapid changes to their routines and facing an unpredictable future. Palliative care teams may consider expanding their communication training and skillsets to help families consider caring ways to communicate with their children and grandchildren about the coronavirus. Palliative care teams are wise to encourage families to ground their communication with children on key values: honesty and trust, self-compassion, safety, sensitivity, connection, preparedness, community-building, recognition of death as a part of the lifecycle, and legacy.","","BACKGROUND Limited data exist on how SARS-CoV-2 enters and spreads in the general population. METHODS We used two strategies for SARS-CoV-2 testing: targeted testing of high-risk individuals (n=4,551) and a population screening (n=5,502). We sequenced SARS-CoV-2 from 340 individuals. RESULTS On March 22 2020, 528 had tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in the targeted testing (11.6%) and 50 in the population screening (0.9%); approximately 0.2% of the Icelandic population. Large fractions of positives had travelled outside Iceland (38.4% and 34.0%). Fewer under 10 years old were positive than those older: 2.8% vs. 12.3% for targeted testing (P=1.6e-9) and 0.0% vs. 1.0% for population screening (P=0.031). Fewer females were positive in the targeted testing than males (9.5% vs. 14.6%, P=6.8e-9). SARS-CoV-2 came from eight clades, seven A clades and one B clade. The clade composition differed between the testing groups and changed with time. In the early targeted testing, 65.0% of clades were ...","If COVID-19 containment policies fail and social distancing measures cannot be sustained until vaccines becomes available, the next best approach is to use interventions that reduce mortality and prevent excess infections while allowing low-risk individuals to acquire immunity through natural infection until population level immunity is achieved. In such a situation, allowing some infections to occur in lower-risk groups might lead to an overall greater reduction in mortality than trying to protect everyone equally.","","Abstract We present here the proceedings of the 5th seminar on emerging infectious diseases, held in Paris on March 22nd, 2016, with seven priority proposals that can be outlined as follows: encourage research on the prediction, screening and early detection of new risks of infection; develop research and surveillance concerning transmission of pathogens between animals and humans, with their reinforcement in particular in intertropical areas (\u201chot-spots\u201d) via public support; pursue aid development and support in these areas of prevention and training for local health personnel, and foster risk awareness in the population; ensure adapted patient care in order to promote adherence to treatment and to epidemic propagation reduction measures; develop greater awareness and better education among politicians and healthcare providers, in order to ensure more adapted response to new types of crises; modify the logic of governance, drawing from all available modes of communication and incorpor...","AbstractA novel coronavirus (2019-nCov) was identified in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China in December of 2019. This new coronavirus has resulted in thousands of cases of lethal disease in China, with additional patients being identified in a rapidly growing number internationally. 2019-nCov was reported to share the same receptor, Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), with SARS-Cov. Here based on the public database and the state-of-the-art single-cell RNA-Seq technique, we analyzed the ACE2 RNA expression profile in the normal human lungs. The result indicates that the ACE2 virus receptor expression is concentrated in a small population of type II alveolar cells (AT2). Surprisingly, we found that this population of ACE2-expressing AT2 also highly expressed many other genes that positively regulating viral reproduction and transmission. A comparison between eight individual samples demonstrated that the Asian male one has an extremely large number of ACE2-expressing cells in the lung. T...","The recent outbreak of COVID-19 in Mainland China is characterized by a distinctive algebraic, sub-exponential increase of confirmed cases with time during the early phase of the epidemic, contrasting an initial exponential growth expected for an unconstrained outbreak with sufficiently large reproduction rate. Although case counts vary significantly between affected provinces in Mainland China, the scaling law t^\u03bc is surprisingly universal, with a range of exponents \u03bc = 2.1 \u00b1 0.3. The universality of this behavior indicates that, in spite of social, regional, demographical, geographical, and socio-economical heterogeneities of affected Chinese provinces, this outbreak is dominated by fundamental mechanisms that are not captured by standard epidemiological models. We show that the observed scaling law is a direct consequence of containment policies that effectively deplete the susceptible population. To this end we introduce a parsimonious model that captures both, quarantine of sympto...","As the outbreak of a deadly new coronavirus in China and its rapid spread is rattling countries, only the collective international experience and advances derived from past outbreaks can accelerate its control.","A novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) causing severe acute respiratory disease emerged recently in Wuhan, China. Information on reported cases strongly indicates human-to-human spread, and the most recent information is increasingly indicative of sustained human-to-human transmission. While the overall severity profile among cases may change as more mild cases are identified, we estimate a risk of fatality among hospitalised cases at 14% (95% confidence interval: 3.9\u201332%).","Abstract Only a month after the outbreak of pneumonia caused by 2019-nCoV, more than forty-thousand people were infected. This put enormous pressure on the Chinese government, medical healthcare provider, and the general public, but also made the international community deeply nervous. On the 25th day after the outbreak, the Chinese government implemented strict traffic restrictions on the area where the 2019-nCoV had originated\u2014Hubei province, whose capital city is Wuhan. Ten days later, the rate of increase of cases in Hubei showed a significant difference (p = 0.0001) compared with the total rate of increase in other provinces of China. These preliminary data suggest the effectiveness of a traffic restriction policy for this pandemic thus far. At the same time, solid financial support and improved research ability, along with network communication technology, also greatly facilitated the application of epidemic prevention measures. These measures were motivated by the need to provid...","Since the first identified individual of 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) infection on Jan 20, 2020 in South Korea, the number of confirmed cases rapidly increased. As of Feb 26, 2020, 1,261 cases of COVID-19 including 12 deaths were confirmed in South Korea. Using the incidence data of COVID-19, we estimate the reproduction number at 1.5 (95% CI: 1.4-1.6), which indicates sustained transmission and support the implementation of social distancing measures to rapidly control the outbreak.","AbstractTo explore potential intermediate host of a novel coronavirus is vital to rapidly control continuous COVID-19 spread. We found genomic and evolutionary evidences of the occurrence of 2019-nCoV-like coronavirus (named as Pangolin-CoV) from dead Malayan Pangolins. Pangolin-CoV is 91.02% and 90.55% identical at the whole genome level to 2019-nCoV and BatCoV RaTG13, respectively. Pangolin-CoV is the lowest common ancestor of 2019-nCoV and RaTG13. The S1 protein of Pangolin-CoV is much more closely related to 2019-nCoV than RaTG13. Five key amino-acid residues involved in the interaction with human ACE2 are completely consistent between Pangolin-CoV and 2019-nCoV but four amino-acid mutations occur in RaTG13. It indicates Pangolin-CoV has similar pathogenic potential to 2019-nCoV, and would be helpful to trace the origin and probable intermediate host of 2019-nCoV.","AbstractThe coronavirus outbreak took place in December 2019 and continues to spread worldwide. In the absence of an effective vaccine, inhibitor repurposing may seem a fruitful attempt. Here, we compared Mpros from SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV. Despite a high level of sequence similarity, the binding sites of analysed proteins show major differences in both shape and size indicating that repurposing SARS drugs for COVID-19 may be futile. Furthermore, the analysis of the pockets\u2019 conformational changes during the simulation time indicates their flexibility, which dashes hopes for rapid and reliable drug design. Conversely, structural stability of the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro with respect to mutations of the binding cavity and adjacent flexible loops indicates that the protein\u2019s mutability will pose a further challenge to the rational design of small-molecule inhibitors. However, few residues contribute significantly to the protein stability and thus can be considered as key anchoring residues for Mp...","Abstract The Internet of Things (IoT) includes three core procedures: full spectrum perception, reliable transmission, and intelligent processing. It can be applied for the prevention and control of SARI (severe acute respiratory infection). By combining sensors, information technology, artificial intelligence, and available dynamic networking devices, IoT could realize long-distance communication between hospitals, patients, and medical devices, which could ultimately improve current medical conditions.","The Coronavirus (COVID-19) is a world pandemic that has been affecting Portugal since 2 of March 2020. Portuguese government has been making efforts to contradict the exponential growth through social isolation measures. We have developed a mathematical model to predict the impact of such measures in the number of infected cases and peak of infection. We estimate the peak to be around 2 million infected cases by the beginning of May if no additional measures are taken. The model indicates that current measures effectively isolated 25-30% of the population, contributing for some reduction on the infection peak. Importantly, our simulations show that the infection burden can be further reduced with higher isolation degree, providing information for a second intervention.","A novel \u03b2-coronavirus (2019-nCoV) caused severe and even fetal pneumonia explored in a seafood market of Wuhan city, Hubei province, China, and rapidly spread to other provinces of China and other countries. The 2019-nCoV was different from SARS-CoV, but shared the same host receptor the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). The natural host of 2019-nCoV may be the bat Rhinolophus affinis as 2019-nCoV showed 96.2% of whole-genome identity to BatCoV RaTG13. The person-to-person transmission routes of 2019-nCoV included direct transmission, such as cough, sneeze, droplet inhalation transmission, and contact transmission, such as the contact with oral, nasal, and eye mucous membranes. 2019-nCoV can also be transmitted through the saliva, and the fetal\u2013oral routes may also be a potential person-to-person transmission route. The participants in dental practice expose to tremendous risk of 2019-nCoV infection due to the face-to-face communication and the exposure to saliva, blood, an...","Abstract: We propose that the palliative care team response will occur in two waves: first communication and second symptom management. Our experience with discussing goals of care with the family of a COVID positive patient highlighted some expected and unexpected challenges. We describe these challenges along with recommendations for approaching these conversations. We also propose a framework for proactively mobilizing the palliative care workforce to aggressively address goals of care in all patients, with the aim of reducing the need for rationing of resources.","From 29 to 31 January 2020, a total of 565 Japanese citizens were evacuated from Wuhan, China on three chartered flights. All passengers were screened upon arrival in Japan for symptoms consistent with novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection and tested for presence of the virus. Assuming that the mean detection window of the virus can be informed by the mean serial interval (estimated at 7.5 days), the ascertainment rate of infection was estimated at 9.2% (95% confidence interval: 5.0, 20.0). This indicates that the incidence of infection in Wuhan can be estimated at 20,767 infected individuals, including those with asymptomatic and mildly symptomatic infections. The infection fatality risk (IFR)\u2014the actual risk of death among all infected individuals\u2014is therefore 0.3% to 0.6%, which may be comparable to Asian influenza pandemic of 1957\u20131958.","A novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) was first identified in Wuhan, Hubei Province, and then spreads to the other Provinces of China. WHO decides to determine a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) of 2019-nCoV. 2019-nCov was reported to share the same receptor, Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), with SARS-Cov. Here based on the public single-cell RNA-Seq datasets, we analyzed the ACE2 RNA expression profile in the tissues at different locations of the respiratory tract. The result indicates that the ACE2 expression appears in nasal epithelial cells. We found that the size of this population of ACE2-expressing nasal epithelial cells is comparable with the size of the population of ACE2-expression type II alveolar cells (AT2) in the Asian sample reported by Yu Zhao et al. We further detected 2019-nCoV by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from the nasal-swab and throat-swab of seven suspected cases. We found that 2019-nCoV tends to have a higher concentration in the nas...","Abstract In this note we analyze the temporal dynamics of the coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak in China, Italy and France in the time window 22 / 01 \u2212 15 / 03 / 2020 . A first analysis of simple day-lag maps points to some universality in the epidemic spreading, suggesting that simple mean-field models can be meaningfully used to gather a quantitative picture of the epidemic spreading, and notably the height and time of the peak of confirmed infected individuals. The analysis of the same data within a simple susceptible-infected-recovered-deaths model indicates that the kinetic parameter that describes the rate of recovery seems to be the same, irrespective of the country, while the infection and death rates appear to be more variable. The model places the peak in Italy around March 21st 2020, with a peak number of infected individuals of about 26000 (not including recovered and dead) and a number of deaths at the end of the epidemics of about 18,000. Since the confirmed cases are bel...","Abstract To overcome the limitations of the state-of-the-art influenza surveillance systems in Europe, we established in 2008 a European-wide consortium aimed at introducing an innovative information and communication technology approach for a web-based surveillance system across different European countries, called Influenzanet. The system, based on earlier efforts in The Netherlands and Portugal, works with the participation of the population in each country to collect real-time information on the distribution of influenza-like illness cases through web surveys administered to volunteers reporting their symptoms (or lack of symptoms) every week during the influenza season. Such a large European-wide web-based monitoring infrastructure is intended to rapidly identify public health emergencies, contribute to understanding global trends, inform data-driven forecast models to assess the impact on the population, optimize the allocation of resources, and help in devising mitigation and co...","Summary The Middle East Respiratory Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) was first isolated from a patient who died with severe pneumonia in June 2012. As of 19 June 2015, a total of 1,338 MERS-CoV infections have been notified to the World Health Organization (WHO). Clinical illness associated with MERS-CoV ranges from mild upper respiratory symptoms to rapidly progressive pneumonia and multi-organ failure. A significant proportion of patients present with non-respiratory symptoms such as headache, myalgia, vomiting and diarrhoea. A few potential therapeutic agents have been identified but none have been conclusively shown to be clinically effective. Human to human transmission is well documented, but the epidemic potential of MERS-CoV remains limited at present. Healthcare-associated clusters of MERS-CoV have been responsible for the majority of reported cases. The largest outbreaks have been driven by delayed diagnosis, overcrowding and poor infection control practices. However, chains of MERS-Co...","Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov-2) quickly became a major epidemic threat in the whole China. We analysed SARS-Cov-2 infected cases from Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, and noted divergent characteristics of these Tibetans infected cases compared to Han Chinese, characterizing by a considerable proportion of asymptomatic carriers (21.7%), and few symptomatic patients with initial symptom of fever (7.7%). Here, we did a descriptive study on clinical characteristics of 18 asymptomatic individuals with SARS-CoV-2 infection. The median age of these asymptomatic carriers was 31 years and one third of them were students, aged under 20 years. Notably, some of asymptomatic carriers had recognizable changes in radiological and laboratory indexes. Our finding indicates a potentially big number of SARS-CoV-2 asymptomatic carriers in prevalent area, highlighting a necessity of screening individuals with close contact of infected patients, for a better control on the spread...","In early December 2019 a cluster of cases of pneumonia of unknown cause was identified in Wuhan, a city of 11 million persons in the People&amp;rsquo;s Republic of China. Further investigation revealed these cases to result from infection with a newly identified coronavirus, termed the 2019-nCoV. The infection moved rapidly through China, spread to Thailand and Japan, extended into adjacent countries through infected persons travelling by air, eventually reaching multiple countries and continents. Similar to such other coronaviruses as those causing the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), the new coronavirus was reported to spread via natural aerosols from human-to-human. In the early stages of this epidemic the case fatality rate is estimated to be approximately 2%, with the majority of deaths occurring in special populations. Unfortunately, there is limited experience with coronavirus infections during pregnancy, and it now appears certai...","Background: Community responses are important for outbreak management during the early phase when non-pharmaceutical interventions are the major preventive options. Therefore, this study aims to examine the psychological and behavioral responses of the community during the early phase of the COVID-19 epidemic in Hong Kong. Method: A cross-sectional online survey was launched within 36 hours after confirmed COVID-19 cases were first reported. Councilors of all 452 district council constituency areas were approached for survey dissemination. Respondent demographics, anxiety level, risk perception, sources to retrieve COVID-19 information, actual adoption and perceived efficacy of precautionary measures were collected. Result: Analysis from 1715 complete responses indicated high perceived susceptibility (89%) and high perceived severity (97%). Most respondents were worried about COVID-19 (97%), and had their daily routines disrupted (slightly/greatly: 98%). The anxiety level, measured by ...","Background Reporting delays in disease surveillance impair the ability to assess the current dynamic of an epidemic. In continuously updated epidemic curves, case numbers for the most recent epidemic week or day usually appear to be lower than the previous, suggesting a decline of the epidemic. In reality, the epidemic curve may still be on the rise, because reporting delay prevents the most recent cases to appear in the case count. In context of the COVID-19 epidemic and for countries planning large international gatherings, such as the Summer Olympic Games in Japan 2020, the ability to assess the actual stage of an epidemic is of outmost importance. Methods We applied now-casting onto COVID-19 data provided by the nCoV-2019 Data Working Group to evaluate the .true count of cases, by taking into account reporting delays occurring between date of symptom onset and date of confirmation. Findings We calculated a decrease of reporting delay, from a median delay of ten days in calendar wee...","Assuming that no human had any previously acquired immunoprotection against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) during the 2003 SARS outbreak, the biological bases for possible difference in individual susceptibility are intriguing. However, this issue has never been fully elucidated. Based on the premise that SARS patients belonging to a given genotype group having a significantly higher SARS infection rate than others would imply that genotype group being more susceptible, we make use of a compartmental model describing disease transmission dynamics and clinical and gene data of 100 laboratory confirmed SARS patients from Chinese Han population in Taiwan to estimate the infection rates of distinct candidate genotype groups among these SARS-infected individuals. The results show that CXCL10(\u2212938AA) is always protective whenever it appears, but appears rarely and only jointly with either Fgl2(+158T/*) or HO-1(\u2212497A/*), while (Fgl2)(+158T/*) is associated with highe...","We explore here how variation in the SARS-CoV-2 virus tropism could influence epidemic spread. We use a compartmental model fit to the existing data. The model indicates that Wuhan quarantine measures were effective but that alternative virus forms (gut tropism) and a second propagation route (through environment) was present. For Singapore and Shenzhen region the secondary route does not seem to be active yet. Adequate prevention measures taking into account both routes should be implemented.","AbstractSince December 2019, the outbreak of a new coronavirus, named 2019-nCoV, has greatly threatened the public health in China and raised great concerns worldwide. No specific treatment for this infection is currently available. We previously reported that teicoplanin, a glycopeptide antibiotic which has routinely been used in the clinic to treat bacterial infection with low toxicity, significantly inhibits the invasion of cells by Ebola virus, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, via specifically inhibiting the activity of cathepsin L. Here, we tested the efficacy of teicoplanin against 2019-nCoV virus infection and found that teicoplanin potently prevents the entrance of 2019-nCoV-Spike-pseudoviruses into the cytoplasm, with an IC50 of 1.66 \u03bcM. Although the inhibitory effect upon the replication of wildtype viruses ex vivo and in vivo remains to be determined, our preliminary result indicates that the potential antiviral activity of teicoplanin could be applied for the treatment of 2019-nCoV v...","In the current COVID-19 pandemic, a significant proportion of cases shed SARS-Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) with their faeces. To determine if SARS-CoV-2 is present in sewage during the emergence of COVID-19 in the Netherlands, sewage samples of 7 cities and the airport were tested using RT-PCR against three fragments of the nucleocapsid protein gene (N1-3) and one fragment of the envelope protein gene (E). No SARS-CoV-2 was detected in samples of February 6, three weeks before the first case was reported in the Netherlands on February 27. On March 5, the N1 fragment was detected in sewage of five sites. On March 15/16, the N1 fragment was detected in sewage of six sites, and the N3 and E fragment were detected at 5 and 4 sites respectively. This is the first report of detection of SARS-CoV-2 in sewage. The detection of the virus in sewage, even when the COVID-19 incidence is low, indicates that sewage surveillance could be a sensitive tool to monitor the circulation of the virus in the p...","The novel coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19)epidemic has brought serious social psychological impact to the Chinese people, especially those quarantined and thus with limited access to face-to-face communication and traditional social psychological interventions. To better deal with the urgent psychological problems of people involved in the COVID-19 epidemic, we developed a new psychological crisis intervention model by utilizing internet technology. This new model, one of West China Hospital, integrates physicians, psychiatrists, psychologists and social workers into Internet platforms to carry out psychological intervention to patients, their families and medical staff. We hope this model will make a sound basis for developing a more comprehensive psychological crisis intervention response system that is applicable for urgent social and psychological problems.","The outbreak of COVID-19 originated in Wuhan has become a global epidemic of contagious diseases, which poses a serious threat to human life and health, especially for those with underlined diseases. However, Impacts of COVID-19 epidemic on HD center and HD patients are still unknown. In this report, we reviewed the whole course of the epidemic emerged in the HD center of Renmin Hospital, Wuhan University from January 14, 2020, the day the first case was confirmed, to February 17, 2020, the day the epidemic extinction. There are totally 37 cases among 230 HD patients and 4 cases among 33 staff being diagnosed with COVID-19. The epidemiology, clinical presentation and immune profile of dialysis patients contracted COVID-19 were further studied. We found that the two key measures we took in response to the epidemic, one was upgrading level of prevention and protection on January 21 and the other one starting universal screening, isolating, and distributing the infected cases on February ...","Abstract Porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) is a newly discovered enterotropic swine coronavirus that causes enteritis and diarrhea in piglets. Like other coronaviruses, PDCoV commonly contains 4 major structural proteins: spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N) proteins. Among these, the N protein is known to be the most abundant and multifunctional viral component. Therefore, as the first step toward understanding the biology of PDCoV, the present study investigated functional characteristics and expression dynamics of host proteins in a stable porcine cell line constitutively expressing the PDCoV N protein. Similar to N proteins of other coronaviruses, the PDCoV N protein was found to interact with itself to form non-covalently linked oligomers and was mainly localized to the nucleolus. We then assessed alterations in production levels of proteins in the N-expressing PK (PK-PDCoV-N) cells at different time points by means of proteomic analysis. According to the res...","AbstractSARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV share a common human receptor ACE2. Protein-protein interaction structure modeling indicates that spike-RBD of the two viruses also has similar overall binding conformation and binding free energy to ACE2. In vitro assays using recombinant ACE2 proteins and ACE2 expressing cells confirmed the two coronaviruses\u2019 similar binding affinities to ACE2. The above studies provide experimental supporting evidences and possible explanation for the high transmissibility observed in the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak. Potent ACE2-blocking SARS-CoV neutralizing antibodies showed limited cross-binding and neutralizing activities to SARS-CoV-2. ACE2-non-blocking SARS-CoV RBD antibodies, though with weaker neutralizing activities against SARS-CoV, showed positive cross-neutralizing activities to SARS-CoV-2 with an unknown mechanism. These findings suggest a trade-off between the efficacy and spectrum for therapeutic antibodies to different coronaviruses, and hence highlight the po...","Abstract Since the COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan City in December of 2019, numerous model predictions on the COVID-19 epidemics in Wuhan and other parts of China have been reported. These model predictions have shown a wide range of variations. In our study, we demonstrate that nonidentifiability in model calibrations using the confirmed-case data is the main reason for such wide variations. Using the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) for model selection, we show that an SIR model performs much better than an SEIR model in representing the information contained in the confirmed-case data. This indicates that predictions using more complex models may not be more reliable compared to using a simpler model. We present our model predictions for the COVID-19 epidemic in Wuhan after the lockdown and quarantine of the city on January 23, 2020. We also report our results of modeling the impacts of the strict quarantine measures undertaken in the city after February 7 on the time course of the ep...","Strict interventions were successful to control the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak in China. As transmission intensifies in other countries, the interplay between age, contact patterns, social distancing, susceptibility to infection and disease, and COVID-19 dynamics remains unclear. To answer these questions, we analyze contact surveys data for Wuhan and Shanghai before and during the outbreak and contact tracing information from Hunan Province. Daily contacts were reduced 7-9 fold during the COVID-19 social distancing period, with most interactions restricted to the household. Children 0-14 years were 59% (95% CI 7-82%) less susceptible than individuals 65 years and over. A transmission model calibrated against these data indicates that social distancing alone, as implemented in China during the outbreak, is sufficient to control COVID-19. While proactive school closures cannot interrupt transmission on their own, they reduce peak incidence by half and delay the epidemic. Thes...","Abstract The aim is to diagnose COVID-19 earlier and to improve its treatment by applying medical technology, the \u201cCOVID-19 Intelligent Diagnosis and Treatment Assistant Program (nCapp)\u201d based on the Internet of Things. Terminal eight functions can be implemented in real-time online communication with the \u201ccloud\u201d through the page selection key. According to existing data, questionnaires, and check results, the diagnosis is automatically generated as confirmed, suspected, or suspicious of 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection. It classifies patients into mild, moderate, severe or critical pneumonia. nCapp can also establish an online COVID-19 real-time update database, and it updates the model of diagnosis in real time based on the latest real-world case data to improve diagnostic accuracy. Additionally, nCapp can guide treatment. Front-line physicians, experts, and managers are linked to perform consultation and prevention. nCapp also contributes to the long-term follow-up of pa...","Beijing has been severely affected by SARS, and SARS-associated coronavirus has been confirmed as its cause. However, clinical and experimental evidence implicates the possibility of co-infection. In this report, reovirus was isolated from throat swabs of SARS patients, including the first case in Beijing and her mother. Identification with the electron microscopy revealed the characteristic features of reovirus. 24 of 38 samples from other SARS cases were found to have serologic responses to the reovirus. Primers designed for reovirus have amplified several fragments of DNA, one of which was sequenced (S2 gene fragment), which indicates it as a unique reovirus (orthoreovirus). Preliminary animal experiment showed that inoculation of the reovirus in mice caused death with atypical pneumonia. Nevertheless, the association of reovirus with SARS outbreak requires to be further investigated.","The spread of a novel pathogenic infectious agent eliciting protective immunity is typically characterised by three distinct phases: (I) an initial phase of slow accumulation of new infections (often undetectable), (II) a second phase of rapid growth in cases of infection, disease and death, and (III) an eventual slow down of transmission due to the depletion of susceptible individuals, typically leading to the termination of the (first) epidemic wave. Before the implementation of control measures (e.g. social distancing, travel bans, etc) and under the assumption that infection elicits protective immunity, epidemiological theory indicates that the ongoing epidemic of SARS-CoV-2 will conform to this pattern. Here, we calibrate a susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) model to data on cumulative reported SARS-CoV-2 associated deaths from the United Kingdom (UK) and Italy under the assumption that such deaths are well reported events that occur only in a vulnerable fraction of the populati...","The need for accurate statistics has never been felt so deeply as the novel COVID-19 pathogen spreads around the world and quantifying its severity is a primary clinical and public health issue. In Italy, the magnitude and increasing trend of the case-fatality risk (CFR) is fueling the already high levels of public alarm. In this paper, we highlight that the widely used crude CFR is an inaccurate measure of the disease severity since the pandemic is still unfolding. With the goal to improve its comparability over time and across countries at this stage, we then propose a demographic adjustment of the CFR that addresses the bias arising from differential case ascertainment by age. When applied to publicly released data for Italy, we show that until March 16 our adjusted CFR was similar to that of Wuhan, the most affected Chinese region, where COVID-19 has now been contained. This indicates that our adjusted CFR improves its comparability over time, making an important tool to chart the ..."],"title":["Applications of google search trends for risk communication in infectious disease management: A case study of COVID-19 outbreak in Taiwan","How Do the First Days Count?

Risk communication messages that are not comprehended by the public at risk, or communication of conflicting risk messages will result in lack of precautionary actions. Communications that are perceived as coming from a non-trustworthy source may have the same results. However, risk communication messages are sometimes very quickly adopted by the media, possibly leading to an \u2018amplification\u2019 of risk information that may lead to unnecessary mass scares and unnecessary or ineffective precautionary actions.","SARS galvanized the international community to finally conclude drafting of the revised IHR. The IHR bind WHO member countries to not only notify all events that may constitute a public health emergency, but also to respond to requests for verification of information. WHO has also produced outbreak communication guidelines to aid in the dissemination of information to the public, recognizing that 'expertise [in communications] has become as essential to outbreak control as epidemiological training and laboratory analysis'. 2 The boundaries between risk communication and management are not, however, sharply delineated, as illustrated by the controversy surrounding H5N1 influenza virus sharing. Indonesia is one of the countries hardest hit by outbreaks of H5N1. Virus sharing with the international community is the mechanism by which, first, viruses developing pandemic potential can be tracked (risk communication), and second, vaccines can be developed to meet global need (risk management). Indonesia refused to virus share, not because it was opposed to the sharing of technical information to better understand the threat posed by H5N1 avian influenza, but because it felt excluded from equitable access to the resulting vaccine, meaning that its management of a subsequent pandemic would be constrained. 3 It could be argued that Indonesian authorities currently view virus sharing as an important element in risk management and thus a sovereign issue, although the international community, by contrast, views virus sharing as a critical element of risk communication and, by extension, a global risk management issue. Differing interpretations of international treaties are possible and resolution is proving challenging. 4 Ultimately, the debate is centred on the boundary between the governance of risk communication and risk management, the former now being mandated through international laws, with the latter remaining, to a large degree, a national sovereignty responsibility.","The development of this case study is grounded on the Crisis and Emergency Risk Communication (CERC) framework, which was created by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) as a theoretical framework for research and practice [3,12]. Such framework describes how health communication functions within the context of risks and crisis. As the name reflects, CERC seeks to merge the traditions and best practices of risk communication into crisis communication. It positions communication centrally throughout the risk and crisis communication process, and it emphasizes the role of communication, primarily as a management tool from centralized authorities to the public through mass media channels. In this case report, we focus on the role of ERC as a crisis management tool during the MERS outbreak in Qatar by describing the delivery of information by central public health authorities and its reporting through a major media channel.","Risk Assessment is central scientific component of risk analysis (preferably performed by Veterinary Public Health) but risk management, defines the problem, articulates the goals of the risk analysis, and identifies the questions to be answered by the risk assessment (preferably performed by Public Health). Science-based tasks of measuring and describing nature of risk being analyzed (i.e., risk characterization) are performed during risk assessment. Risk management and risk assessment are performed within an open and transparent environment based on communication and dialog. Risk communication encompasses an interactive exchange of information and opinions among risk managers, risk assessors, the risk analysis team, consumers, and other stakeholders. Process often culminates with implementation and continuous monitoring of a course of action by risk managers (FAO/WHO-Provisional Edition, 2005) .","Risk communication is interactive exchange of information and opinions throughout risk analysis process concerning risk, risk-related factors and risk perceptions, among risk assessors, risk managers, consumers, industry, the academic community and other interested parties, including explanation of risk assessment findings and basis of risk management decisions. Risk communication should:","Effective management of new epidemic infectious disease risks in the phase that no treatment or vaccination is yet possible is largely dependent on precautionary behaviour of the population. Implementation of precautionary behaviour is largely dependent on effective risk communication, i.e. communication that induces realistic risk perceptions, correct knowledge and skills to promote and enable precautionary practices. Scientific knowledge about these topics in the area of infectious disease control is scarce. Neither is there knowledge if the theories and measures developed for risk perception research on, for example chronic diseases, can be applied in the area of infectious diseases. However, such knowledge is vital for effective control of newly emerging infectious diseases, because our ability to promote health protective behavioural change depends on our knowledge of important determinants of such behaviour [15]. For people to voluntarily engage in precautionary actions, they first of all need to be aware of the risk. Risk perception is a central feature in many health behaviour theories. According to the Protection Motivation Theory, for example [16], protection motivation is the result of the threat appraisal and coping appraisal. Threat appraisal consists of estimates of the chance of contracting a disease (perceived vulnerability or susceptibility) and estimates of seriousness of a disease (perceived severity).","There are many concepts of communication in relation to risk associated with outbreaks. As these are relatively new concepts, this article will consider approaches relating to highlighting public health threats and supporting operational management, addressing these as the communication of risk and subsequent risk management. Strategic considerations are critical to both, although information, messengers, communication tools and audiences may differ. The communication of risk refers to the process by which information regarding outbreaks is identified and shared with the purpose of increasing awareness amongst key stakeholders of the threat. Key stakeholders for public health threats include WHO, national governments and the public. Risk management, by contrast, refers to the management processes associated with response to the outbreak, for which communication is crucial at each stage. Three examples are used to explore the challenges and demands of communicating effectively and coherently given this changing landscape. This brief paper will attempt to show the progress made, draw lessons to be learned and outline the ways forward.","The incidence of KD is therefore greatest in north-east Asians, especially in Koreans and Japanese. It is estimated that 1-2% of all hospitalised Korean children have KD (Park YW, personal communication) and that KD affects one in 150 Japanese children. 3 This indicates genetic factors may be central in determining susceptibility, especially as the incidence rate remains high in those migrating to lower incidence countries. For example, the incidence of KD in Japanese Americans in Hawaii (135/100,000 &lt;5 years) is identical to the highest rates reported from Japanese living in Japan. 67 The incidence rate in siblings of affected children is 10-15 fold higher than the population incidence in Japan. 70 The ratio of sibling to population incidence is termed the 'heritability' or 'l s '. Sibling rates outside Japan are unknown, but reports from Caucasians support this trend 71 and sibling rates in Korea 37 (Burgner, unpublished observations) also support this high heritability. This figure is slightly less than the heritability for insulin-dependent diabetes (l s 15) and 4 times higher than that of asthma, 72 suggesting a striking genetic predisposition to develop the disease in a minority of children across different ethnic groups. In addition, the incidence of previous KD in parents of Japanese children with KD is significantly increased and these families are much more likely to have other affected children and children with recurrent disease. 73 Taken together, these epidemiological data provide convincing evidence for a major role for host genetics in KD susceptibility.","Drawing on the social amplification of risk model [31], public risk perception is shaped by a process of interplays between psychological, cultural, social, and institutional factors that may result in amplifying or attenuating the public attention to risk. Mass communication is among the list of factors. Public health officials have long recognised the role of the mass media in disseminating risk and emergency information before, during, and after a catastrophe [32]. The World Health Organization establishes guidelines for \u201ceffective media communication\u201d, through which the authorities are able to disseminate information to the public [33]. Communication during crisis was traditionally understood to be a one-way and top-down process, in which the public are assumed to be \u201cdeficient\u201d in knowledge, while the scientists, public health experts, and emergency managers, are \u201csufficient\u201d [34]. But this presumption was profoundly challenged by the emergence of social media. For instance, Leung and Nicoll argued that the 2009 H1N1 pandemic was the first pandemic in which social media \u201cchallenged conventional public health communication\u201d [35]. In China, online messages were published ahead of the official statement in the 2008 Sichuan Earthquake [36]. Social media enabled people under crisis to share information and experience and to seek message credibility and confirmation via multiple media platforms and social networks [34]. Our study demonstrated that official data released by health authorities, whether in Beijing or Geneva, received strong reactions in the Chinese online community. With such knowledge, social media should be incorporated in the best practices for risk and crisis communication [37]. Social media data can also provide health authorities, researchers and the media a quantifiable measure of public attention towards a particular disease outbreak [11].","Risk analysis should include clear, interactive, and documented communication, among risk assessors and risk managers. In fact risk communication should be more than dissemination of information. Its major function should be to insure that all information and opinion required for effective risk management is incorporated into decision-making process.","Identifying those at high-risk will aid the public health response in controlling the spread of disease. Given the ubiquity of comorbidities in the elderly population, and their increased susceptibility to severe COVID-19 infection (18), knowledge on the differing prevalence and risk of various conditions may help to focus and tailor public health efforts such as the screening of asymptomatic individuals, risk communication, contact tracing, self-isolation and social distancing. For instance, for COPD, which is less common in the general population and very strongly associated with ICU admission, a more targeted and intensive health protection strategy may be warranted, compared to other conditions (such as hypertension) that are more difficult to target due to their higher prevalence in the general population.","Therefore, governments across the world should revisit their emergency plan for controlling infectious disease outbreaks in the local context. Timely public health measures should be taken to control the outbreak within the city or the province/state where the city is located. Meanwhile, the supply of and demand for facemasks and other medical resources should be considered when planning for public health measures, so as to maintain the availability and affordability of medical resources. Besides, timely and effective communication with the public is essential to mitigate panic buying and anxiety in the population 27,28 . Furthermore, during a medical resource crisis, health disparity could be widened between specific population groups. Individuals of lower socioeconomic status are more likely to find themselves in a dilemma between the need to work in high-risk locations and the lack of protective equipment. In addition, market forces can drive the price up, preventing them from purchasing an adequate amount of protective equipment.","Risk communication: the interactive exchange of information and opinions throughout the risk analysis process concerning risk, risk-related factors, and risk perceptions, among risk assessors, risk managers, consumers, industry, the academic community and other interested parties, including the explanation of risk assessment findings and the basis of risk management decisions.","In the changing landscape outlined, there are clearly many challenges for effective risk communication and risk management. In terms of the communication of risk, this article has focused on progress on the international stage. It is recognized that challenges still remain at national level, but the diversity of these is beyond the scope of this brief paper.","The importance of timely, accurate and context-specific risk communication during public health emergencies is increasingly being recognized, particularly with rapid changes in how people consume media. The WHO has produced useful guidance on communicating risk in such situations, which draws on experiences from previous PHEIC [37] . Good risk communication allows people to know from trusted sources in real-time the risks they may face, and any protective measures they can take to help minimise this.","As we look to the future of epidemic prevention and control, we believe that telemedicine systems have the potential to play a role in addressing emergencies and large-scale outbreaks in high uncertainty settings. As telemedicine has inevitably altered the traditional working relationships within the healthcare network, how to ensure high-quality communication among healthcare practitioners poses a significant challenge. As such, frequent, timely, accurate, and problem-solving focused communication among clinical staffs from hospitals at different levels in the healthcare system is essential to minimize the risk incurred in handling patients with possible COVID-19 infection 3 . However, we have found that high quality of communication is not always maintained during the telemedicine coordination. Therefore, a learning telemedicine system platform for coronavirus care was developed across connected hospitals, serving as the overarching authoritative source for diagnostic decision making and knowledge sharing for treatment. The platform could aggregate COVID-19 patient records across 126 connected hospitals and rapidly expand to enable open collaborations with key stakeholders such as government authorities, research institutions and laboratories. The lessons learned from this crisis can provide insights to guide public health institutions as they implement telemedicine to increase resilience to future epidemic outbreaks.","Implicit to better risk communication is a belief that better risk management will automatically follow. Surveillance is, after all, 'information for action'. Communication, co-operation and coordination are necessary at an international level. However, they are also, as the illustration below highlights, necessary at national and subnational levels.","Appropriate risk communication could help prevent infodemics (World Health Organization, 2020b) or an excessive amount of information circulating in affected populations which might induce public restlessness or panic. In response to the ongoing outbreak, our results demonstrated that GT could potentially define the proper timing and location for risk communication.","As per CAC (2013), risk analysis is a process which follows a structured approach comprising three distinct but closely linked components, namely, risk assessment, risk management, and risk communication, each component being integral to overall risk analysis and playing an essential and complementary role in risk analysis process. The overall objective of risk analysis applied to food safety is to insure human health protection and it should be based on all available scientific evidence, information on perceptions, costs, environmental, cultural factors, etc., which is gathered and analyzed according to scientific principles.","Countries at the highest risk of importation, based on current epidemic situation in China, had moderate to high capacity scores. These may however correspond to different contributions to the mean SPAR indicators, reflecting different aspects of a country's functional capacity. For example, South Africa had the maximum score for the laboratory capacity (100), but a low score in risk communication (20). Conversely, Nigeria had a fairly low score in the laboratory capacity (27) and the maximum score in the IHR coordination capacity (100). Conversely, countries with the lowest SPAR capacity score had moderate (Kenya, Tanzania, Ghana) to low introduction risk. The evaluation of additional factors (demographic, socio-economic, political) included in the IDVI that may influence the overall potential impact of an unfolding epidemic identifies several countries that had a significant importation risk with a low to medium IDVI, such as Nigeria, Ethiopia, Egypt and Algeria. The risk of importation from other points of entry, such as for example sea ports was not evaluated here.","Countries at the highest risk of importation, based on the current epidemic situation in China, had moderate to high capacity scores; however, these scores might correspond to different contributions to the mean SPAR indicators, reflecting different aspects of a country's functional capacity.

Risk communications to establish trust in authorities has been less successful in Japan and Hong Kong.","Safety climate is being increasingly recognized as one of the most important determinants of safe work practice in terms of preventing exposures to BBF but has been little studied in other types of nosocomial transmitted diseases. Respiratory tract diseases, in particular, have not been well studied in this regard, presumably because most HCWs do not develop severe or specific symptoms when infected (such as for most respiratory tract viruses) or because most HCWs are already immune to potential pathogens, either through vaccination (for influenza or measles) or through natural immunity (varicella). Other diseases, such as tuberculosis, are thought to be easily controlled through the use of specific environmental controls and PPE. 61 Improving the safety climate and creating a workplace culture in which workers and their health are valued has the added potential benefit of improving HCW outcomes for many different diseases and injuries, including emerging diseases of which preexisting immunity is not present. This has particular relevance to HCWs, who will likely be placed at great risk of acquiring novel strains of influenza during a pandemic. Clearly, HCWs do need to be trained in infection control procedures to apply them, but the available evidence indicates that knowledge deficit is not a major barrier to compliance. This suggests that a focus on training content or methods to increase knowledge may not yield much change in compliance. Feedback to workers on their adherence to precautions has been identified as an important factor in facilitating compliance with infection control practices. Unfortunately, most studies that have found positive effects on compliance levels through formal education sessions have found improvements to be short lived. The optimal type, timing, and frequency of feedback that is most effective in achieving compliance are not known. Most of the reviewed studies were observational in nature, whereas many of the research questions could be investigated using intervention-based study designs. It is particularly noteworthy that the communication strategies used by health care institutions to improve worker safety have not been researched at all.","The added value of this now-casting approach increases with the length of the reporting delaythe larger the delays the more important is the adjustment. As illustrated per 95% prediction intervals in figure 3 , uncertainty of now-casts is obviously highest for the days are closest to the actual day of the now-cast itself. We used publicly available data for our analysis, which tends to be less complete than the data available to national surveillance agencies. This slightly limits the precision of our now-cast, but also indicates the even higher value of now-casting when used within a nation's surveillance system. For this reason, we are currently building this tool as a permanent functionality into the dashboard of the Surveillance Outbreak Response Management System (www.sormas.org) to further enhance its role in COVID-19 response. [20] [21] [22] [23] Via the open-source R package surveillance applied within the user-friendly shiny application, public health surveillance institutions can easily apply this now-cast approach in their country for COVID-19 or any other disease. No system or country specific configurations are needed. As a specific use case this tool may be of particular value for the challenging risk assessment and risk communication in the context of the Summer Olympic Games in Tokyo July to August 2020 and similar situations elsewhere. ","Risk analysis: a process consisting of three components: risk assessment, risk management, and risk communication.","For the over-discrete parameter \u03b5it, according to Gelman, the normal distribution with a mean value of 0 and a variance of \u03c3 2 \u03b5, is generally assumed and the variance of each parameter obeys Gamma (a, b). 15 Based on this model, through the spatial component si and its posterior probability, high-risk or low-risk cities with respect to the average risk (\u03b1) of the entire study area can be identified. By calculating the probability of spatial relative risk, exp (si) is greater than 1 and divided into five categories: areas with probability&gt; 0.8, 0.6-0.8, 0.4-0.6, 0.2-0.4, and &lt;0.2 are defined as hot spots, secondary hot spots, warm-spots, sub-cold spots, and cold-spots respectively. Similarly, based on the probability threshold, the differences in these classification regions can be identified based on the trend over time. The probability that exp (b1i) is greater than 1 is divided into five categories: cities with an incidence risk probability greater than 0.8 have a rapid change trend relative to the overall risk change; between 0.6 and 0.8 indicate that the change trend of the incidence risk is greater than the overall risk change; 0.4 to 0.6 indicates that the occurrence risk is the same as the overall risk change trend; 0.2 to 0.4 indicates that the change trend of the disease risk is slower than the overall risk change; the change trend of the disease risk in cities with a probability less than 0.2 is more slower than the overall risk.","The mass media must also take responsibility for providing correct information and creating comprehension among citizens. Journalists have an important role in health communication and should acknowl edge that their strong but inaccurate and misleading headlines agitate members of the public, cause fear, impinge on public communication, and diminish countermeasures for the outbreak. Health-care professionals should cooperate with the mass media and help differentiate what is known and unknown. Effective communication will not only contribute to lessening the risk for inappropriate behaviour, such as unnecessary visits to health-care facilities, but also help eliminate fake news and discrimination against patients and Chinese visitors. ","In August 2005, Hurricane Katrina made landfall on the Gulf coast of the USA. The worst consequences were felt in New Orleans, Louisiana, where the levee system was breached and billions of dollars of damage occurred. The storm also caused significant loss of life and many people were displaced from their homes. The magnitude of the hurricane was anticipated, the risk having been communicated at both local and national level. However, this risk warning was not heeded appropriately. For example, although mandatory evacuation was eventually ordered, there was little provision for the large numbers involved or for those citizens who could not evacuate themselves. The aftermath of the storm, with many people left living in squalid conditions, also revealed a risk management process that left much to be desired. 5 One notable example was in the coordination of a bi-partisan emergency federal health policy response, attempts at which were blocked by the White House, citing multiple concerns including relevance and cost. The subsequent delay resulted in profound health, economic and political consequences. 6 Several lessons may be drawn for the risk management of disease outbreaks. Firstly, although risk communication may occur, it does not automatically result in a co-ordinated risk management response. Second, this occurred in the USA, a country which clearly has the public health and disaster management resources to deal with such a problem. However, these resources were not mobilized effectively, efficiently or in a timely manner. At the heart of many of the problems were fractured communication systems. Among operational problems, there were failures in communication technologies subsequent to the weather conditions and, whilst some decisions required extensive information, others were made on the basis of unverified rumours reported by the media, leading to incoherent responses. 5 Communication failures occurred between the local, state and federal agencies, and there was a lack of clear roles and responsibilities. Although New Orleans had experienced previous hurricanes and had a disaster management plan, the plan was clearly operationally fragile.","Some relevant definitions according to Indian FSS Act 2006 are \u2022 \"Food\" means any substance, whether processed, partially processed or unprocessed, which is intended for human consumption and includes primary food as defined in the Act. \u2022 \"Food safety\" means assurance that food is acceptable for human consumption according to its intended use. \u2022 \"Food Safety Management System\" means the adoption of Good Manufacturing Practices, Good Hygienic Practices, Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point and such other practices as may be specified by regulation, for the food business. \u2022 \"Primary food\" means an article of food, being a produce of agriculture or horticulture or animal husbandry and dairying or aquaculture in its natural form, resulting from the growing, raising, cultivation, picking, harvesting, collection, or catching in the hands of a person other than a farmer or fisherman. \u2022 \"Risk\" in relation to any article of food, means the probability of an adverse effect on the health of consumers of such food and the severity of that effect, consequential to a food hazard. \u2022 \"Risk analysis\" in relation to any article of food, means a process consisting of three components, that is, risk assessment, risk management, and risk communication. \u2022 \"Risk assessment\" means a scientifically based process consisting of the following steps: (1) hazard identification, (2) hazard characterization, (3) exposure assessment, and (4) risk characterization. \u2022 \"Risk communication\" means the interactive exchange of information and opinions throughout the risk analysis process concerning risks, risk-related factors and risk perceptions, among risk assessors, risk managers, consumers, industry, the academic community and other interested parties, including the explanation of risk assessment findings and the basis of risk management decisions. \u2022 \"Risk management\" means the process, distinct from risk assessment, of evaluating policy alternatives, in consultation with all interested parties considering risk assessment and other factors relevant for the protection of health of consumers and for the promotion of fair trade practices, and, if needed, selecting appropriate prevention and control options. \u2022 \"Unsafe food\" means an article of food whose nature, substance, or quality is so affected as to render it injurious to health.","As per WHO (2015) global human movements are increasing as also the international food trade, resulting in new risks to food safety since more and more people want to eat out to try new varieties of foods. Such new trends are also modifying the Role of risk analysis and risk communication in food safety management 5.1 Introduction effective and rapid communication during food safety emergencies. To insure a comprehensive approach, GLEWS links with INFOSAN to insure and promote seamless action throughout food value chain within human-animal-ecosystem interface (WHO, 2013) .","Risk communication involving interested parties should include a transparent explanation of the risk assessment policy and of assessment of risk, including uncertainty. Need for specific standards or related texts and procedures followed to determine them, including how uncertainty was dealt with, should also be clearly explained. It should indicate any constraints, uncertainties, assumptions and their impact on the risk analysis, and minority opinions that had been expressed in the course of the risk assessment (FAO/WHO-Provisional Edition, 2005) .","Epidemiologic studies may be designed to evaluate outcome variables other than infection or disease occurrence. In these situations, how the outcome variables and study population are defined and measured can affect interpretation of the results and the validity of the conclusions. For example, in the development of recombinant vaccines for hepatitis B virus (HBV), two vaccine formulations, containing either 10 \u00b5g or 20 \u00b5g of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) in each dose, were evaluated in clinical trials. Higher antibody titers developed in subjects who were administered vaccine with the higher dose. Both vaccines produced sufficient levels of antibody to be considered protective against infection, and both were licensed by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. However, when the vaccines were more broadly case-control studies, odds ratios (ORs) are determined and approximate the relative risk. ORs provide a valid estimate of the RR under conditions that prevail in most case-control studies: the cases of disease are newly diagnosed, prevalent cases are not included in the control group, and the selection of cases and controls is not based on exposure status. 31 An increased RR or OR (i.e., &gt;1.0) for an exposure variable indicates that the exposure is related to an increased risk of disease. Similarly, a decreased RR or OR (i.e., &lt;1.0) indicates that the exposure variable is related to a decreased risk of disease. For example, the consumption of undercooked ground beef has been associated with an increased risk of E. coli O157:H7 infection in outbreak settings and of sporadic E. coli O157:H7 infections in the community. 32 Although RRs and ORs do provide a measure of the risk of disease associated with a specific factor, they do not directly describe how much disease in the community can be attributed to that factor. Rather, the attributable risk or fraction considers both the RR for an exposure variable and the proportion of the population exposed to that variable. In a case-control study of sporadic E. coli O157:H7 infections conducted by the Foodborne Disease Active Surveillance Network (FoodNet) in 1996 to 1997, persons who ate undercooked hamburgers away from home had approximately a 6 times greater risk of E. coli O157:H7 than those who did not. For those who ate undercooked hamburger at home, the risk was only 2 times greater. However, eating undercooked hamburger at home was more common than eating it away from home. Therefore, eating undercooked hamburger at home accounted for an estimated 8% of cases, whereas the riskier (i.e., higher OR) practice of eating undercooked hamburger away from home accounted for 7% of cases. Furthermore, persons who ate at a table service restaurant were only 1.7 times as likely to have E. coli O157:H7 infection than those who did not. But, because eating at a table service restaurant is a very common practice and therefore represents more frequent exposure, it accounted for an estimated 20% of cases. Although it had the weakest statistical association, it accounted for the highest proportion of cases. Similarly, in a case-control study of sporadic listeriosis cases reported in FoodNet sites from 2000 to 2003, living on a cattle farm had the strongest association with illness (OR = 13.75), but, because it was an uncommon exposure, it had a population attributable fraction of only 1.6%. However, eating melons at a commercial establishment accounted for 10.6% of cases, even though the OR was only 2.6. 33 The identification of melon as a risk factor for sporadic listeriosis in this study subsequently made it easier for investigators to identify cantaloupe as the source for a large multistate outbreak of listeriosis in 2011. 34 As these examples show, both RR and attributable risk are important measures for describing the epidemiology of infectious diseases and determining public health priorities.","Effective outbreak communication is one tool to achieve that goal. Unfortunately, examples abound of communication failures that have undermined public trust and compliance, as well as unnecessarily prolonged economic, social and political turmoil (31, 32) . As part of hospital preparedness and management planning, an outbreak communication plan should be ready from the start.","At the above-mentioned hospitals, the \"three zones and two channels\" management is used for facilitation of medical staff and patient flow through the hospital. There have been three zones arranged to help facilitate treatment of patients: a \"contaminated\" area (Red), a \"semicontaminated\" area (Yellow), and a \"clean\" area (Green). The risk of personnel cross-infection is divided into three levels of risk. Level 1 indicates high risk level is for the \"contaminated\" zone; level 2 indicates medium risk level is for \"semi-contaminated\" zone, and level 3 indicates low risk one for the \"clean\" zone. There are also two \"channels\" or areas that are only accessible by patients with suspected or confirmed infections and areas that are only accessible by routine patients and staff.","There is currently much debate about the reasons why Italy has been the country hardest hit by the pandemic, both in terms of mortality and disease severity. Although often used interchangeably, these are two distinct concepts. COVID-19-related mortality indicates the proportion of individuals in the population who die from the disease. The severity of COVID-19 measures the risk of dying among infected individuals. Overall mortality is thus determined by the severity of the disease for the proportion of infected individuals in the population, and it will be higher if disease severity is elevated for a large share of the population. This is the reason why a demographic argument frequently cited is that the old age structure of the Italian population and extensive intergenerational contact between older and younger generations have made it more vulnerable to COVID-19-related mortality (3) .","The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.24.20027474 doi: medRxiv preprint their incubation periods groups using different visualization tools. It indicates that the younger group tends to have a shorter incubation period. The variance of their incubation period also seems to be smaller. The Mann-Whitney rank test shows that there's a statistically significant difference between the incubation of age&lt;40 and age&gt;=40 groups with the null hypothesis: the medians of incubation period between two groups are the same. The p-values for corresponding alternative hypotheses: the age&lt;40 group has a smaller incubation median is 0.00474. It suggests that the age&lt;40 group has a shorter incubation period than the age&gt;=40 group. Similarly, the Siegal-Tukey test indicates the younger group's incubation variance is less than the older group's by p-value: 0.0083.

Figure 4 illustrates biplots of the dataset by removing two cases with missing items by using PCA (principal component analysis), sparse PCA (sparse principal component analysis, t-SNE (t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding), and LLE (locally linear embedding) [16] [17] [18] [19] .

But PCA, sparse PCA and LLE all show that the incubation of two groups is linearly separable, which means there exists an obvious linear boundary to separate them, in the subspaces generated by PCA, SPCA, t-SNE, or LLE.

Interaction effects were found: year 2 and year 3 NSs were significantly affected by the nursing staff's infection control practice in the units. Furthermore, knowledge, training, management support, barriers, and nursing staff influence were the predictors for compliance of SPs. Assertiveness training coupled with communication skills training should be implemented to empower NSs to handle the challenges in the hierarchical clinical placement environment. Future studies using an observational design on SPs compliance among NSs and studies to explore the influence of nursing staff to NSs and junior nursing staff are recommended.","Perhaps one of the most important global health emergency incidents for 2020 would be the global response to COVID-2019 [21]. With their proposed influenza A simulation model that considered the three main routes of transmission\u2014long\u2013range airborne, fomites, and close contact\u2014Zhang and Li [22] found in a non-clinical office setting that mask wearing and regular cleaning of high-touch surfaces were more useful than hand-washing for viral-related disease transmission control. Through their retrospective public health response policy analysis of SARS and MERS in South Korea, Lee and Jung [23] showed that legislation and leadership influenced the overall emergency response process and the establishment of intergovernmental response systems and the success of risk communications during infectious-related events. Meanwhile, although new technology platforms (e.g., smartphones and internet) had generated interests and showed promises in efficiency and speed in mass communication in emergencies and crises, community receptivity of communication channels might differ with the nature of the emergency events [24]. For major infectious disease-based event such as the H7N9 outbreak in 2014 in Hong Kong, Tam, Huang and Chan [19] showed traditional risk communication channels (television and telephone) might still be the preferred channels of the general public.","An effective FSMS helps in developing an effective \"risk analysis framework\" to collect and analyze the best available scientific information on a hazard that presents a risk to people, animals, or plants and consider the information along with other important nonscientific information, about a chemical, biological or physical hazard, possibly associated with food in order to select the best option to manage that risk based on various alternatives identified (FAO/WHO-Provisional Edition, 2005). 5.4 Risk assessment Risk analysis process begins with risk management defining problem, articulating goals of risk analysis and defining questions to be answered by risk assessment. Next step is to develop a risk profile, that is, science-based tasks of \"measuring\" and \"describing\" nature of risk being analyzed (i.e., risk characterization) are performed during risk assessment. Risk management and assessment are performed in an open and transparent environment based on communication and dialog. The process often culminates with the decision for implementation and continuous monitoring of a course of action by risk managers (FAO/WHO-Provisional Edition, 2005) . But the process does not end with the decision itself. Members of the risk analysis team regularly monitor the success and impact of their decision. Modifications are made as required-on the basis of new data or information or changes in the context of the problem-to achieve further reductions in adverse human health effects (FSSAI, 2010).","The population attributable fractions (PAFs) were estimated for the at-risk genotypes of CCL2 G-2518A and MBL codon 54 variant (A/B) with the use of the formula PAF Z f(OR e 1)/[1 \u00fe f(OR e 1)], where f is the prevalence of at-risk genotype associated with SARS and OR is used in the place of relative risk. 29 The PAF value indicates percentage of the increase in the risk of developing SARS attributed to at-risk genotypes.","(1) MERS: On September 24, 2012, through routine surveillance using Internet-based data, China CDC found a piece of information as following: on September 23, 2012 the official website of the WHO reported a case of novel coronavirus (later named \"MERS coronavirus\") infected case identified by UK Department of Health; previously, Saudi Arabia also reported a case; the clinical presentations of the two cases primarily included fever, cough, polypnea and dyspnea and other acute serious respiratory tract conditions, both complicated by acute renal failure. The daily information screening and assessment team preliminarily concluded that the disease was a serious emerging infectious disease which might be international spreading, and therefore suggested China CDC to follow up. On the same day, the Deputy Director General of China CDC organized experts to assess the risk, and then proposed the Chinese Ministry of Health to communicate with the WHO through the information exchange mechanism defined in the International Health Regulations (2005) , in order to be informed of the latest development; and communicate promptly with other health agencies around the globe to obtain information on virus, epidemic and response; prepare necessary risk communication materials to launch risk communication in a timely manner as needed; the National Institute for Viral Disease Control and Prevention of China CDC makes preparations for emergency laboratory testing; China CDC carries out dynamic risk assessment according to further information gained. Subsequently, China CDC continuously tracked the progress of the epidemic according to Internet information. The official websites of the WHO, the Ministry of Health of Saudi Arabia, US CDC, ECDC and other health agencies, ProMED, CIDRAP and other third-party professional websites, and news media, etc. have become important sources of information on the disease and related studies for China CDC, and important evidence base to inform the decision of China Ministry of Health to launch joint prevention and control mechanism with the other departments.","The relationship between RA and infectious diseases is very complex and can be interpreted in two different directions. On the one hand, in fact, the potential role of external microorganisms in producing acute and chronic arthritis in the form of either the direct colonization of the joints by the pathogen or the aberrant autoimmune reaction produced by the host response to the infection is well known [23, 24] . Few studies have investigated a potential link between respiratory viral infections and the development of RA [25] and in particular a Korean study reported parainfluenza and coronavirus to be associated with the number of incident RA [26] . In addition, in patients with overt inflammatory arthritis, infections are a major concern as they can contribute to disease flares [27] [28] [29] . On the other hand, RA patients carry a documented increased risk of infection compared with the general population. A population-based study by Doran and colleagues compared two matched groups of 609 patients with or without RA showing that RA patients had a significantly higher risk of serious (RR 1.53, 95% CI 1.41-1.65) and hospitalized (RR 1.88, 95% CI 1.71-2.07) infections [30] . Similarly, a prospective cohort study conducted on 2108 patients with inflammatory polyarthritis reported a 2-to 4-fold increased risk of hospitalized infection compared to healthy population [31] . This trend is primarily the result of a general impairment of the immune system typical of all autoimmune disorders and strictly dependent on the degree of disease activity. In fact, it has been demonstrated by an analysis conducted in 16,242 RA patients from the US CORRONA registry that each 0.6 unit increase in Disease Activity Score 28 (DAS28) corresponded to a 25% increased rate of infections requiring hospitalization (Incident rate ratio [IRR] 1.25, p = .03) and a 4% increased rate of outpatient infections (IRR 1.04, p = .01) [32] . In addition, a subsequent report from the same registry showed that the risk of serious infections increased progressively from patients achieving clinical remission to those achieving low (adjusted IRR 1.69, 95% CI 1.32-2.15) or moderate (adjusted IRR 1.30, 95% CI 1.09-1.56) disease activity, demonstrating the importance of maintaining a good disease control in order to reduce infectious complications [33] .","With the continuous introduction of SARS-CoV-2 and the ability of the virus to rapidly spread, the EU/EEA is about to enter Scenario 2: Limited sustained transmission. Countries should consider activating their pandemic preparedness plan. With a rising number of cases, resources may become stretched but detailed case histories, lists of contacts and samples for diagnostic testing should still be obtained, where possible. These data will give valuable insight into the epidemiology of the virus and will be essential in planning for further progression of the outbreak. While cases are concentrated in clusters, measures could be taken to boost capacity by transferring healthcare resources and staff from other locations. In preparation for the following scenarios, contingency plans should be reviewed and updated. Risk assessments before mass gatherings should consider their potential role in amplifying transmission of the virus. In this phase, there may be increasing concern among the population, particularly if a high level of uncertainty persists regarding disease severity. Risk communication messages should include clear justifications for any changes to the public health measures being implemented, as well as the critical importance of adherence to any such measures that may restrict personal freedom, such as quarantine or self-isolation. In addition, public perception should be monitored, regarding the outbreak itself but also the response, so that concerns, misinformation and rumours can be addressed.","We link gridded climate data to country-level COVID-19 cases by aggregating grid cell information over country boundaries. To preserve any nonlinearities in the temperature-COVID-19 relationship, we take nonlinear transformations of climate variables (e.g. second order polynomials) at the grid cell level before averaging values across space. To capture climatic conditions reflective of population exposure, we average across grid cells weighting by the cross-sectional gridded distribution of population in 2011 from LandScan. 27 For example, the vector of country-level daily population-weighted average temperature variables we use is computed as T it = [ z\u2208i \u03c9 gi (T gt ) 1 , g\u2208i \u03c9 gi (T gt ) 2 ], where g indicates grid cell, i indicates country, superscripts indicate polynomial powers, and \u03c9 gi is the share of country i's population that falls within grid cell g.","The availability of human resources responsible for safety, health, and environment in the laboratories is identified in most laboratories in this higher education institution. The human resources are available at the faculty, department, and laboratory levels. The availability of human resources guarantees an optimal chance of implementation of OHSE in the laboratory. 18 Improved awareness, competency and training includes training associated with specific potential hazards in each laboratory, such as chemical hazards, bio risk management, radiation safety, and training on how to develop documents related to laboratory OHSE. This training can be online or face-to-face. Most laboratories in this higher education institution have complied with this element. 18 The element of communication, participation, and consultation is the element that requires communication as part of laboratory participation, internally and externally, in a laboratory committee that discusses all aspects related to OHSE in laboratories. This objective of this element is to optimize the performance of OHSE. Most laboratories in this higher education institution must implement this element.","-Communication within the team is challenging PPE required by involved staff can affect intra-operative communication owing to loss of visual cues and sound attenuation. As such particular attention should be given to minimize background noise and precise closed loop communication. Communication between team members in the theatre is more challenging and requires patience at a time of alreadyincreased stress. Good briefing prior to the case helps with this as team members have an idea of what should be happening at each step. Speaker phones or walkie-talkies can be challenging due to PPE, however additional staff members and satellite members of the team with appropriate PPE donned were very helpful.","1.6 Statistical method: SAS 9.4 statistical analysis software was used. The t-test was used for comparisons between groups for continuous variables. The comparison between groups for categorical variables was performed using Fisher's exact probability method. Means and standard deviations are used to describe centralized discrete trends. The t-test, rank-sum test, and Fisher's exact probability method were used for comparisons between groups. P\u22640.05 indicates that the difference was statistically significant.","The first successful example of using the web for public health purposes dates back to 2003, when, in The Netherlands and Belgium, a Dutch scientific communication project was initiated by the small company Science in Action. The purpose was to inform the general population about influenza by means of a self-reporting Internet platform in Dutch (http://www.degrotegriepmeting.nl), where volunteers in The Netherlands and Belgium (the Flemish part) could answer socio-demographic, medical and behavioural questions, and report their influenzarelated symptoms each week. User participation was achieved through targeted communication and recruitment. A positive side effect of this project was the collection of almost real-time data about influenza, including from individuals who did not visit a doctor when ill. Knowledge of volunteers' postal codes allowed the real-time collection of data at the postal code level. Thanks to a vigorous communication campaign using both online and offline media, the project attracted 20 000 users during this first season.","Appropriate health care \u25a0 Patients should be approached slowly in a non-threatening manner and should be advised of what to expect during the procedure \u25a0 The dental staff should adopt an open manner, with no whispering or talking quietly to staff, as this may induce a paranoid episode \u25a0 Appropriate behavioural control techniques should be selected on an individual patient basis \u25a0 Mild schizophrenic features (which are often unrecognised) include loss of social contact, flatness of mood or inappropriate social behaviour, which may appear at first as mere tactlessness or stupidity. Thus the patient, when asked to sit down in the surgery, sits in the operator's rather than the dental chair; attempts at communication may be met by a response that indicates a failure to get through, or are interrupted by totally irrelevant remarks. Psychiatric help must be sought through the patient's medical practitioner. \u25a0 Consent issues may need to be addressed, particularly when the patient is having an acute episode \u25a0 Elective dental treatment should not be undertaken during acute episodes \u25a0 Care must be taken to avoid injury to the patient/self due to sudden movements related to tardive dyskinesia and/or orofacial dyskinesia.","The reversible accumulation of secretory proteins in the sec mutants indicates that a functional intermediate of the pathway develops at the restrictive temperature. Thin-section analysis has helped to establish the nature of these intermediates ~. Members of 10 complementation groups accumulate 80-100 nm vesicles. Members of 9 groups develop an exaggerated endoplasmic reticulum (ER) lining the inner surface of the plasma membrane and connected to the lumen of the nuclear envelope.
