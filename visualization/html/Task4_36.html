Considering the potential threat of a pandemic, scientists and physicians have been racing to understand this new virus and the pathophysiology of this disease to uncover possible treatment regimens and discover effective therapeutic agents and vaccines. To support the current research and development, CAS has produced a special report to provide an overview of published scientific information with an emphasis on patents in the CAS content collection. It highlights antiviral strategies involving small molecules and biologics targeting complex molecular interactions involved in coronavirus infection and replication. The drug-repurposing effort documented herein focuses primarily on agents known to be effective against other RNA viruses including SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. The patent analysis of coronavirus-related biologics includes therapeutic anti...","AbstractThe global spread of SARS-CoV-2 requires an urgent need to find effective therapeutics for the treatment of COVID-19. We developed a data-driven drug repositioning framework, which applies both machine learning and statistical analysis approaches to systematically integrate and mine large-scale knowledge graph, literature and transcriptome data to discover the potential drug candidates against SARS-CoV-2. The retrospective study using the past SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV data demonstrated that our machine learning based method can successfully predict effective drug candidates against a specific coronavirus. Our in silico screening followed by wet-lab validation indicated that a poly-ADP-ribose polymerase 1 (PARP1) inhibitor, CVL218, currently in Phase I clinical trial, may be repurposed to treat COVID-19. Our in vitro assays revealed that CVL218 can exhibit effective inhibitory activity against SARS-CoV-2 replication without obvious cytopathic effect. In addition, we showed that CVL...","In the past twenty years, numerous novel zoonotic viral agents with pandemic potential have emerged in China, such as the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus and, more recently, the avian-origin influenza A/H7N9 virus, which have caused outbreaks among humans with high morbidity and mortality. In addition, several emerging and re-emerging viral pathogens have also been imported into China from travelers, e.g. the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus and Zika virus (ZIKV). Herein, we review these emerging viral pathogens in China and focus on how surveillance by pathogen genomics has been employed to discover and annotate novel pathogenic agents, identify natural reservoirs, monitor the transmission events and delineate their evolution and adaption to the human host. We also highlight the application of genomic sequencing in the recent Ebola epidemics in Western Africa. In summary, genomic sequencing has become a standard research tool in the field of eme...","AbstractWuhan Novel Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak has become a global outbreak which has raised the concern of scientific community to design and discover a definitive cure against this deadly virus which has caused deaths of numerous infected people upon infection and spreading. To date, no antiviral therapy or vaccine is available which can effectively combat the infection caused by this virus. This study was conducted to design possible epitope-based subunit vaccines against the SARS-CoV-2 virus using the approaches of reverse vaccinology and immunoinformatics. Upon continual computational experimentation three possible vaccine constructs were designed and one vaccine construct was selected as the best vaccine based on molecular docking study which is supposed to effectively act against SARS-CoV-2. Later, molecular dynamics simulation and in silico codon adaptation experiments were carried out in order to check biological stability and find effective mass production strate...","SUMMARYA new coronavirus (CoV) identified as COVID-19 virus is the etiological agent responsible for the 2019-2020 viral pneumonia outbreak that commenced in Wuhan1-4. Currently there is no targeted therapeutics and effective treatment options remain very limited. In order to rapidly discover lead compounds for clinical use, we initiated a program of combined structure-assisted drug design, virtual drug screening and high-throughput screening to identify new drug leads that target the COVID-19 virus main protease (Mpro). Mpro is a key CoV enzyme, which plays a pivotal role in mediating viral replication and transcription, making it an attractive drug target for this virus5,6. Here, we identified a mechanism-based inhibitor, N3, by computer-aided drug design and subsequently determined the crystal structure of COVID-19 virus Mpro in complex with this compound. Next, through a combination of structure-based virtual and high-throughput screening, we assayed over 10,000 compounds including...","SARS-CoV-2 is the etiological agent responsible for the COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan. Specific antiviral drug are urgently needed to treat COVID-19 infections. The main protease (Mpro) of SARS-CoV-2 is a key CoV enzyme that plays a pivotal role in mediating viral replication and transcription, which makes it an attractive drug target. In an effort to rapidly discover lead compounds targeting Mpro, two compounds (11a and 11b) were designed and synthesized, both of which exhibited excellent inhibitory activity with an IC50 value of 0.05 \u03bcM and 0.04 \u03bcM respectively. Significantly, both compounds exhibited potent anti-SARS-CoV-2 infection activity in a cell-based assay with an EC50 value of 0.42 \u03bcM and 0.33 \u03bcM, respectively. The X-ray crystal structures of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro in complex with 11a and 11b were determined at 1.5 \u00c5 resolution, respectively. The crystal structures showed that 11a and 11b are irreversible, the aldehyde groups of which are bound covalently to Cys145 of Mpro. Both compo...","Antiviral agents are drugs approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment or control of viral infections. Available antiviral agents mainly target stages in the viral life cycle. The target stages in the viral life cycle are; viral attachment to host cell, uncoating, synthesis of viral mRNA, translation of mRNA, replication of viral RNA and DNA, maturation of new viral proteins, budding, release of newly synthesized virus, and free virus in body fluids. At least half of available antiviral agents are for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infections. The others are used mainly for the management of herpesviruses, hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), and respiratory viruses. Antiviral agents can be used for prophylaxis, suppression, preemptive therapy, or treatment of overt disease. Two important factors that can limit the utility of antiviral drugs are toxicity and the development of resistance to the antiviral agent by the virus. In ...","Abstract Antiviral agents are drugs approved in the USA by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment or control of viral infections. Available antiviral agents mainly target stages in the viral life cycle. The target stages in the viral life cycle are; viral attachment to host cell, uncoating, synthesis of viral mRNA, translation of mRNA, replication of viral RNA and DNA, maturation of new viral proteins, budding, release of newly synthesized virus, and free virus in body fluids. Two important factors that can limit the utility of antiviral drugs are toxicity and the development of resistance to the antiviral agent by the virus. In addition, host phenotypic behaviors toward antiviral drugs because of either genomic or epigenetic factors could limit the efficacy of an antiviral agent in an individual. This article summarizes the most relevant pharmacologic and clinical properties of current antiviral agents, and targets for novel antiviral agents.","AbstractCoronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) is an emerging global health crisis. With over 200,000 confirmed cases to date, this pandemic continues to expand, spurring research to discover vaccines and therapies. SARS-CoV-2 is the novel coronavirus responsible for this disease. It initiates entry into human cells by binding to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) via the receptor binding domain (RBD) of its spike protein (S). Disrupting the SARS-CoV-2-RBD binding to ACE2 with designer drugs has the potential to inhibit the virus from entering human cells, presenting a new modality for therapeutic intervention. Peptide-based binders are an attractive solution to inhibit the RBD-ACE2 interaction by adequately covering the extended protein contact interface. Using molecular dynamics simulations based on the recently solved ACE2 and SARS-CoV-2-RBD co-crystal structure, we observed that the ACE2 peptidase domain (PD) \u03b11 helix is important for binding SARS-CoV-2-RBD. Using automated fast-flo...","Welcome to the New Year and a new issue of the Biomedical Journal, where we learn that travelling with company boosts the metastatic potential of circulating tumour cells, as well as that a worm could be an excellent model to study antidiabetic drugs. In addition, we discover another pair of molecular scissors for genetic engineering, how exactly Leptospira wreaks havoc on its run through the host organism, and that hyperparathyroidism brings its own risks, but does not worsen the outcome of papillary thyroid carcinoma. Furthermore, the importance of taking into account differing beauty ideals for aesthetic surgery surveys is discussed, alongside the question how bad isolated local recurrence is in the case of HR + breast cancer. Finally, we find out that virtual colonoscopy deserves more credit, that the first medical experiment in space was all about the H-reflex, and that it is possible to survive advanced necrotising fasciitis of the face and neck.","With relatively short latency and rapid propagation, viral diseases could be transmitted through the air to medical personnel or the public during the incubation period. To reduce the possibilities of spread, this research creates an infection probability model based on the settling velocity and concentration distribution of infectious droplets. Then, radio frequency identification (RFID) technology is employed to track the travel history (time, date and place) of the infected patients. A tree structure algorithm and an infection probability model are applied to trace the transmission routes, discover the correlations between carriers and suspected cases, and finally calculate the infection probability on the basis of time interval. In case of an epidemic outbreak or once an infected case is confirmed, the disease tracking and control system could be initiated by accessing RFID logs to plot the carriers\u2019 time of onset and to trace possible routes of transmission via tree diagrams. The ...","Viral diseases are one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in the world. Virus-specific vaccines and antiviral drugs are the most powerful tools to combat viral diseases. However, broad-spectrum antiviral agents (BSAAs, i.e. compounds targeting viruses belonging to two or more viral families) could provide additional protection of general population from emerging and re-emerging viral diseases reinforcing the arsenal of available antiviral options. Here, we reviewed discovery and development of BSAAs and summarized the information on 119 safe-in-man agents in freely accessible database (https://drugvirus.info/). Future and ongoing pre-clinical and clinical studies will increase the number of BSAAs, expand spectrum of their indications, and identify drug combinations for treatment of emerging and re-emerging viral infections as well as co-infections.","Computational and experimental high-throughput screening are frequently used to discover new leads for drug design. Although novel ligands have been identified by these methods, it has become clear that screening hit lists are plagued by false positives. These nuisance compounds are ultimately found to be developmental dead-ends and are abandoned, often after considerable effort has been invested in them. Much work over the last decade has been devoted to exploring the origins of false-positive screening hits, and ligand promiscuity has emerged as one such cause. Well-known mechanisms of promiscuity include reactive species and privileged substructures. More recently, it has been found that some nonspecific screening hits form aggregates of 30\u20131000nm in diameter. It has been proposed that these aggregate particles are responsible for the promiscuous behavior of many false positives and that aggregate-forming compounds may be widespread among screening hits. This chapter will review the...","Background: Chest CT had high sensitivity in diagnosing novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP) at early stage, giving it an advantage over nucleic acid detection in time of crisis. Deep learning was reported to discover intricate structures from clinical images and achieve expert-level performance in medical image analysis. To develop and validate an integrated deep learning framework on chest CT images for auto-detection of NCP, particularly focusing on differentiating NCP from influenza pneumonia (IP). Methods: 35 confirmed NCP cases were consecutively enrolled as training set from 1138 suspected patients in three NCP designated hospitals together with 361 confirmed viral pneumonia patients from center one including 156 IP patients, from May, 2015 to February, 2020. The external validation set enrolled 57 NCP patients and 50 IP patients from eight centers. Results: 96.6% of NCP lesions were larger than 1 cm and 76.8% were with intensity below -500 Hu, indicating less consolidation than IP...","AbstractSARS-CoV-2 is a betacoronavirus that is responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic. The genome of SARS-CoV-2 was reported recently, but its transcriptomic architecture is unknown. Utilizing two complementary sequencing techniques, we here present a high-resolution map of the SARS-CoV-2 transcriptome and epitranscriptome. DNA nanoball sequencing shows that the transcriptome is highly complex owing to numerous recombination events, both canonical and noncanonical. In addition to the genomic RNA and subgenomic RNAs common in all coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 produces a large number of transcripts encoding unknown ORFs with fusion, deletion, and/or frameshift. Using nanopore direct RNA sequencing, we further find at least 41 RNA modification sites on viral transcripts, with the most frequent motif being AAGAA. Modified RNAs have shorter poly(A) tails than unmodified RNAs, suggesting a link between the internal modification and the 3\u2032 tail. Functional investigation of the unknown ORFs and RN...","Abstract Sequential pattern mining (SPM) has been applied in many fields. However, traditional SPM neglects the pattern repetition in sequence. To solve this problem, gap constraint SPM was proposed and can avoid finding too many useless patterns. Nonoverlapping SPM, as a branch of gap constraint SPM, means that any two occurrences cannot use the same sequence letter in the same position as the occurrences. Nonoverlapping SPM can make a balance between efficiency and completeness. The frequent patterns discovered by existing methods normally contain redundant patterns. To reduce redundant patterns and improve the mining performance, this paper adopts the closed pattern mining strategy and proposes a complete algorithm, named Nettree for Nonoverlapping Closed Sequential Pattern (NetNCSP) based on the Nettree structure. NetNCSP is equipped with two key steps, support calculation and closeness determination. A backtracking strategy is employed to calculate the nonoverlapping support of a ...","Abstract The International Society for Influenza and other Respiratory Virus Diseases held its 6th Antiviral Group (isirv-AVG) conference in Rockville, Maryland, November 13\u201315, 2018. The three-day program was focused on therapeutics towards seasonal and pandemic influenza, respiratory syncytial virus, coronaviruses including MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, human rhinovirus, and other respiratory viruses. Updates were presented on several influenza antivirals including baloxavir, CC-42344, VIS410, immunoglobulin, immune plasma, MHAA4549A, pimodivir (JNJ-63623872), umifenovir, and HA minibinders; RSV antivirals including presatovir (GS-5806), ziresovir (AK0529), lumicitabine (ALS-008176), JNJ-53718678, JNJ-64417184, and EDP-938; broad spectrum antivirals such as favipiravir, VH244, remdesivir, and EIDD-1931/EIDD-2801; and host directed strategies including nitazoxanide, eritoran, and diltiazem. Other topics included considerations of novel endpoints such as ordinal scales and patient reported ou...","AbstractIn 2015, the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) reached the Republic of Korea through nosocomial transmission and was the largest epidemic outside of the Arabian Peninsula. To date, despite various strategies to identify CoV interventions, only limited therapeutic options are available. To address these unmet medical needs, we used a South Korean MERS-CoV clinical isolate and screened 5,406 compounds, including United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drugs and bioactive molecules, for their activity against the isolate. The primary assay confirmed 221 hits by dose-response curve analysis and identified 54 hits with a therapeutic index (TI) greater than 6. Time-of-addition studies with 12 FDA-approved drugs demonstrated that 8 and 4 therapeutics act on the early and late stages of the viral life cycle, respectively. Among the drugs were e.g., three cardiotonic agents (ouabain, digitoxin, digoxin) with a TI greater than 100, an anti-malaria ...","Publisher Summary This chapter focuses on non-HIV antiviral agents. The development of antiviral agents to treat non-HIV infections is largely focused on therapies for the treatment of chronic hepatitis infections B and C. Nucleoside analog continue to be the mainstay of Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) therapeutics. The first small molecule inhibitor of Hepatitis C Virus (HCV), the NS3 protease inhibitor BILN-2061, entered phase 2 clinical trials, producing a striking reduction in viral load in treated individuals. The development of the HCV replicon system and its application to screening for antiviral agents provided tangible benefit with the disclosure of mechanistically and structurally diverse HCV inhibitors. Adefovir dipivoxil has been approved in the United States and the European Union for the treatment of HBV, providing a second small molecule antiviral to add to lamivudine (3TC) and the injectable protein IFN\u03b1 as the only approved agents for treating HBV infection. The chapter also p...","As of March 22, 2020, the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in the U.S. has reached nearly 30,000. While rapid and accessible diagnosis is paramount to monitoring and reducing the spread of disease, COVID-19 testing capabilities across the U.S. remain constrained. For many individuals, urgent care centers (UCCs) may offer the most accessible avenue to be tested. Through a phone survey, we describe the COVID-19 testing capabilities at UCCs and provide a snapshot highlighting the limited COVID-19 testing capabilities at UCCs in states with the greatest disease burden.","[Image: see text] The recent outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) highlights an urgent need for therapeutics. Through a series of drug repurposing screening campaigns, niclosamide, an FDA-approved anthelminthic drug, was found to be effective against various viral infections with nanomolar to micromolar potency such as SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, ZIKV, HCV, and human adenovirus, indicating its potential as an antiviral agent. In this brief review, we summarize the broad antiviral activity of niclosamide and highlight its potential clinical use in the treatment of COVID-19.","Filoviruses are emerging pathogens and causative agents of viral haemorrhagic fever. Case fatality rates of filovirus disease outbreaks are among the highest reported for any human pathogen, exceeding 90% (ref. 1). Licensed therapeutic or vaccine products are not available to treat filovirus diseases. Candidate therapeutics previously shown to be efficacious in non-human primate disease models are based on virus-specific designs and have limited broad-spectrum antiviral potential. Here we show that BCX4430, a novel synthetic adenosine analogue, inhibits infection of distinct filoviruses in human cells. Biochemical, reporter-based and primer-extension assays indicate that BCX4430 inhibits viral RNA polymerase function, acting as a non-obligate RNA chain terminator. Post-exposure intramuscular administration of BCX4430 protects against Ebola virus and Marburg virus disease in rodent models. Most importantly, BCX4430 completely protects cynomolgus macaques from Marburg virus infection whe...","Background: Although a number of antiviral agents have been evaluated for coronaviruses there are no approved drugs available. To provide an overview of the landscape of therapeutic research for COVID-19, we conducted a review of registered clinical trials. Methods: A review of currently registered clinical trials was performed on registries, including the Chinese (chictr.org.cn) and US (clinicaltrials.gov) databases to identify relevant studies up to March, 7th 2020. The search was conducted using the search terms \u201c2019-nCoV\u201d, \u201cCOVID-19\u201d, \u201cSARS-CoV-2\u201d, \u201cHcov-19\u201d, \u201cnew coronavirus\u201d, \u201cnovel coronavirus\u201d. We included interventional clinical trials focusing on patients with COVID-19 and assessing antiviral drugs or agents. Findings: Out of the 353 studies identified, 115 clinical trials were selected for data extraction. Phase IV trials were the most commonly reported study type (n=27, 23%). However, 62 trials (54%) did not describe the phase of the study. Eighty percent (n=92) of the tri...","Abstract RNA viruses are a significant source of morbidity and mortality in humans every year. Additionally, the potential use of these viruses in acts of bioterrorism poses a threat to national security. Given the paucity of vaccines or postexposure therapeutics for many highly pathogenic RNA viruses, novel treatments are badly needed. Sequence-based drug design, under development for almost 20 years, is proving effective in animal models and has moved into clinical trials. Important advances in the field include the characterization of RNA interference in mammalian cells and chemical modifications that can dramatically increase the in vivo stability of therapeutic oligonucleotides. Antisense strategies utilize single-stranded DNA oligonucleotides that inhibit protein production by mediating the catalytic degradation of target mRNA, or by binding to sites on mRNA essential for translation. Double-stranded RNA oligonucleotides, known as short-interfering RNAs (siRNAs), also mediate the...","A newly identified novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) is causing pneumonia-associated respiratory syndrome across the world. Epidemiology, genomics, and pathogenesis of the SARS-CoV-2 show high homology with that of SARS-CoV. Current efforts are focusing on development of specific antiviral drugs. Therapeutic neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) against SARS-CoV-2 will be greatly important therapeutic agents for the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Herein, the host immune responses against SARS-CoV discussed in this review provide implications for developing NAbs and understanding clinical interventions against SARS-CoV-2. Further, we describe the benefits, challenges and considerations of NAbs against SARS-CoV-2. Although many challenges exist, NAbs still offer a therapeutic option to control the current pandemic and the possible re-emergence of the virus in the future, and their development therefore remains a high priority.","Sarcoidosis is a granulomatous disease of unknown etiology, characterized by a Th1 immunophenotype, most commonly involving the lung, skin, lymph node and eyes. Molecular and immunologic studies continue to strengthen the association of sarcoidosis with infectious antigens, particularly those derived from Propionibacterium and Mycobacterium species. Independent studies report the presence of microbial nucleic acids and proteins within sarcoidosis specimens. Complementary immunologic studies also support the role of infectious agents in sarcoidosis pathogenesis. Th-1 immune responses directed against mycobacterial virulence factors have been detected within sarcoidosis diagnostic bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). Th1 and Th17 immune responses against propionibacteria have also been reported. More recently, case reports and clinical trials from Japanese, European and American investigators have emerged regarding the efficacy of antimicrobials against Propionibacterium and Mycobacterium speci...","The last decades have been characterized by the appearance of a substantial number of newly recognized or novel infectious agents and by the re-emergence of infectious diseases with a global impact. The objective of this article is to briefly describe the model of hospital response for early diagnosis and prompt management of patients with highly contagious infectious diseases. We reviewed the main components of hospital preparedness in response to clustering of highly contagious diseases. A model for the initial hospital response to an epidemic in our referral Institute is discussed. Prompt recognition and identification is the initial and indispensable step in facing any communicable diseases, regardless of whether it is a prevalent, a newly emerging one or deliberately released. The importance of developing and implementing nontraditional methods of public health surveillance and a system that allows a wide and immediate dissemination of information and exchange of views on risk ass...","The emergence of new pathogens, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and Ebola virus, poses serious challenges to global public health and highlights the urgent need for novel antiviral approaches. Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) have been successfully used to treat various diseases, particularly cancer and immunological disorders. Antigen-specific mAbs have been isolated using several different approaches, including hybridoma, transgenic mice, phage display, yeast display, and single B-cell isolation. Consequently, an increasing number of mAbs, which exhibit high potency against emerging viruses in vitro and in animal models of infection, have been developed. In this paper, we summarize historical trends and recent developments in mAb discovery, compare the advantages and disadvantages of various approaches to mAb production, and discuss the potential use of such strategies for the development of antivi...","Respiratory viruses cause significant morbidity and mortality in immunocompromised populations such as stem cell transplant and solid organ transplant patients. Few viruses causing respiratory tract infection have an approved therapy, and many of the viruses have no therapeutic options at all. In this article, we describe novel agents under development for treatment options against several respiratory viruses.","AbstractThe outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in China caused by SARS-CoV-2 virus continually lead to worldwide human infections and deaths. It is currently no specific viral protein targeted therapeutics yet. Viral nucleocapsid protein is a potential antiviral drug target, serving multiple critical functions during the viral life cycle. However, the structural information of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein is yet to be clear. Herein, we have determined the 2.7 \u00c5 crystal structure of the N-terminal RNA binding domain of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein. Although overall structure is similar with other reported coronavirus nucleocapsid protein N-terminal domain, the surface electrostatic potential characteristics between them are distinct. Further comparison with mild virus type HCoV-OC43 equivalent domain demonstrates a unique potential RNA binding pocket alongside the \u03b2-sheet core. Complemented by in vitro binding studies, our data provide several atomic resolution features of...","COVID-19 is an emerging infectious disease and was recently declared as a pandemic by WHO. Currently, there is no vaccine or therapeutic available for this disease. Drug repositioning represents the only feasible option to address this global challenge and a panel of fifty FDA-approved drugs that have been pre-selected by an assay of SARS-CoV was screened to identify potential antiviral drug candidates against SARS-CoV-2 infection. We found a total of 24 drugs which exhibited antiviral efficacy (0.1 \u03bcM &lt; IC50 &lt; 10 \u03bcM) against SARS-CoV-2. In particular, two FDA-approved drugs \u2013 niclosamide and ciclesonide \u2013 were notable in some respects. These drugs will be tested in an appropriate animal model for their antiviral activities. In near future, these already FDA-approved drugs could be further developed following clinical trials in order to provide additional therapeutic options for patients with COVID-19.","Rapid diagnostics, vaccines and therapeutics are important interventions for the management of the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak. It is timely to systematically review the potential of these interventions, including those for Middle East respiratory syndrome-Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV, to guide policymakers globally on their prioritization of resources for research and development. A systematic search was carried out in three major electronic databases (PubMed, Embase and Cochrane Library) to identify published studies in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Supplementary strategies through Google Search and personal communications were used. A total of 27 studies fulfilled the criteria for review. Several laboratory protocols for confirmation of suspected 2019-nCoV cases using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) have been publ...","The novel coronavirus infection (COVID-19 or Coronavirus disease 2019) that emerged from Wuhan, Hubei province of China has spread to many countries worldwide. Efforts have been made to develop vaccines against human coronavirus (CoV) infections such as MERS and SARS in the past decades. However, to date, no licensed antiviral treatment or vaccine exists for MERS and SARS. Most of the efforts for developing CoV vaccines and drugs target the spike glycoprotein or S protein, the major inducer of neutralizing antibodies. Although a few candidates have shown efficacy in in vitro studies, not many have progressed to randomized animal or human trials, hence may have limited use to counter COVID-19 infection. This article highlights ongoing advances in designing vaccines and therapeutics to counter COVID-19 while also focusing on such experiences and advances as made with earlier SARS- and MERS-CoVs, which together could enable efforts to halt this emerging virus infection.","Background: To identify safe and effective medical countermeasures (e.g., antivirals/antibodies) to address the current outbreak of a novel coronavirus (COVID-19) Methods: Comprehensive literature searches were developed by an experienced librarian for MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, and biorxiv.org/medrxiv.org; additional searches for ongoing trials and unpublished studies were conducted in clinicaltrials.gov and the Global Infectious Diseases and Epidemiology Network (GIDEON). Title/abstract and full-text screening, data abstraction, and risk of bias appraisal were carried out by single reviewers. Results: 54 studies were included in the review: three controlled trials, 10 cohort studies, seven retrospective medical record/database studies, and 34 case reports or series. These studies included patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARs, n=33), middle east respiratory syndrome (MERS, n=16), COVID-19 (n=3), and unspecified coronavirus (n=2). The most common treatment ...","Abstract Background The Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) was first described in 2012 and attracted a great international attention due to multiple healthcare associated outbreaks. The disease carries a high case fatality rate of 34.5%, and there is no internationally or nationally recommended therapy. Method We searched MEDLINE, Science Direct, Embase and Scopus databases for relevant papers published till March 2019 describing in vitro, in vivo or human therapy of MERS. Results Initial search identified 62 articles: 52 articles were from Medline, 6 from Embase, and 4 from Science Direct. Based on the inclusions and exclusions criteria, 30 articles were included in the final review and comprised: 22 in vitro studies, 8 studies utilizing animal models, 13 studies in humans, and one study included both in vitro and animal model. There are a few promising therapeutic agents on the horizon. The combination of lopinavir/ritonavir and interferon-beta- 1b showed excelle...","Abstract Recent international epidemics of coronavirus-associated illnesses underscore the urgent medical and public health need for vaccine development and regulatory body approved therapies. In particular, the current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has quickly intensified interest in developing treatment options to mitigate impact on human life. Remdesivir (GS-5734\u2122) is a broad-spectrum antiviral drug that is now being tested as a potential treatment for COVID-19 in international, multi-site clinical trials. Currently available evidence about the antiviral effects of remdesivir against coronaviruses is primarily based on in vitro and in vivo studies (including some on a chemically related compound, GS-441524\u2122), which have demonstrated largely favorable findings. As the pandemic progresses, information from human compassionate use cases will continue to accumulate before the clinical trials are concluded. It is imperative for public health practitioners and the One Healt...","Abstract This paper describes a proposed Strategic Vaccine Facility (SVF) to provide a capability to the UK to deal with new and emerging disease threats. It would underpin the vaccine manufacturing industry by developing expertise and technology to enable rapid manufacture of small batches of vaccines for emergency use against agents, such as bioterrorist agents and emerging diseases. It would have a rare ability to work with dangerous pathogens under containment, allowing the production of inactivated and live vaccines, which would be difficult in a conventional plant. The facility's output will include vaccine candidates and manufacturing protocols for transfer to industry, small vaccine batches for emergency use or clinical trials, and vaccine reference standards. It would also be available for manufacturing small batches of experimental and public health vaccines for the UK and the developing world, allowing clinical trials to be undertaken against key diseases.","Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a newly emerging infectious disease caused by a novel coronavirus, SARS-coronavirus (SARS-CoV). The SARS-CoV spike (S) protein is composed of two subunits; the S1 subunit contains a receptor-binding domain that engages with the host cell receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 and the S2 subunit mediates fusion between the viral and host cell membranes. The S protein plays key parts in the induction of neutralizing-antibody and T-cell responses, as well as protective immunity, during infection with SARS-CoV. In this Review, we highlight recent advances in the development of vaccines and therapeutics based on the S protein.","The newly emerged Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is becoming another \u201cSARS-like\u201d threat to the world. It has an extremely high death rate (\u223c50%) as there is no vaccine or efficient therapeutics. The identification of the structures of both the MERS-CoV receptor binding domain (RBD) and its complex with dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), raises the hope of alleviating this currently severe situation. In this review, we examined the molecular basis of the RBD-receptor interaction to outline why/how could we use MERS-CoV RBD to develop vaccines and antiviral drugs.","Respiratory viruses are the most frequent causative agents of disease in humans, with significant impact on morbidity and mortality worldwide. Common respiratory agents from several virus families are well adapted to efficient person-to-person transmission and circulate in a global scale, and community-based studies conducted over the past five decades or so confirm that these viruses are the predominant etiological agents of acute respiratory infections (ARIs). The respiratory viruses that most commonly circulate in all continents as endemic or epidemic agents are influenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza viruses, metapneumovirus, rhinovirus, coronaviruses, adenoviruses, and bocaviruses. Although vaccines and effective antiviral drugs are not yet available for most of these viruses, much progress has been made in the understanding of their biology and fundamental issues of host\u2013parasite relationship. This article is a summary of the current knowledge about these viru...","INTRODUCTION: There is little research on emergency care delivery in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). To facilitate future research, we aimed to assess the set of key metrics currently used by researchers in these settings and to propose a set of standard metrics to facilitate future research. METHODS: Systematic literature review of 43,109 published reports on general emergency care from 139 LMICs. Studies describing care for subsets of emergency conditions, subsets of populations, and data aggregated across multiple facilities were excluded. All facility- and patient-level statistics reported in these studies were recorded and the most commonly used metrics were identified. RESULTS: We identified 195 studies on emergency care delivery in LMICs. There was little uniformity in either patient- or facility-level metrics reported. Patient demographics were inconsistently reported: only 33% noted average age and 63% the gender breakdown. The upper age boundary used for paediatric ...","Mass spectrometry (MS) has found numerous applications in life sciences. It has high accuracy, sensitivity and wide dynamic range in addition to medium- to high-throughput capabilities. These features make MS a superior platform for analysis of various biomolecules including proteins, lipids, nucleic acids and carbohydrates. Until recently, MS was applied for protein detection and characterization. During the last decade, however, MS has successfully been used for molecular diagnostics of microbial and viral infections with the most notable applications being identification of pathogens, genomic sequencing, mutation detection, DNA methylation analysis, tracking of transmissions, and characterization of genetic heterogeneity. These new developments vastly expand the MS application from experimental research to public health and clinical fields. Matching of molecular techniques with specific requirements of the major MS platforms has produced powerful technologies for molecular diagnosti...","Abstract Due to presence of secondary bioactive metabolites, natural compounds are considered a major source of new active molecules that can be developed as new drugs. Infectious diseases, and mainly the common respiratory infections, are major challenges to the current chemotherapy systems and, therefore, there is a requirement to find new compounds with therapeutic potential. The volatile natural compounds and essential oils are the main treasure agents in the natural compounds with antibiotic potential. The present chapter reviews natural traditional remedies used in the treatment of respiratory infections with the emphasis on antibacterial, antiviral, and antiinflammation activities of the volatile natural compounds (essential oils, etc.), and provides a brief view in some of structural activity relationships between antibacterial potencies and chemical structures of the essential oil\u2019s constituents.","An emerging respiratory infectious disease with high mortality, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), is caused by a novel coronavirus (MERS-CoV). It was first reported in 2012 in Saudi Arabia and has now spread to eight countries. Development of effective therapeutics and vaccines is crucial to save lives and halt the spread of MERS-CoV. Here, we show that a recombinant protein containing a 212-amino acid fragment (residues 377-588) in the truncated receptor-binding domain (RBD: residues 367\u2013606) of MERS-CoV spike (S) protein fused with human IgG Fc fragment (S377-588-Fc) is highly expressed in the culture supernatant of transfected 293T cells. The purified S377-588-Fc protein efficiently binds to dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), the receptor of MERS-CoV, and potently inhibited MERS-CoV infection, suggesting its potential to be further developed as a therapeutic modality for treating MERS-CoV infection and saving the patients\u2019 lives. The recombinant S377-588-Fc is able to induce in t...","The use of viral agents for biological warfare has a long history, which predates their recognition and isolation by culture. Advances in viral culture and virus stabilization made during the second half of the twentieth century raised the level of concern by facilitating the large-scale production of viral agents for aerosol dissemination. Furthermore, the nucleic acid of many viruses, including some that are currently not threats, can be manipulated in the laboratory. Thus, the potential for genetic engineering and misuse of biotechnology is a serious threat. An effective defense against viral agents requires a comprehensive approach including restricting access to viral stocks, detecting deliberately induced disease outbreaks, rapid laboratory identification of viral agents in clinical specimens, preventing person-to-person transmission, using reliable decontamination procedures, and developing effective vaccines and antiviral drugs.","Efficient vaccination against infectious agents and tumors depends on specific antigen targeting to dendritic cells (DCs). We report here that biosafe coronavirus-based vaccine vectors facilitate delivery of multiple antigens and immunostimulatory cytokines to professional antigen-presenting cells in vitro and in vivo. Vaccine vectors based on heavily attenuated murine coronavirus genomes were generated to express epitopes from the lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus glycoprotein, or human Melan-A, in combination with the immunostimulatory cytokine granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF). These vectors selectively targeted DCs in vitro and in vivo resulting in vector-mediated antigen expression and efficient maturation of DCs. Single application of only low vector doses elicited strong and long-lasting cytotoxic T-cell responses, providing protective antiviral and antitumor immunity. Furthermore, human DCs transduced with Melan-A-recombinant human coronavirus 229E effi...","The human coronavirus HCoV-19 infection can cause acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), hypercoagulability, hypertension, extrapulmonary multiorgan dysfunction. Effective antiviral and anti-coagulation agents with safe clinical profiles are urgently needed to improve the overall prognosis. We screened an FDA approved drug library and found that an anticoagulant agent dipyridamole (DIP) suppressed HCoV-19 replication at an EC50 of 100 nM in vitro. It also elicited potent type I interferon responses and ameliorated lung pathology in a viral pneumonia model. In analysis of twelve HCoV-19 infected patients with prophylactic anti-coagulation therapy, we found that DIP supplementation was associated with significantly increased platelet and lymphocyte counts and decreased D-dimer levels in comparison to control patients. Two weeks after initiation of DIP treatment, 3 of the 6 severe cases (60%) and all 4 of the mild cases (100%) were discharged from the hospital. One critically ill pat...","The novel corona virus disease -2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has caused a massive global public health havoc. Recent clinical trials carried out in China has found a promising therapeutic application of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine for COVID-19. This study meticulously evaluated the various dosages of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine utilized in clinical trials registered in Chinese and US clinical trial registries for the treatment of pneumonia caused by SARS-CoV-2.","The COVID-19 virus has spread worldwide in a matter of a few months. Healthcare systems struggle to monitor and report current cases. Limited capabilities in testing result in difficult to guide policies and mitigate lack of preparation. Since severe cases, which more likely lead to fatal outcomes, are detected at a higher percentage than mild cases, the reported death rates are likely inflated in most countries. Such under-estimation can be attributed to the under-sampling of infection cases and results in systematic death rate estimation biases. The method proposed here utilizes a benchmark country (South Korea) and its reported death rates in combination with population demographics to correct the reported COVID-19 case numbers. By applying a correction, we predict that the number of cases is highly under-reported in most countries. In the case of China, it is estimated that more than 700.000 cases of COVID-19 actually occurred instead of the confirmed 80,932 cases as of 3/13/2020.",""],"title":["Research and Development on Therapeutic Agents and Vaccines for COVID-19 and Related Human Coronavirus Diseases","A data-driven drug repositioning framework discovered a potential therapeutic agent targeting COVID-19","Pathogen genomic surveillance elucidates the origins, transmission and evolution of emerging viral agents in China","The Essential Facts of Wuhan Novel Coronavirus Outbreak in China and Epitope-based Vaccine Designing against COVID-19","Structure of Mpro from COVID-19 virus and discovery of its inhibitors","Structure-Based Design, Synthesis and Biological Evaluation of Peptidomimetic Aldehydes as a Novel Series of Antiviral Drug Candidates Targeting the SARS-CoV-2 Main Protease","Antiviral Agents","Antiviral Agents\u2606","The first-in-class peptide binder to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein","Tumour travel tours \u2013 Why circulating cancer cells value company","The construction of a hospital disease tracking and control system with a disease infection probability model","Discovery and development of safe-in-man broad-spectrum antiviral agents","2.18 Promiscuous Ligands","Improved deep learning model for differentiating novel coronavirus pneumonia and influenza pneumonia","The architecture of SARS-CoV-2 transcriptome","NetNCSP: Nonoverlapping closed sequential pattern mining","Advances in respiratory virus therapeutics \u2013 A meeting report from the 6th isirv Antiviral Group conference","Screening of FDA-approved drugs using a MERS-CoV clinical isolate from South Korea identifies potential therapeutic options for COVID-19","Chapter 22.

In a historical control study, a combination of protease inhibitors (lopinavir and ritonavir) was associated with substantial clinical benefit among patients with SARS-CoV. 17 Results from in vitro cell and in vivo animal studies suggest that a combination of lopinavir/ritonavir and interferon-b1 may be effective against MERS-CoV. A placebo-controlled trial of interferon-b1 and lopinavir/ritonavir was initiated in patients with laboratory-confirmed MERS requiring hospital admission in Saudi Arabia. 18 Remdesivir, a 1 0 -cyano-substituted adenosine nucleotide analogue prodrug with broad-spectrum antiviral activity against several RNA viruses, may be evaluated. 19 The first reported patient with COVID-19 infection in the United States was administered remdesivir. Based on worsening clinical status, IV remdesivir was given for compassionate use on hospital day 7 (illness day 11). 20 Two randomized controlled trials have been registered to evaluate the safety and efficacy of remdesivir in mild/ moderate or severe patients with COVID-19 viral pneumonia. 21, 22 Kirchdoerfer and Ward 23 noticed that nonstructural proteins (nsp)12 polymerase may be a template for the design of novel antiviral therapeutic agents to interrupt the assembly of the SARS-CoV core RNA-synthesis machinery. COVID-19 has full-length genome sequences with &gt; 75% nucleotide identity with that of SARS-CoV, 7 which allows the molecular e2 Editorial structure information to be used as a model for coronavirus antiviral design. Clinical studies should assess the effectiveness and safety of monoclonal and polyclonal neutralizing antibody products and aim to discover therapeutic targets against immunopathologic host responses.","To date, there are no SARS-CoV-2-specific antiviral agents. Researchers have been racing to find possible treatments to save lives and produce vaccines for future prevention. To support research and development efforts to discover effective therapeutic and preventive agents for COVID-19, CAS, a division of the American Chemical Society specializing in scientific information solutions, has analyzed scientific data related to the development of therapeutic agents and vaccines for human coronaviruses since 2003. The analyses presented in this report are based on the CAS content collection, a scientist-curated data collection covering published scientific literature and patents from over 60 patent authorities worldwide. For a subset of the analyses, both CAS and MEDLINE data were collectively analyzed.","Since the outbreak of COVID-19, this new disease and its causative virus have drawn major global attention. Scientists and physicians worldwide have been conducting a major campaign to understand this new emergent disease and its epidemiology in an effort to uncover possible treatment regimens, discover effective therapeutic agents, and develop vaccines. Figure 4 shows the total number of journal articles related to COVID-19 or SARS-CoV-2 published each week from the last week of 2019 through the week of February 24, 2020. Over 500 journal articles were published electronically or in print during this period, and the number of published articles has increased each week since the week of January 13, 2020. Although a large portion of these articles are about clinical manifestations and treatment options, an increasing number of studies are focused on elucidation of virus structure, virus transmission mechanisms/dynamics, as well as identification of antiviral agents and accurate diagnostics for virus detection. These trends reflect immense interest and desire from the scientific community, including both academic and industrial organizations as well as clinicians, to identify new methods to halt the progression of this epidemic disease and to prevent infection and transmission in the future.","The encouraging early results from the DNA microarray technology has inspired the development of a variety of array-based platforms [38-42] and contributed to the development of a system-wide study of proteins -- the field of modern pro-teomics. Traditionally, two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-D PAGE) with mass spectrometry has been the basis of proteomic technology [43]. Although this technique has provided rich information about individual proteins, its clinical usefulness for the study of the proteome is limited. The limitations of this technique for clinical diagnostics are primarily due to low sample throughput compared with other techniques. Additionally, there are technical challenges relating to the reproducibility of the 2-D gels, the relatively low numbers of proteins that can be resolved on each gel and the limited sensitivity (ie low abundant proteins are not easily identified). Modern proteomics technology, as discussed in several recent reviews, is developing quickly and is focused on mass spec-trometry-based serum pattern profiling and protein micro-arrays in continuing efforts to discover new molecular markers and therapeutic targets in human cancer [44-46]. The use of serum proteomic pattern analysis has created diagnostic signatures for ovarian [47,48], breast [49], prostate [50] and liver cancers [51]. In the Laboratory of Pathology at the National Cancer Institute (NCI), in collaboration with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), this proteome-based strategy is being used for early detection of ovarian cancer in high-risk women. Preliminary data is so encouraging that the technology is on track to enter clinical trials in the very near future [47]. For women living with the spectre of an aggressive disease, such as ovarian cancer, a reliable screening test would represent a major step forward in the diagnostic capabilities of the physicians who treat them.","The incidences are getting reduced because of the awareness of the disease but still we don\u2019t have a particular drug or vaccine against MERS-CoV. There is a great need for a new drug for the treatment of this deadly virus and vaccine to prevent the disease. Many research laboratories are working to understand the disease completely and to discover the drug or vaccine for MERS-CoV. So we can hope that in future MERS will be treatable as common Cold.","One efficient approach to discover effective drugs is to test whether the existing antiviral drugs are effective in treating other related viral infections. Several drugs, such as ribavirin, interferon (IFN), Favipiravir (FPV), and Lopinavir (LPV)/ritonavir (RTV), have been used in patients with SARS or MERS, although the efficacy of some drugs remains controversial. It has recently been demonstrated that, as a prodrug, FPV (half maximal effective concentration (EC 50 ) = 61.88 lmol\u00c1L \u00c01 , half-maximal cytotoxic concentration (CC 50 ) &gt; 400-lmol\u00c1L \u00c01 , selectivity index (SI) &gt; 6.46) effectively inhibits the SARS-CoV-2 infection in Vero E6 cells (ATCC-1586) [7] . Furthermore, other reports show that FPV is effective in protecting mice against Ebola virus challenge, although its EC 50 value in Vero E6 cells was as high as 67 lmol\u00c1L \u00c01 [8] . Therefore, clinical studies are urgently needed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of this antiviral nucleoside for COVID-19 treatment.","Acute viral infections, such as influenza virus, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, Ebola virus, Zika virus, and the very recent SARS-CoV-2 are an increasing and probably lasting global threat 1 . Broad-spectrum antivirals (BSA) are clinically needed for the effective control of emerging and re-emerging viral infectious diseases. However, although great efforts have been made by the research community to discover therapeutic antiviral agents for coping with such emergencies, specific and effective drugs or vaccines with low toxicity have been rarely reported 2 . Thus, unfortunately, there is still no effective drugs for the infection of the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 at present, which outbreak in December 2019 firstly identified by several Chinese groups [3] [4] [5] , and now has quickly spread throughout China and to more than 90 other countries, infecting 101,923 patients and killing 3486 ones by March 7, 2020 6 .","The outbreak of the pneumonia named COVID-19 caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (2019-nCoV) has infected over 110,000 people worldwide by 8th March, 2020. Apart from China, other countries or regions including South Korea, Iran, and Europe have reported a rapid increase in the number of COVID-19 cases, implying that this novel coronavirus has posed a global health threat. Under the current circumstance of the absence of the specific vaccines and medicines against SARS-CoV-2, it is urgent to discover effective therapies especially drugs to treat the resulting COVID-19 disease and prevent the virus from further spreading. Considering that the development of a new drug generally takes years, probably the best therapeutic shortcut is to apply the drug repositioning strategy (i.e., finding the new uses of old drugs) [1, 2, 3] to identify the potential antiviral effects against SARS-CoV-2 of existing drugs that have been approved for clinical use or to enter clinical trials. Those existing drugs with potent antiviral efficacy can be directly applied to treat COVID-19 in a short time, as their safety has been verified in principle in clinical trials.","Wuhan has the competence and will to manage the outbreak supported by the provincial and central governments, together with the solidarity of whole China and the international community. Wuhan has made great contributions to global health. Further global cooperation is required in order to win the pandemic war from local to global. Scientists all over the world need to understand COVID-19 and discover potentially effective antiviral treatments and vaccines; epidemiologists need to conduct intensive contact investigations; It is important to promote protection knowledge for the general public [10]. Finally, Wuhan will not cease the restrictions of population mobility and transportation until the situation is fully under control. With all people working together, it is undoubtedly the COVID-19 can be treated and the pandemic is controllable. However, comprehensive actions from multi-sectoral bodies, both national and international, with supportive attitudes will be important to proceed towards the solution.","With incredibly high infectivity and mortality rate, COVID-19 has become a global scare. 8, 9 To compound the problem, there are no proven therapeutics to aid the suffering patients 2, 8, [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] . Only viable treatment at the moment is symptomatic and there is a desperate need for developing therapeutics to counter COVID-19. Recently, the proteomics sequences of 'WH-Human 1' coronavirus became available through Metagenomic RNA sequencing of a patient in Wuhan. 4, 15 WH-Human 1 is 89.1% similar to a group of SARS-like coronaviruses. 4 With this sequence available, it is possible to find potential inhibitory antibodies by scanning thousands of antibody sequences and discovering the neutralizing ones [16] [17] [18] . However, this requires very expensive and time-consuming experimentation to discover the inhibitory responses to Corona virus in a timely manner. In addition, computational and physics-based models require the bound crystal structure of antibody-antigen complex, however; only a few of these structures have become available. 19, 20, 21, 22 In the case of COVID-19, the bound antigen-antibody crystal structure is not available to-date 23, 24 . Given this challenge and the fact that ML models require a large amount of data, the ML approach should rely on the sequences of the antibody-antigen rather than the crystal structures 25 .","Approximately one-fifth of all childhood deaths worldwide are related to acute respiratory infections (ARIs), particularly in impoverished populations of tropical regions, where ARI case-to-fatality ratios can be remarkably higher than in temperate regions of the world. Eight human respiratory viruses circulate commonly in all age groups and are recognized as adapted to efficient person-to-person transmission ( Table 1 ). In addition to these, SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and avian influenza virus H5N1 have emerged in recent years as threats to public health. SARS-CoV has been out of circulation since 2003, and avian influenza virus H5N1 has caused limited outbreaks of human infections. As the currently known respiratory viruses still do not account for all clinically relevant human viral respiratory illnesses, systematic searches for new agents using molecular tools are expected to discover previously unidentified agents. Although respiratory viruses cause a great burden of diseases, only a few preventive or therapeutic interventions are currently available. However, recent advances in molecular and cell biology of respiratory viruses will hopefully result in the development of useful interventions. In this article, we focus on the common respiratory viruses, with the exception of influenza virus, covered in a separate article.","8. Lessons yet to be learned: the current status of antiviral therapy and vaccine development for SARS and MERS Huge progress has been made over the past ten years in the elucidation of the functions and structures of the proteins of the SARS-CoV, and research on vaccine development has also progressed, with a number of strategies being developed and evaluated in experimental animal models. However, it should also be noted that after [2005] [2006] , it became difficult to obtain funding for research on SARS-CoV in many countries, especially for efforts to discover new antiviral therapies. Similarly, there was no incentive to further develop SARS-CoV vaccines, in the absence of an overt threat to human health. Funding agencies and peer reviewers were probably short-sighted in this respect, but many virologists also failed to take seriously the threat of the re-emergence of SARS or of a SARS-like virus.","Many efforts have been directed to develop vaccines against human CoV infections in recent decades, but a limiting factor is the degree of cross-protection rendered by these vaccines due to their extensive sequence diversity.5 Various vaccines, immunotherapeutics, and drug options have been explored during the recent threats of Zika, Ebola, and Nipah viruses6-8 as well as against previous CoVs including SARS- and MERS-CoVs.3,5,9-12 These valuable options can be exploited for their potency, efficacy, and safety along with expediting other ongoing research2,4,13-15 so as to discover valuable modalities for tackling the emerging COVID-19, but as yet there is no effective vaccine or therapeutic, for which intense efforts are ongoing.","In routine drug development, researchers first discover a drug molecule with potential therapeutic activity against a certain target, then optimize its structure and validate its function using in vitro experiments followed by animal and clinical trials. By contrast, many herbal drugs have been used in clinics for hundreds or thousands of years, and thus their safety and effects have been repeatedly tested; chloroquine phosphate has been used to treat malaria for over 70 years. Timeliness is another advantage, particularly during emergencies. Once a herbal decoction or component is found to be effective, it can be immediately used for treating patients, its safety already established.","And the utility of economic statecraft has been systematically underestimated. 7 Today, it is all too common for great powers to resort to economic statecraft and social penetration to further their national interests. nuclear program. 8 The Russian Federation launched cyber warfare to destabilize Ukraine's democratic order. Moreover, Russia misinformed and polarized U.S. voters by extensive propaganda and penetration of social media platforms. 9 As a rising power, aiming at building its own order and sphere of influence, China has been engaging extensively in economic and social penetration of other countries. For instance, China banned rare earth metals exports to Japan and curtailed the import of Japanese autos due to the territory disputes regarding the Senkaku/Diaoyu Island in the East China Sea. China, as noted, also banned banana imports from the Philippines to coerce the Philippines to concede in the South China Sea dispute. 10 More important, economic globalization, the development of supply chains, and breakthroughs of network technology have jointly transformed and updated China's coercive capabilities. Some liberal scholars argue that global networks create mutual dependence that decrease states' incentives to engage in conflict or coercion. However, as political scientists Henry Farrell at George Washington University and Abraham L. Newman at Georgetown University show, global connectivity actually creates new opportunities for great powers to coerce, manipulate, and penetrate. Like Hirschman's emphasis on power asymmetry in economic interdependence, Farrell and Newman also find that modern globalization results in asymmetrical networks, in which some states are far more connected than others. Those states become the \"hubs\" of the global networks and have the capabilities to exploit \"weaponized interdependence.\" Specifically, those great powers can utilize their hub positions to gather information or cut off financial and information flows, discover and exploit vulnerabilities, compel policy change, and deter unwanted actions. 11 Sharp Power and Social Penetration. Financial power, hub positions in the global exchange networks, and information supply chains also enable authoritarian regimes to engage in comprehensive social penetration and manipulation of other societies. Christopher Walker and Jessica Ludwig of the National Endowment for Democracy analyze such phenomena through a lens of \"sharp power,\" defined as authoritarian influence efforts to \"pierce, penetrate, or perforate the information environments and societies in the targeted countries.\" To delegitimize democracies and other universal human-rights regimes, authoritarian regimes seek to incite and amplify existing divisions in democratic societies by manipulating or faking the information that reaches them. They also use financial incentives to induce media or civil societies in democracies to censor opinions that may be critical of those authoritarian regimes.","Although a number of drugs have been evaluated for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV there are no approved therapeutic agents available for coronaviruses. Integrating clinical trials of experimental therapeutics is an increasingly recognized part of the response during infectious disease outbreaks. Since the Ebola outbreak in West Africa and subsequent outbreaks in the Democratic Republic of Congo, clinical trials of investigative drugs have been fully integrated in the epidemic response. [5] [6] [7] The COVID-19 pandemic is unique because of its scale, the speed of its spread, the lack of pre-existing scientific data and the importance of media and scientific coverage. 2 To encourage the development of clinical trials that test therapeutics against SARS-CoV-2, the WHO has suggested a number of candidate antiviral agents that have to be tested in clinical trials. 8 Concomitantly, numerous clinical trials have been registered since the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak numerous to evaluate therapeutic strategies for this disease. In the epidemic context, it is crucial for clinicians and researchers to have access to rapid and quality information on clinical trials that the various teams around the world are setting up. The results will inform about the antiviral agents that are used, their dosing and duration, the inclusion and exclusion criteria for patients, the outcomes that will be evaluated, as well as the design of the clinical trials. We believe that it is essential to carry out a review of these early phase clinical trials before the results are even available in order to best inform the teams wishing to test new therapies, choose therapeutic candidates or to design clinical trials.","The use of small molecules to stabilize PPI interfaces has been shown to be a viable approach for the development of new therapeutics. Most compounds created by structure-based design to manipulate the PPI depend on detailed knowledge of the native interacting interfaces.35\u221237 In contrast, most of the compounds with therapeutic potential that stabilize non-native PPI interfaces were discovered by chance alone.38 The anti-influenza compound nucleozin was initially discovered using a chemical genetics approach, and its ability to stabilize non-native nucleoprotein oligomers was elucidated much later.39,40 Swinholide A, a cytotoxic marine macrolide, has been known to disrupt the actin cytoskeleton and act as an anticancer agent, but it took ten years to discover that it stabilized G-actin as a non-native homodimer complex.41\u221243 However, these examples did underscore the importance of hydrophobicity as a crucial factor stabilizing protein\u2013protein and protein\u2013ligand associations.44 Here, we demonstrated the possibility of using the hydrophobic interactions on non-native interfaces as targets for virtual screening. Combined with suitable selection criteria focusing on both shape and hydrophobic complementarities between the ligand and the receptor, small-molecule compounds that stabilize non-native PPIs may be identified in a rational manner. Using the above approach, we successfully identified a compound P3 that affected the biochemical activity of our target protein and showed efficacy against our target pathogen MERS-CoV (Figures 2 and 4). P3-mediated non-native MERS-CoV N-NTD dimerization induced abnormal N protein aggregation by influencing the oligomeric behavior of N-CTD and eventually halting its function in RNP formation. To the best of our knowledge, this structure-based strategy for targeting non-native interfaces has never been proposed for therapeutic design. Thus, non-native interaction interfaces in proteins may comprise a new drug development target class. For \u03b2-coronaviruses such as MERS-CoV, the amino acids comprising the non-native interaction interface on N-NTD are relatively conserved. The hydrophobic pocket surrounding W43 and F135 on monomer 1 is shared among other \u03b2-coronaviruses.24,28 The interacting surface on monomer 2, which includes G104, T105, G106, and A109, is also highly conserved (Figure S4). This conservation may provide certain advantages when developing compounds with broad-spectrum activity against a target pathogen family, including COVID-19. When we tested P3 on mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), we observed a reduction in viral titer, indicating that P3 may also inhibit MHV replication (Figure S5). On the other hand, targeting non-native interaction interfaces is not trivial. As interface formation is induced by an external agent, computations aimed at predicting native PPI structures may not be able to identify potential non-native interfaces. Nevertheless, several stratagems may assist in the identification of potential non-native interaction interfaces. One strategy is to search for target protein structures with crystal packing contacts known to be biologically irrelevant. Another approach is to identify weakly interacting sites through NMR chemical shift perturbation and hydrogen-deuterium exchange MS.45 Once these potential non-native interaction interfaces are identified, standard screening and then functional characterization may be conducted for small compounds that bind to the interface.","How do we discover new drugs for inhibiting co-translational translocation of therapeutically interesting proteins? We speculate that there may already be drugs with poorly characterized mechanisms that bind SPs, and we believe that one example may be the \"atypical\" antidepressant tianeptine, 93 which is not a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, despite its tricyclic structure. Some studies found that tianeptine is a \u03bc-opioid receptor agonist, 94, 95 but others showed recently that it inhibits neuronal inflammation by suppressing toll-like receptor TLR4-related pathways. 96, 97 It is a nonplanar sulfonamide with aromatic benzene rings that could bind an SP H-region \u03b1-helix with van der Waals interactions, as we propose for CADA compounds. Tianeptine might down-modulate receptors or cytokines on TLR4 inflammation pathways by inhibiting their co-translational translocation across the ER membrane. In the search to develop new SP-binding drugs, we suggest focusing on proteins with recognized therapeutic potential that have SPs containing potentially recognizable residues in their H domains, including asparagine, aspartate, cysteine, glutamate, glutamine, histidine, lysine, methionine, serine, threonine, tryptophan, and tyrosine.","Finally, results together reveal that protein dynamics also play a central role in enzymatic catalysis, and allosteric actions operate in all three proteases, as we previously characterized on the dynamics of the transmembrane Eph receptor on different time scales (Qin et al., 2012 (Qin et al., , 2015 Huan et al., 2013) . Therefore, it is promising and feasible to discover/design molecules that allosterically inhibit three enzymes. Indeed, two categories of natural products extensively existing in edible plants have been successfully identified to allosterically inhibit the Zika and Dengue protease by binding to a pocket on the back of the active site. This result may bear significant implications in further design of therapeutic inhibitors particularly for the Flavivirus proteases because they have relatively flat active sites and general preference for positively charged amino acids in peptides and peptidomimetics.","In this study, an accelerated FEP-ABFE based virtual screening strategy with bioassay validation is introduced as a rapid protocol to accurately discover anti-COVID-19 proteinase Mpro inhibitors. The Clinical trial (ChiCTR2000030055) was registered. As a result, we has finished its first-round clinical trials including 31 patients with COVID-19 and it demonstrated markedly improved clinical outcomes.","The clinical potential of microarray technology is enormous. Global transcriptional analyses have been used to identify pathogens, to discover new pathogens, to predict antimicrobial susceptibility, and to determine a host's \"gene expression signature\" in attempts to define markers of disease severity and/or prognosis. While an in-depth review of each of these applications is well beyond the scope of this perspective, an example of how this technology applies to each of these areas is offered.","Sequential pattern mining (SPM) refers to discover the subsequences (also known as patterns) that satisfy the threshold from given sequences [1, 2, 3] .","January 2020 from China. In addition, infection cases have been reported from Thailand, Australia, Malaysia, Singapore, France, Japan, South Korea, the United States, Vietnam, Canada and Nepal, indicating that the disease is a potential threat to the global health. 3 Sadly, the number is still growing rapidly and no drug has been approved to be effective. Therefore, it is urgent to discover and develop drugs to cure the disease.","Because the host inflammatory response during URI plays a central role in the pathogenesis of AOM, it could be hypothesized that the use of potent anti-inflammatory agents, such as corticosteroids, might suppress the inflammatory process and prevent the development of AOM as a complication. In an experimental study of rhinovirus infection in adults, glucocorticoids were shown to reduce inflammation in the nasopharynx during the first days of the infection. 18 We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to assess whether fluticasone propionate (FP) administered intranasally early during the course of URI would prevent the development of AOM in children. Furthermore, to discover Asthma, rhinitis, other respiratory diseases Intranasal fluticasone propionate does not prevent acute otitis media during viral upper respiratory infection in children potential differences in the effect of FP between different viral infections, we used extensive methods to determine the specific viral cause of the URIs.","Evolutionary models and phylogenetic analysis deserve attention for helping estimate genetic variability and the evolutionary rate so that in turn to provide important implications for disease progression, drug trial and vaccine development. Zhou et al. 2 report the full-length genome sequences acquired from patients at the early outbreak are almost identical to each other and shared 79.5% sequence similar to SARS-CoV. In addition, 2019-nCoV is 96% 8 identical at the whole genome level to a bat coronavirus. Wu et al. 1 almost simultaneously and independently discover the novel RNA virus from the family Coronaviridae. Phylogenetic analysis of the complete viral genome reveals that the coronavirus is most closely related (89.1% nucleotide similarity) to a group of SARS-like coronaviruses previously sampled from bats in China. Benvenuto et al. 9 ","We hypothesize that disruption of the viral SARS-CoV-2-RBD-host ACE2 interaction with 72 peptide-based binders will prevent virus entry into human cells, offering a novel opportunity for 73 therapeutic intervention. Toward this aim, we launched a campaign to rapidly discover peptide 74 binders to SARS-CoV-2-RBD. Analyzing the RBD-ACE2 co-crystal structure, we found that 75 SARS-CoV-2-RBD/ACE2 interface spans a large elongated surface area, as is common for PPIs. 76 .

It is made available under a The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https: //doi.org/10.1101 //doi.org/10. /2020 We leveraged molecular dynamic simulations and automated fast-flow peptide synthesis [11] to 77 prepare a 23-mer peptide binder (SBP1) to SARS-CoV-2-RBD, the sequence of which was 78 derived from the ACE2 \u03b11 helix. Using bio-layer interferometry, we determined that SBP1 binds 79 SARS-CoV-2-RBD with low nanomolar affinity (dissociation constant, K D = 47 nM). SBP1 is a 80 first-in-class peptide binder to SARS-CoV-2-RBD, potentially inhibiting entry of the virus into 81 human cells. In addition, the human protein-derived sequence of SBP1 is fully proteinogenic, and 82","To discover patterns of gene expression, the values associated with each gene feature f were translated so that their means were zero. Similar genes, whose translated gene-features exhibited same induction-repression pattern, were grouped together. Genes gi, gj were said to be similar if they satisfied the following condition:","Unfortunately, given that the clinical manifestations of SARS do not allow ready distinction from other common respiratory viral infections, the diagnosis of SARS may become more difficult as epidemiological links with travel to selected areas diminish over time. Rapid and accurate diagnostic tools will be critical in the management of this epidemic. Once these tools are available, we may discover, as we did with HIV, that there are indeed many more persons who are infected yet do not manifest the illness-in other words, hospitalized patients may represent just the 'tip of the iceberg'.","In his presentation \"From genomics to new interventions for tuberculosis and leprosy\", Stewart Cole (Global Health Institute, Lausanne, Switzerland) reminded the audience about the high disease burden of tuberculosis and leprosy, which are characterized by a very low amount of genetic diversity encountered in the two corresponding pathogens, M. tuberculosis and Mycobacterium leprae. S. Cole illustrated how pioneering studies in tuberculosis genomics shed light on the biology, pathogenesis and epidemiology of TB. He also discussed how the promise of genomics for discovery of novel drug targets met unanticipated challenges. On the other hand, genome sequencing brought novel ways to rapidly discover cellular targets of old or redesigned drugs. Finally, S. Cole demonstrated the power of combining genomics and more conventional typing approaches such as MLVA to decipher the phylogeography of an old scourge, leprosy, and to demonstrate that populations of armadillos from America represent a reservoir of the disease bacillus.","Together, these results suggest that testing mildly symptomatic, or asymptomatic, individuals using a group testing approach will discover the same number of cases using the same number or fewer tests, albeit in a population with much lower prevalence. This enables large numbers of lower-risk individuals to be tested, either from mild symptomatic individuals or contact tracing, which in turn empowers behavioral change.","Ren et al 9 reported the clinical manifestations of the infection caused by the novel bat-origin of the human-infected coronavirus, including its potential lethality. On January 24, 2020, Huang et al 10 reported in The Lancet on the epidemiologic, clinical, laboratory, and radiologic characteristics, as well as treatment and outcomes, of the virus. An understanding of the clinical features will help clinicians to recognize the infected patients and minimize the risk of exposure to others. It was inferred that the target cells might be in the lower airway, due to features of presentation such as the lack of prominent upper respiratory tract signs and symptoms and the ground-glass opacities on chest CT images. Older male subjects with comorbidities have been reported to have more severe and even fatal respiratory diseases. 11 Additional studies will help in assessing for host risk factors for disease severity and mortality. Laboratory evaluation has found lymphopenia in 63% of patients and a cytokine storm profile in those who are critically ill. The combination of viral replication in the lower respiratory tract and an aberrant immune response may have an impact on the severity of illness, similar to what has been proven in SARS and MERS. 10 Translational research may discover biomarkers and other cofactor triggers in infected patients with different risk stratification.","However, proteomic and peptide-based techniques have evolved in recent years to simplify the search for biomarkers. Peptide-based technologies provide new opportunities for the detection of low-molecular-weight protein biomarkers (peptides) by MS. Improvements in peptide-based research are based on separation of peptides and/or proteins by their physicochemical properties in combination with mass spectrometric detection and identification using sophisticated bioinformatics tools for data analysis. Therefore, peptide-based technologies offer an opportunity to discover novel biomarkers for diagnosis and management of disease including prognosis, treatment decision, and monitoring response to therapy.","The cause of SARS was identified with remarkable speed. In March, 2003, a novel coronavirus, now called SARS-CoV, was discovered in patients with cases of SARS. By April, there was strong evidence that this virus caused the disease (Ksiazek et al., 2003) . Moreover, by May, investigators had sequenced the complete genome of SARS-CoV, showing that it is not closely related to previously characterised coronaviruses (Rota et al., 2003) . Thus in a matter of months medical researchers managed to discover the plausible cause of the new disease. The medical theory here is: SARS is caused by the virus SARS-CoV. Let us now look at this theory as a kind of mental representation.","Recent reports indicate that human immunodeficiency virus protease inhibitors (lopinavir and ritonavir), an anti-psychotic drug (promazine), and an anti-parasitic drug (niclosamide) are effective inhibitors of SARS-CoV infection by inhibiting the SARS-CoV main proteinase Wu et al., 2004a; Zhang and Yap, 2004) . Natural products, such as glycyrrhizin, baicalin, reserpine, luteolin, ginsenoside-Rb1 and aescin, also abolished SARS-CoV production in vitro; however, the antiviral mechanisms of these compounds remained unclear Cinatl et al., 2003a; Wu et al., 2004b; Yi et al., 2004) . One of the logical targets of the viral life cycle to inhibit SARS-CoV replication is the step following entry of the infectious virion into the host cell. To discover inhibitors at this stage, we established a biotinylated enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to evaluate the inhibitory effects of Chinese medicinal herbs on the S protein and ACE2 interaction. Herein we reported the finding that emodin, the likely active component from Rheum officinale and Polygonum multiflorum, blocked both the binding of S protein to ACE2 and the infectivity of S protein-pseudotyped retrovirus to Vero E6 cells.","To discover the evolutionary history of the viruses, we analyzed the genomes of 2019-nCoVs, compared their variations in both nucleotide and amino acid sequence levels, and determined their molecular clock related characteristics such as the nucleotide substitution rate and the most recent common ancestor. We tried to explore the origin and evolution mechanism of the viruses causing the epidemic, and to provide theoretical basis for early warning of similar events caused by \u03b2 -CoVs in the future.","Great efforts from various research groups have been done to discover new agents from several databases by targeting the target Mpro via several virtual screening strategy, 5, 6 which consists of pharmacophore, molecule docking, and molecular simulations approaches. As a result, six drugs inhibited Mpro with IC50 values ranging from 0.67 to 21.4 \u03bcM. 5 These drug design methods contributed considerably to the lead discovery, but the computational accuracy and efficiency need to be improved especially when dealing with emergency situations such as the COVID-19 outbreak. Free energy perturbation (FEP) method is a promising method with satisfactory accuracy [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] , but their actual applications to drug design are still limited to simulate minor structural changes of the ligands, thus predicting the relative binding free energy (RBFE). 7, 14 In order to perform virtual screening of a large molecule database, the absolute binding free energy (ABFE) calculation must be performed for each ligand without using of a reference ligand structure. The FEP approach has an advantage in predicting the affinities more precisely between drugs and their targets than conventional methods, such as pharmacophore, molecule docking, and molecular simulations. However, the FEP-ABFE approaches are extremely expensive/time-consumpting and therefore not used for virtual screening purpose. 15, 16 To accelerate the discovery of Mpro inhibitors from the small molecule database to combat COVID-19, we represent a newly derived FEP-ABFE-accelerated screening strategy together with bioassay validation to rapidly reposition potential agents against COVID-19 by targeting viral proteinase Mpro.","The outbreak of atypical pneumonia, referred to as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) was first identified in Guangdong Province, China, and spread to several countries later Ksiazek et al., 2003; Lee et al., 2003; Peiris et al., 2003; Poutanen et al., 2003; Tsang et al., 2003) . A novel coronavirus was isolated and found to be the cause of SARS. Although SARS has been under control, some scattering cases infected by SARS-CoVs were reported. No effective drugs are currently available to cure this disease. Gaining insight into the phylogenetic relationships among coronaviruses would be helpful to discover drugs and develop vaccines against the virus.","Although RT-PCR was regarded the most accurate examinations for COVID-19, the sensitivity was limited. RT-PCR postive rate was 63.5%, the first test was 46.7%, and the second test was 11.2%.Comparing with PCR , almost all patients had been discover lesions in the chest CT scans, 32 (15.3%)patients displayed unilateral pneumonia, 136 (69.0%)patients displayed bilateral pneumonia, and only 25(12.7%) patients displayed multiple monttling and ground-glass opcity(Table 4, Figure 2 ).","We have presented a systematic and quantitative approach to discover human disease comorbidities using different sources of available mRNA expression, protein-protein interactions, signalling pathways, disease\u2013gene associations, disease\u2013disease associations and disease\u2013drug associations data. It has been shown that SARS coronavirus infects and replicates in a wide variety of host cells in susceptible animals and human beings [55, 56]. To understand the host response to this pathogen, we analysed the gene expression patterns of SARS infected patients, compared to normal subjects using oligo-nucleotide microarrays from the NCBI GEO ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE1739) [55]. We analysed the microarray gene expression data of over 8,700 genes from the PBMCs of 10 SARS patients, and compared with healthy control samples. We found that 274 genes (p &lt; 0.01, &gt; 1.5 fold change) were differentially expressed as compared to healthy controls in which 120 genes were significantly up regulated and 154 genes were significantly down regulated (see Additional file 1: Table S1).","[10-12]. Medicinal plants, especially those employed in traditional Chinese medicine, have 59 attracted significant attention because they include bioactive compounds that could be used to 60 develop formal drugs against several diseases with no or minimal side-effects [13] . Therefore, 61 the present study was conducted to obtain structural insight into the SARS-CoV-2 3CL pro and to 62 discover potent anti-COVID-19 natural compounds. Whole-genome sequences of all available SARS-CoV-2 isolates available till January 31, 2020, 67","Invasive fungal infections (IFIs) have become a major cause of increased morbidity and mortality in immunocompromised patients. While a number of new antifungals have been lately introduced in the fight against opportunistic fungi, patients with these generally devastating diseases have had very dismal prognosis partly due to the late diagnosis of IFIs. Historically, microscopic examinations of body fluids or tissue biopsies as well as culture of the material on appropriate culture media have been the principal modalities for diagnosis of IFIs. High resolution CT scans serially performed have been proven to be sensitive tool of diagnosis of fungal pneumonias in haematological patients. Lung densities with halo sign and central cavitation of small nodules with air crescent formation can be found in adult patients and they are very useful signs of invasive aspergillosis (IA). Recently, novel diagnostic methods both serological and molecular have been developed and evaluated as well as improved culturing techniques. Identification now is performed more accurately to the species level with the use of automated methods and genetic sequencing. Evaluation of susceptibility of clinical fungal isolates to antifungal drugs is also more widespread and more standardized. Correlation between in vitro and in vivo effectiveness has been achieved at least in the case of Candida infections. Among serological methods, galactomannan assay has become very helpful in the early diagnosis of IA and its sequential performance in high-risk patients has been shown to help. Its use is still problematic in young pediatric patients in whom the assay has given low specificity with a high number of false positive results as well as low sensitivity in certain cases such as chronic granulomatous disease. Evaluation of galactomannan in body fluids other than blood is also feasible and provides important information; it needs, however, further standardization. b-glucan is another metabolite that is increased in serum of patients with fungal infections and specifically with invasive candidiasis. It is being under intense study. Detection of nucleic acids of fungi by the use of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is a powerful method for rapid identification of fungi; this method, however, needs further development and standardization before it is widely applied in the clinical microbiology lab. These techniques coupled with enhanced radiology are expected to enable the physician to diagnose serious fungal infections earlier in their course increasing the chance for an improved outcome. Almost 150 years after its first description by Gustave Landry, the Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndromes (GBS) are the leading cause of acute autoimmune neuromuscular paralysis worldwide. Major advances have been made in recent years unravelling the pathophysiological mechanisms of GBS. Overall, approx. 60% of the cases was preceded by infections, mostly flu-like infections or gastroenteritis caused by Campylobacter jejuni. The discovery of ganglioside mimics on microbial glycans has been quintessential and human as well as animal studies now support an important role for molecular mimicry in the pathogenesis of GBS. Evidence is accumulating that genetic polymorphism of C. jejuni determines the anti-ganglioside antibody reactivity and the clinical presentation of GBS. Genes involved in the synthesis and transfer of sialic acid appear to play a crucial role. In mice, injection of wild type GBS strains induces anti-ganglioside antibodies whereas Cst-II knockout mutants do not. Acute motor axonal neuropathy (AMAN) and Fisher's syndrome in particular, have been associated with anti-GM1/GD1a and anti-GQ1b antibodies, respectively. B-cell tolerance may explain the fact that most C.jejuni infections are not followed by GBS, although the mechanism is still poorly understood. Being carbohydrates, human gangliosides elicit a T-cell-independent humoral response. However, for reasons not specified here, T-cells also are likely to play an important role in the pathogenesis of GBS but their role is not clear yet. Recent attempts to identify human immunosusceptibility factors have been unsuccessful. Further research is clearly needed in order to discover new treatment modalities. Recent developments in the biosynthesis surface-bound ganglioside derivatives may open new avenues for novel and specific diagnostic and therapeutic approaches.","Despite great advances in management and preventative approaches, pneumonia still remains a major burden of mortality and morbidity in young children and the elderly, especially in the developing and under-developed countries. Prevention by means of vaccination is critical for reducing pneumonia mortality in children &lt;5 years of age, and an effective antibiotic therapy is important for the elderly. The widespread emergence of antimicrobial resistance is a well-recognized cause of the ineffectiveness of the large number of the currently used antimicrobials. Although numerous efforts have been made to combat this, newer targets need to be identified for the generation of the next level of effective antimicrobials. In addition, a complete understanding of the various aspects of drug resistance in microbes is essential to assist us in designing better targets and help us discover new antibacterial drugs. In the near future, the next challenge will be to identify newer agents for the treatment of multidrug resistant pathogens which are emerging at a rapid rate. The constant and unpredictable nature of pneumococcal pathogens can outpace technological and drug development strategies. Therefore, it is critical for researchers, pharmaceutical companies, and governments and other funding bodies to continue making progress in developing new strategies and antimicrobials towards respiratory infections, including pneumonia.","In order to discover highly mutated viruses and unknown pathogens, we subsequently developed a userfriendly multiplex-PCR-based metagenomic method. In this method, random hexamer-adapters were used to amplify DNA or cDNA targets in a multiplex PCR reaction. The large amounts of non-specific amplification products were removed by using Paragon Genomics' proprietary background removing reagent, thus resolving a library suitable for sequencing. For RNA samples, our reverse transcription reagents were additionally used to convert RNA into cDNA, resulting in significantly reduced amount of human ribosomal RNA species.","is the (which was not peer-reviewed) The copyright holder for this preprint . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03. 19.20026245 doi: medRxiv preprint to at least eight contacts 19 . Therefore, C-1 and C-29 were considered as the super-spreaders because each of them passed the infection of SARS-CoV-2 on to at least eleven contacts. Since super-spreading events were associated with the outbreaks of SARS and MERS [19] [20] [21] [22] , it would be not a surprise to discover super-spreading events associated with COVID-19.","DNA microarrays are also emerging as an important tool in metagenomics [2,16-18]. Particularly in applications concerned with real-time identification of known or related species, microarrays provide a practical high-throughput alternative to costly and time-consuming cloning and repetitive sequencing. For example, as previously reported, DNA microarrays have successfully been used to detect known viruses [19-22] and to discover a novel human viral pathogen [23]. Other metagenomic applications in which microarrays have great potential include monitoring food and water quality [24], tracking bioremediation progress [2,25], and assessment of biologic threat [26].","More than 70% of the emerging infectious disease agents are caused by microbes jumping from animals into human. This has been well exemplified by the highly fatal human infection due to avian influenza A H5N1 in 1997 [1]. The outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) caused by a novel coronavirus in 2003 [2], confirmed again that microbes can jump species from animals to humans with unpredictable consequence. The human SARS coronavirus was traced to caged civets in the market [3], and later Chinese horseshoe bat, Rhinolophus sinicus, was suggested to be a likely reservoir of SARS coronavirus [4]. Bats are ideal incubators for new emerging infectious agents as they are mammals which roosted together and can fly over vast geographical distance [5]. This has reignited the interest in seeking for new bat viruses including many bat coronaviruses and the recent discovery of bat influenza virus [6]. Besides the SARS coronavirus, viruses in bats often infect human through intermediate hosts such as horses for Hendra virus, pigs for Nipah virus, and chimpanzees for Ebola virus [5]. It is therefore important to catalogue as comprehensively as possible the animal viruses present in wild life especially the bats and birds, the food animals such as pigs and cattles, the pet animals such as cats and dogs, and monkeys which are phylogenetically close to humans. Using consensus primer polymerase chain reaction (PCR) screening, we have been able to discover relatively closely related species of virus in many different animals [4], [7]\u2013[23]. However more distant or novel families of virus can only be found by metagnenomics using deep sequencing with the newer generation sequencers [24],[25]. We report in this paper the discovery and characterization of a novel bat papillomavirus (PV) from rectal swab samples randomly collected from asymptomatic wild, food and pet animals using a metagenomic approach.","Importantly, the predicted epitopes for SARS-CoV spike RBD show a good degree of overlap with the epitopes mapped for neutralizing Ab 80R 16 , S230 17 and m396 18 , providing a relevant validation of our approach. However, in spite of the high degree of structural similarity between the two spike proteins, these mAbs failed to bind SARS-CoV-2 RBD, probably due to the low degree of sequence conservation in the regions contacted by these antibodies. The fact that most of the SARS-CoVdirected mAbs are not reactive against the novel betacoronavirus once more highlights the need to discover specific epitopes in SARS-CoV-2.","and detailed strategy for further optimizing the alchemical pathway for calculating \u2206A annihilation are given in SI section S4.After all the above efforts, the FEP-ABFE can be accurately calculated by using just 16 \u03bb values which need only 38 % computation resources compared with the reported FEP protocols, and the calculation is accelerated by more than 2.5 times. With such acceleration, FEP-ABFE calculation was first made possible to be applied in virtual screening to rapidly discover inhibitors against the coronavirus COVID-19. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.23.004580 doi: bioRxiv preprint","LSR of protein sequences represents each amino acid by a letter of twenty different letters such as A, R, N, D, C, Q, E, G, H, I, L, K, M, F, P, S, T, W, Y, and V. Although protein sequences and DNA sequences belong to symbolic sequences, the methods for the graphical representation of protein sequences are relatively less popular, compared with DNA sequences. The key reason is that the extension of DNA graphical representation to protein sequences enormously increases the number of possible alternative assignments for these 20 amino acids. The amino acid sequence is the key to discover protein structure and function in the cell, so analysis of amino acid sequences is a very important part of postgenomic studies. The graphical representation study of protein sequences emerged very recently. The first visualization protein model was proposed by Randi\u0107 et al. until 2004 [19]. Some researchers have studied on graphical representation of protein sequences from different perspectives [20\u201329].","In 2001, for the first time, Gandsas and Montgomery 16 in the United States, using the wireless application protocol (WAP), connected to a laptop using the Internet to obtain telemedicine data including blood pressure, pulse, breathing frequency, moisture, oxygen saturation, and electrocardiograms, in ''anytime and anywhere.\" This technology was mainly implemented through the cell digital packet data (CDPD) of digital cell phones to achieve highspeed transmission of data, anytime and anyp lace (up to 19,200 bps). In the 21st century, with the combination of wireless sensors and Internet technology, clinicians have been able to apply this convenient and more accurate measurement technology for the observation and prevention of disease. For example, in a highrisk population with congestive heart failure, the use of a wireless cardiopulmonary monitoring system can discover early signs of Chen-Shi breathing. 17 "],"title":["A Novel
