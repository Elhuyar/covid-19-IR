In the developing world, the problem is even more acute, as respiratory tract infections are the leading cause of death in children outside of the neonatal period. Streptococcus pneumoniae is the leading bacterial cause of pneumonia, sepsis, otitis media, and meningitis and accounts for a significant portion of this mortality. Influenza is also a major contributor, both as a primary infection and by interacting with bacterial pathogens to increase the incidence and severity of pneumonia. While the pneumococcus is the most common secondary pathogen following influenza in typical inter-pandemic years, affecting mainly the young and the frail elderly, Staphylococcus aureus is seen more commonly when highly virulent viral strains circulate, and has been emerging in recent years as a cause of necrotising pneumonia as a co-pathogen with influenza in healthy children and young adults. Our laboratory studies the mechanisms that underlie the interactions between respiratory viruses such as influenza virus and bacterial pathogens such as S. pneumoniae and S. aureus. The approach we have taken is to isolate specific virulence factors in the virus or bacterium and use genetic approaches to modify or delete them, allowing assessment of their impact in relevant animal models. Certain themes of cooperation between pathogens have emerged from this analysis, giving us insight into specific pathogenic mechanisms and revealing how these differ for different viral-bacterial pairs, or between different strains of one of the pathogens. These findings in the laboratory can then be related back to the epidemiology of co-infections in humans, helping define the challenges we face in moderating morbidity and mortality from these pathogens. The ultimate goal of this work is to apply this knowledge to facilitate treatment and prevention of these common diseases by targeting the cooperative interactions that make co-infections so deadly.","Coronaviruses (CoVs) were first identified during the 1960s by using electron microscopy to visualize the distinctive spike glycoprotein projections on the surface of enveloped virus particles. It was quickly recognized that CoV infections are quite common, and that they are responsible for seasonal or local epidemics of respiratory and gastrointestinal disease in a variety of animals. CoVs have been named according to the species from which they were isolated and the disease associated with the viral infection. Avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) infects chickens, causing respiratory infection, decreased egg production, and mortality in young birds. Bovine coronavirus (BCoV) causes respiratory and gastrointestinal disease in cattle. Porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) and porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) cause gastroenteritis in pigs. These CoV infections can be fatal in young animals. Feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) and canine coronavirus (CCoV) can cause severe disease in cats and dogs. Depending on the strain of the virus and the site of infection, the murine CoV mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) can cause hepatitis or a demyelinating disease similar to multiple sclerosis. CoVs also infect humans. Human coronaviruses (HCoVs) 229e and OC43 are detected worldwide and are estimated to be responsible for 5-30% of common colds and mild gastroenteritis. Interestingly, HCoV-OC43 and BCoV share considerable sequence similarity, indicating a likely transmission across species (either from cows to humans or vice versa) and then adaptation of the virus to its host. In contrast to the relatively mild infections caused by HCoV-229e and HCoV-OC43, the CoV responsible for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV) causes atypical pneumonia with a 10% mortality rate. Two additional HCoVs, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1, were identified using molecular methods and are associated with upper and lower respiratory tract infections in children, and elderly and immunosuppressed patients. Most recently, a coronavirus likely endemic in the camel population has been associated with Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) in humans. MERS-CoV can cause a lethal respiratory disease and renal syndrome, and mortality is highest in older individuals with co-morbidities such as diabetes or immunosuppression. CoVs are grouped according to sequence similarity as alpha-, beta, gamma or deltacoronaviruses (see www.viprbrc.org for a complete list of reference genomes for coronaviruses).","is the (which was not peer-reviewed) The copyright holder for this preprint . It is worth noting that the risks associated with cancer are based on small samples: aside from the two studies above (which included a total of 28 patients with cancer), the original dataset included only 107 patients with cancer. In contrast, the data on increased risk in older patients is much more robust, although the existing models do not adequately distinguish between risk due to age and that due to increased presence of co-morbidities in older patients.","Establishing causation between viruses detected in respiratory specimens and the clinical illness is sometimes difficult, because (1) detection of some agents (e.g., picornaviruses) in the upper respiratory tract may indicate asymptomatic or mild infection, (2) upper respiratory tract samples may be negative despite positive lower respiratory tract ones, and (3) secondary bacterial and less often fungal infections are commonly co-identified [1]. However, it is generally believed that most respiratory viruses by themselves can cause severe illness, especially so in the elderly, persons with co-morbidities (particularly immunosuppression), and occasionally in previously healthy persons, in addition to predisposing to secondary infections [2].","BSAAs could also serve as treatment of other co-morbidities, therefore, simplifying the therapy and lowering its cost (Table S1 ). For example, the concomitant actions of ezetimibe and statins could be beneficial for treatment of both hypertension and several viral infections in patients with these co-morbidities (NCT00908011, NCT00099684, NCT00843661, NCT03490097, NCT00994773, NCT00441493).","BSAAs could also serve as treatment of other co-morbidities, therefore, simplifying the therapy and lowering its cost (Table S1 ). For example, the concomitant actions of ezetimibe and statins could be beneficial for treatment of both hypertension and several viral infections in patients with these co-morbidities (NCT00908011, NCT00099684, NCT00843661, NCT03490097, NCT00994773, NCT00441493).","The factors that mediate susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infections are poorly understood. We speculate that the increased expression of ACE2 in the lungs of smokers could partially contribute to the severe cases of COVID-19 that have been observed in this population. In support of this hypothesis, mice that were engineered to express high levels of human ACE2 succumbed to infections with a related coronavirus more quickly than mice that expressed low levels of human ACE2 9 . Nonetheless, the relevance of increased ACE2 expression as a driver of disease susceptibility in humans or for SARS-CoV-2 remains to be demonstrated. Chronic smokers may exhibit a number of co-morbidities, including emphysema, atherosclerosis, and decreased immune function 86 , that are also likely to affect COVID-19 progression. While the effects of smoking can last for years, smoking cessation causes an improvement in lung function and an overall decrease in disease burden 86 . Interestingly, quitting smoking also leads to a normalization of respiratory epithelial architecture 87 , a decrease in hyperplasia 88 , and a downregulation of ACE2 levels. Thus, for multiple reasons, smoking cessation could eventually lessen the risks associated with SARS-CoV-2 infections.","There are not yet any clear models to guide risk predictions in patients infected with COVID-19. One report by the Centres for Disease Control in China provided numbers of patients and fatalities divided by age, and by comorbidities. However, there was no cross-tabulation of factors, and so it is not clear how many patients in each age group had each comorbdity, nor how the risks associated with those co-morbidities interact with each other 3 . There is one small series of 18 patients with cancer, which suggests higher risks of intubation or death, but it is so small it difficult to draw robust conclusions, and the authors' conclusions have been criticised 4 . One other study suggests patients with a history of cancer have a higher risk of becoming infected with COVID. The data from CDC China have been used to simulate a population and then develop a risk model based on that simulated population 5 ; Although a useful step, it almost certainly leads to \"double counting\" of risk (i.e. the increased risk of death in older patients and in those with hypertension is related, as hypertension is commoner in the elderly). Data from patients admitted to hospital show an increased risk of death in older patients 6 .","The devastating marks left by infectious diseases on human race are much similar to that caused by famine and war [1] . Majority of the infectious diseases are caused by viruses, bacteria or fungi. Coronaviruses are a family of viruses responsible for causing diseases ranging from mild infection to death causing diseases such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). Since the advent of the 21 st century, there has been a surge in the discovery of new coronaviruses such as SARS Co-V, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-HKU1 etc. [2] . The detailed medical analysis on the death of a 60-year-old man in Saudi Arabia led to the discovery of a novel coronavirus [2] , which was later coined as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome CoronaVirus (MERS Co-V). The incubation period associated with the viral infection ranges from 2 to 14 days. The mortality rate associated with MERS Co-V is over 30% [3] . MERS Co-V is a zoonotic virus wherein human beings may get infected due to direct or indirect contact with infected animals [4] . Camels have been identified as a carrier [5] . It is believed that the MERS-CoV is transmitted to humans from camels through respiratory droplet, saliva, or consuming undercooked camel meat or milk. Using viral genome sequencing, the zoonotic nature of the virus was confirmed [6] . MERS Co-V RNA was detected in nasal swab of infected camels, and their antibodies were found in 70% of the positively tested camels [7] . Contact with infected people in healthcare facilities, houses and communities have also contributed to the spread of the disease [8] [9] [10] [11] . Healthcare facilities are the major source of nosocomial outbreak of the disease [12] . Studies conducted have reported that there is no pandemic risk associated with the disease acquired through contact with infected people [13] . Proper awareness of modes of transmission of the disease can help in preventing the spread of the infection. Several studies have been conducted to assess the knowledge of MERS among various sections of the society [14] [15] [16] . A recent study conducted throws light on the lack of knowledge of the general public regarding the probable epidemic nature of the disease [15] . Arabia. Acute respiratory problem along with fever, cough or shortness of breath are the most common symptoms of MERS Co-V infection. Apart from the aforementioned health problems, many people infected with the virus suffered from diarrhoea, nausea or vomiting. In a small fraction of cases, people with infection showed very mild or no symptoms. The mortality rate is comparatively high in people suffering from comorbidities [17] . People suffering from kidney problems, cancer, diabetics, respiratory problems etc. are more likely to be severely infected by the virus [12] . Rivers et al. used Poisson regression to identify the risk factors associated with death and severity of the disease. They concluded that advancing age and pre-existing diseases were the main risk factors leading to death and severe infection [18] . Ahmed employed statistical methods to determine the predictors responsible for recovery from the disease after 3 and 30 days of onset of symptoms. The study identified old age, non-healthcare workers, severe infection and hospital-acquired infection as the leading factors responsible for mortality [19] .","A larger percentage (61.5 %; 8/13) of SeasFluA/hBoV co-infections were identified in patients that were admitted to either a general ward (GW) or the intensive care unit (ICU) compared to 44.3 % (66/149) of single SeasFlu A virus infections (OR 2.5 95 % CI 0.67\u20139.34, p = 0.17). In a stratified analysis, there was a trend towards higher association between Flu A, hCoV and hBoV with increasing age, but none of these were statistically significant (Table 2). In children \u22645 years, 50 % (1/2) of SeasFluA/hCoV and 66.7 % (2/3) of SeasFluA/hBoV co-infections were admitted to a GW or ICU compared to 26.5 % (9/34) of single influenza A virus infections. Comparatively, among patients aged 24\u201345 years old, 66.7 % (2/3) with SeasFluA/hCoV co-infection were admitted either to a GW/ICU compared to 56.3 % (18/32) of those with single seasonal influenza A virus infections (OR 2.20, 95 % CI 0.46\u201310.35, p = 0.32), and 100 % (3/3) of SeasFluA/hBoV co-infections were admitted to a GW/ICU. Similarly among those aged &gt;65 years old, 75.0 % (3/4) of those with SeasFluA/hBoV co-infection were admitted to GW/ICU compared to 60.0 % (27/45) with single seasonal influenza A virus infections (OR 6.0, 95 % CI 0.46\u201376.54, p = 0.17) and 100 % (1/1) of SeasFluA/hCoV co-infection was admitted to a GW/ICU (Table 2). The lack of statistical significance was probably because most of the cells in the &gt;5\u201319,  &gt;19\u201324 and &gt;45\u201365 years age groups had zero observations; when these age groups were eliminated from the analysis, SeasFluA/hBoV co-infections was associated with a significant increase in risk of admission to GW/ICU (OR: 5.83, 95 % CI: 1.03\u201332.93, p = 0.05).","To minimize the case fatality rate in MERS-HCP and SARS-HCP, we analyzed the epidemiology about the deaths related to HCP infections. 10 fatal MERS-HCP cases from Saudi Arabia, UAE and Jordan, as well as 13 fatal SARS-HCP cases in Taiwan were included (Table 3). The mean age of fatal MERS-HCP cases was 50 (26~67), 70% of them were male, and 40% (4/10) had comorbidities. Similarly, the mean age of the fatal SARS-HCP cases was 49 (28~68), 64.29% of whom were female. 69.23% (9/13) of SARS-HCP cases had accompanying co-morbidities. We found that fatality was most often found in age 50~ groups with co-mortality in both the MERS-HCP and SARS-HCP groups respectively. Most of the fatal SARS-HCP were hired care workers (30.77% (; 4/13), or cleaners or nurses (15.38% (; 2/13). Importantly, the mean age in fatal HCP with the two infections was much older than in survivors of HCP with these infections.","The age, sex, and season distribution of patients are given in (Table 2). The majority of seasonal influenza A single infections and hCoV and hBoV co-infections were in adults &gt;19 years old. Specifically, 104/149 (69.8 %) of single seasonal influenza A virus infections were in adults &gt;19 years compared to 8/11 (72.7 %) of SeasFluA/hCoV co-infections and 9/13 (69.2 %) of SeasFluA/hBoV co-infections in adults &gt;19 years old (and these differences were not statistically significant)-Table 2. However co-infections between Flu A and other respiratory viruses were significantly higher among children &lt;5 years old (11.2 %-14/34; p = 0.03). Regarding seasonal distribution, most of both single and dual virus infections occurred during the winter season (with summer season having low virus activity). This is probably because we tested for hCoV and hBoV in samples that were positive for influenza A viruses and influenza viruses are known to circulate in high numbers mainly in winter seasons. ","Nineteen patients received convalescent plasma after three doses of pulsed methylprednisolone (plasma group); two also received additional pulsed steroids. Nine patients in the steroid group (n = 21) were given convalescent plasma subsequently after four to eight doses of pulsed methylprednisolone. Age, sex and lactate dehydrogenase levels on admission were comparable between the two groups (Table 1 ). In the plasma group, 74% of patients were discharged by day 22, compared with 19% in the steroid group (p 0.001; Table 2 ). Five people died in the steroid group, all of whom were patients who received steroids only, compared with no deaths in the plasma group (p 0.049). Nine patients in the steroid group who received In most viral illnesses, viraemia peaks in the first week of infection. The patient then develops a primary immune response by day 10-14, followed by virus clearance. Therefore, convalescent plasma should be more effective when given early in the course of the disease. In SARS, viral load also peaks in the first week [5] , and this might explain the lack of clinical effectiveness of convalescent plasma when given after day 16. There were several limitations to this study. First, it was not a randomised study and the steroid group had more co-existing morbidities. However, when the analysis was repeated after excluding patients with co-morbid illness in each group, the difference in clinical outcome remained statistically significant (p 0.004). Second, the amount of antibodies given to each patient was not standardised, which could contribute to the variable clinical outcome in patients receiving convalescent plasma. Finally, it is arguable whether the ribavirin-steroid combination was effective at all in SARS patients, and the poorer outcome in the continuing high-dose methylprednisolone group might be caused sim-ply by the deleterious effects of steroids. However, no fungal or opportunistic infections were observed in these patients.","The factors identified as influencing transmission are patient viral load and patient index distance. The ideal conditions for transmission to occur are those of an infected patient excreting large quantities of virus, presenting with a certain number of comorbidities capable of masking the initial profile, and the existence of multiple close contacts with high-risk procedures such as oro-tracheal intubation, performing a fibroscopy, or the administration of treatments through nebulizers. The idea of a ''super-excreter'' patient was also identified during recent respiratory virus epidemics. This concept could play a crucial role. Usually it concerns cases of very serious infection occurring in patients with several co-morbidities.","Since the same samples had been tested previously for the presence of RSV, PIV, and INF RNA [8], the HCoV-NL63-positive samples were analysed for co-infections with these viruses. Co-infections were apparent in 29 of the 49 HCoV-NL63-positive samples: 20 patients were co-infected with RSV-A, four with RSV-B, and five with PIV3. Double infections were observed in the hospitalised patients with HCoV-NL63 (72%) but also in the outpatients (52%). HCoV-NL63 co-infection with RSV-A occurred predominantly in the hospitalised patients (61%) rather than the outpatient group (29%). In contrast, HCoV-NL63 co-infections with PIV3 were exclusively present in the outpatient group (16%). Similar trends were also observed when looking at the overall prevalence of the viruses: RSV-A occurred in 32% of hospitalised patients versus 21% of outpatients, and PIV3 occurred in 5% of hospitalised patients and 8% of outpatients [8]. The RNA load of HCoV-NL63 differed considerably from less than 225 copies/ml (but detectable) to 9 \u00d7 107 copies/ml aspirate. Interestingly, the HCoV-NL63 load was significantly higher in samples with undetectable levels of the other viral RNAs (median viral load 2.1 \u00d7 106 copies/ml) than in samples that had co-infections with RSV or PIV3 (2.7 \u00d7 102 copies/ml, p = 0.0006; Figure 2).","Many groups have reported that the occurrence of co-infections with HCoV-NL63 and other respiratory viruses, including other human coronaviruses, influenza A virus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza virus and human metapneumovirus (hMPV), are common [26, 30, 46, 47, 51, 53, 54, 60, 61]. Also, co-infected patients are more likely to be hospitalized, indicating the severity of this kind of superinfection. In a study from Germany, RSV-A and HCoV-NL63 was the most common co-infection indentified in children less than three years of age. This is probably due to the high incidence of RSV-A in winter and the overlap in seasonality of the viruses [53]. Also, in Italy, HCoV-NL63 circulates as a mixture of variant strains and is often associated with other viral infections [30]. In South Africa, co-infection of patients with HCoV-NL63 and bocavirus in hospitalized children is reported. Nasopharyngeal and bronchoalveolar lavage samples from 341 patients were screened for common respiratory viruses, and the co-presence of HCoV-NL63 and bocavirus in at least one sample was reported [62].","Age, sex, lactate dehydrogenase level at admission, time of convalescent plasma administration and co-morbidities were analyzed to determine whether or not they were predictive of clinical outcome. Numerical data were compared using independent samples and Student\u2019s t-test, and categorical data by Fisher\u2019s exact test. Differences were considered significant at the level of P&lt;0.05. All values were expressed as mean \u00b1 standard deviation unless stated otherwise. Logistic regression analysis was performed for age, lactate dehydrogenase level, time of convalescent therapy and viral status.","It is difficult to determine the percentage of contaminated patients, symptomatic or not, who will require to be hospitalized and who will require intensive care. Ventilatory assistance is required in about 10% of the hospitalized patients, and the mortality rate in patients requiring ventilator assistance, younger than 75 years of age, without major co morbidities, is minimal. So, it is difficult to determine the number of ICU needed, but no country in the world, so far, had enough ICU beds.","The copyright holder for this preprint . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.09.20033357 doi: medRxiv preprint estimates of the probability of requiring hospitalisation assume that only severe cases clinically require hospitalisation. This is clearly different from the pattern of hospitalisation that occurred in China, where hospitalisation was also used to ensure case isolation. Mortality can also be expected to vary with the underlying health of specific populations, given that the risks associated with COVID-19 will be heavily influenced by the presence of underlying co-morbidities.","Our work has some limitations that require comments. HRV can be detected some weeks after infection and can be amplified from respiratory samples generating a suboptimal specificity. 18, 41 However, these are universal limitations present across all studies, and do not invalidate the scientific evidence showing similar results in different scenarios. In addition, a systematic search for respiratory bacterial pathogens was not carried out in our study, making possible that part of the results be explained by co-infections as it was the case in at least two patients. We believe that this factor is rather secondary because some patients had negative blood cultures and the reported frequency of viral-bacterial co-infection is not high in the literature (&lt;20%). 36 On the other hand, no viral-viral co-infection could be demonstrated in our patients making our findings unbiased by the contribution of other viral respiratory agents. The frequency of viral-viral co-infection appears to be low in adults with respiratory infections (&lt;10%). 36 Finally, the results of this work were derived from stringent criteria for severity and they do not necessarily represent cases with mild disease.","Results of the current Real Time Bayesian SIR model suggest a subcritical MERS-CoV epidemic in Saudi Arabia, as estimated by the reproductive number to be less than one. Subsequently, a self-sustaining epidemic cannot be established in humans, which would agree with the findings of other studies (Breban et al., 2013, Poletto et al., 2014). The potential outbreak of MERS-CoV in the period between March to May 2014 could be interpreted by the paucity of data about the index cases and subsequent waves of infections. Moreover, other possibilities must be included such as as seasonal variations and their correlation with zoonotic origins like infections in camels (Sharif-Yakan and Kanj, 2014). However, the low rate of daily, sporadic MERS cases diminished the possibility of zoonotic infection and indicated a more likelihood of inter-human transmissibility that is plausible with data reported elsewhere (Breban et al., 2013). The limited human-to-human transmission has been reported due to the variations of MERS-CoV receptors in the human upper and lower respiratory tract (Raj et al., 2014a, Raj et al., 2014b). Furthermore, a potentially low respiratory disease could evolve in patients lacking considerable co-morbidities (Raj et al., 2014a, Raj et al., 2014b).","The co-infection of RSV and HBoV was frequently detected among the samples, whereas these two viruses co-dominated in cold season. HBoV was the second most prevalent virus (24.5%), and the co-infection rate of HBoV with other respiratory viruses was 54.6%, compared to 14% in non-HBoV-infected patients. This was lower than the co-infection rate reported previously, which ranged up to 71%. [34] [35] [36] [37] A previous study showed that HBoV increased the severity of bronchiolitis in children less than 1-year-old co-infected with RSV, and that it is not an occasional virus. 38 However, no correlation of HBoV infection with clinical severity was observed in this and its related study. 7 One study carried out in Wuhan, China analyzed peripheral blood samples by indirect immunofluorescence to detect RSV, IAV, IBV, ADV, PIV1-3, Chlamydia pneumonia and Mycoplasma pneumonia in children ARI inpatients and used viremia as sign of severe infection. 39 It showed that 36% of cases were co-infected by multiple agents and IAV, IBV and PIV1 were associated with co-infection. In addition, studies showed up to 30% of co-infection in hospitalized children 40 and RSV co-infection was associated with clinical severity. 38, 39 However, no such correlation was found in this study. This may be due to differences in the criteria of patient enrollment and in the lower severity of clinical signs observed. Bacteria-virus co-infection was commonly found in inpatients. In our study, only polynucleosis (&gt;10,000 on absolute count) was considered as a sign of bacterial infection and was observed in 30 patients infected with a respiratory virus. Hence, future studies should focus on severe respiratory infection to identify viral determinants of disease severity and should introduce bacteriological test.","This increase in reported prevalence has been mirrored by an increase in the rates of viral co-infection (or probably more accurately, co-detection). In recent studies, two or more viral pathogens have been found in up to 44% of upper respiratory samples from young children with acute respiratory infection. 21, [41] [42] [43] [44] [45] Co-infection rates appear to vary depending on age, country and living conditions, as well as the number of pathogens tested (Table 19 .1). Some of the highest viral detection and co-infection rates have been reported in pre-school children from low-income families living in Brazil, Vietnam and Jordan. 21, 41, 42 A number of groups has suggested co-infection as a risk factor for severe disease. However, there is no real consensus in the literature supporting this premise, which is perhaps not surprising given that most of the published studies have investigated very different populations and looked for different numbers of pathogens (Table 19 .1).","Clinically, MERS-CoV causes symptoms of upper and lower RTIs [23]. The severity of symptoms varies widely. Most asymptomatic cases have been discovered through screening after contact with a known case [2]. Presenting signs and symptoms may include high-grade fever, non-productive cough, dyspnea, headache, myalgia, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea that may precede the respiratory symptoms [25], [26]. Renal failure has been frequently reported, yet no conclusive evidence of a direct viral invasion of renal tissues exists [11], [27], [28]. Notably, most patients who developed complications had coexisting medical co-morbidities [11]. Laboratory findings on admission may include leukopenia, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and elevated lactate dehydrogenase levels [25]. MERS-CoV can also cause severe pneumonia with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), requiring mechanical ventilation and intensive care admission [24]. To date, there is still a lack of surgical and pathological information from patients infected with MERS-CoV, which hampers full understanding of the pathogenesis. Lastly, co-infection with other respiratory viruses and with community-acquired bacteria has been also reported in MERS-CoV patients [11], [29], [30].","COVID-19 and TB are both respiratory diseases. It is perhaps not surprising that chronic respiratory diseases such as Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), and indeed active TB, could predispose susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2. Statistics from other reported studies, however, suggest that the frequency of these co-morbidities is much lower than that of MTB infection in this study (COPD: 1% of 1099 COVID-19 cases 12 , chronic respiratory disease: 2.4% of 72,314 COVID-19 cases 13 ). The strength of this finding, however, is limited by the relatively low number of cases involved in this study and requires further validation.","Some studies have reported that co-infections are predominantly in younger and older patients [32\u201334]. In this study, single seasonal influenza A viruses were predominantly in adults &gt;18 years old in agreement with our earlier published study [35]. Similarly a higher proportion of hCoV and hBoV co-infections were in adults 18 to 65 years old. This suggests high prevalence of hCoVs and hBoV among older patients. Comparatively the majority of other respiratory virus co-infections (RSV, RV, hMPV and hPIV1-3) were in children \u22645 years old (Table 2). Regarding seasonality of the viruses, almost all the respiratory virus single and dual infections in this study were identified in the winter season. This could be because we tested for hCoV and hBoV in samples that were positive for influenza A viruses and influenza viruses are known to circulate mainly during winter season. Our findings are in agreement with other studies [16, 36], which also reported dual or multiple respiratory virus infections mainly occur during winter season.","Results: ESBL and AmpC (+) producing microorganisms were more isolated from patients that belong to over 65-year age and 0\u22121 age groups (p:0,005). The risk factors including hospitalisation (OR:3,1; 1,19\u22128,1; p:0,018), co-morbidity (OR:2,1; 1,12\u22127,3, p:0,024), were found higher in ESBL (+) group compared to ESBL(\u2212) group. Hospitalisation at last three months was found as a risk factor for resistance to any 3rd generation cephalosporins (OR:2,4; 0,9\u22126,3; p:0,04). There was a correlation between ESBL (+) production and resistant to many antibiotics that are generally used for ampiric treatment (p &lt; 0,05, Pearson correlation r: 0,78), except for piperacillintazobactam (p &gt; 0,05). ESBL production was significantly higher in K. pneumoniae (p: 0,0005), E. cloacae (p:0,001), E. sakazakii (p:0,001) and A. baumannii (p:0,005) strains more than other Gram negative strains revealed in Table- 1. Hospitalisation was single significant risk factor for patients with MRSA (OR:1,8, 0,7\u22121,2, p:0,005; Table-1) . Vancomycin resistant Enterococcus was not isolated. Discussion: Hospitalisation and co-morbidity causing to colonisation and impairment on immunity are the most important risk factors for ESBL producing microorganisms related infections as our study revealed. Although antibiotic usage including 2nd, 3rd generation cephalosporins and quinolones was cited as a risk factor for ESBL related infections, it was not found significant statistically in our study. Piperacillin-tazobactam could be thought as an option to treat the resistant Gram negative infections associated with K. pneumoniae, E. cloacae, E. sakazakii and A. baumannii whose ESBL rates are frequently higher in our local settings but carbapenems, should be opted for serious patients with co-morbidites. Consequently, immunity and infection control programs are important factors against increasing antibiotic resistance rates. Objective: Infections in patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI) are associated with prolonged hospitalisation and adverse outcomes. The acknowledgement of the pre-disposing risk factors may help decrease the morbidity and mortality. We conducted a retrospective cohort study to determine the incidence, bacteriology and risk factors for development of infection after TBI.","Because of the absence of any natural predator the rabbits multiplied to biblical numbers, and threatened natural grasslands and agricultural crops over extensive areas of southern Australia. To control this problem, myxomatosis virus was deliberately introduced in 1950 (Fenner, 1983) . This poxvirus is transmitted mechanically by the bite of insects and is indigenous to wild rabbits in South America, in which it causes nonlethal skin tumors. However, myxomatosis virus causes an acutely lethal infection in European rabbits, and its introduction in Australia resulted in a pandemic in the rabbit population. Following the introduction of myxomatosis virus in 1950, co-evolution of both virus and host were observed. The introduced strain was highly virulent and caused epizootics with very high mortality. However, with the passage of time field isolates exhibited reduced virulence, and there was a selection for rabbits that were genetically somewhat resistant to the virus. Strains of moderate virulence probably became dominant because strains of lowest virulence were less transmissible and strains of maximum virulence killed rabbits very quickly.","Microbial aetiology of osteomyelitis of the foot in diabetic patients related hospitalization and lower-extremity amputation.Acute infections in pts who have not recently received antibiotic therapy are predominantly caused by aerobic gram-positive cocci, often as a monomicrobial infection. Although chronic wounds tend to develop polymicrobial flora. Objective: To know the microbial etiology of osteomyelitis of the foot in diabetic pts, to determine the best choice empirical antibiotics combination. Methods: Diabetic pts with osteomyelitis of the foot admitted in our unit between 2002 and 2004 were included. The infection was documented with intraoperative samples and osteomyelitis was histolopathologically prouved. Clinical and biological data were collected. Results: 87 diabetics pts (64 males, 23 females) with a median age 65 years(23-94) were included.The co-morbidities were chronic renal failure (n = 35), arteriopathy (n = 34), obesity (n = 13), alcoholism (n = 10), immunodepression (n = 10). The clinical data were fever (40%), shock (2%), local signs as erythema (90%), fistula (86%), necrosis (43%) and foul odor (54%). The median rates of neutrophils polynuclear, C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation were respectively 9.7 G/L, 131 mg/l, 82 mm. 59 pts (68%) had a polymicrobial infection.The intra-operative samples (n = 87) yieled a majority of gram positive cocci [MSSA:n = 30;MRSA:n = 15; CNS:n = 15; Streptococcus sp:n = 34; Enterococcus sp: n = 15], following with gram negative bacteria [ Pseudomonas sp: n = 12; Proteus sp: n = 11; Morganella sp: n = 11; E. coli: n = 8; Klebsiella sp: n = 6; E. cloacae: n = 6; Citrobacter sp: n = 4; Serratia sp: n = 3, others: n = 3] and anaerobes (n = 17). 10 pts had positive blood samples. S. aureus is the most frequent pathogen isolated especially in monomicrobial infections and infections with positive blood samples. Pseudomonas spp. seems to be correlated with chronic renal failure and immunodepression. No clinical data was significantly associated with a special bacteria , except necrosis and foul odor with gram negative bacteria or anaerobes. Conclusion: Our results are according with clinical studies in the literature. The major difficulty to treat osteomyelitis of diabetics foot is to well documented the infection. Selecting an appropriate antibiotic to treat is particularly important because of the prolonged duration of therapy required and potential resistance of pathogens.","This study did not find a significant association between seasonal influenza A viruses co-infection with hCoV and hBoV and severe disease. Given the high co-infection rates for bocavirus reported by other studies [3, 12], probably more bocavirus infections could have been identified if all the 3,804 samples received at the MMPL between June 2011 and June 2012 were tested. A possibility of finding more coronaviruses could also not be ruled out. A review by Schildgen et al. [3] suggested that human bocavirus may be a bystander and not a real pathogen; one of the evidence to this hypothesis being frequently identified co-infecting with other respiratory viruses, and also it is mostly identified in low copy numbers. However, the results of this study indicate a trend towards the hypothesis that hBoV co-infection might promote hospitalization especially among patients &gt;65 years old and &gt;24 \u226445 years old. Further, a number of other factors; age, comorbidities, immune status, and bacterial co-infection, affect disease outcome [37\u201339]. However in this study we did not control for these factors as the datum did not have these variables. This may have affected our outcomes and this should be born in mind when interpreting our results.","When tested, samples positive for MERS-CoV are often negative for other pathogens [2, 25, 93, 104]. However, many studies make no mention of additional testing for endemic human respiratory viruses [21, 23, 73, 105]. When viruses are sought, they have included human herpesvirus (HHV), rhinoviruses (HRV), enteroviruses (EV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenzavirus types 1, 2 and 3 (PIVs),influenzaviruses (IFVs), endemic HCoVs, adenoviruses (AdVs) metapneumovirus (MPV) and influenza A\\H1N1 virus; co-detections with MERS-CoV have been found on occasion [2, 22, 37, 69, 97]. Bacterial testing is sometimes included (for example, for Legionella and Pneumococcus) but the impact of bacterial co-presence is also unclear [22, 104\u2013106]. Further testing of the LRT sample from the first MERS case used IFA to screen for some viruses (negative for IFV, PIVs, RSV and AdVs) and RT-PCR for others (negative for AdV, EVs, MPV and HHVs) [18]. RT-PCR also detected MERS-CoV. The WHO strongly recommends testing for other respiratory pathogens [53] but with this recommendation often discounted, there are limited data to address the occurrence and impact of co-infections or alternative viral diagnoses among both MERS cases and their contacts. Little is known of other causes of MERS-like pneumonia in the KSA or of the general burden of disease due to the known classical respiratory viruses.","Hence, the nCoVs may depends on co-receptor or other auxiliary membrane proteins to facilitate its infection. It is reported that viruses tend to hijack co-expressed proteins as their host factors [9] . For example, Hoffmann et al. recently showed that 2019-nCoV-S uses ACE2 for entry and depends on the cellular protease TMPRSS2 for priming [10] , showing that 2019-nCoV infections also require multiple factors. Understanding the receptors usage by the viruses could facilitate the development of intervention strategies. Therefore, identifying the potential co-receptors or auxiliary membrane proteins for 2019-nCoV is of great significance.","The recent pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 , caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused unprecedented morbidity and mortality in almost all the continents (1) . Despite implementations of extensive control measures, spread of the disease and eventual fatality could not be effectively halted till date. The major cause of death in COVID-19 is due to virus-induced pneumonia leading to respiratory failure (2) . Epidemiological evidence suggests that older age and the associated co-morbidities such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes put patients at higher risk of mortality (3) . Thus identification of novel risk factors predictive for patients' outcome including mortality is needed.","The overall case-fatality rate was 9.6% and the terminal events were severe respiratory failure associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and multiple organ failure. Age, presence of co-morbidities, and viral load in the nasopharynx and serum during the first 5 days of illness correlated with an adverse prognosis.","The introduction of SARS-CoV-2 into the Kutupalong-Balukhali Expansion Site or any other large refugee or internally displaced persons (IDPs) camp or settlement is likely to have serious consequences and overwhelm existing health systems. Even when transmission rates were assumed to be similar to that of influenza (low scenario), the necessary hospitalization capacities far exceeded the available capacities for the refugees in the Expansion Site in most simulations. Recent experience with other infectious disease outbreaks shows that the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 will likely be more intense in contexts such as Kutupalong-Balukhali Expansion Site than in out-of-camp settings because of high population density, inadequate water and soap to maintain hygiene, limited ability to isolate infected individuals, and large household sizes. 16 The younger demographic profile of the Rohingya camp population could reduce the overall rate of severe cases as compared with China or other upper-middle and high-income countries that have older populations. After adjusting for age, we estimate the overall severe disease rate among infections in this population (3.6%) to be approximately half that estimated for China (6.6% [95% CI, 3.7-10.4]). However, it is likely that co-morbidities such as malnutrition, concomitant diseases, and poor overall health status could cause more severe outcomes among these groups, which was not captured by our model.","Next, we wanted to determine if tagged M, E and S proteins interact with each other within producer cells. For this, HF cells were co-infected with different monocistronic rBVs (coding for tagged or untagged proteins, as summarized in S1 Table) and examined for co-localization of HCoV-NL63 proteins. We observed that M-HA protein but not E-HA protein, co-localized with S protein, when co-expressed with E or M protein, respectively [Fig 2b]. This result suggests that HA tag on the E protein impairs its interaction with other proteins and thus precludes VLP formation. No co-localization could be detected for S-GFP with M or M-HA proteins (in presence of E protein), leading to conclusion that S-GFP is not incorporated into HCoV-NL63 VLPs.","HBoV infection is reported to mainly occur as a co-infection with other respiratory viruses; some zoonotic hCoV have been associated with sever lower repiratory tract infection (LRTI). However these viruses are not, at present, routinely tested in clinical settings due to a lack of knowledge on the significance of these viruses in causing severe disease. Some recent studies have indicated that respiratory virus co-infections increases disease severity [15, 16], however the pattern of co-infection between influenza A viruses and hCoV and hBoV and their association with severe disease has not been clearly elucidated. We designed primers and optimized a real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay for identification of 15 coronaviruses and used the RT-PCR targeting the NS1 region of the hBoV described by Qu et al. [17] to investigate the patterns of co-infections between influenza A virus with hCoV and hBoV and their association with severe clinical disease.","Co-infections with bacterial pathogens occur often with RVI. Co-infection with Staphylococcus aureus is common with influenza pneumonia and can be especially virulent [10]. The recent 2019 ATS/IDSA clinical practice guidelines recommend standard antibacterial therapy to be initially prescribed for adults with community-acquired pneumonia who test positive for influenza [10]. The guidelines provide details on when to consider empiric therapy for methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa and provide guidance for de-escalation of antibacterial therapy in patients with confirmed influenza [10]. Clinicians should be aware of the reports of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis in severely ill influenza patients especially those with underlying conditions or receiving corticosteroids, although up to 30% of patients with influenza-associated aspergillosis had been previously healthy [41].","High rates of co-infection with other respiratory viruses are commonly reported [85,86,95,99]. Viruses frequently associated with co-infection include enterovirus, rhinovirus and PIV [100] however reports of co-infection with two human coronaviruses are limited. Dijkman et al. recently demonstrated that HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-NL63 may elicit immunity that protects against HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-229E, respectively [101]. Clinical progression and outcomes of disease in patients presenting with co-infection are however similar to patients presenting with mono-infection [85,95]. There is also no substantial difference in coronaviral load between co-infected and mono-infected patients. No substantial difference in disease progression in co-infected versus mono-infected patients has been reported and therefore understood to have little impact; however, the role in facilitation of infection of one respiratory virus by another is still speculative [95].","Furthermore, some patients may have co-morbidities and chronic diseases such as diabetes and hypertension that we cannot account for. These factors may be affect imaging appearances. Second, due to different CT scanners and interpreting radiologists, the reported imaging features may be variable across sites. Due to the proportion of COVID-19 detected by chest CT imaging is very high, especially thin chest CT plays a huge role in assisting diagnosis and follow-up treatment in clinical application.","Co-exposed persons are defined as people who shared the same risks of exposure as a possible or confirmed case of COVID-19. Contact and co-exposure identification is done for all identified possible cases. Contacts are traced from the date of onset of clinical symptoms in a case. If the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection is confirmed in the index case, active surveillance of contacts/co-exposed persons is initiated immediately.","Phylogenetically distinct virus species or lineages have been reported co-circulating in certain bat populations [45, 46]. Under this situation, co-infections of single host cells\u2014the necessary requisite for recombination\u2014are possible. By careful sequence analysis we show that the heterologous recombination event placed the p10 gene in Ro-BatCoV GCCDC1 is genuine. Previous studies showed the existence of p10-harboring orthoreoviruses in bat populations [40, 47\u201349], such that co-infections with bat coronaviruses and hence recombination events are clearly possible. In addition, a previous study reported that mammalian orthoreovirus, a type of nonfusogenic orthoreovirus, was isolated from a SARS-CoV patient along during the in 2003 outbreak [50]. We believe that future studies should investigate co-infections in specific bat cell lines using a coronavirus similar to Ro-BatCoV GCCDC1 or Ro-BatCoV HKU9 and the relevant orthoreoviruses, from which it will be possible to reveal more of the underlying basis of heterologous coronavirus recombination.","Elderly patients with severe co morbidities are at higher risk for mortality. Children and young adults rarely have symptoms, but they can carry the virus.","Background: Aim of this study was to investigate the risk factors associated with high antibiotic resistance rates belong to Gram positive and negative organisms isolated in 2010 using epidemiological analysis. Methods: A case-control study of 72 patients with Extended Spectrum b Lactamase producing organisms and 33 patients with Amp C producing organisms, 222 patients with non-ESBL organisms and 75 patients with Gram positive organisms was conducted in a subsidial care hospital of\u00c7anakkale province. Demographics, co-morbidities, antibiotics usage were analysed for all patients.","Deaths had older median age and more co-morbidities than and survivors.","Previous studies have indicated that colonisation appears to be common in children during upper respiratory tract symptoms or infection. 3 Our pilot study was not designed to determine any associations between P. jirovecii colonisation and co-infection with respiratory viruses, but this is an important consideration for future studies. Pneumocystis jirovecii may provide an alternative aetiological diagnosis for upper respiratory tract symptoms, 3 and pathogens may co-exist and act synergistically in infection and disease. For instance, co-infection has been demonstrated to result in more severe disease caused by other","Remarkably, the study by Dr. Zhao and colleagues showed that intravenous MSC infusion could reduce the overactivation of the immune system and support repair by modulating the lung microenvironment after SARS-CoV-2 infection even in elderly patients. Intravenous infusion of MSCs typically leads to their accumulation in the lungs, where they secrete multiple paracrine factors [16]. Such factors likely played a significant role in protecting or rejuvenating alveolar epithelial cells, counteracting fibrosis, and improving lung function. MSC infusion would likely be particularly beneficial to elderly individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2, both with and without co-morbidities, as this population is more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 induced pneumonia, resulting in severe respiratory distress and death because of immunosenescence [17-20]. In summary, this study showed that intravenous infusion of MSCs is a safe and efficient approach for treating patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, including in elderly patients displaying severe pneumonia. Additional studies in a larger cohort of patients are needed to validate this therapeutic intervention further, however.","Mortality of critically ill patients of COVID-19 is high and co-morbidities including hypertension, diabetes and coronary artery disease are often present in hospitalised patients.","Results from the PRI.DE study indicated that co-infections with multiple respiratory viruses are rare (1.5% of all samples tested; [8]). In contrast, we report detection of more than one viral RNA in 59% of HCoV-NL63-positive samples, which represents 3% of the 949 samples tested. Most co-infections are with RSV-A, probably because of the high percentage of RSV-A infections and an overlap in seasonality. In the winter season the percentage of RSV-positive samples per month can exceed 50% and even the overall difference in percentage of RSV-positive samples among HCoV-NL63-negative and -positive samples was not significant (Fisher's exact test, two-tailed). This contrasts with results obtained for PIV1- and PIV3-positive patients, for whom co-infection with RSV is rarely observed (data not shown). Therefore, infection with RSV seems to reduce infection by PIV1 and PIV3 (or vice versa), but not infection by HCoV-NL63 (or vice versa).","Viruses bind to host receptors on target cell surface to establish infection. Membrane proteins mediated membrane fusion allowed the entry of enveloped viruses [3] . As recently reported, both SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV could use ACE2 protein to gain entry into the cells [4, 5] . Since the outbreak, many data analysis have showed a wide distribution of ACE2 across human tissues, including lung, liver, stomach, ileum, colon and kidney [6] , indicating that SARS-CoV-2 may infect multiple organs. However, these data showed that AT2 cell (the main target cell of SARS-CoV-2) in the lung actually expressed rather low levels of ACE2 [6] . Hence, the SARS-CoV-2 may depends on co-receptor or other auxiliary membrane proteins to facilitate its infection. It is reported that viruses tend to hijack co-expressed proteins as their host factors [7] . For example, Hoffmann et al. recently showed that SARS-CoV-2-S uses ACE2 for entry and depends on the cellular protease TMPRSS2 for priming [5] , showing that SARS-CoV-2 infections also require multiple factors. Understanding the receptors usage by the viruses could facilitate the development of intervention strategies. Therefore, identifying the potential co-receptors or auxiliary membrane proteins for SARS-CoV-2 is of great significance."],"title":["Oral presentations","Coronaviruses: Molecular Biology\u2606","Estimating the Risks from COVID-19 Infection in Adult Chemotherapy Patients","Critical care management of adults with community-acquired severe respiratory viral infection","Discovery and development of safe-in-man broad-spectrum antiviral agents","Discovery and development of safe-in-man broad-spectrum antiviral agents","Cigarette smoke triggers the expansion of a subpopulation of respiratory epithelial cells that express the SARS-CoV-2 receptor ACE2","Estimating the Risks from COVID-19 Infection in Adult Chemotherapy Patients","Main factors influencing recovery in MERS Co-V patients using machine learning","Pan-human coronavirus and human bocavirus SYBR Green and TaqMan PCR assays; use in studying influenza A viruses co-infection and risk of hospitalization","Comparative Epidemiology of Human Infections with Middle East Respiratory Syndrome and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronaviruses among Healthcare Personnel","Pan-human coronavirus and human bocavirus SYBR Green and TaqMan PCR assays; use in studying influenza A viruses co-infection and risk of hospitalization","Retrospective comparison of convalescent plasma with continuing high-dose methylprednisolone treatment in SARS patients","Need for integrative thinking to fight against emerging infectious diseases.

The high mortality rate associated with this disease has been a major cause of concern. This paper aims at identifying the major factors influencing MERS recovery in KSA. Methods The data used for analysis was collected from the Ministry of Health website, KSA. The important factors impelling the recovery are found using machine learning. Machine learning models such as support vector machine, conditional inference tree, na\u00efve Bayes and J48 are modelled to identify the important factors. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis is also carried out to identify the significant factors statistically. Result The main factors influencing MERS recovery rate are identified as age, pre-existing diseases, severity of disease and whether the patient is a healthcare worker or not. In spit...","Abstract Ever since the first case was reported at the end of 2019, the SARS-COV-2 virus and associated lung disease COVID-19 has spread throughout the world and has become a pandemic. In particular, the high transmission rate of the virus has made it a threat to public health globally. Currently, there is no proven effective therapy against the virus, and the impact on other diseases is also uncertain, especially inherited arrhythmia syndrome. Arrhythmogenic effect of COVID-19 can be expected, potentially contributing to disease outcome. This may be of importance for patients with an increased risk for cardiac arrhythmias, either secondary to acquired conditions or co-morbidities or consequent to inherited syndromes. Management of patients with inherited arrhythmia syndromes such as Long QT syndrome, Brugada syndrome, Short QT syndrome and Catecholaminergic Polymorphic Ventricular Tachycardia in the setting of the COVID-19 pandemic may prove particularly challenging. Depending on the ...","Abstract Background and Aims Multiple issues in management of COVID have emerged, but confusion persists regarding rational interpretation. Aim of this brief review is to review these issues based on current literature. Methods This is a narrative review with Pubmed and Google Scholar search till 23 March 2020. Search terms were, COVID-19, treatment of coronavirus, COVID 19 and following terms; chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, ibuprofen, ACE-inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers, cardiovascular disease, diarrhoea, liver, testis and gastrointestinal disease. Results We discuss evidence regarding role of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine in treatment and prophylaxis, use of inhibitors of the renin angiotensin system, safety of ibuprofen, unusual clinical features like gastrointestinal symptoms and interpretation of tests for cardiac enzymes and biomarkers. Conclusions While our conclusions on management of COVID-19 patients with co-morbidities are based on current evidence, howeve...","Importance: Risk factors associated with COVID-19, the viral pneumonia originating in Wuhan, China, in Dec 2019, require clarification so that medical resources can be prioritized for those at highest risk of severe COVID-19 complications. Infection with M. tuberculosis (MTB), the pathogen that causes TB and latently infects ~25% of the global population, may be a risk factor for SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe COVID-19 pneumonia. Objective: To determine if latent or active TB increase susceptibility to SARS-COV-19 infection and disease severity, and lead to more rapid development of COVID-19 pneumonia. Design: An observational case-control study of 36 confirmed COVID-19 cases from Shenyang, China, conducted in Feb 2020. Final date of follow-up: Feb 29, 2020. Cases were grouped according to COVID-19 pneumonia severity (mild/moderate, severe/critical), and MTB infection status compared. Comparisons were made with MTB infection data from another case-control study on bacterial/viral pneu...","Lower respiratory tract symptoms during seasonal coronavirus infections in children are associated with RSV co-detection and increased levels of Haemophilus and Fusobacterium species.","BACKGROUND: The ORF6 protein is one of the eight accessory proteins of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV). Numerous properties of ORF6 have been documented and this study focuses on two of these, namely, its ability to suppress the expression of co-transfected expression constructs and its subcellular localization to vesicular structures. RESULTS: Using a transient transfection system, ORF6's ability to suppress the expression of co-transfected expression constructs was measured in a quantitative manner. While ORF6 does not have a global effect on protein synthesis, quantitative real-time PCR revealed that it down-regulated the mRNA level of the co-transfected myc-nsp8 gene. Furthermore, alanine substitution of a diacidic cluster motif (aa53-56) in the ORF6 gene caused a reduction in the suppression of expression of co-transfected myc-nsp8 gene. Our previous study revealed that ORF6 localized to vesicular structures in SARS-CoV infected Vero E6 cells. Here, OR...","Background: SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) induced cell apoptosis and its structural proteins may play a role in this process. Objectives: To determine whether the structural proteins M and N of SARS-CoV induce apoptosis. Study design: We investigated human pulmonary fibroblast (HPF) cells, were transfected with plasmids containing the M or N gene, by TdT-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL), Hoechst 33342 staining for nuclei, and observation of morphology. Results: We found that in the absence of serum about 16.34% of cells transfected by pcDNA3.1-M and 21.72% of N-transfected cells showed typical apoptotic characteristics, significantly different from mock-transfected cells (only 6.23%, p&lt;0.01). Furthermore, the cells that were co-transfected with M and N proteins showed more obvious phenomena of cell death (about 36.03%). There was a statistical significance between M-transfected cells and co-transfected cells (p&lt;0.01), and a remarkable difference between N-transfected ce...","Abstract Background: A new virus broke out in Wuhan, Hubei, China, and was later named 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). The clinical characteristics of severe pneumonia caused by 2019-nCoV are still not clear. Objectives: The aim of this study was to explore the clinical characteristics and risk factors of the severe pneumonia caused by the 2019-nCoV in Wuhan, China. Method: The study included patients hospitalized at the central hospital of Wuhan who had been diagnosed with a pneumonia caused by the novel coronavirus. Clinical features, chronic co-morbidities, demographic data, laboratory examinations, and chest computed tomography (CT) scans were reviewed through electronic medical records. SPSS was used for data analysis to explore the clinical characteristics and risk factors of the patients with the severe pneumonia. Results: A total of 110 patients diagnosed with 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia were included in the study, including 38 with severe pneumonia and 72 with non-sev...","Abstract First reported in September 2012, the Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) has resulted in 206 laboratory-confirmed deaths, with a 42% mortality rate as of 27 March 2014. Closely related coronaviruses have been isolated in bats, but most evidence suggests that humans have become infected directly from camels in a number of separate transmission events, with limited human-to-human transmission reported thus far. The majority of cases originated in the Middle East (predominantly Saudi Arabia), including all the index cases. Clinical manifestations primarily involve fever, chills, and rapidly progressive respiratory failure, often resulting in an acute respiratory distress syndrome, with a minority of patients reporting gastrointestinal symptoms, as well. The majority of critically ill patients are older males with medical co-morbidities, and a large number of minimally symptomatic cases likely go undetected. Unfortunately, attempted therapies have all been ...","Abstract The contribution of cell-mediated immunity to protective immunity against virulent transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) infection conferred by primary porcine respiratry coronavirus (PRCV) or TGEV exposure was assessed in pigs that were challenged with TGEV 24 days after a primary oronasal inoculation with PRCV or TGEV when 11 days old. PRCV exposure induced partial protection against TGEV challenge in suckling pigs based upon a decreased number of diarrhea cases (42% vs. 90% in age-matched control pigs), limited virus shedding in feces, and increases in virus-neutralizing serum antibody titers; in contrast, all 11-day-old pigs inoculated with TGEV were completely protected after challenge. Weaned pigs were also studied to eliminate any possibility that lactogenic immunity from contact PRCV-exposed sows contributed to protection against TGEV. Once weaned, none of the PRCV-exposed or age-matched control pigs had diarrhea after TGEV challenge; moreover, both groups exhibit...","PURPOSE: Influenza A viruses, human coronaviruses (hCoV) and human bocavirus (hBoV) are emerging respiratory viruses. This study investigated the association between influenza A viruses co-infection with hBoV and hCoV and severity and the sensitivity of a real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay for identification of 15 coronaviruses. METHODOLOGY: Published sequences for the 15 human coronaviruses were used to design a consensus PCR targeting the replicase open reading frame 1b. A previously published PCR targeting the NS1 Gene of all known human bocavirus strains was also utilized. A series of 217 samples from patients aged 37.7 (SD \u00b1 30.4)] with seasonal influenza A viruses (SeasFluA) identified between 06/2011 and 06/2012 in NW England were tested for hCoV and hBoV using RT-PCR. Association between co-infection and disease outcome was assessed using logistic regression. RESULTS: The limit of detection of hCoV RT-PCR assay was 2 copies/\u00b5l of human coronavirus RNA template, ...","This is the first report on circulating canine rotavirus in Mexico. Fifty samples from dogs with gastroenteritis were analyzed used polymerase chain reaction and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction in order to identify parvovirus and rotavirus, respectively; 7% of dogs were infected with rotavirus exclusively, while 14% were co-infected with both rotavirus and parvovirus; clinical signs in co-infected dogs were more severe.","The transmission potential of a novel infection depends on both the inherent transmissibility of a pathogen, and the level of susceptibility in the host population. However, distinguishing between these pathogen- and population-specific properties typically requires detailed serological studies, which are rarely available in the early stages of an outbreak. Using a simple transmission model that incorporates age-stratified social mixing patterns, we present a novel method for characterizing the transmission potential of subcritical infections, which have effective reproduction number R&lt;1, from readily available data on the size of outbreaks. We show that the model can identify the extent to which outbreaks are driven by inherent pathogen transmissibility and pre-existing population immunity, and can generate unbiased estimates of the effective reproduction number. Applying the method to real-life infections, we obtained accurate estimates for the degree of age-specific immunity against...","Abstract Porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) (family Coronaviridae, genus Deltacoronavirus) is a novel swine enteropathogenic coronavirus that causes acute diarrhea/vomiting, dehydration and mortality in seronegative neonatal piglets. PDCoV diarrhea was first reported in the US in early 2014, concurrently with co-circulation of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) (family Coronaviridae, genus Alphacoronavirus). The origin of PDCoV in pigs and also its sudden emergence or route of introduction into the US still remains unclear. In the US, since 2013\u20132014, the newly emerged PDCoV and PEDV have spread nationwide, causing a high number of pig deaths and significant economic impacts. The current US PDCoV strains are enteropathogenic and infect villous epithelial cells of the entire small and large intestines although the jejunum and ileum are the primary sites of infection. Similar to PEDV infections, PDCoV infections also cause acute, severe atrophic enteritis accompanied by transient virem...","Over the past several decades, we have witnessed the emergence of many new infectious agents, some of which are major public threats. New and emerging infectious diseases which are both transmissible from patient-to-patient and virulent with a high mortality include novel coronaviruses (SARS-CoV, MERS-CV), hemorrhagic fever viruses (Lassa, Ebola), and highly pathogenic avian influenza A viruses, A(H5N1) and A(H7N9). All healthcare facilities need to have policies and plans in place for early identification of patients with a highly communicable diseases which are highly virulent, ability to immediately isolate such patients, and provide proper management (e.g., training and availability of personal protective equipment) to prevent transmission to healthcare personnel, other patients and visitors to the healthcare facility.","Abstract Acute respiratory illnesses are the most frequently occurring illness in all age groups globally. Disease is mostly limited to the upper airways and is self-limiting, but a small percentage can progress to lower respiratory tract infections as bronchiolitis and pneumonia. Children and elderly people are at increased risk, especially in developing countries. The most important etiologic agents of severe lower respiratory illness are bacteria such as Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae and viruses such as respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and influenza virus. Efficacious vaccines are available against the two bacteria and the influenza virus. Viruses are much more important in mild upper and middle respiratory tract infections and in bronchiolitis in children, whereas bacteria are the main cause of pneumonia, especially in adults. Clinical syndromes overlap considerably, and there is increasing evidence of bacterial-viral co-infections and of bacterial pneumonia ...","Abstract Human rhinovirus (HRV) is an emerging viral pathogen. Aim To characterize a group of patients admitted due to infection by this agent in a general hospital in Chile. Methods Cases were identified by RT-PCR for 1 year through active surveillance of patients admitted with severe respiratory illness. Diagnosis was not available during hospitalization. Thirty-two cases were identified, 90% were \u226560 years old or had co-morbid conditions. Human rhinovirus-related admissions represented 23.7% of hospitalization due to severe acute respiratory infections among adults and ranked second to influenza (37.8%). Patients presented with pneumonia (68.8%), decompensated chronic lung conditions (21.9%), heart failure or influenza-like illness (6.3% each). Admission to intensive or intermediate care units was required by 31.2% and in-hospital mortality reached 12.5%. A CURB-65 score \u22653 was significantly associated to in-hospital mortality (p &lt;0.05). Most patients received antibiotics (90%). Con...","Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a newly emerged infection that is caused by a previously unrecognized virus\u2013a novel coronavirus designated as SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV). From November 2002 to July 2003 the cumulative number of worldwide cases was &gt;8000, with a mortality rate of close to 10%. The mortality has been higher in older patients and those with co-morbidities. SARS has been defined using clinical and epidemiological criteria and cases are considered laboratory-confirmed if SARS coronavirus is isolated, if antibody to SARS coronavirus is detected, or a polymerase chain reaction test by appropriate criteria is positive. At the time of writing (24 May 2004), no specific therapy has been recommended. A variety of treatments have been attempted, but there are no controlled data. Most patients have been treated throughout the illness with broad-spectrum antimicrobials, supplemental oxygen, intravenous fluids, and other supportive measures. Transmission of SAR...","Abstract Coronavirus 3C-like and Flavivirus NS2B-NS3 proteases utilize the chymotrypsin fold to harbor their catalytic machineries but also contain additional domains/co-factors. Over the past decade, we aimed to decipher how the extra domains/co-factors mediate the catalytic machineries of SARS 3C-like, Dengue and Zika NS2B-NS3 proteases by characterizing their folding, structures, dynamics and inhibition with NMR, X-ray crystallography and MD simulations, and the results revealed: 1) the chymotrypsin fold of the SARS 3C-like protease can independently fold, while, by contrast, those of Dengue and Zika proteases lack the intrinsic capacity to fold without co-factors. 2) Mutations on the extra domain of SARS 3C-like protease can transform the active catalytic machinery into the inactive collapsed state by structurally-driven allostery. 3) Amazingly, even without detectable structural changes, mutations on the extra domain are sufficient to either inactivate or enhance the catalytic mac...","Abstract The sudden appearance of apparently new viruses with pathogenic potential is of fundamental importance in medical microbiology and a constant threat to humans and animals. The emergence of a \u201cnew\u201d pathogen is not an isolated event, as for instance the frequent appearance of new influenza virus strains demonstrates. Often the new virus strains co-circulate with the older strains in a susceptible population, but a replacement of the older strains has been also observed. In rare instances the new viruses can cause dramatic epidemics or pandemics, such as those observed with the human immunodeficiency virus, canine parvovirus, or most recently, with the agent of bovine spongiform encephalopathy in the United Kingdom. The mechanisms of the emergence are not always clearly understood, but an altered host range appears to be a common event. Whether a true change in host range occurs, or whether the virus adapted to the host and replicated more efficiently, is often unknown. This revi...","AbstractThe new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak from December 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei, China, has been declared a global public health emergency. Angiotensin I converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), is the host receptor by 2019-nCov to infect human cells. Although ACE2 is reported to be expressed in lung, liver, stomach, ileum, kidney and colon, its expressing levels are rather low, especially in the lung. 2019-nCoV may use co-receptors/auxiliary proteins as ACE2 partner to facilitate the virus entry. To identify the potential candidates, we explored the single cell gene expression atlas including 119 cell types of 13 human tissues and analyzed the single cell co-expression spectrum of 51 reported RNA virus receptors and 400 other membrane proteins. Consistent with other recent reports, we confirmed that ACE2 was mainly expressed in lung AT2, liver cholangiocyte, colon colonocytes, esophagus keratinocytes, ileum ECs, rectum ECs, stomach epithelial cells, and kidney proximal tubules. Intriguingly, w...","Abstract Introduction The COVID-19 pandemic is stressing healthcare systems throughout the world. Significant numbers of patients are being admitted to the hospital with severe illness, often in the setting of advanced age and underlying co-morbidities. Therefore, palliative care is an important part of the response to this pandemic. The Seattle area and UW Medicine have been on the forefront of the pandemic in the US. Methods UW Medicine developed a strategy to implement a palliative care response for a multi-hospital healthcare system that incorporates conventional capacity, contingency capacity, and crisis capacity. The strategy was developed by our palliative care programs with input from the healthcare system leadership. Results In this publication, we share our multi-faceted strategy to implement high-quality palliative care in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic that incorporates conventional, contingency, and crisis capacity and focuses on the areas of the hospital caring for ...","Background: Management of high mortality risk due to significant progression requires prior assessment of time-to-progression. However, few related methods are available for COVID-19 pneumonia. Methods: We retrospectively enrolled 338 adult patients admitted to one hospital between Jan 11, 2020 to Feb 29, 2020. The final follow-up date was March 8, 2020. We compared characteristics between patients with severe and non-severe outcome, and used multivariate survival analyses to assess the risk of progression to severe conditions. Results: A total of 76 (31.9%) patients progressed to severe conditions and 3 (0.9%) died. The mean time from hospital admission to severity onset is 3.7 days. Age, body mass index (BMI), fever symptom on admission, co-existing hypertension or diabetes are associated with severe progression. Compared to non-severe group, the severe group already demonstrated, at an early stage, abnormalities in biomarkers indicating organ function, inflammatory responses, blood ...","Abstract The new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) outbreak from December 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei, China, has been declared a global public health emergency.

This review aims to describe the pattern of influenza B occurrence in Brazil to have a better understanding of its epidemiology and its relevance when considering seasonal influenza vaccine composition. A review of the data including analysis of international and local surveillance data as well as information from online search of databases using Medical Subject Headings terms in conjunction with screening of abstracts from scientific events was performed. Based on international epidemiologic surveillance data, moderate levels of influenza B disease (19%; 2006\u20132014) were observed. Of these nine years, it was possible to compare data from three years (2007, 2008 and 2013) which have information on the circulating influenza B lineage. Co-circulation of influenza B lineages was observed in all these three influenza seasons, of which, during one season, a high degree of mismatch ...","BACKGROUND: The clinical relevance of infections with the novel human coronavirus NL63 (HCoV-NL63) has not been investigated systematically. We therefore determined its association with disease in young children with lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI). METHODS AND FINDINGS: Nine hundred forty-nine samples of nasopharyngeal secretions from children under 3 y of age with LRTIs were analysed by a quantitative HCoV-NL63-specific real-time PCR. The samples had been collected from hospitalised patients and outpatients from December 1999 to October 2001 in four different regions in Germany as part of the prospective population-based PRI.DE study and analysed for RNA from respiratory viruses. Forty-nine samples (5.2%), mainly derived from the winter season, were positive for HCoV-NL63 RNA. The viral RNA was more prevalent in samples from outpatients (7.9%) than from hospitalised patients (3.2%, p = 0.003), and co-infection with either respiratory syncytial virus or parainfluenza virus 3 ...","Abstract The SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) pandemic caused ten years ago by the SARS-coronavirus (SARS-CoV) has stimulated a number of studies on the molecular biology of coronaviruses. This research has provided significant new insight into many mechanisms used by the coronavirus replication-transcription complex (RTC). The RTC directs and coordinates processes in order to replicate and transcribe the coronavirus genome, a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA of outstanding length (\u223c27\u201332kilobases). Here, we review the up-to-date knowledge on SARS-CoV replicative enzymes encoded in the ORF1b, i.e., the main RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (nsp12), the helicase/triphosphatase (nsp13), two unusual ribonucleases (nsp14, nsp15) and RNA-cap methyltransferases (nsp14, nsp16). We also review how these enzymes co-operate with other viral co-factors (nsp7, nsp8, and nsp10) to regulate their activity. These last ten years of research on SARS-CoV have considerably contributed to unravel s...","Abstract Objectives The role of viral co-detection in children with severe acute respiratory infection is not clear. We described the viral detection profile and its association with clinical characteristics in children admitted to the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) during the 2009 influenza A(H1N1) pandemic. Method Longitudinal observational retrospective study, with patients aged 0\u201318 years, admitted to 11 PICUs in Rio de Janeiro, with suspected H1N1 infection, from June to November, 2009. The results of respiratory samples which were sent to the Laboratory of Fiocruz/RJ and clinical data extracted from specific forms were analyzed. Results Of 71 samples, 38% tested positive for H1N1 virus. Of the 63 samples tested for other viruses, 58 were positive: influenza H1N1 (43.1% of positive samples), rhinovirus/enterovirus (41.4%), respiratory syncytial v\u00edrus (12.1%), human metapneumovirus (12.1%), adenovirus (6.9%), and bocavirus (3.5%). Viral codetection occured in 22.4% of the cas...","Human infections with a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) were first identified via syndromic surveillance in December of 2019 in Wuhan China. Since identification, infections (coronavirus disease-2019; COVID-19) caused by this novel pathogen have spread globally, with more than 250,000 confirmed cases as of March 21, 2020. An open-label clinical trial has just concluded, suggesting improved resolution of viremia with use of two existing therapies: hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) as monotherapy, and in combination with azithromycin (HCQ-AZ). The results of this important trial have major implications for global policy in the rapid scale-up and response to this pandemic. The authors present results with p-values for differences in proportions between the study arms, but their analysis is not able to provide effect size estimates. To address this gap, more modern analytical methods including survival models, have been applied to these data, and show modest to no impact of HCQ treatment, with more ...","Novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP) is an emerging, highly contagious community acquired pneumonia (CAP) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Highly efficient and accurate microbiological laboratory assay is essential to confirm the SARS-CoV-2 infection, rule out other pathogens that can cause CAP, and monitor secondary infections. Here, we enrolled and provide microbiological analysis for 129 suspected and 52 transferred confirmed NCP patients hospitalized in the First Affiliated Hospital of University of Science and Technology of China (USTC) from Jan 21 to Feb 29, 2020. By analyzing the dual swab samples (sputum and pharyngeal) from 129 suspected patients with realtime RT-PCR, we confirmed 33 SARS-CoV-2 infections, with two co-infection cases with adenovirus or rhinovirus. We also used multiplex PCR to detect 13 common respiratory tract pathogens in 96 non-NCP patients, and found that 30 patients (31.25%) were infected with at least one respiratory t...","Viral diseases are one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in the world. Virus-specific vaccines and antiviral drugs are the most powerful tools to combat viral diseases. However, broad-spectrum antiviral agents (BSAAs, i.e. compounds targeting viruses belonging to two or more viral families) could provide additional protection of general population from emerging and re-emerging viral diseases reinforcing the arsenal of available antiviral options. Here, we reviewed discovery and development of BSAAs and summarized the information on 119 safe-in-man agents in freely accessible database (https://drugvirus.info/). Future and ongoing pre-clinical and clinical studies will increase the number of BSAAs, expand spectrum of their indications, and identify drug combinations for treatment of emerging and re-emerging viral infections as well as co-infections.","R\u00e9sum\u00e9 La bronchiolite aigu\u00eb est une infection virale respiratoire \u00e9pid\u00e9mique du nourrisson.

While respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), human metapneumonvirus, parainfluenzaviruses, and influenza viruses are well known for their potential to cause fatal pneumonia, information is emerging only recently on the significance of the newly discovered viruses such as human coronaviruses NL63 and HKU1, and human bocavirus. Lymphopenia seems to be the most recent risk factors for progression to lower respiratory tract disease. Airflow obstruction is another complication of respiratory virus infections after HCT, and data to date indicate this complication may occur following parainfluenza virus and RSV infection. Infection control procedures are key for prevention. Unfortunately, there are no randomized treatment studies, which make the interpretation of the literature on interventions difficult. This article reviews the spectrum of pathogens, epidemiology, risk fa...","Abstract The open reading frame 3 (ORF3) of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) genome encodes a predicted 154-amino acid protein, which lacks similarities to any known protein, and is named 3b. In this study, it was shown that 3b protein was predominately localized to nucleus with EGFP tag at its N- or C-terminus. The localization patterns were similar in different transfected cells. Immuno-fluorescence assay revealed that 3b protein was co-localized well with C23 in nucleolus. C23, B23 and fibrillarin all are important nucleolar proteins, which localize in the region of the nucleolus. Co-transfection of p3b-EGFP with pC23-DsRed, pB23-DsRed and pfibrillarin-DsRed further confirmed 3b's nucleolus localization. With construction of serial truncated mutants of 3b, a region (residues 134\u2013154 aa) responsible for nucleolar localization was determinated in 3b protein. These results provide a new insight for further functional studies of SARS-CoV 3b protein.","BACKGROUND: Bat-borne virus surveillance is necessary for determining inter-species transmission risks and is important due to the wide-range of bat species which may harbour potential pathogens. This study aimed to monitor coronaviruses (CoVs) and paramyxoviruses (PMVs) in bats roosting in northwest Italian regions. Our investigation was focused on CoVs and PMVs due to their proven ability to switch host and their zoonotic potential. Here we provide the phylogenetic characterization of the highly conserved polymerase gene fragments. RESULTS: Family-wide PCR screenings were used to test 302 bats belonging to 19 different bat species. Thirty-eight animals from 12 locations were confirmed as PCR positive, with an overall detection rate of 12.6% [95% CI: 9.3\u201316.8]. CoV RNA was found in 36 bats belonging to eight species, while PMV RNA in three Pipistrellus spp. Phylogenetic characterization have been obtained for 15 alpha- CoVs, 5 beta-CoVs and three PMVs; moreover one P. pipistrellus res...","Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV, is an acute infectious disease with significant mortality. A typical clinical feature associated with SARS is pulmonary fibrosis and associated lung failure. In the aftermath of the SARS epidemic, although significant progress towards understanding the underlying molecular mechanism of the infection has been made, a large gap still remains in our knowledge regarding how SARS-CoV interacts with the host cell at the onset of infection. The rapidly changing viral genome adds another variable to this equation. We have focused on a novel concept of microRNA (miRNA)\u2013mediated host\u2013virus interactions in bronchoalveolar stem cells (BASCs) at the onset of infection by correlating the \u201cBASC\u2013microRNome\u201d with their targets within BASCs and viral genome. This work encompasses miRNA array data analysis, target prediction, and miRNA\u2013mRNA enrichment analysis and develops a complex interaction map among disease-related factors...","Abstract Background Numerous viruses are responsible for respiratory infections; however, both their distribution and genetic diversity, in a limited area and a population subgroup, have been studied only rarely during a sustained period of time. Methods A 2-year surveillance program of children presenting with acute respiratory infections (ARIs) was carried out to characterize the viral etiology and to assess whether using gene amplification and sequencing could be a reliable approach to monitor virus introduction and spread in a population subgroup. Results Using multiplex RT-PCR, 15 different respiratory viruses were detected within the 486 nasopharyngeal positive samples collected among 817 children aged &lt;9-year old who presented with ARI during October 2006 to September 2008. A single virus was detected in 373 patients (45.7%), and two to four viruses in 113 patients (13.8%). The most frequent causative viruses were respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) (24.7%), human bocavirus (24.5%...","Abstract Although bacteria are the main pathogens involved in community-acquired pneumonia, a significant number of community-acquired pneumonia are caused by viruses, either directly or as part of a co-infection. The clinical picture of these different pneumonias can be very similar, but viral infection is more common in the pediatric and geriatric populations, leukocytes are not generally elevated, fever is variable, and upper respiratory tract symptoms often occur; procalcitonin levels are not generally affected. For years, the diagnosis of viral pneumonia was based on cell culture and antigen detection, but since the introduction of polymerase chain reaction techniques in the clinical setting, identification of these pathogens has increased and new microorganisms such as human bocavirus have been discovered. In general, influenza virus type A and syncytial respiratory virus are still the main pathogens involved in this entity. However, in recent years, outbreaks of deadly coronavir...","Many viruses are surrounded by a continuous bilayer membrane studded with viral proteins. Its purpose is to protect the genome-containing virus nucleocapsid from damage, and to facilitate entry of the nucleocapsid into a host cell. Viral membrane proteins attach the virus to the host cell, and promote fusion between viral and host cell membranes. Enveloped viruses form by a budding process, involving the wrapping up of newly synthesized nucleocapsids with regions of host cell membranes containing host cell lipids but exclusively viral proteins. Host cell machinery and processes are co-opted by enveloped viruses for use at every stage of these viral events.","COVID-19 caused by a novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 emerged in Wuhan, Hubei province since December 2019, and caused a rapid outbreak throughout China and globally. Cities outside Hubei are also facing great challenge and require implementing of effective and feasible strategy in precision diagnosing novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP). We described a multicenter prospective study on diagnostic strategy of suspected NCP patients from January 22nd to February 9th, 2020 in Eastern China cities. Nasopharyngeal swabs were collected from the patients. The epidemiological characteristics, clinical symptoms, laboratory assessments, and computed tomographic (CT) scans were obtained. Pathogen screen were performed including RT-PCR, multiplex PCR, rapid flu antigen tests and mNGS. We enrolled 53 suspected NCP patients, among whom 20 were laboratory-confirmed. Fourteen (70%) and 3 (15%) patients were positive for the first and second SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test, respectively. All NCP patients were positiv...","The basic reproductive number --- R0 --- is one of the most common and most commonly misapplied numbers in public health. Nevertheless, estimating R0 for every transmissible pathogen, emerging or endemic, remains a priority for epidemiologists the world over. Although often used to compare outbreaks and forecast pandemic risk, this single number belies the complexity that two different pathogens can exhibit, even when they have the same R0. Here, we show how predicting outbreak size requires both an estimate of R0 and an estimate of the heterogeneity in the number of secondary infections. To facilitate rapid determination of outbreak risk, we propose a reformulation of a classic result from random network theory that relies on contact tracing data to simultaneously determine the first moment (R0) and the higher moments (representing the heterogeneity) in the distribution of secondary infections. Further, we show how this framework is robust in the face of the typically limited amount o...","The pathogenesis of SARS coronavirus (CoV) remains poorly understood. In the current study, two recombinant baculovirus were generated to express the spike (S) protein of SARS-like coronavirus (SL-CoV) isolated from bats (vAcBS) and the envelope (E) and membrane (M) proteins of SARS-CoV, respectively. Co-infection of insect cells with these two recombinant baculoviruses led to self-assembly of virus-like particles (BVLPs) as demonstrated by electron microscopy. Incorporation of S protein of vAcBS (BS) into VLPs was confirmed by western blot and immunogold labeling. Such BVLPs up-regulated the level of CD40, CD80, CD86, CD83, and enhanced the secretion of IL-6, IL-10 and TNF-\u03b1 in immature dendritic cells (DCs). Immune responses were compared in immature DCs inoculated with BVLPs or with VLPs formed by S, E and M proteins of human SARS-CoV. BVLPs showed a stronger ability to stimulate DCs in terms of cytokine induction as evidenced by 2 to 6 fold higher production of IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1. Furt...","Following the SARS outbreak, extensive surveillance was undertaken globally to detect and identify coronavirus diversity in bats. This study sought to identify the diversity and prevalence of coronaviruses in bats in the Australasian region. We identified four different genotypes of coronavirus, three of which (an alphacoronavirus and two betacoronaviruses) are potentially new species, having less than 90% nucleotide sequence identity with the most closely related described viruses. We did not detect any SARS-like betacoronaviruses, despite targeting rhinolophid bats, the putative natural host taxa. Our findings support the virus-host co-evolution hypothesis, with the detection of Miniopterus bat coronavirus HKU8 (previously reported in Miniopterus species in China, Hong Kong and Bulgaria) in Australian Miniopterus species. Similarly, we detected a novel betacoronavirus genotype from Pteropus alecto which is most closely related to Bat coronavirus HKU9 identified in other pteropodid ba...","ABSTRACT SARS-CoV-2, the novel coronavirus from China, is spreading around the world, causing a huge reaction despite its current low incidence outside China and the Far East. Four common coronaviruses are in current circulation and cause millions of cases worldwide. This article compares the incidence and mortality rates of these four common coronaviruses with those of SARS-COV-2 in Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries. It is concluded that the problem of SARS-CoV-2 is probably being overestimated, as 2.6 million people die of respiratory infections each year compared with less than 4000 deaths for SARS-CoV-2 at the time of writing.","Abstract The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) is a serious respiratory illness that has recently been reported in parts of Asia and Canada. In this study, we use molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and docking techniques to screen 29 approved and experimental drugs against the theoretical model of the SARS CoV proteinase as well as the experimental structure of the transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) proteinase. Our predictions indicate that existing HIV-1 protease inhibitors, l-700,417 for instance, have high binding affinities and may provide good starting points for designing SARS CoV proteinase inhibitors.","Abstract SARS-CoV 3a protein was a unique protein of SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV), which was identified in SARS-CoV infected cells and SARS patients\u2019 specimen. Recent studies revealed that 3a could interact specifically with many SARS-CoV structural proteins, such as M, E and S protein. Expressed 3a protein was reported to localize to Golgi complex in SARS-CoV infected cells. In this study, it was shown that 3a protein was mainly located in Golgi apparatus with different tags at N- or C-terminus. The localization pattern was similar in different transfected cells. With the assay of truncated 3a protein, it was shown that 3a might contain three transmembrane regions, and the second or third region was properly responsible for Golgi localization. By ultra-centrifugation experiment with different extraction buffers, it was confirmed that 3a was an integral membrane protein and embedded in the phospholipid bilayer. Immunofluorescence assay indicated that 3a was co-localized with M protein i...","SummaryThe recent pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). COVID-19 was first reported in China (December 2019) and now prevalent in \u223c170 countries across the globe. Entry of SARS-CoV-2 into mammalian cells require the binding of viral Spike (S) proteins to the ACE2 (angiotensin converting enzyme 2) receptor. Once entered the S protein is primed by a specialised serine protease, TMPRSS2 (Transmembrane Serine Protease 2) in the host cell. Importantly, beside respiratory symptoms, consistent with other common respiratory virus infection when patients become viraemic, a significant number of COVID-19 patients also develop liver comorbidities. We explored if specific target cell-type in the mammalian liver, could be implicated in disease pathophysiology other than the general deleterious response to cytokine storms. Here we employed single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) to survey the human liver and identified pote...","Background: At present, there is a global pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia. Two previous case series from China have suggested that cancer patients are at a higher risk of COVID-19 pneumonia, but the reports were limited by small numbers and few clinical information. Objective: To study clinical characteristics and outcomes of cancer patients infected with COVID-19. Design: Retrospective study. Setting: Four designated COVID-16 hospitals in Wuhan, Hubei province, China. Participants: Medical records of 67 cancer patients admitted to hospitals between Jan 5, 2020 to Feb 18, 2020 were included. Measurements: Demographic, clinical, laboratory, radiological and treatment data were collected. Survival data of the cohort was cut-off on Mar 10, 2020. Results: Of the 67 patients (median age: 66 years), the median age of patients who had severe illness was older than that of patients who had mild symptoms (P&lt;0.001). Forty-three (64.2%) patients had other concurrent chro...","Abstract The recent outbreak of Zaire Ebola virus in West Africa altered the classical paradigm of vaccine development and that for emerging infectious diseases (EIDs) in general. In this paper, the precepts of vaccine discovery and advancement through pre-clinical and clinical assessment are discussed in the context of the recent Ebola virus, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and Zika virus outbreaks. Clinical trial design for diseases with high mortality rates and/or high morbidity in the face of a global perception of immediate need and the factors that drive design in the face of a changing epidemiology are presented. Vaccines for EIDs thus present a unique paradigm to standard development precepts.","Rationale: In late December 2019, an outbreak of acute respiratory illness, now officially named as COVID-19, or coronavirus disease 2019, emerged in Wuhan, China, now spreading across the whole country and world. More data were needed to understand the clinical characteristics of the disease. Objectives: To study the epidemiology, clinical features and outcomes of patients with COVID-19. Methods: we performed a single center, retrospective case series study in 221 patients with laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia at a university hospital. Measurements and Main Results: The median age was 55.0 years and 48.9% were male and only 8 (3.6%) patients had a history of exposure to the Huanan Seafood Market. Compared to the non-severe pneumonia patients, the median age of the severe patients was significantly older, and they were more likely to have chronic comorbidities. Most common symptoms in severe patients were high fever, anorexia and dyspnea.
