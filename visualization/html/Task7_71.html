The ELISA detected IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV in all 74 convalescent-phase samples from SARS patients while weakly cross-reacting to only 1 of the 210 control sera from healthy donors. This finding thus led to a kit sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of 100, 99.5, and 99.6%, respectively. The test thus provided a positive predictive value (PPV) of 98.7% and a negative predictive value (NPV) of 100%. In addition, the ELISA gave a positive delta of 5.4 and a negative delta of 3.6, indicating an excellent differentiation between positives and negatives. The same recombinant proteins were also applied to a newly developed platform for the development of a 15-min rapid test. The resulting rapid test has an excel...","Purpose: COVID-19 has become global threaten. CT acts as an important method of diagnosis. However, human-based interpretation of CT imaging is time consuming. More than that, substantial inter-observer-variation cannot be ignored. We aim at developing a diagnostic tool for artificial intelligence (AI)-based classification of CT images for recognizing COVID-19 and other common infectious diseases of the lung. Experimental Design: In this study, images were retrospectively collected and prospectively analyzed using machine learning. CT scan images of the lung that show or do not show COVID-19 were used to train and validate a classification framework based on convolutional neural network. Five conditions including COVID-19 pneumonia, non-COVID-19 viral pneumonia, bacterial pneumonia, pulmonary tuberculosis, and normal lung were evaluated. Training and validation set of images were collected from Wuhan Jin Yin-Tan Hospital whereas test set of images were collected from Zhongshan Hospital...","[Abstract]Objective Coronavirus disease 2019 has become pandemic in the world. The need for IgG/IgM combined antibody test is booming, but data on diagnostic indexes evaluation was inadequate. The aim of this study was to evaluate diagnostic indexes of a rapid IgG/IgM combined antibody test for SARS-CoV-2. Methods A total of 179 patients were enrolled. Serum were collected for IgG-IgM combined antibody test and corresponding nasal and pharyngeal swab specimens were collected for SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR. According to SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR results, patients under study were categorized as PCR positive group in 90 patients and PCR negative group in 89 patients. Results 1. Of the 90 PCR positive samples, 77 were tested positive by SARS-CoV-2 IgG-IgM test kit, yielding a sensitivity of 85.6%. Meanwhile, of the 89 PCR negative sample, 8 samples were detected positive, resulting in a specificity of 91%. Positive predictive value, negative predictive value and accuracy of this test kit was 95.1%, 82.7%,...","OBJECTIVES: Timely implementation of influenza infection control and treatment can significantly reduce the impact on Hospital resources and patient management when demand is at peak. Turnaround times of Laboratory based screening tests for the diagnosis of influenza may have an impact on the implementation of infection control measures and treatment. In this study the objectives included determining the correlation between the Abbott ID NOW point-of-care testing (POCT) instrument using the Influenza A&amp;B2 test and the laboratory based GeneXpert Flu+RSV kit. In addition the impact of the POCT instrument on the prescription of antivirals and antibiotics was evaluated by comparing with practice when the instrument was not in place. RESULTS: The results of the correlation study with a cohort of 54 patients revealed the Abbott ID NOW POCT has 92% sensitivity for the detection of Influenza A, while specificity was 100% for both Influenza A and B. The impact of the POCT instrument on the freq...","ABSTRACTTo combat the pandemic of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19), numerous governments have established phone hotlines to prescreen potential cases. These hotlines have struggled with the volume of callers, leading to wait times of hours or, even, an inability to contact health authorities. Symptoma is a symptom-to-disease digital health assistant that can differentiate more than 20,000 diseases with an accuracy of more than 90%. We tested the accuracy of Symptoma to identify COVID-19 using a set of diverse clinical cases combined with case reports of COVID-19. We showed that Symptoma can accurately distinguish COVID-19 in 96.32% of clinical cases. When considering only COVID-19 symptoms and risk factors, Symptoma identified 100% of those infected when presented with only three signs. Lastly, we showed that Symptoma\u2019s accuracy far exceeds that of simple \u201cyes-no\u201d questionnaires widely available online. In summary, Symptoma provides unparalleled accuracy in systematically identifying...","Novel Corona virus (COVID-19 or 2019-nCoV) is an emerging global health concern that requires a rapid diagnostic test. Quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) is currently the standard for COVID-19 detection; however, Reverse Transcription Loop-Mediated Isothermal Amplification (RT-LAMP) may allow for faster and cheaper field based testing at point-of-risk. The objective of this study was to develop a rapid screening diagnostic test that could be completed in under 30 minutes. Simulated patient samples were generated by spiking serum, urine, saliva, oropharyngeal swabs, and nasopharyngeal swabs with a portion of the COVID-19 nucleic sequence. The samples were tested using RT-LAMP as well as by conventional qRT-PCR. Specificity of the RT-LAMP was evaluated by also testing against other related coronaviruses. RT-LAMP specifically detected COVID-19 in simulated patient samples. This test was performed in under 30 minutes. This approach could be used for monitoring of exposed indi...","AbstractSARS-CoV-2 emerged in China at the end of 2019 and has rapidly become a pandemic with over 400,000 recorded COVID-19 cases and greater than 19,000 recorded deaths by March 24th, 2020 (www.WHO.org) (1). There are no FDA approved antivirals or vaccines for any coronavirus, including SARS-CoV-2 (2). Current treatments for COVID-19 are limited to supportive therapies and off-label use of FDA approved drugs (3). Rapid development and human testing of potential antivirals is greatly needed. A potentially quicker way to test compounds with antiviral activity is through drug re-purposing (2, 4). Numerous drugs are already approved for use in humans and subsequently there is a good understanding of their safety profiles and potential side effects, making them easier to test in COVID-19 patients. Here, we present data on 20 FDA approved drugs tested for antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 that we have previously found to inhibit SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (4). We find that 17 of these also ...","COVID-19 outbreak is still threatening the public health. Therefore, in the middle of the pandemic, all kind of knowledge on SARS-CoV-2 may help us to find the solution. Determining the 3D structures of the proteins involved in host-pathogen interactions are of great importance in the fight against infection. Besides, post-translational modifications of the protein on 3D structure should be revealed in order to understand the protein function since these modifications are responsible for the host-pathogen interaction. Based on these, we predicted O-glycosylation and phosphorylation positions using full amino acid sequence of S1 protein. Candidate positions were further analyzed with enzyme binding activity, solvent accessibility, surface area parameters and the positions determined with high accuracy rate were used to design full 3D glycoprotein structure of the S1 protein using carbohydrate force field. In addition, the interaction between the C-type lectin CD209L and \u03b1-mannose residu...","Early detection of COVID-19 based on chest CT will enable timely treatment of patients and help control the spread of the disease. With rapid spreading of COVID-19 in many countries, however, CT volumes of suspicious patients are increasing at a speed much faster than the availability of human experts. Here, we propose an artificial intelligence (AI) system for fast COVID-19 diagnosis with an accuracy comparable to experienced radiologists. A large dataset was constructed by collecting 970 CT volumes of 496 patients with confirmed COVID-19 and 260 negative cases from three hospitals in Wuhan, China, and 1,125 negative cases from two publicly available chest CT datasets. Trained using only 312 cases, our diagnosis system, which is based on deep convolutional neural network, is able to achieve an accuracy of 94.98%, an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 97.91%, a sensitivity of 94.06%, and a specificity of 95.47% on an independent external verification datase...","Objectives: To report our experiences screening and managing patients with suspected or confirmed novel coronavirus (COVID-19) disease using a hospital-specific protocol. Design: Longitudinal cohort study. Setting: A 1,200 bed tertiary care teaching hospital in Chengdu, Sichuan, China. Participants: 802 adults presenting to hospital with concerns of having COVID-19, 1,246 inpatients and 2,531 hospital visitors. Interventions: Screening and management of patients using a hospital-specific protocol, which included fever triage, monitoring visitors and patients, emergency response, personnel training for healthcare team members, health education for patients and family, medical materials management, disinfection and wastes disposal protocols. Results: Between 23 January and 28 February 2020, 73 people were identified as having fever plus respiratory signs with/without a history of exposure and were tested for the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) by our hospital...","Abstract The outbreak of the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has caused more than 100,000 people infected and thousands of deaths. Currently, the number of infections and deaths is still increasing rapidly. COVID-19 seriously threatens human health, production, life, social functioning and international relations. In the fight against COVID-19, Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and big data technologies have played an important role in many aspects, including the rapid aggregation of multi-source big data, rapid visualization of epidemic information, spatial tracking of confirmed cases, prediction of regional transmission, spatial segmentation of the epidemic risk and prevention level, balancing and management of the supply and demand of material resources, and social-emotional guidance and panic elimination, which provided solid spatial information support for decision-making, measures formulation, and effectiveness assessment of COVID-19 prevention and control. GIS has d...","A newly developed severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was further validated to confirm cutoff values and evaluate its diagnostic performance with clinical samples. In parallel, an immunochromatographic test was also evaluated. A total of 227 clinical serum specimens collected from SARS patients were used in the study, together with 385 samples from healthy donors. By use of an immunofluorescent (IF) test as the \u201cgold standard, \u201d both the ELISA and the immunochromatographic test were able to detect immunoglobulin G antibodies to SARS not only from late-convalescent-stage samples (&gt;21 days from the onset of clinical symptoms), as previously established, but also from early-acute-phase samples (1 to 10 days from onset). The ELISA, using an optical density (OD) of 0.25 as its cutoff value, produced the best sensitivity while maintaining high specificity. It detected SARS-specific antibodies in 58, 70, 75, and 95%, respectively, of the...","Abstract The coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 that has significant implications for the cardiovascular care of patients. First, those with COVID-19 and preexisting cardiovascular disease (CVD) have an increased risk of severe disease and death. Second, infection has been associated with multiple direct and indirect cardiovascular complications including acute myocardial injury, myocarditis, arrhythmias and venous thromboembolism. Third, therapies under investigation for COVID-19 may have cardiovascular side effects. Fourth, the response to COVID-19 can compromise the rapid triage of non-COVID-19 patients with cardiovascular conditions. Finally, the provision of cardiovascular care may place health care workers in a position of vulnerability as they become host or vectors of virus transmission. We hereby review the peer-reviewed and preprint literature pertaining to cardiovascular considerations relate...","Abstract A survey of rotavirus infection in a dairy herd with a history of neonatal diarrhoea was carried out. Faecal samples taken from 15 cows before and after calving as well as faeces taken from their calves daily from birth to two weeks of life were tested for rotavirus by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and compared with an ELISA and a latex agglutination commercial test. Rotavirus excretion was not detected in faeces from cows around parturition by any of the three tests. However, all of their calves shed rotaviruses during the observation period. The onset of rotavirus excretion determined by PAGE ranged from day 2 to day 8 of life (day 4.8\u00b1 1.8 on average) and lasted for 4 to 7 days (5.3\u00b11.1 days on average). Chi-square test showed a significant association (P=0.0001) between the presence of rotavirus and the altered consistency of calves faeces. All the three tests showed similar results (overall agreement 92.5%) but discrepancies were detected mainly at the beginni...","AbstractAn epidemic can be characterized by its speed (i.e., the exponential growth rate r) and strength (i.e., the reproductive number \u211b). Disease modelers have historically placed much more emphasis on strength, in part because the effectiveness of an intervention strategy is typically evaluated on this scale. Here, we develop a mathematical framework for this classic, strength-based paradigm and show that there is a corresponding speed-based paradigm which can provide complementary insights. In particular, we note that r = 0 is a threshold for disease spread, just like \u211b = 1, and show that we can measure the speed and strength of an intervention on the same scale as the speed and strength of an epidemic, respectively. We argue that, just as the strength-based paradigm provides the clearest insight into certain questions, the speed-based paradigm provides the clearest view in other cases. As an example, we show that evaluating the prospects of \u201ctest-and-treat\u201d interventions against t...","BACKGROUND Nucleic acid test and antibody assay have been employed in the diagnosis for SARS-CoV-2 infection, but the use of viral antigen for diagnosis has not been successfully developed. Theoretically, viral antigen is the specific marker of the virus and precedes antibody appearance within the infected population. There is a clear need of detection of viral antigen for rapid and early diagnosis. METHODS We included a cohort of 239 participants with suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection from 7 centers for the study. We measured nucleocapsid protein in nasopharyngeal swab samples in parallel with the nucleic acid test. Nucleic acid test was taken as the reference standard, and statistical evaluation was taken in blind. We detected nucleocapsid protein in 20 urine samples in another center, employing nasopharyngeal swab nucleic acid test as reference standard. RESULTS We developed a fluorescence immunochromatographic assay for detecting nucleocapsid protein of SARS-CoV-2 in nasopharyngeal sw...","Estimates suggest that COVID-19 will stress bed capacity, equipment, and health care personnel in U.S. hospitals in ways not previously experienced. How can health systems prepare to care for a large influx of patients with this disease?","Viral infections are common causes of respiratory tract disease in the outpatient setting but much less common in the intensive care unit. However, a finite number of viral agents cause respiratory tract disease in the intensive care unit. Some viruses, such as influenza, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), cytomegalovirus (CMV), and varicella-zoster virus (VZV), are relatively common. Others, such as adenovirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-coronavirus, Hantavirus, and the viral hemorrhagic fevers (VHFs), are rare but have an immense public health impact. Recognizing these viral etiologies becomes paramount in treatment, infection control, and public health measures. Therefore, a basic understanding of the pathogenesis of viral entry, replication, and host response is important for clinical diagnosis and initiating therapeutic options. This review discusses the basic pathophysiology leading to clinical presentations in a few common and rare, but important, viruses found in ...","Due to the limitation of rapid development of specific antiviral drug or vaccine for novel emerging viruses, an accurate and rapid diagnosis is a key to manage the virus spread. We developed an efficient and rapid method with high specificity for the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), based on one-pot reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (one-pot RT-LAMP). A set of six LAMP primers [F3, B3, FIP, BIP, LF (Loop-F), and LB (Loop-B)] were designed using the sequence of nucleocapsid (N) gene with optimized RT-LAMP enzyme conditions: 100 U M-MLV RTase and 4 U Bst polymerase, implying that the reaction was able to detect four infectious viral genome copies of MERS-CoV within a 60 min reaction time period. Significantly, EvaGreen dye has better signal read-out properties in one-pot RT-LAMP reaction and is more compatible with DNA polymerase than SYBR green I. Isothermally amplified specific N genes were further evaluated using field-deployable micr...","Abstract The geographic spread and rapid increase in the cases of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) caused by a novel coronavirus (MERS-CoV) during the past two months have raised concern about its pandemic potential. Here we call for the rapid development of an effective and safe MERS vaccine to control the spread of MERS-CoV.","Summary Globalisation and its effect on human development has rendered an environment that is conducive for the rapid international spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), and other new infectious diseases yet to emerge. After the unprecedented multi-country outbreak of avian influenza with human cases in the winter of 2003\u20132004, an influenza pandemic is a current threat. A critical review of problems and solutions encountered during the 2003\u20132004 SARS epidemics will serve as the basis for considering national preparedness steps that can be taken to facilitate the early detection of avian influenza, and a rapid response to an influenza pandemic should it occur.","The recent emergence of SARS-CoV-2 lead to a current pandemic of unprecedented levels. Though diagnostic tests are fundamental to the ability to detect and respond, many health systems are already experiencing shortages of reagents associated with this test. Here, testing a pooling approach for the standard RT-qPCR test, we find that a single positive sample can be detected even in pools of up to 32 samples, with an estimated false negative rate of 10%. Detection of positive samples diluted in even up to 64 samples may also be attainable, though may require additional amplification cycles. As it uses the standard protocols, reagents and equipment, this pooling method can be applied immediately in current clinical testing laboratories. We hope that such implementation of a pool test for COVID-19 would allow expanding current screening capacities thereby enabling the expansion of detection in the community, as well as in close integral groups, such as hospital departments, army units, or...","Summary Emerging infectious diseases arising from livestock and wildlife pose serious threats to global human health, as shown by a series of continuous outbreaks involving highly pathogenic influenza, SARS, Ebola and MERS. The risk of pandemics and bioterrorism threats is ever present and growing, but our ability to combat them is limited by the lack of available vaccines, therapeutics and rapid diagnostics. The use of high bio-containment facilities, such as the CSIRO Australian Animal Health Laboratory, plays a key role studying these dangerous pathogens and facilitates the development of countermeasures. To combat diseases like MERS, we must take a holistic approach that involves the development of early biomarkers of infection, a suite of treatment options (vaccines, anti-viral drugs and antibody therapeutics) and appropriate animal models to test the safety and efficacy of candidate treatments.","The past decade and a half has been characterized by numerous emerging infectious diseases. With each new threat, there has been a call for rapid vaccine development. Pathogens such as the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and the Zika virus represent either new viral entities or viruses emergent in new geographic locales and characterized by novel complications. Both serve as paradigms for the global spread that can accompany new pathogens. In this paper, we review the epidemiology and pathogenesis of MERS-CoV and Zika virus with respect to vaccine development. The challenges in vaccine development and the approach to clinical trial design to test vaccine candidates for disease entities with a changing epidemiology are discussed.","A recent outbreak of novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of COVID-19, has spread rapidly all over the world. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is another deadly virus and causes acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Rapid and early detection of these viruses will facilitate early intervention and reduce disease transmission risk. Here, we present an All-In-One Dual CRISPR-Cas12a (termed \"AIOD-CRISPR\") assay method for simple, rapid, ultrasensitive, one-pot, and visual detection of coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 and HIV virus. In our AIOD CRISPR assay, a pair of crRNAs was introduced to initiate dual CRISPR-Cas12a detection and improve detection sensitivity. The AIOD-CRISPR assay system was successfully utilized to detect nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) of SARS-CoV-2 and HIV with a sensitivity of few copies. Also, it was evaluated by detecting HIV-1 RNA extracted from human plasma samples, achieving a comparable sensitivity with real-time RT-PCR method. Thus, our method has a ...","To control the spread of Corona Virus Disease (COVID-19), screening large numbers of suspected cases for appropriate quarantine and treatment is a priority. Pathogenic laboratory testing is the diagnostic gold standard but it is time consuming with significant false negative results. Fast and accurate diagnostic methods are urgently needed to combat the disease. Based on COVID-19 radiographical changes in CT images, we aimed to develop a deep learning method that could extract COVID-19's graphical features in order to provide a clinical diagnosis ahead of the pathogenic test, thus saving critical time for disease control. Methods:We collected 1,119 CT images of pathogen-confirmed COVID-19 cases along with those previously diagnosed with typical viral pneumonia. We modified the Inception transfer-learning model to establish the algorithm, followed by internal and external validation. Results: The internal validation achieved a total accuracy of 89.5% with specificity of 0.88 and sensiti...","The current diagnosis of severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) relies on laboratory-based tests since its clinical features are nonspecific, unlike other respiratory pathogens. Therefore, the development of a rapid and simple method for on-site detection of SARS-CoV is crucial for the identification and prevention of future SARS outbreaks. In this study, a simple colorimetric and multiplex loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay was developed to rapid screening of severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV). It can be visually detected based on color change and monitored in real-time with fluorescent signals. The performance of this assay, based on six primers targeting open reading frame (ORF1b) and nucleocapsid (N) genes located in different regions of the SARS-CoV, was compared with real-time RT-PCR assay using various concentrations of target genes. The detection limit of the LAMP assay was comparable to that of real...","Abstract Health planning and policy seek to create a group of mutually interacting bodies to produce goods and services to meet the health needs of a population. Recent developments in the health status of the population are characterized by continuous improvement in life expectancy, chronic diseases which absorb 90% of total health care expenditure, differences in the causes of mortality (more than 70% mortality from cancer, heart and brain, and external causes). The new trends in health indicators define the current health policies and lead to the necessity of adapting the health system so as to meet the changing health needs of the population. Especially in the context of the changes in the epidemiological spectrum and the variability in the indices of morbidity and mortality, the focus is not only to further prolong life expectancy but also to improve life expectancy without chronic diseases and without disabilities and to reduce the avoidable mortality, the potential years of life...","During the current COVID-19 pandemic, testing kit and RNA extraction kit availability has become a major limiting factor in the ability to determine patient disease status and accurately quantify prevalence. Current testing strategies rely on individual tests of cases matching restrictive diagnostic criteria to detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA, limiting testing of asymptomatic and mild cases. Testing these individuals is one effective way to understand and reduce the spread of COVID-19. Here, we develop a pooled testing strategy to identify these low-risk individuals. Drawing on the well-studied group testing literature, modeling suggests practical changes to testing protocols which can reduce test costs and stretch a limited test kit supply. When most tests are negative, pooling reduces the total number of tests up to four-fold at 2% prevalence and eight-fold at 0.5% prevalence. At current SARS-CoV-2 prevalence, randomized group testing optimized per country could double the number of tested ind...","Background COVID-19 is leading to the implementation of social distancing policies around the world and in the United States, including school closures. The evidence that mandatory school closures reduce cases and ultimately mortality mostly comes from experience with influenza or from models that do not include the impact of school closure on the healthcare labor supply or the role of the healthcare labor force in reducing the per infection mortality from the pathogen. There is considerable uncertainty of the incremental effect of school closures on transmission and lives saved from school closures. The likely, but uncertain, benefits from school closure need to be weighed against uncertain, and seldom quantified, costs of healthcare worker absenteeism associated with additional child care obligations. Methods We analyze data from the US Current Population Survey to measure the potential child care obligations for US healthcare workers that will need to be addressed if school closures...","Abstract In the present work, a single-step purification of recombinant nucleocapsid protein (NP) of the Newcastle disease virus (NDV) directly from unclarified feedstock using an expanded bed adsorption chromatography (EBAC) was developed. Streamline 25 column (ID=25mm) was used as a contactor and Streamline chelating adsorbent immobilized with Ni2+ ion was used as affinity adsorbent. The dynamic binding capacity of Ni2+-loaded Streamline chelating adsorbent for the NP protein in unclarified feedstock was found to be 2.94mg ml\u22121 adsorbent at a superficial velocity of 200cm h\u22121. The direct purification of NP protein from unclarified feedstock using expanded bed adsorption has resulted in a 31% adsorption and 9.6% recovery of NP protein. The purity of the NP protein recovered was about 70% and the volume of processing fluid was reduced by a factor of 10. The results of the present study show that the IMA-EBAC developed could be used to combine the clarification, concentration and initia...","An analysis of the time evolution of the 2019-nCoV outbreak event in Italy is proposed and is based on the preliminary data at disposal (till March 11th, 2020) on one side, and on an epidemiological model recently used to describe the same epidemic event in the Wuhan region (February 2020) on the other side. The equations of the model include the description of compartments like Susceptible (S), exposed (E), infectious but not yet symptomatic (pre-symptomatic) (A), infectious with symptoms (I), hospitalized (H) and recovered (R). Further stratification includes quarantined susceptible (Sq), isolated exposed (Eq) and isolated infected (Iq) compartments. The equations are numerically solved for boundary (initial) conditions tuned on the Italian event. The role of quarantine is specifically emphasized and supports the strategies adopted providing a numerical description of the effects.","Abstract Background Rapid virological diagnosis is needed to limit the length of isolation for suspected COVID-19 cases. Method We managed the first 280 patients suspected to have COVID-19 through a rapid care circuit and virological diagnosis in our infectious disease reference hospital in Marseille, France. Rapid viral detection was performed on sputum and nasopharyngeal samples. Results Over our study period, no SARS-CoV-2 was detected. Results were obtained within approximately three hours of the arrival of patient samples at the laboratory. Other viral infections were identified in 49% of the patients, with most common pathogens being influenza A and B viruses, rhinovirus, metapneumovirus and common coronaviruses, notably HKU1 and NL63. Conclusion Early recognition of COVID-19 is critical to isolate confirmed cases and prevent further transmission. Early rule-out of COVID-19 allows public health containment measures to be adjusted by reducing the time spent in isolation.","AbstractThe rapid sharing of sequence information as seen throughout the current SARS-CoV-2 epidemic, represents an inflection point for genomic epidemiology. Here we describe aspects of coronavirus evolutionary genetics revealed from these data, and provide the first direct RNA sequence of SARS-CoV-2, detailing coronaviral subgenome-length mRNA architecture.","R\u00e9sum\u00e9 Les tests de d\u00e9pistage rapide (TDR) bas\u00e9s sur la technique d\u2019immunochromatographie sont tr\u00e8s r\u00e9pandus pour le diagnostic des maladies infectieuses.

Scientific and technological advancements have revolutionized the field of veterinary diagnostics. Genome sequencing has allowed efficient, sensitive, and specific diagnostic assays to be developed based on the detection of nucleic acids. The integration of advances in biochemistry, proteomics, engineering, and medicine offers enormous potential for the rapid and accurate diagnosis of viral, microbial, genetic, and metabolic disease. In the future, polymerase chain reaction assays, microarray testing, genomic analysis, and metabolic profiling will be accomplished in a rapid, portable, sensitive, and cost-efficient manner.","We describe the benefit of using reconstructed ancestral sequences (RAS) on resequencing microarrays for rapid pathogen identification, with Enterobacteriaceae rpoB sequences as a model. Our results demonstrate a sharp improvement of call rate and accuracy when using RASs as compared to extant sequences. This improvement was attributed to the lower sequence divergence of RASs, which also expanded the sequence space covered by the microarray. Extension of this novel microarray design strategy to viruses, antimicrobial resistance elements or toxins is straightforward.","Abstract Objectives To develop and test machine learning-based CT radiomics models for predicting hospital stay in patients with pneumonia associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Design Cross-sectional Setting Multicenter Participants A total of 52 patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and their initial CT images were enrolled from 5 designated hospitals in Ankang, Lishui, Zhenjiang, Lanzhou, and Linxia between January 23, 2020 and February 8, 2020. As of February 20, patients remained in hospital or with non-findings in CT were excluded. Therefore, 31 patients with 72 lesion segments were included in the final analysis. Intervention CT radiomics models based on logistic regression (LR) and random forest (RF) were developed on features extracted from pneumonia lesions in training and inter-validation datasets. The predictive performance was further evaluated in test dataset on lung lobe- and patients-level. Main outcomes Short-term hospital stay (\u226410 days) and long-term...","BACKGROUND: Coronaviruses (CoVs) are large ribonucleic acid (RNA) viruses causing primarily respiratory disease in humans. A novel human coronavirus, subsequently named middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), was first reported in Saudi Arabia in September of 2012. With increasing numbers of infections and deaths from MERS-CoV, development of a rapid and reliable kit was crucial to prevent further spread of MERS-CoV. OBJECTIVES: In this study, we present two real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) assays for in-house rapid and sensitive diagnostic testing of MERS-CoV, detecting the regions upstream of the envelope gene (upE) and open reading frame (ORF) 1b, respectively, for initial screening and final confirmation of MERS-CoV infection, as recommended by the world health organization (WHO). MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this experimental study, acquiring patient samples was difficult; thus, according to WHO recommendations and standard protocol...","Background The novel coronavirus COVID19 has been classified by the World Health Organisation as a pandemic due to its worldwide spread. The ability of countries to contain and control transmission is critical in the absence of a vaccine. We evaluated a range of social distancing measures to determine which strategies are most effective in reducing the peak daily infection rate, and consequential pressure on the health care system. Methods Using COVID19 transmission data from the outbreak source in Hubei Province, China, collected prior to activation of containment measures, we adapted an established individual based simulation model of the city of Newcastle, Australia, population 272,409. Simulation of virus transmission in this community model without interventions provided a baseline from which to compare alternative social distancing strategies. The infection history of each individual was determined, as was the time infected. From this model generated data, the rate of growth in c...","Background: The SARS-CoV-2 shares 74.5% genome identity with SARS-CoV, both exhibiting a similar well conserved structure. Therefore, antibodies produced in COVID-19 and SARS patients should not be that dissimilar. We evaluated SARS-CoV test assays to detect for the presence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 and tried to determine the timing of appearance of these antibodies by testing serial sera from these patients. Methods: Tests were carried out using ELISA (total antibodies) and indirect immunofluorescence (IIFA) (IgM &amp; IgG) methods on serial sera from patients confirmed with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Results: Cross-reactivity was seen in these two test assays with sera from COVID-19 patients and was detected in 6 out of 7 patients from 7 days after onset of symptoms. Five of the patients had detectable antibodies by the 3rd week into their illness and there was evidence of seroconversion in 4 patients. The IIFA method was marginally more sensitive compared to the ELISA assay, however the I...","Background: COVID-19 could have even more dire consequences among refugees living in camps than in general populations. Bangladesh has confirmed COVID-19 cases and hosts almost 1 million Rohingya refugees from Myanmar with 600,000 concentrated in Kutupalong-Balukhali Expansion Site. Projections of the potential COVID-19 infection burden, epidemic speed, and healthcare needs in such settings are critical to inform preparedness planning. Methods: To explore the potential impact of the introduction of SARS-CoV-2 in Kutupalong-Balukhali Expansion Site, we used a stochastic disease transmission model with parameters derived from emerging literature. We considered three scenarios with different assumptions about the transmission potential of SARS-CoV-2. We estimated the number and daily rate of infections, hospitalizations, deaths, and healthcare needs expected under each scenario. Findings: A large-scale outbreak is highly likely after a single introduction of the virus into the camp across...","The ability to detect an infectious agent in a widespread epidemic is crucial to the success of quarantine efforts in addition to sensitive and accurate screening of potential cases of infection from patients in a clinical setting. Enabling testing outside of sophisticated laboratories broadens the scope of control and surveillance efforts, but also requires robust and simple methods that can be used without expensive instrumentation. Here we report a method to identify SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) virus RNA from purified RNA or cell lysis using loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) using a visual, colorimetric detection. This test was additionally verified using RNA samples purified from respiratory swabs collected from COVID-19 patients in Wuhan, China with equivalent performance to a commercial RT-qPCR test while requiring only heating and visual inspection. This simple and sensitive method provides an opportunity to facilitate virus detection in the field without a requirement for...","ABSTRACTA fully Integrated Micropillar Polydimethylsiloxane Accurate CRISPR Detection (IMPACT) system is developed for viral DNA detection. This powerful system is patterned with high-aspect ratio micropillars to enhance reporter probe binding. After surface modification and probe immobilization, CRISPR Cas12a/crRNA complex is injected into the fully enclosed system. With the presence of double-stranded DNA target, the CRISPR enzyme is activated and non-specifically cleaves the ssDNA reporters initially immobilized on the micropillars. This collateral cleavage releases fluorescence dyes into the assay, and the intensity is linearly proportional to the target DNA concentration ranging from 0.1 to 10 nM. Importantly, this system does not rely on traditional dye-quencher labeled probe thus eliminating the fluorescence background presented in the assay. Furthermore, our one-step detection protocol is performed at isothermal conditions (37\u00b0C) without using complicated and time-consuming off...","Abstract Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) is caused by a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV). Coronaviruses including SARS-CoV encode an envelope (E) protein, a small, hydrophobic membrane protein. We report that, in planar lipid bilayers, synthetic peptides corresponding to the SARS-CoV E protein forms ion channels that are more permeable to monovalent cations than to monovalent anions. Affinity-purified polyclonal antibodies recognizing the N-terminal 19 residues of SARS-CoV E protein were used to establish the specificity of channel formation by inhibiting the ion currents generated in the presence of the E protein peptides.","Abstract Introduction Influenza is a common respiratory infectious disease affecting population worldwide yearly.

The reactivities of the recombinant proteins to a panel of antibodies containing 33 SARS coronavirus-positive sera and 66 negative sera and to antibodies against other animal coronaviruses were screened. A truncated 195-amino-acid fragment from the C terminus of the nucleocapsid protein (N195) was identified that had a strong ability to detect antibodies against SARS coronavirus. No cross-reaction was found between the N195 protein and antibodies against chicken, pig, and canine coronaviruses. The N195 protein was used to develop a Western blot assay to detect antibodi...","The sudden outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2002 prompted the establishment of a global scientific network subsuming most of the traditional rivalries in the competitive field of virology. Within months of the SARS outbreak, collaborative work revealed the identity of the disastrous pathogen as SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV). However, although the rapid identification of the agent represented an important breakthrough, our understanding of the deadly virus remains limited. Detailed biological knowledge is crucial for the development of effective countermeasures, diagnostic tests, vaccines and antiviral drugs against the SARS-CoV. This article reviews the present state of molecular knowledge about SARS-CoV, from the aspects of comparative genomics, molecular biology of viral genes, evolution, and epidemiology, and describes the diagnostic tests and the anti-viral drugs derived so far based on the available molecular information.","Abstract The recent pneumonia outbreak caused by a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) in Chinais posing a great threat to global public health. Therefore, rapid and a accurate identification of pathogenic viruses plays a vital role in selecting appropriate treatments, saving people\u2019s lives and preventing epidemics. It is important to establish a quick standard diagnostic test for the detection of the infectious disease (COVID-19) to prevent subsequent secondary spread. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is regarded as a gold standard test for the molecular diagnosis of viral and bacterial infections with high sensitivity and specificity. Isothermal nucleic acid amplification is considered to be a highly promising candidate method due to its fundamental advantage in quick procedure time at constant temperature without thermocycler operation. A variety of improved or new approaches also have been developed.

The ZStat Flu, QuickVue Influenza, and Binax Now FluA and FluB are currently CLIA-waived which allows for in-clinic testing. The features of the different assays have been summarized recently (Nicholson et al., 2003) . Unfortunately, reported sensitivities and specificities of these various tests cannot be directly compared, since different 'gold standards', source populations, sample types (fresh versus frozen; nasal versus throat), and operators (i.e. research laboratory versus clinical laboratory versus physician office) were used to evaluate each test. Use of a particular rapid diagnostic test for influenza should be determined according to the level of identification needed (influenza A or B versus influenza A and B), price, CLIA status, specimen type, staff familiarity with methods, turn-around-time, and relative sensitivity and specificity of the test. Additionally, the predictive value depends on the prevalence of disease. For example, if the sensitivity and specificity of the test was 80%, and the prevalence of influenza was 5%, the positive predictive value (PPV) of the test would be 17%; if the prevalence was 20%, the PPV would be 50%. Rapid testing is best used in individuals with a strong pre-test probability of influenza during the influenza season. When clinically important (for example, in hospitalized patients), negative rapid test results should be confirmed by culture.","Influenza is usually diagnosed using clinical features during the influenza season. Rapid testing by either immunofluorescence or immunoassay has the advantage of providing same-day diagnosis; however, it does not have the same sensitivity as culture. There are various rapid tests on the market. Some detect influenza but cannot distinguish influenza A from B. Others detect both and can distinguish them. Nasal samples provide a higher level of sensitivity than do throat samples when performing rapid testing. The positive and negative predictive value of the rapid tests depends on the level of influenza activity in the population being tested. Patients who have a clinical picture highly suggestive of influenza but with a negative rapid test should still be cultured, because false negatives do occur [4, 12] . Viral culture is necessary to subtype influenza as well as to perform drug sensitivities.","Effective planning for pandemic influenza and the global vaccine supply will require the skills of experts in virology, epidemiology and vaccination. Equally important, however, will be the skills of experts in politics, economics and law. Coordinating their efforts at an international level will be very difficult. That the task must be undertaken cannot be questioned. Because the health benefits of its success are certain, the challenge it presents is extraordinarily compelling. 5.6. How good are the rapid diagnostic tests really? (Peter Wright, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN and Ruth Karron, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD) Rapid diagnostic tests for respiratory viral illness has become an increasingly important tool because of the advent of effective antiviral agents that are maximally effective if started early in the course of the illness, the need to isolate patients who could pass their infection to other ill patients, and the need to differentiate between these viral illnesses and other respiratory tract pathogens, including bioterrorism agents. However, currently available rapid testing has many limitations. Areas of improvement that need to be addressed include the ability to test for all or most know agents, improved collection methods, improved integration of diagnosis with use of medications and clinical care, use of diagnostics for epidemiology and vaccine development, increased sensitivity in adults and immunocompromised patients, and improved ease and accuracy of testing.","New technological developments including microfluidics, nanotechnology, and lab-on-a-chip technologies have enabled development of user-friendly, easy, and quick point-of-care molecular tests including Alere i (Alere Inc.) and Cobas Liat (Roche Molecular Systems). In the setting of emerging infectious diseases, rapid and accurate identification of the causative agent is critical to facilitate effective patient management and enable prompt initiation of infection controls. Point-of-care assays are especially needed in resource-limited settings and in situations with lack of access to centralized medical facilities. Further development of point-of-care molecular tests for emerging pathogens is critical to timely diagnosis, treatment, and subsequent control of emerging infectious disease.","The management of patient flow and bed allocation is an important element in an effective infection control programme for viral Influenza infection [1]. An effective programme requires results of screening tests to be available to make decisions in a timely manner that suit the flow of newly admitted patients through the Hospital. This is difficult with laboratory-based testing, especially at weekends and evenings where limited on-call services may only be available [2]. The nicking enzyme nucleic acid (NEAR) isothermal amplification technique enables rapid amplification in a very narrow temperature range. This eliminates the need for thermal cyclers with the high-temperature DNA denaturation cycle required for polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The low-footprint bench-top instruments can provide results in 15 min in a near-patient setting. It has been previously demonstrated that POCT leads to rapid confirmation of influenza and allows informed early decision making, reducing flu contacts and bed closures [3].","While some might see tradeoffs between interventions to stem current epidemics and investments in health systems for the future, these two notions can coexist. Indeed, building systems that provide high-quality care in crisis can be used to provide effective critical care disease management and chronic care once the epidemic has subsided. The HIV epidemic is an important example of how quality, system-based interventions in times of disease outbreak can serve a country\u2019s healthcare system as a whole.","Objectives: Molecular assays for the diagnosis of fungal infection from clinical specimens are increasingly described. However, the extent to which these are adopted by clinical staff and, critically, the extent to which their results impact therapeutic decisions is not well described. Such information is important to justify the cost of developing and delivering novel diagnostic tests. The aim of this study was to evaluate the extent to which a clinically validated PCR assay for candidaemia impacted antifungal drug prescribing. Method: A prospective observational study was conducted in a mixed 17-bed ICU in which the assay, with turn-around-time of 24-hours, was made available for a period of six months. Physicians were encouraged to use the assay particularly when considering prescribing an antifungal drug in the context of probable Candida infection. Each assay request was recorded, as well as whether the patient received an antifungal drug within 72hr of the test request and whether this prescribing decision reflected the test result. When the prescribing decision and assay result were discordant, a reason for this was sought. Results: In all, 55 PCR tests were requested on 45 patients. Overall, the PCR test appeared to strongly influence the prescribing decision in 44 (80%) instances whether negative or positive. An antifungal drug was prescribed within 72hr of PCR requesting in 14 (25%) instances; of these PCR requests, 4 were positive and a further one was from a patient who had a positive blood culture within 72hr of a negative PCR. For the remaining nine PCR-negative patients who received an antifungal drug, various factors were considered to over-rule the PCR test; these included drug prescribed prior to test ordering, compliance with the ward prophylaxis policy and high likelihood of infection as determined by extant pre-emptive prescribing practice. Conclusions: While the availability of the rapid molecular assay displayed substantial capacity to modify antifungal drug prescribing in certain circumstances, it is clear that physician behaviour cannot be completely influenced by a single test result regardless of other factors. Indeed it is unlikely that this is desirable, given that no test has been shown to perform with 100% reliability. Nonetheless, rapid diagnostic methods may help to improve antifungal conservation and their contribution to the 'model' therapeutic algorithm merits further evaluation.","It is worth noting that over the past 20 years, the development and refinement of real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) has enhanced the clinician\u2019s ability to diagnose an array of viruses rapidly and accurately. Multiplex RT-PCR testing analyzes a single sample for multiple viral agents and subtypes simultaneously, producing sensitive and specific results in a short period of time (58). Even with the 2009 influenza A (H1N1) virus pandemic, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) quickly modified standard PCR assays to detect the new virus (59). A challenge to routine RT-PCR testing in all patients who present with viral symptoms is the prohibitive cost, need for specialized equipment, and the relatively longer time between sampling and availability of results (60). Furthermore, PCRs detect viral genes that are used as a surrogate measurement of whole virions. In some instances, viral gene detection may actually reflect non-replicating, non-infectious virions. Newer rapid point-of-care PCRs are currently being developed, but their implications for clinical decision making remain uncertain (61). In addition, rapid antigen detection tests (RADT) are also available commercially for detection of both RSV and influenza virus infection in the outpatient and emergency department settings (62, 63). However, in a recent study by Moesker et al., RADTs were found to have relatively low sensitivity compared to RT-PCR testing which limits their use for clinical decision making (64). Nonetheless, RADT maybe a valuable tool, especially during an outbreak, because it is a point-of-care test that is easy to use with a rapid turnaround time (65). Since clinical symptoms for different viral respiratory infections are often the same, and with the limitations of our current testing methods, it is critical that clinicians obtain microbiology data early, especially in the risk population (66\u201369).","The GenoType \u00ae Cdiff assay for the direct detection of Clostridium difficile and major ribotypes from stool shows rapid, sensitive and specific results. The DNA isolation is fully automated. The turnaround time (including hands on time) is approximately 1.5 hours for DNA isolation, 2 hours for amplification and 2 hours for hybridization. The assay provides more information (ribotypes, toxins, binary toxins and Moxifloxacin resistance) as any presently available commercial CD test. Objectives: Implementation of rapid molecular diagnostics in bloodstream infections could significantly improve speed of diagnosis, and thereby outcome. Current molecular tests directly on whole blood samples have suboptimal sensitivity, due to the use of small volumes. Larger volumes show an inhibitory effect of human DNA. The Sepsitest\u2122-assay (Molzym, Germany) incorporates a pre-test enrichment method, which selectively eliminates human cells. This may lead to an increase in input volume and subsequent diagnostic sensitivity. We investigated the use of this assay in a cohort of patient with sepsis on the ICU.","Comparison of two different stool antigen tests for the primary diagnosis of Helicobacter pylori infection in Turkish dyspeptic patients B. Kocazeybek, Y. Erzin, S. Altun, A. Dobrucali, M. Aslan, S. Erdamar, A. Dirican (Istanbul, TR) Aim: To assess the reliability of two different enzyme immunoassays in detecting the Helicobacter pylori(Hp) status in stool specimens of Turkish dyspeptic patients. Materials and methods: 151 patients [74 with non-ulcer dyspepsia(NUD), 64 with duodenal ulcer(DU),13 with gastric cancer]who were admitted to the endoscopy unit of Istanbul University, Cerrahpasa Medical Faculty for upper gastrointestinal endoscopy due to dyspepsia were enrolled in the study. Hp infection was confirmed in all patients by histology, rapid urease test(RUT) and culture. A patient was classified as being Hp-positive if the culture alone or both histology, RUT were positive in the absence of a positive culture and as negative only if all of these tests remained negative. Stool samples of patients were obtained in order to assess the reliability of a monoclonal (FemtoLab H. pylori, Connex, Martinsried, Germany) and a polyclonal (Premier Platinum HpSA, Meridian Diagnostics Inc., Cincinnati, USA) stool antigen test and to compare their diagnostic accuracies. The v 2 test was used for statistical comparison of the values. Results: Using a cutoff 0.19 for FemtoLab H. pylori and 0.16 for Premier Platinum HpSA the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV) and diagnostic accuracy of the former and latter tests were 93%, 90%, 98%, 68%, 93% and 84 %, 67%, 94%, 40%, 81% respectively. The sensitivity, specificity, NPV and diagnostic accuracy of the former test were significantly superior to the latter one's (v 2 = 3.98; p &lt; 0.05 for sensitivity and v 2 = 15.67; p = 0.000 for specificity, v 2 = 15.78; p = 0.000 for NPV and v 2 = 6.37; p = 0.012 for diagnostic accuracy). The bacterial load did not affect the sensitivity of both tests. Conclusions: The monoclonal FemtoLab H. pylori, using a cutoff 0.19 is a very sensitive, specific and easy to perform diagnostic tool for the primary diagnosis of Hp infection in Turkish, dyspeptic patients.","The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is . https://doi.org/10. 1101 /2020 Performance of the AI algorithm during test 250 From Zhongshan Hospital Xiamen University, and the fifth Hospital of Wuhan, 29201 251 CT scan images were collected from the following patients: 50 cases of COVID-19 252 pneumonia, 52 cases of non-COVID-19 viral pneumonia, 53 cases of bacterial 253 pneumonia, 54 cases of pulmonary tuberculosis, 100 cases of normal lung, were 254 employed to develop the model (Table 1) . Multi-class comparison was performed 255 between COVID-19, non-COVID-19 viral pneumonia, bacterial pneumonia, 256 pulmonary tuberculosis, and normal lung. Confusion matrix of the AI framework 257 based on test dataset was shown in Figure 2 . Binary classification between COVID-19 258 and the other four types, including non-COVID-19 viral pneumonia, bacterial 259 pneumonia, pulmonary tuberculosis and normal lung, was also implemented to 260 evaluate the performance of recognizing COVID-19.

The ROC curve was 263 generated to evaluate the AI algorithm's ability to distinguish COVID-19 from other 264 four types. The area under the ROC curve was 99.0% (Figure 2 the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.","Reporting delay of cases is a common obstacle for real-time risk assessment and management of epidemics. In continuously updated epidemic curves, case numbers for the most recent epidemic week or day usually appear to be lower than the previous, suggesting a decline of the epidemic. In reality however, the epidemic curve may still be on the rise, because reporting delay prevents the most recent cases to already appear in the case count. This phenomenon often introduces misperceptions in the general public and in media coverage as can again be seen in the current COVID-19 epidemic. 1 Reporting delay can be decomposed into several parts: (a) the time passing from symptom onset until the patient seeks medical service, (b) the time passing between this service and initiation of a laboratory test, (c) the time between this test initiation and completion of its result, (d) the time between test completion and its registration at the local health authority level and (e) the time passing from transmitting the case report from that local level to the (usually national) health authority level that will generate and publish the epidemic curve. 2 Technology and rapid procedures can minimize the delay occurring from the first contact with the health care system and appearance of a case in the daily case count at national level, but they can hardly reduce the delay between appearance of first symptoms and contact to the health care service. 2 The latter is subject to a variety of factors such as severity of the disease, public awareness for it, individual benefit to seek health services, accessibility to those services, some of which may also be subject to change during an epidemic. For all those reasons, reporting delay is not only specific to a country and its surveillance and health care system, but to the disease in questions and the phase of the epidemic.","Diagnostic tests for 2019-nCoV are already available internationally. As a marker of global forward planning, the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium has prepared standard forms and these were used to record data in the Lancet report on initially affected patients [5] . The ECDC and the WHO Regional Office for Europe are coordinating the rapid reporting of data [9] . Public health measures in place in China since late January include bans on travel from the city of Wuhan, with overall 15 cities -a population of 57 million -under full or partial travel lockdown [11] , major sporting events cancelled and gatherings banned, including for weddings and birthdays, and limits on how many family members can leave home each day. On 28th January 2020, Hong Kong announced closure of many border crossings with mainland China [8] . USA, Japan, Russia and Australia and many other countries have now closed their borders to arrivals from China. Checks are now in place at many international airports for symptoms and fever in travelers from China, with international 14 day quarantine for travellers at risk. With remarkable speed, new 10 0 0 bed containment hospital for suspected coronavirus cases was built and opened in Wuhan on 3rd February and a further new 1500 bed hospital is under construction.","The potential benefits of school closures must be balanced with the costs. Smith et al., Lempel, Epstein, and Hammond, and Adda analyze the economic impacts of school closures. 1, 6, 7 Schooling is one of the most important investments we make in our children's futures, and we do not have good estimates of how prolonged school closures influence drop-out rates and future earnings. This uncertainty makes a holistic assessment of tradeoffs challenging.","Prevention of gastric cancer by H. pylori eradication P. Malfertheiner (Magdeburg, DE) In the light of the most recent clinical developments in the management of H. pylori infection, the European Helicobacter Study Group (EHSG) organized the Maastricht III Consensus Report that involved 50 participants from 26 countries around the world. This abstract provides a brief summary of some novel and major aspects relevant for clinician routine. In the new edition of the Maastricht guidelines three areas have been addressed: (a) Indications/contraindications for H. pylori eradication, with special focus on dyspepsia, patients exposed to NSAIDs or Aspirin, and the relationship with GERD; (b) Diagnostic procedures-Standard and rescue therapy of H. pylori infection and (c) Prevention of gastric cancer and other compli-cations related to H. pylori. Selected recommendations and statements are listed as follows: (a) Indications/contraindications for H. pylori eradication and relevant statements. Uninvestigated dyspepsia: H. pylori test and treat is an appropriate option for patients with uninvestigated dyspepsia. NSAIDs: (i) In patients who are na\u00efve NSAIDs users, H. pylori eradication may partially prevent peptic ulcers and/or bleeding; (ii) In patients on long term NSAIDs and peptic ulcer and/or ulcer bleeding, PPI maintenance therapy is superior to H. pylori eradication in preventing ulcer recurrence and/or bleeding. Aspirin: Patients who are on long-term aspirin with ulcer disease and significant clinical bleeding should be tested for H. pylori and if positive receive eradication therapy. GERD: H. pylori eradication does not cause GERD. Atrophic gastritis: H. pylori eradication halts the extension of atrophic gastritis and may lead to regression of atrophy. The effect on intestinal metaplasia is uncertain. Iron Deficiency Anaemia: H. pylori infection should be sought for and treated in patients with unexplained iron deficiency anaemia.(b) Diagnosis of H. pylori infection:(i) The non-invasive tests that can be used for the test and treat strategy are UBT and the stool antigen tests. Certain kits for serology with high accuracy can also be applied; (ii) PPI is a source of false negative diagnostic tests except serology, PPI should be stopped for at least 2 weeks before to perform diagnostic test and (iii) it is recommended to follow up patients after H. pylori eradication with UBT, if available. If this diagnostic procedure is not available, a laboratory-based stool test, preferably using monoclonal antibodies, could be used (c) Prevention of gastric cancer: (i) H. pylori eradication prevents development of preneoplastic changes (intestinal metaplasia, atrophic gastritis) of the gastric mucosa; (ii) eradication of H. pylori has the potential to reduce the risk of gastric cancer development and (iii) the optimal time to eradicate H. pylori is before preneoplastic conditions (atrophy, intestinal metaplasia) are present Treatment strategy: First line therapy for H. pylori eradication: PPI-clarithromycin -amoxicillin or metronidazole therapy remains the recommended first line therapy in populations with less than 15-20% clarithromycin resistance prevalence in population in less than 40% metronidazole resistance prevalence PPI-clarithromycin -metronidazole is preferable. Quadruple therapies are alternative first line therapies. In case of failure -second line therapy: Bismuth-based quadruple therapies remain the best second line therapy, if available, if not, PPI-Amoxicillin or tetracycline and metronidazole are recommended. Subsequent failures -rescue therapy: The rescue therapy should be based on antimicrobial susceptibility testing New diagnostic techniques for the microbiological laboratory and general practitioner S36 Breakthroughs in bacterial detection, identification and typing M. Struelens (Brussels, BE) In 2005, a number of novel methods applicable in the clinical microbiology laboratory have been reported for the detection, identification to species level and sub-typing of bacterial pathogens. Breakthroughs have been made in rapid detection of bloodstream infections in neonates and adult patients with sepsis by use of broad range bacterial DNA detection and identification. Successful methods include universal gene analysis by real-time PCR, PCR-DNA micro-array hybridization, or PCR-pyrosequencing testing of blood specimens. Also, several highly accurate sequence-based methods were developed and validated for identification of clinical cultures of staphylococci, mycobacteria, nocardia, and Burkholderia species. Progress has also been achieved in rapid detection of carriers of multi-resistant bacteria, especially methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) from superficial swabs. Several chromogenic selective culture media have shown sensitivity of 80-90% with excellent specificity for MRSA detection within 20-24 hours of incubation. Real-time PCR based on the orfX-SCCmec junction has shown similar accuracy for MRSA detection within 2 hours after specimen collection. For tuberculosis, advances were made in rapid detection, identification to species level and detection of rifampin and isoniazid resistance directly in clinical specimens by molecular methods, including PCR-pyrosequencing. Epidemiological typing has benefited greatly from the extension and validation of sequence-based systems and databases, including novel MLST schemes for Acinetobacter and B. cepacia complex. Single nucleotide polymorphism analysed by rapid methods like real-time PCR with melt curve analysis or allele-specific PCR have been developed for E.coli and Campylobacter. VNTR-MLVA schemes have also been validated for rapid typing of several human pathogens. In general, most publications focus on the ''proof of concept'' of these rapid and highly informative molecular assays at the level of clinical accuracy. There is however, too few evaluation of the clinical utility/superiority of these assays in routine application in terms of cost-effectiveness of medical/public health interventions based on test results. Thus, the need for funding this kind of intervention research should urgently be addressed by health technology assessment authorities.","Covid-19's global spread is triggering a range of public health responses. School closures are some of the highest-profile social distancing measures employed to slow the spread of an infectious disease. Japan recently instituted a nationwide school closure, which drew a swift response from families scrambling to make alternative childcare arrangements. South Korea, Italy, and some US school districts have closed schools. School closures prevent contacts among children and reduce cases. But, there is a downside to closing schools, even if the only goal is saving lives during an epidemic. Closing schools can inadvertently cause child care shortages that strain the healthcare system. Lempel et al. estimated that the child care obligations associated with school closure could reduce key medical personnel by 6-19%. 1 Here, we use the recent years (2018-2020) of the US Current Population Survey to estimate the school closure induced child care obligations for the US healthcare labor force. Approximately 29% of US households with a healthcare worker have at least one school-aged child age 3-12, who requires child care. Child care obligations are especially high and relatively inflexible in households where a parent is a nurse or medical assistant. Understanding these tradeoffs are important in planning the public health response to COVID-19, because if the survival of infected patients is sufficiently sensitive to declines in the healthcare labor force, then school closures could increase deaths.","Background: The GeneXpert test is a new automated molecular test which detects the DNA in Mycobacterium Tuberculosis (MTB), as well as testing for the genetic mutations associated with resistance to the drug Rifampicin (RIF). Some organizations have claimed that the GeneXpert test is going to revolutionize the diagnosis and care of patient with MTB. It provides results directly from sputum specimen in less than 2 hours. WHO recommended that the test should be used as the initial diagnosis test in individuals suspected of having Multi-Drug Resistant Tuberculosis (MDR TB). The purpose of our study was to assess the performance to detection of drug resistant MTB of the GeneXpert Test compared to conventional culture methods when implemented into the normal clinical workflow of a regional hospital in south Taiwan. Methods: WHO emphasized that the GeneXpert MTB/RIF test does not eliminate the need for conventional microscopy culture and drug sensitivity testing (DST), as it detects both live and dead bacteria. We assessed the performance of GeneXpert test from April 2015 to April 2017 with all of new directly sputum smear acidfast bacilli (AFB) stain positive tuberculosis suspects. Each new AFB smear-positive patient's specimen was processed with reflecting GeneXpert test and then sent to our referral laboratory for conventional MTB culture and DST. Results: A total of 40 patients with suspected pulmonary MTB who had a smear positive AFB sputum specimen were enrolled into the study. Among these 40 patients, 39(97.5%) had no prior history of MTB and 1(0.25%) were retreatment MTB case. Overall, 32(80%) samples were culture positive, 8(20%) samples were culture negative. Both GeneXpert and conventional DST revealed 32 (100%) MTB isolates had no RIF resistance. There was 100% agreement between the GeneXpert and conventional DST results in detecting RIF resistance MTB. Conclusion: This study showed and verified the accuracy of GeneXpert test, and this result was similar to those of some early experimental findings and previous reports. The main advantages of the GeneXpert test are, for diagnosis, reliability when compared to sputum microscopy and the speed of getting the result when compared with culture. For diagnosis of MTB, although sputum microscopy is both quick and cheap, it is often unreliable. Although culture gives a definitive diagnosis, to get the result usually takes weeks rather than the hours of the GeneXpert test.","Rapid streptococcal antigen detection kits are also of great utility in making this diagnosis. Some 19 manufacturers produce these k i t~.~6 Although most claim a 95% to 99% specificity (true negatives), clinical trials suggest that 90% is more accurate. The manufacturers' claims of 90% to 95% sensitivity (true positives) have not been substantiated by the 60% to 80% found in clinical trials, however. In a case of suspected GABHS, therefore, a negative rapid streptococcal antigen test should be confirmed with a throat culture.1o Rapid streptococcal kits cost between $2 and $4 each.36 Optical immunoassay technology may offer results superior to standard rapid streptococcal Figure 4 presents a scheme to use these tests appropriately. A decision about the severity of the pharyngitis, especially whether it is the major complaint, is required initially. This plan avoids excessive testing because the majority of rapid streptococcal tests are negative in mild disease and throat cultures then are necessary in addition. Rapid streptococcal tests might be beneficial in severe disease, but many physicians treat on the basis of clinical findings in this setting, whereas most withhold treatment in the moderately ill.","Rapid antigen detection tests (RADT) have been developed such as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) and chromatographic immunoassays (CIA). These are both easy to use and have a rapid (under 10 min) turnaround time making them applicable at the point of care. Immunofluorescence assays can also be used from sloughed respiratory cells collected from a patient. This approach is slower than the RADTs but has a higher degree of sensitivity.","Aim: Hp is recognized as an important human pathogen by virtue of it's association with peptic ulcer disease, gastric cancer and gastric lymphoma and the high prevalence of infection worldwide. Both invasive and noninvasive tests are available to diagnose Hp infection but there is still no single gold standard. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of a commercially available anti-Hp IgG ELISA kit for the primary diagnosis of Hp infection. Materials and methods: A total of 185 patients who were referred to our endoscopy unit were included. According to our gold standard, a patient was classified as being Hp(+) if the culture and/or both histology, rapid urease test were positive and as Hp()) only if all of these tests remained negative. Standard methods were used to calculate sensitivity, specificity, predictive values of positive and negative results and 95% confidence intervals of these values. Results: After excluding patients with discordant results131 of 152 patients (86%) were Hp (+). The sensitivity, specificity and diagnostic accuracy of the IgG-ELISA were 97%, 67%, 93% respectively. Conclusion: Due to it's lack for specificity, we conclude that quantitative anti-Hp ELISA test may not be a suitable alternative for primary diagnosis of Hp in our country, where the prevalence of infection is still very high.","In transplantation, several competing issues coalesce to determine ideal decision making. First, it is essential that a reliable, highly sensitive, point of care test with a short turn around time for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 become widely available for universal testing of organ donors in all regions. All potential recipients should also be tested for COVID-19 prior to transplantation. Next, the urgency of the need to accept the organ should be resolved in the context of available resources in medical equipment, healthcare personnel, hospital intensive care bed availability, and available personal protective ","Rapid testing is currently available for RSV and influenza on a wide basis. There are significant limitations of these tests including sensitivities and specificities that are dependent on the quality of the sample collected, the timing of the illness, the intensity of the epidemic, and the population tested. These assays have been developed to allow for sentinel surveillance, although their positive predictive values are limited at the beginning and end of epidemics (see below). In addition, rapid testing helps to identify patients who may benefit from antiviral agents and to decrease the use of antibiotics and shorten the duration of hospitalizations. The available rapid tests for RSV and their respective characteristics have been reviewed elsewhere recently (Caliendo, 2002) . Rapid testing for influenza uses three major methods: fluorescent antibodies (FA) and other antigen detection techniques, neuraminidase detection, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). FA testing is rapid with a turn-around-time (TAT) of 20 min to 2 h. Unfortunately, it requires intact cells in the collected fluid, an expert reader, and a fluorescent microscope. It is able to distinguish between influenza A and B and has a sensitivity of 92-99% and a specificity of 96% (Hornsleth and Jankowski, 1990; Storch, 2003) . It costs about US$ 2.50-7 to screen and US$ 8-18 to identify influenza. PCR takes slightly longer with a TAT of 6-12 h and requires an expert technician and specialized, expensive equipment. Unfortunately, PCR is not available at most centers as a clinical assay.","Minimizing the impact of the COVID-19 and saving lives requires clear thinking and weighing tradeoffs. There will likely be cases when closing schools is sensible. However, policymakers and the healthcare experts advising them need to understand that closing schools may have severe knock-on effects on the healthcare system and that there is substantial uncertainty about the effectiveness of school closures for preventing infection beyond school children and on the impact of reduction in the healthcare workforce on patient survival. In the United States, the healthcare system appears disproportionately exposed to school closure induced labor shortages, and the segment of that system that provides infection control in nursing homes even more so. Such potential healthcare workforce labor shortages should be a first-order consideration when considering the potential benefits and costs of school closures.","Ginocchio et al. also compared the xTAG system with the BinaxNOW\u00ae influenza A and B test (Inverness Medical International, Cranfield, UK) and the 3M\u2122 Rapid Detection Flu A + B test (3M, St Paul, MN, USA; both antigen-detection tests) [62]. The xTAG panel demonstrated far superior sensitivity for inferred detection of novel H1N1 influenza of swine origin (i.e., for detection of influenza A virus that was untypeable using the xTAG panel). However, the xTAG respiratory virus panel should be modified to allow unambiguous subtyping of influenza A virus in order to confirm these provisional comparisons with other tests.","Continuing challenges in influenza include the sporadic human cases of highly pathogenic avian H5N1 influenza, emergence of pandemic H1N1 influenza in 2009 [62, 69] , and human infections with avian H7N9 influenza in 2013 [11] . Influenza A virus undergoes continuous antigenic drift and sporadic antigenic shifts in the viral surface glycoproteins, hemagglutinin (H) and neuraminidase (N). Influenza A has 15 H and 9 N subtypes. Antigenic H and N subtypes to which humans lack immunity are introduced by reassortment of virus genes and cause pandemics, whereas H and N antigenic variants determined by point mutations cause seasonal influenza epidemics [66, 67] . Molecular assays are the preferred method for identification and surveillance of new strains of influenza A infections [11, 62, 67] . Influenza A has no pathognomonic symptoms, and diagnosis based on clinical signs is correct in only two-thirds of patients [68, 70] . Therefore, sensitive and rapid laboratory tests are required to diagnose and guide antiviral treatment. Recently, multiplex molecular assays for respiratory viruses including influenza viruses have been developed, and several have received approval/clearance by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for routine clinical use (Table 15 .2, listed under pandemic H1N1 influenza virus). These assays provide rapid and sensitive tests for respiratory viral infections.","A tremendous problem is the large number of persons with atypical symptoms of a wide range that includes those similar to chronic fatigue syndrome or fibromyalgia who are convinced that they are suffering from chronic Lyme disease but whose results of validated tests do not support the diagnosis. Many of them are convinced that the tests are inadequate and that better tests are needed [94] . In contrast, patients with HME often have not developed antibodies to the etiologic agent, E. chaffeensis, at the time when they present for medical attention. The bacteria can infect mononuclear phagocytes and are present in circulating monocytes providing an often effective target for molecular diagnostics at a time when appropriate antibiotic treatment results in rapid recovery from an otherwise life-threatening infection [29] . Yet HME, which likely has an incidence similar to Lyme disease, lacks a readily available point-of-care diagnostic test. Effective molecular target genes have been identified, and in-house assays provide proof-of-concept that molecular diagnostics offer an effective approach [28, 95] . Moreover, low-cost instrument-free devices for nucleic acid amplification and specific identification have been developed that would be appropriate for point-of-care diagnosis.","The US classified the coronavirus disease pandemic (COVID-19) as a national emergency on March 14, 2020 . Cumulative US cases surged beyond 122,000 on March 29, 2020. [2, 3] Its rapid spread in China and Italy quickly overwhelmed available hospital beds. [4, 5] County-level forecasts of demand for hospital beds based on data commonly available to hospitals would help guide US hospital efforts to anticipate and mitigate similar bed shortages. [6, 7] In order to plan their response, hospital and public health officials need to understand how many people in their area are likely to require hospitalization for COVID-19; how these numbers compare to the number of available intensive care and acute care beds; and how to project the impact of socialdistancing measures on utilization. Since the majority of people with COVID-19 are asymptomatic and the rates of cases requiring hospitalization differ significantly across age groups, answering these questions requires understanding the epidemic and accounting for the specific vulnerabilities of the local population. [8, 9] The numbers of people in each age group differ significantly across US counties, as do the available hospital resources [10, 11] . Initial analyses of the potential impact of COVID-19 have spurred governmental action at the federal and state level; however, significant differences remain in the policies implemented across states and counties. [9, 12] In order to help facilitate adequate and appropriate local responses, we developed a simple model to project the number of people in each county in the United States who are likely to require hospitalization as a result of COVID-19 given the age distribution of the county per the US Census. The model compares the projected number of individuals needing hospitalization to the publicly known numbers of available intensive and acute care beds and allows users to model the impact of social-distancing or other measures to slow the spread of the virus. The uncertainty surrounding the numbers of people infected and the rates of spread make it difficult to evaluate the accuracy of projections generated by complex epidemiological models. The model presented errs on the side of simplicity and transparency to allow non-specialist policymakers to fully understand the logic and uncertainty associated with the estimates.","The growing number of US COVID-19 cases is expected to tax the capacity of health care delivery systems. Analysis of clinical characteristics at time of patient presentation associated with disease severity is immediately useful. Recognizing the rapid utility of such data, we evaluated clinical characteristics and disease course of patients with confirmed COVID-19 at Stanford Hospital.","Evidence-based comparison of diagnostic accuracy of xpert MTB/RIF assay, with smear microscopy for pulmonary tuberculosis and its rifampicin -resistance detection evaluation Yi-Ching Huang 1 , Yuan-Hsin Chu 2 . 1 Division of Infectious Disease, Jen-Ai Hospital, 2 Department of Infection Control, Jen-Ai Hospital Background: Accurate and earlier detection of TB, and TB drug resistance is critical for TB control. Mycobacterial culture is considered as the best reference standard but is relatively complex and slow. Thus, Taiwan CDC recommends to develop rapid technique. Xpert MTB/RIF (Cepheid) assay has been introduced for the diagnosis of TB and RIF(rifampicin)-resistance. We herein compare its diagnostic accuracy of pulmonary tuberculosis with smear microscopy and assess the assay for rifampicin resistance in adults. Methods: It's a diagnostic question, Acquiring systematic review (SR) of cross-sectional studies with reference standard and blinding is priority. P-pulmonary tuberculosis; I-Xpert MTB/RIF; C-smear microscopy; O-diagnostic accuracy The PICO terms and their respective synonyms were engaged by boolean character \"AND\"\u2192 to search CochraneLibrary and Pubmed\u2192 3 SR were filterd out of 6 searching results in Cochrane Library\u2192 One most relevant SR was selected and in PubMed we included the same SR. Results: As an initial test replacing smear microscopy, Xpert \u00ae MTB/ RIF pooled sensitivity 89%; pooled specificity 99%. As an add-on test following a negative smear microscopy result, Xpert \u00ae MTB/RIF pooled sensitivity 67%; pooled specificity 99%. For smear-positive, culture-positive TB, Xpert \u00ae MTB/RIF pooled sensitivity 98%. Compared with smear microscopy, Xpert \u00ae MTB/RIF increased TB detection among culture-confirmed cases by 23%. For RIF-resistance detection, Xpert \u00ae MTB/RIF pooled sensitivity 95% and pooled specificity 98%. Conclusion: Compared with smear microscopy, Xpert \u00ae MTB/RIF substantially increases TB detection among culture-confirmed cases. Xpert \u00ae MTB/RIF has higher sensitivity for TB detection in smear-positive than smear-negative patients in adults. Nonetheless, this test may be valuable as an add-on test following smear microscopy in patients previously found to be smearnegative. For rifampicin resistance detection, Xpert \u00ae MTB/RIF provides accurate results and can allow rapid initiation of MDR-TB treatment (Level 1).","The rapid review conduct was guided by the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions 1 along with the Rapid Review Guide for Health Policy and Systems Research 2 . The team used an integrated knowledge translation approach, with consultation from the knowledge users from the WHO at the following stages: question development, interpretation of results, and draft report. We used the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) Statement 3 to guide the reporting of our rapid review results; a PRISMA extension for rapid reviews is currently under development. This rapid review of guidelines was completed in conjunction with a rapid overview of systematic reviews published in a separate report titled: Preventing respiratory illness in older adults aged 60 years and above living in long-term care: A rapid overview of reviews\".","In order to make it possible to use FEP-ABFE in rapid discovery of inhibitors against COVID-19, the alchemical pathway was optimized to find one that can significantly not only improve the calculation speed but also keep the accuracy. According to the FEP theory, in order to calculate the free energy difference \u2206 , probability distribution of potential energy difference between adjacent \u03bb, denoted as (\u2206 ) , will be sampled. In the reported studies 27, 28 , (\u2206 )'s are considered as Gaussian-like distributions, which is true for the steps of electrostatic interactions and vdW interactions decoupling.","The release of the viral genome sequence has made it possible for the CDC to create a rapid molecular diagnostic test for COVID-19. The test received expedited approval from the FDA and the test is being made available to state health departments and selected commercial laboratories. At this time the test is only performed at the CDC but it is likely that the test will be made available at several state health departments in the near feature. The currently available diagnostic tests for other coronaviruses (eg, FilmArray Respiratory Panel [BioFire Diagnostics]) do not detect the COVID-19.","The current clinical situation is complicated. Among the patients in the present study, the following conditions were observed: (1) the patient had a fever, no epidemiological history, and abnormal manifestations in the lungs on CT, while the first nucleic acid test was negative, and the second test was positive; (2) the patient had symptoms, a history of exposure, and abnormal manifestations in the lungs on CT, while the first two nucleic acid tests were negative, and the third was positive; (3) the nucleic acid test was positive; however, the patient was asymptomatic, had an epidemiological history, and CT showed no abnormal manifestations in the lungs. Three days later, the CT examination showed abnormal findings in the lungs. From the above analysis, it is evident that in this specific period and under the current clinical situation, patients with an abnormal chest CT examination should be quarantined, and the patient's epidemiological history should be investigated. After consideration of other test results, and excluding influenza and mycoplasma infection, at least one or more SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid tests are required; however, some studies have shown that the accuracy rate of the CT examination in the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection was only 76.4%. Only three cases (2.6%) in this study showed no apparent abnormalities in the lungs at the initial CT examination, and the overall accuracy rate of CT examination in the present study was 97.3%, which is much higher than the accuracy reported in the literature. The reason may be that the present study is a retrospective analysis and, in order to summarise the CT imaging characteristics better, the selected cases were all confirmed cases.","The rapid overview was guided by the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions 1 along with the Rapid Review Guide for Health Policy and Systems Research 2 .

The development of robust serological assays hinges on the accessibility of a reliable panel of well-characterised animal or human sera including those positive for antibodies specific to MERS-CoV and to likely agents of cross-reaction . Obtaining these control materials has been problematic and has slowed the development and commercialization of assays for human testing . One company has produced an ELISA kit to detect IgG in camels using a recombinant S1 receptor-binding subunit of MERS-CoV S protein as the antigen and produces a diagnostic reagent for immunofluorescence EUROIMMUN Medizinische Labordiagnostika AGf, 2014) . Serosurveys are essential to determine a baseline of animal and community exposures to MERS-CoV among countries in the Arabian Peninsula. Early sero-surveys of humans used conventional immunofluorescent assays (IFA) in which antibodies, if present in patient sera, attach to MERS-CoV infected cell cultures to identify the presence of IgG, IgM or neutralising antibodies (Corman et al., 2012b; Drosten et al., 2013; Zaki et al., 2012) . No sign of MERS-CoV antibody was found among 2400 sera from patients visiting the Dr. Soliman Fakeeh Hospital in Jeddah, KSA from 2010 through 2012 , and no sign of prior MERS-CoV infection was found among 130 healthy blood donors screened at King Abdulaziz University Hospital in Jeddah (collected between January and December 2012). Eight of 226 slaughterhouse workers were positive by IFA, but those results could not be confirmed by neutralization (NT) test. The study indicated that HCoV-HKU1 was a likely source of cross-reactive antigen by IFA (Aburizaiza et al., 2014 ). An absence of MERS-CoV antibodies among slaughterhouse workers may reflect the killing of older DCs which are less often MERS-CoV positive (see Table 1 ), the rarity of infected animals, a limited transmission risk associated with slaughtering DCs (Aburizaiza et al., 2014) , a weak immune response by humans who do not get severe MERS, or an overall low risk of MERS-CoV transmission by contact. IFA also suffered from some cross-reactivity with convalescent SARS patient sera which could not be resolved by an NT test (Chan et al., 2013b) . The need for well-validated assays was further emphasised when publicly released MERS-CoV antibody test results indicated that a handshake and two face-to-face meetings were sufficient for MERS-CoV transmission between two people in the USA (CDC Newsroom, 2014; Sampathkumar, 2014) . These results were subsequently retracted because they did not withstand further confirmatory analysis with the less rapid, but highly specific, NT assay (CDC Newsroom, 2014) .","\u2022 Fill gaps in understanding of the natural history of infection to better define the period of infectiousness and transmissibility; more accurately estimate the reproductive number in various outbreak settings and improve understanding the role of asymptomatic infection. \u2022 Comparative analysis of different quarantine strategies and contexts for their effectiveness and social acceptability \u2022 Enhance and develop an ethical framework for outbreak response that includes better equity for access to interventions for all countries \u2022 Promote the development of point-of-care diagnostic tests \u2022 Determine the best ways to apply knowledge about infection prevention and control in health-care settings in resource-constrained countries (including identification of optimal personal protective equipment) and in the broader community, specifically to understand behaviour among different vulnerable groups \u2022 Support standardised, best evidence-based approach for clinical management and better outcomes and implement randomised, controlled trials for therapeutics and vaccines as promising agents emerge \u2022 Validation of existing serological tests, including those that have been developed by commercial entities, and establishment of biobanks and serum panels of well characterised COVID-19 sera to support such efforts \u2022 Complete work on animal models for vaccine and therapeutic research and development include some identified by the global community and by the Research and Development Blueprint Scientific Advisory Group.

For example, the availability of various sequence databases permits quick identification of sequence identity and variations. For example, the HIV database http://www.hiv.lanl.gov/ contains data on HIV genetic sequences and drug resistance associated mutations. It is valuable for HIV epidemiological studies, research, development, and clinical validation studies of HIV clinical assays [38, 71] . It is well known that there are significant variations of clinical phenotypes in the presence of emerging infections ranging from asymptomatic carrier to lethal infection. Recently, assays to examine multiple pathogen panels have been developed [97\u00c0102], which should increase the diagnostic yield for many pathogens. A critical need for emerging pathogen analysis is quicker, easier, cost-effect assays that can be used in a point-of-care setting. New assays that are performed on platforms with a small footprint and detect pathogens quickly (in minutes instead of hours or days) have entered clinical use. For example, the FilmArray (BioFire Diagnostics, Inc.) and Simplexa (Focus Diagnostics, Inc.) molecular assays can generate results in approximately 60 min. The user-friendly Alere i (Alere Inc.) and Cobas Liat (Roche Molecular Systems) platforms are compact and portable, generate rapid molecular results in 15\u00c020 min, can use electricity or rechargeable battery, and therefore are completely mobile and suited for point-of-care testing. It is obvious that the current rapid development of new technologies will further enhance the utility of molecular diagnostics in various emerging infectious diseases.","Viruses exist as quasispecies [32]. Infected humans and animals host a diverse population of viral nucleic acid sequences; the raw material for rapid evolution. RNA viruses, including retroviruses, have much higher mutation rates than DNA viruses [33,34], increasing the complexity of generating effective probes for nucleic acid amplification tests. This can result in assay \u2018drop out\u2019. This has been a problem with influenza A diagnostics targeting hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) segments. It is exemplified by the necessity for ad hoc test development for the 2009 H1N1 human influenza of swine origin, the \u2018swine influenza virus real-time detection panel\u2019, and its authorization for emergency use by the US FDA. This test was subsequently replaced by an improved version developed by the CDC, as more H1N1 specimens became available [203]. The problem of drop out continues to plague commercial and in-house assays [35]. Whiley and colleagues cite several examples of PCR or reverse-transcriptase (RT)-PCR-based virus diagnostic assays that are prone to false-negative results caused by sequence variation. This list includes commercial assays for HIV-1, human parvovirus B19, and in-house methods for rabies and cytomegalovirus [35]. This calls for astute primer design or the use of multiple gene targets within a single organism (e.g., combining PCRs for the por A and ctr A genes in Neisseria meningitidis[36] or for the HA and NA genes for influenza A detection) [37]. The challenge to the designer of an influenza diagnostic test is the same as the challenge faced by the designer of influenza vaccines, where the vaccine needs to be reformulated annually to account for antigenic drift and also when antigenic shift is detected.","In this paper, we analyzed a simple model of cost-benefit tradeoffs in a stylized model of contact investigation and disclosure, reflecting public health circumstances in which individuals may not wish to disclose other individuals in their contact network. Such circumstances may arise if such contacts reflect illicit activity, undocumented presence in the country, or other reasons related to privacy. We therefore assumed a cost for each such disclosure. The model assumes that individuals may benefit by disclosing other individuals in their network of contacts and that the sole such benefit is a reduction in infection risk resulting from earlier diagnosis of other individuals in the group. We assumed a specific simple form where individuals use a fixed strategy, for which any specific contact may or may not be disclosed, and that this did not depend on the progression of the epidemic. We assumed a simple stochastic epidemic model where individuals could be protected after exposure by vaccination, and that once an individual is diagnosed, he or she is removed and will transmit no more infection. Finally, our analysis was restricted to the case of a simple three person cluster. We developed the analytic Kolmogorov equations for the stochastic process, and solved these equations to determine the expected payoffs.","We define the peak value as the peak of I(t), which is the cumulative number of infected cases. After this peak point, the temporary number of cases gradually decrease and the epidemic subsides. We first simulated the epidemic trend of 34 provinces of China, and predicted the peak number of confirmed cases and its arrival time in each area, as shown in figure 2 and 3. On average, the peak number of real-time confirmed cases of Hubei is predicted to reach 63800, and its arrival time is on March 3, 2020. Tibet has both the minimum peak value and the earliest peak arrival time. According to the data up to Feburary 12, 2020, the number of confirmed cases in Tibet is only 1, and there is no suspected patient. On the one hand, it is shown that the transmission speed is very high, on the other hand, the rapid development of traffic caused the rapid development of cross transmission.The predicted peak values of different areas are divided to different intervals, which is listed in table 3. Except for Hubei, there are no other provinces that the peak value is more than 2000. Table 3 distinguishs Hubei Province as a single category to reflect the corresponding relationships and differences. In terms of peak values, Hubei is far higher than other regions. Zhejiang, Guangdong, Henan, Hunan and Chongqing are the places most likely to become the next worst-hit areas, and the relevant departments should pay much attention to them. The peak value of more than 73.5% provinces or regions of China is predicted to be stable within 1000.","Before analyzing, time series must become station-based on mean and variance. The Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) is used (9) in recognizing stationary in the mean and Box Cox test in recognizing whether the time series is stationary based on variance or not. Log transformation and differences are remedy approaches to stabilize the time series for variance and mean, respectively (10). Seasonal differences were used to stabilize the series from seasonality trend.","Group A \u03b2-hemolytic Streptococcus (GABHS, i.e., S. pyogenes) commonly infects the pharynx. In addition to sore throat, associated symptoms include fever, headache, and abdominal pain. Associated signs include pharyngeal erythema, halitosis, tonsillar exudates, and tender adenopathy. Diagnosis may be confirmed initially with a rapid streptococcal antigen test. Because rapid antigen testing is more sensitive than formal plating on blood agar, a negative test does not need confirmation, but positive rapid streptococcal tests should be confirmed with formal plating. Other bacterial pathogens that cause acute pharyngitis include Haemophilus influenzae and groups C and G \u03b2-hemolytic streptococci. Occasionally, concurrent infection with penicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus may interfere with treatment of a GABHS infection. 28 Although many cases of GABHS infections respond to treatment with penicillin V or amoxicillin, emerging resistance to oropharyngeal pathogens mandates treatment of recalcitrant cases with an antibiotic having known effectiveness against \u03b2-lactamase-producing organisms. In cases in which a lack of compliance is suspected, intramuscular benzathine penicillin or ceftriaxone may be used.","Early diagnosis by virus isolation or serological testing is essential to halt the spread of SARS. Rapid diagnosis of SARS for infection-control measures and potential treatment will require very sensitive and specific methods. There is still no reference standard (gold standard) test for SARS. Three diagnostic tests are currently available, but all with their limitations. 27, 28 We have reported two cases of patients with SARS and low PCT levels. This is consistent with the current evidence that SARS is just another viral pneumonia. High initial levels of PCT may be used to exclude SARS to a certain degree of accuracy whereas low PCT in relevant clinical context may prompt further testing for SARS. We recommend that PCT concentrations be determined for every patient presenting with community-acquired pneumonia.","This report describes the extensive immunological characterisation of a candidate SARS coronavirus vaccine. A number of different strategies have previously been reported for the development of experimental and candidate human SARS vaccines. These include inactivated whole virus vaccines [19] [20] [21] , attenuated viral vectors expressing SARS-CoV proteins [7, 8, 12, 13] and DNA vaccines [14, 22] . We have favoured the strategy of a whole virus vaccine development for a number of reasons, including speed of development. The virus grows to very high titres in Vero cells, a cell line accepted by most regulatory authorities. A similar technology used for this development has been utilised for development and industrial scale production of an influenza virus vaccine [15] . Manufacturing facilities are also in place at the appropriate biosafety level to utilise this technology for rapid large scale vaccine production. However, in addition to these technology and logistical reasons, it is also likely that an inactivated whole virus vaccine would be most efficient in inducing neutralising antibodies, which are possibly critical in preventing SARS-CoV infection.","Purpose: The purpose of this study was to compare two immunochromatographic tests: Vikia Rota Adeno (bioM\u00e9rieux, France) and Diarlex MB, with centrifugation (Orion Diagnostica), used in rotavirus detection in the case of gastroenteritis episodes in paediatrics. Methods: 189 stool samples in total were tested: 116 frozen stools (-20\u00b0C) studied retrospectively and 73 fresh stools studied prospectively (December 2004 -August 2005 . Of the frozen stools, 50 were selected as containing bacteria or yeasts responsible for diarrhoea and 45 were selected as containing rotavirus using the laboratory's routine method (Diarlex MB). For all the stools, the rapid tests were performed on the same day under the same conditions at H\u00f4 pital Debrousse and the reference method IDEIA rotavirus (Dako) was performed in blind mode by bioM\u00e9rieux. Results: On the frozen stools, Vikia produced the same results as the reference method and Diarlex MB produced two false negative results. On the fresh stools, Vikia produced two noninterpretable results and two false negatives, and Diarlex MB produced two non-interpretable results and two false negatives. For three frozen stools, Vikia posed methodological problems associated with the migration on the strip which were resolved in a second assay. On the 50 frozen stools containing bacteria or yeasts, no cross-reaction was detected with the two tests. For the 189 stools, the reference method, Vikia, and Diarlex MB detected 81, 79 and 76 stools positive for rotavirus. The sensitivity and specificity values, positive predictive value and negative predictive value are 97.5; 100; 100 and 98.2% for the Vikia test and 95; 100; 100; and 96.4% for the Diarlex MB test, respectively. No statistically significant difference was observed either between the two tests themselves or between the tests and the reference method. Conclusion: Equal in terms of performance, the Vikia test offers a simpler and more rapid methodology.","The rapid spread of Coronavirus Disease 2019 worldwide has raised concern around the world. The outbreak of COVID-19 first started in Wuhan of China. With a dramatic increase in daily confirmed global cases, the World Health Organization has declared as a global pandemic on March 12, 2020 Human immune responses to a novel pathogen with both innate and adaptive arms. One aspect of the adaptive immunity is humoral response that features the production of antibodies recognizing specific determinants of antigens called epitopes.","Based on validation dataset, we evaluated the performance of our AI algorithm in 223 diagnosing the most common infectious diseases of the lung, including 224 non-COVID-19 viral pneumonia, bacterial pneumonia, pulmonary tuberculosis except 225 COVID-19. During training and validation process, accuracy and cross-entropy were 226 plotted against the iteration step, which were shown in Figure 1 . Confusion matrix of 227 the AI framework during validation process was also shown in Figure 1 . Multi-class 228 comparison was performed between COVID-19, non-COVID-19 viral pneumonia, 229 bacterial pneumonia, pulmonary tuberculosis, and normal lung. Binary comparison 230 between COVID-19 and the other four types, including non-COVID-19 viral 231 pneumonia, bacterial pneumonia, pulmonary tuberculosis and normal lung, was also 232 implemented to evaluate the performance of recognizing COVID-19.

The estimated epidemic speed depends only on the observed growth rate -it does not change if we change our assumption about the proportion of early transmission. For the test-and-treat intervention, the effective epidemic speed also stays relatively constant (Fig. 4D) , in part because we have (plausibly) assumed that hazard stays relatively constant for a few key months, and in part because the backward generation-interval distributions for different scenarios are relatively similar. The intervention speed increases slightly as proportion of early transmission increases because the subpopulation that the intervention fails to reach become relatively more important if late transmission is more important. Thus, the speed paradigm provides an intuitive underpinning for the originally surprising result of Eaton and Hallett (2014) : the effectiveness of test-and-treat interventions should not depend much on the proportion of early transmission. 7 .

In order to evaluate the impact of sequencing error on CHEER, we simulated reads with an error rate of 0, 0.01, 0.02, and 0.05, respectively. For each classifier (CNN), we computed the classification accuracy, which is defined in equation (1). To ensure that the computation of the accuracy is not affected by the number of reads from different species, we constructed a balanced test read set by simulating the same number of reads for each test species (1,000 reads for each). (1) For each component classifier in the tree model, we record the average accuracy for multiple test species. For each taxa level, we calculate the average accuracy of all the classifiers in the same level."],"title":["Current research on respiratory viral infections: Fifth International Symposium","Influenza
