Through acting upon these behaviors and habits, we could lower this type of emerging risk. Currently EcoHealth Alliance has research sites in Uganda, Malaysia and Brazil; they are investigating the role played by habitat changes such as deforestation, human interaction with biodiversity through behavior and use. In Manaus in Brazil for example, the maximum risk of new infection is not in the heart of the city where the major markets are located, but in the peri-urban areas where agriculture and ranching are developing. These zones which ecologists call ''ecotones'', or transition zones, are located near strongly species-rich regions, with high concentrations of livestock which can come into contact with wild fauna, and which are furthermore inhabited by ranchers and farmers. These regions which are now located everywhere in the intertropical world for the purpose of feeding urban populations, are generally those where new infections appear, and where future pandemics will also most likely appear. At the heart of this research is the priority of understanding behaviors, habits and practices of populations with the goal of changing these factors. This is a long-term endeavor which requires developing approaches in the field for communicating with local populations, and for developing community participation in our own research, which we also consider an excellent means of education. O. Borraz recalled the fact that we live in a society of risk. It is not that the dangers surrounding us are more numerous or more fearsome than before, but simply that the notion of risk plays a central role in public policies, in public and private organizational management, and in the controversies around new technologies. Genetically modified organisms, mobile phones, nuclear waste, urban sanitation sludge; the activities now considered health or environmental risks are countless. This categorization puts public authorities in a position of having to ensure the safety of populations, even as the State itself sometimes represents a risk factor. It is therefore essential to understand how an activity becomes a risk, and how it is then managed by public authorities as well as by companies, associations and local conglomerates. Risk from its identification to its management, from its highlighting to its instrumentalization becomes a tool linked to the emergence and expansion of a welfare state. It is used by politicians to justify on the one hand its lack of involvement in risk management, on the other the seizing of power over sectors from which they had previously disengaged. This political power seizure plays on politicians' selective dissemination within society of risk identification and the knowledge required for its management.","Like other coronavirus diseases (e.g. SARS and MERS), COVID-19 is believed to be transmitted through droplet and contact modes however other transmission modes, such as airborne, are likely given the virus is found in higher concentrations in the lungs than the upper respiratory tract ( World Health Organisation (WHO) 2020 ). There had been evidence of airborne transmission of SARS as well, therefore respirators were recommended for SARS during 2002-03 outbreak ( McKinney et al., 2006 ) . In Canada, initially masks were recommended, but this recommendation was later changed to respirators due to the deaths of health workers. A recent study demonstrated the presence of coronavirus in anal swabs from infected patients and possibility of transmission through faecal-oral route ( Zhang et al., 2020 ) . Transmission dynamics for COVID-19 are still unclear and pharmaceutical control measures are not yet available, therefore N95 or higher respirators should be offered to health workers who are working at the frontline ( MacIntyre et al., 2014 a; MacIntyre et al., 2014 b). Health workers and other first responders in high coronavirus transmission areas (e.g. Wuhan) should use respirators during routine care of coronavirus cases. Health workers and first responders in low risk countries should use a respirator when encountering a suspected or confirmed case of coronavirus. If respirators are not available, then masks should be used.","The antiviral agent ribavirin (with or without corticosteroids) has been tried as treatment in an increasing number of patients. However, its effectiveness has not been proven. A coordinated multicenter approach to establish the effectiveness of ribavirin and other interventions has been proposed. There is no evidence for its use as prophylaxis, and many experts believe that it will be some years before an effective vaccine for the virus is available. WHO Revised Guidelines: management of contacts of probable SARS cases A SARS contact is a person who may be at greater risk of developing SARS because of exposure to a suspect or probable case of SARS (Table 1) . A contact of a probable SARS case should be given information about SARS, and placed under active surveillance for 10 days in voluntary home isolation. The contact should record his temperature daily, and be visited or telephoned daily by a member of the public health care team. If the contact develops disease symptoms, they should be investigated locally at an appropriate health care facility. WHO Revised Guidelines: management of contacts of suspect SARS cases It is recommended that contacts of suspect cases should be given information on the clinical picture and transmission of SARS and placed under passive surveillance for 10 days. The contact is free to continue with his usual activities, but if he develops any symptoms, he should telephone the public health authority immediately. CONCLUSION As the work on the virus, its clinical manifestations, treatment and prevention proceed, there are many unanswered questions that will challenge scientists, clinicians, and public health workers. These include: how this new virus entered the human population and succeeded in spreading so rapidly from person-toperson, a phenomenon that is not always the case when respiratory viruses make the species jump to humans; what the variation at the molecular level means for the pathogenesis and epidemiology of this virus; and what will be the results over time of its co-evolution with the human host. As there are numerous as yet uncharacterized animal viruses that periodically enter the human population, this outbreak, although due to a viral infection with a relatively low mortality rate, should serve as a warning to the global public health community of the importance of openness in communicating health care threats at an early stage. To not do so because of political concerns could jeopardize human health due to pandemic influenza, a paramyxovirus that is able to establish human-to-human transmission, another coronavirus, or an unrecognized agent. The political will to ensure this openness must be universal, as a single area that does not cooperate with such a policy risks the health of all humankind.","The only way that we as health care experts have to control epidemics early is optimal infection control. Initially, if deaths are associated with new pathogens, the presumption should be that airborne and/or large droplet transmission is possible. A private room with a negative air pressure ventilation system-if available-should be used for all suspected patients. Health care workers should use masks, gowns, eye protection, and two sets of gloves until the modes of transmission are identified. What we are emphasizing is that maximal protection should be employed early with all new, life-threatening infectious diseases. Only later if the data suggest that less stringent control measures are warranted, less should be done. Because proper use of masks was shown to be protective among health care workers exposed to unrecognized SARS, it may be that early and consistent use would have reduced both infections and mortality.","There are many concepts of communication in relation to risk associated with outbreaks. As these are relatively new concepts, this article will consider approaches relating to highlighting public health threats and supporting operational management, addressing these as the communication of risk and subsequent risk management. Strategic considerations are critical to both, although information, messengers, communication tools and audiences may differ. The communication of risk refers to the process by which information regarding outbreaks is identified and shared with the purpose of increasing awareness amongst key stakeholders of the threat. Key stakeholders for public health threats include WHO, national governments and the public. Risk management, by contrast, refers to the management processes associated with response to the outbreak, for which communication is crucial at each stage. Three examples are used to explore the challenges and demands of communicating effectively and coherently given this changing landscape. This brief paper will attempt to show the progress made, draw lessons to be learned and outline the ways forward.","The importance of timely, accurate and context-specific risk communication during public health emergencies is increasingly being recognized, particularly with rapid changes in how people consume media. The WHO has produced useful guidance on communicating risk in such situations, which draws on experiences from previous PHEIC [37] . Good risk communication allows people to know from trusted sources in real-time the risks they may face, and any protective measures they can take to help minimise this.","Finally, the panel's decision to extend this recommendation to all patients, regardless of COVID-19 status, is specifically in the context of documented community spread during a pandemic. It also assumes a small proportion of persons who are negative or have recovered from COVID-19; this may change with the availability of wider testing and the ability to test for past infection or immunity. Recent data from China, by Chang et al, revealed the greatest risk of COVID-19 exposure to health care workers during early stages of the pandemic when testing was not yet widely available. 61 In a JAMA report published from Zhongnan Hospital in Wuhan, 29.3% (40 of 138) of COVID-19 infected patients were health care workers who presumably had hospital-acquired infections. 27 Among 493 health care workers caring for hospitalized patients, 10/493 health care workers became infected with COVID-19; all 10 were unprotected health care workers (no mask) caring for patients on medical wards with a low risk of exposure (no known or suspected COVID-19 patients). In contrast, none of the 278 protected health care workers (N95 mask) caring for high risk patients (known or suspected COVID-19) became infected (aOR 464.82; 95% CI: 97.73 to infinite). 62 One study, evaluating health care worker exposure in the care of one COVID-19 positive patient, revealed that none of 41 health care workers (surgical masks only) developed infection despite absence of N95 mask, although studies evaluating health care workers in context of larger cohorts of COVID-19 positive patients are not yet available. 63 The decision to extend the recommendation to lower GI procedures is based on evidence of possible aerosolization during colonoscopy especially during the insertion and removal of instruments through the biopsy channel. 53 and the uncertain risks associated with evidence of the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in fecal samples. These data provided indirect evidence to extend the recommendation to lower GI procedures pending more definitive evidence. 33 Limited resource settings Recommendation 4: In extreme resource-constrained settings involving health care workers performing any GI procedures, regardless of COVID-19 status, the AGA suggests extended use/re-use of N95 masks over surgical masks, as part of appropriate personal protective equipment. (Conditional recommendation, very low certainty evidence).","There remains controversy regarding appropriate modes of ventilation for patients with refractory respiratory failure from highly infectious diseases. In particular, there are infection control concerns regarding aerosol generation with highfrequency oscillatory ventilation (HFOV) and the inability to filter exhaled air to the environment. There is currently little data available on the risk of disease transmission to health care workers from HFOV, and a retrospective study did not show a clear association between HFOV and SARS infection among health care workers, but the sample size was small and the verdict is still uncertain [20] .","8. When an influenza outbreak in a SNF is suspected (2, 13) , prompt and simultaneous implementation of interventions (https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/68/6/e1/5251935) can minimize the size and scope of the outbreak and adverse impact on resident health. Outbreak management requires a collaborative effort among all HCP with specific task assignments and tracking their completion. a. Prompt administration of antiviral agents for treatment and prophylaxis will shorten an outbreak (6, 7). b. Communicating with residents, HCP, and families, during an outbreak provides needed reassurance. c. Communicating with the local health department will facilitate additional guidance during an outbreak. Educate and train HCP. Reinforce sick leave policies. Remind HCP not to report to work when ill. Reinforce adherence to infection prevention and control measures, including hand hygiene and selection and use of personal protective equipment (PPE). Have HCP demonstrate competency with putting on and removing PPE. Educate both facility-based and consultant personnel (e.g., wound care, podiatry, barber) and volunteers. Including consultants is important because they often provide care in multiple facilities and can be exposed to or serve as a source of pathogen transmission.","The spread of the epidemic can be only contained, and SARS-CoV-2 transmission in hospitals reduced, by strict compliance with infection prevention and control measures (contact, droplet, and airborne precautions) (22,29). During the current epidemic, health care workers have been at an increased risk of contracting the disease and consequent fatal outcome owing to direct exposure to patients. Early reports from the beginning of the epidemic indicated that a large proportion of the patients had contracted the infection in a health care facility (as high as 41%), and that health care workers constituted a large proportion of these cases (as high as 29%). However, the largest study to date on more than 72 000 patients from China has shown that health care workers make up 3.8% of the patients. In this study, although the overall CFR was 2.3%, among health care workers it was only 0.3%. In China, the number of severe or critical cases among health care workers has declined overall, from 45.0% in early January to 8.7% in early February (4). This poses numerous psychological and ethical questions about health care workers\u2019 role in the spread, eventual arrest, and possible consequences of epidemics. For example, during the 2014-2016 Ebola virus disease epidemic in Africa, health care workers risked their lives in order to perform life-saving invasive procedures (intravenous indwelling, hemodialysis, reanimation, mechanical ventilation), and suffered high stress and fatigue levels, which may have prevented them from practicing optimal safety measures, sometimes with dire consequences (30).","HCWs were engaged in communicating the risk with patients and their families. Whenever a suspected case was identified as a Qatari national, a Qatari senior physician was called upon to explain the protocol of medical isolation, the medical and public health investigation procedures, and the expected prognosis. This policy was adopted to ensure greater openness, trust, and collaboration. Consequently, neither refusal nor lack of compliance with established control measures, including isolation, were reported, even as a greater number of cases were identified.","Special care in dentistry Classification \u25a0 Communicating hydrocephalus means that the site of raised resistance to CSF drainage resides outside of the ventricular systemin the subarachnoid space \u25a0 Non-communicating, or obstructive, hydrocephalus is caused when there is an obstruction in the flow of CSF within the ventricular system of the brain, including the outlets of the fourth ventricle (the foramina of Luschka and Magendie). The most common place for the non-communicating CSF obstruction is in the aqueduct of Sylvius (also known as aqueductal stenosis). However, the obstruction can also occur in the outlets of the fourth ventricle and from the lateral ventricles into the third ventricle at the foramina of Monro.","Healthcare professionals across all settings are now caring for and communicating with patients in a context of high uncertainty. The ultimate impact of the COVID-19 outbreak will not be clear for a long time, but greater adherence to the lifestyle modifications suggested by healthcare and public health organizations will greatly delay the spread of the disease. This, in turn, will keep hospitals and clinics from being overwhelmed. For example, hospitals are overburdened in parts ofItaly, which is projected to approximately 80% of its total ICU beds occupied by COVID-19 patients before April 2020. 6 As healthcare professionals with a high public availability, community pharmacists are likely to be many patients' first option for health information. Patients may present to community pharmacies for refills or new prescriptions; prescribers may cancel non-urgent appointments, which would make the community pharmacist a sole point of in-person contact with the healthcare system. It is therefore imperative that community pharmacists be equipped with knowledge and tools to communicate clearly and effectively with patients about ways to limit the impact of COVID-19.","The currently available influenza vaccines are made from inactivated, detergent-split influenza virus grown in the allantoic cavity of embryonated chicken eggs. These vaccines effectively prevent influenza-related illness and have a high benefit-to-cost ratio in terms of preventing hospitalizations and deaths, as shown in numerous studies on vaccination of the elderly and of individuals at high risk for severe outcomes of influenza [48] . WHO estimates that there globally are about 1.2 billion people at high risk for severe influenza outcomes: 385 million elderly over 65 years of age, 140 million infants, and several hundred million children and adults with underlying chronic health problem. The last number still remains unknown, although it has been estimated in industrialized countries that around 12% of total population have chronic underlying respiratory diseases, including asthma. In addition, 24 million health care workers should be immunized to prevent them from spreading the disease to the high-risk population. At this time, the world's total vaccine production capacity is limited to about 900 million doses, which realistically does not suffice to cover the global high-risk population.","We declare no competing interests. JZ, YH, RD, and BC are members of the panel that created the expert consensus statement on the use of corticosteroids in patients with 2019-nCoV pneumonia. We thank Zhenshun Cheng, Yang Jin, Min Zhou, Jing Zhang, and Jieming Qu for contributing to the development of the expert consensus on the use of corticosteroids in patients with 2019-nCoV pneumonia. We extend great thanks to Peter W Horby and Frederick G Hayden for assistance in writing this Correspondence. Broad dissemination in both Chinese and English will accomplish the goals of communicating timely and crucial findings to the international scientific community, while also disseminating this information to health-care workers on the frontline who need to understand the epidemiological and clinical features of COVID-19. This strategy will improve effective control strategies to ultimately contain the virus and protect the health of the public. in Nature, 2 at least 54 academic papers about COVID-19 were published in English-language journals by Jan 30, 2020. We searched major Chinese databases including the China National Knowledge Internet and WANFANG Data. As of Feb 3, 2020, just 23 Chineselanguage papers on COVID-19 were published. These publications mainly focused on epidemiology, clinical features of COVID-19, and the structure or genetics of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).","In a recent editorial titled 'Epidemic science in real time', Fineberg and Wilson underscored the critical importance of 'conducting the right science and communicating expert judgment' to 'enable policies to be adjusted appropriately as an epidemic scenario unfolds' [44]. They emphasized that in times of diminishing public health resources, scientists from diverse disciplines - epidemiology, laboratory, social sciences - must work together to respond to immediate threats and follow through with research to understand key attributes of the affected populations and the disease process. The results of such research are needed to inform policy, to develop treatments and interventions, and to update and adjust recommendations as the state of knowledge changes.","There are difficult decisions for governments to make. How people respond to recommendations on preventing transmission is more important than government measures. The government's strategy of communicating with the public to inform them about infection prevention is also crucial. Extra support for managing the recession is also important. However, it is not clear that other countries can implement the measures that the Chinese eventually adopted to reduce and control the incidence in the future. Extensive capacity is needed for such a level of medical care, which is a health emergency and is particularly challenging. We hope that the analytical results of this study will help to clarify important aspects of the outbreak so that the spread of coronavirus in different locations can be minimized in the shortest possible time.","Health professionals, especially those working in hospitals caring for people with confirmed or suspected 2019-nCoV pneumonia, are vulnerable to both high risk of infection and mental health problems. They may also experience fear of contagion and spreading the virus to their families, friends, or colleagues. Health workers in a Beijing hospital who were quarantined, worked in high-risk clinical settings such as SARS units, or had family or friends who were infected with SARS, had substantially more post-traumatic stress symptoms than those without these experiences. 8 Health professionals who worked in SARS units and hospitals during the SARS outbreak also reported depression, anxiety, fear, and frustration. 6 Despite the common mental health problems and disorders found among patients and health workers in such settings, most health professionals working in isolation units and hospitals do not receive any training in providing mental health care. Timely mental health care needs to be developed urgently. Some methods used in the SARS outbreak could be helpful for the response to the 2019-nCoV outbreak. First, multidisciplinary mental health teams established by health authorities at regional and national levels (including psychiatrists, psychiatric nurses, clinical psychologists, and other mental health workers) should deliver mental health support to patients and health workers. Specialised psychiatric treatments and appropriate mental health services and facilities should be provided for patients with comorbid mental disorders. Second, clear communication with regular and accurate updates about the 2019-nCoV outbreak should be provided to both health workers and patients in order to address their sense of uncertainty and fear. Treatment plans, progress reports, and health status updates should be given to both patients and their families. Third, secure services should be set up to provide psychological counselling using electronic devices and applications (such as smartphones and WeChat) for affected patients, as well as their families and members of the public. Using safe communication channels between patients and families, such as smartphone communication and WeChat, should be encouraged to decrease isolation. Fourth, suspected and diagnosed patients with 2019-nCoV pneumonia as well as health professionals working in hospitals caring for infected patients should receive regular clinical screening for depression, anxiety, and suicidality by mental health workers. Timely psychiatric treatments should be provided for those presenting with more severe mental health problems. For most patients and health workers, emotional and behavioural responses are part of an adaptive response to extraordinary stress, and psychotherapy techniques such as those based on the stress-adaptation model might be helpful. 7, 10 If psychotropic medications are used, such as those prescribed by psychiatrists for severe psychiatric comorbidities, 6 basic pharmacological treatment principles of ensuring minimum harm should be followed to reduce harmful effects of any interactions with 2019-nCoV and its treatments.","MERS-CoV affects all ages. The clinical epidemiology of MERS-CoV cases showed similarity to the seasonal flu; however, severe cases have been reported in elderly individuals and immune compromised patients with underlying conditions.9 Health-care workers are among the risk groups2 and asymptomatic health-care workers spread illness among hospitalized patients.10","Human disease from H5N1 mainly affects children and young adults, making the high mortality especially remarkable. Among reported cases, the median age has been 18 years with a range of 3 months to 81 years. 64, 141 Less than 10% of reported cases have occurred Since late 2003, the virus has spread widely and has been found in 63 countries in Africa, Asia, and Europe, with more than 7000 avian outbreaks reported to the World Organisation for Animal Health. 128 HPAI H5N1 is believed to have spread through multiple modes, including bird migration, international trade in poultry and poultry products, and illegal bird transport, although the relative contribution of these modes is unclear. 111, 129, 130 A variety of strategies, including depopulation, enhanced biosecurity and sanitary measures, and poultry vaccination, have been employed in veterinary settings to control and prevent HPAI H5N1. 120, 131, 132 However, owing to the widespread distribution of this virus, its continuous evolution into multiple lineages, poultry husbandry practices in many parts of Asia, its presence in wild birds and waterfowl, and the human and financial resources needed to implement control measures, the success of these strategies has been variable. 133 Because studies in several countries have demonstrated a strong correlation between the detection of H5N1 outbreaks in poultry and the location and timing of human disease, veterinary public health measures to control the virus must remain an integral part of efforts to reduce the risk to humans from H5N1 and other avian influenza viruses. 134, 135 From 2003 through the end of 2012, the WHO has recorded 610 human cases of H5N1 in 15 countries, with 360 (59%) of these cases being fatal-an unprecedented case-fatality rate for influenza. 136 It has been argued that the observed case-fatality rate may appear artificially high owing to restrictive case definitions and surveillance methods that miss milder and asymptomatic infections. 137 However, H5N1 serosurveys, even in high-risk poultry workers, tend to yield low seroprevalence, and this argument has been challenged. [137] [138] [139] [140] Furthermore, the case-fatality rate has not changed appreciably over time (Fig. 14-5) ","These findings have several practical implications. First, the high viral load during the early phase of illness suggests that patients could be most infectious during this period, and it might account for the high transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, the high viral load on presentation suggests that SARS-CoV-2 could be susceptible to emergence of antiviral resistance. Second, age was associated with viral load in this study, which could explain the high degree of severe disease in older patients with SARS-CoV-2. 5, 6 The high viral load in elderly patients is associated not only with low immunity but also with high expression of the ACE2 receptor (the cellentry receptor for SARS-CoV-2) in older adults. 7 The timing of antibody seroconversion is crucial for determining the optimum timepoints for collecting serum specimens for antibody testing for diagnosis. Furthermore, this information is important for immunologists to choose the best timepoints for obtaining peripheral blood B cells for development of therapeutic monoclonal antibodies. 8 The major strength of the study by To and colleagues is the systematic analysis of the serial viral load and antibody profile for up to 4 weeks, which provides insights into viral and host interactions during the acute and convalescent phases. Another notable aspect is that self-collected posterior oro pharyngeal saliva samples were used, instead of nasopharyngeal specimens, for viral load monitoring. Collection of nasopharyngeal specimens is an invasive procedure, and it is uncomfortable for the patient and poses an infection risk to health-care workers. Self-collected saliva is much more acceptable to patients and is safer for health-care workers. This study clearly shows the feasibility of using saliva for viral load monitoring.","One concern of vaccination in humans is vaccine-mediated enhancement of disease, a process in which the disease following infection is more severe in vaccinated individuals than in unvaccinated individuals. Although this was observed in only a small subset of vaccine studies that were carried out for SARS-CoV136 and has not yet been observed in any of the published MERS-CoV vaccine studies, it is an important concern. Moreover, it is unclear who to vaccinate against MERS-CoV, as healthy individuals seem to be at little risk of severe disease. Older patients or patients with underlying disease, who have the highest risk of severe MERS, would be important target populations. However, vaccination in such patients can be problematic owing to their poor immune responses, as has been established for influenza virus141. In addition, vaccination of people with a high risk of exposure to MERS-CoV, such as health care workers, slaughterhouse workers and camel herders, is advisable142.","Compared with other international migrants (ie, international students), IMWs encounter more barriers in accessing health services in host countries (eg, inadequate health insurance), particularly migrant domestic workers. 2 Under normal conditions, IMWs have a high burden of common mental disorders (eg, depression) and a lower quality of life than local populations. 2, 3 This situation could worsen during the COVID-19 epidemic due to the potential and fear of governmental-imposed quarantine and lost income. For instance, some migrant domestic workers in Hong Kong and Macau have lost their jobs because their employers have left the territory. Many domestic workers cannot obtain masks from the pharmacy because they must stay with employers and adhere to government-recommended selfquarantine. 4 In the absence of reliable information in their own language, IMWs may also not recognise the seriousness of the epidemic or receive accurate information on how to protect themselves from infection. 5 However, most IMWs have smartphones, 3 which can be a useful aid in providing informational and social support during the epidemic, like during the previous MERS epidemic. 5 For instance, WeChat (a Chinese social network platform) is used by IMWs in Hong Kong and Macau for sharing key health messages and official information to the community and providing one another with emotional support. It can, however, also spread inaccurate information and panic that could lead to IMWs delaying visits to health centres due to stigmatisation of those who are infected. 5 Regardless of IMWs communities' self-reliance and resilience, addressing their health needs should be made an urgent public health priority because infection among these individuals could also lead to community infection, eventually affecting the entire population's health. For instance, during the epidemic, IMWs should be provided more accessible health care. Public health campaigns should be available in multiple languages and diffused through various communication channels and networks of IMWs as soon as possible. In addition, more countries should ratify the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families to provide global health equity and ensure that migrant workers' health is not neglected in future epidemics and disasters.","A total of 75 SARS patients, 41 health care workers and 66 individuals were included in this study. All the populations were Chinese Han ethnic. The mean age was 35.0 years for SARS, 35.7 for health care workers and 30.1 for individual controls (SARS Vs HCW, P &gt; 0.05; SARS Vs individual control, P &gt; 0.05). The proportion of male was 30.6% in SARS, 26.8% in health care workers and 69.5% in individual controls (SARS Vs HCW, P &gt; 0.05; SARS Vs individual control, P &lt; 0.05). The sera positive rate anti-SARS-CoV antibody was 100.0% in SARS, significantly higher than that of health care workers and individual controls (SARS Vs HCW, P &lt; 0.05; SARS Vs individual control, P &lt; 0.05) (Table 1).","At the time of this writing, cases continue to be reported. Furthermore, there are also many unknowns regarding this outbreak, including the reservoir host, modes of transmission/transmission potential, and the effectiveness of potential vaccine candidates. Here we have attempted to address some of these issues using foundations from previous coronavirus outbreaks as well as our own analysis. What is certain is that the numbers of reported cases are increasing and will continue to increase before the knowledge gaps surrounding 2019-nCoV are filled. Cooperation among public health officials, healthcare workers, and scientists will be key to gaining a foothold and containing virus spread. Acknowledgement of coronaviruses as a constant spillover threat is important for pandemic preparedness. Two key take-away messages are important at this time: 1) As noted by the previous lopsided cases of healthcare, healthcare workers and care givers should exercise extreme caution and use personal protective equipment (PPE) in providing care to 2019-nCoV infected patients; and 2) The research community should endeavour to compile diverse CoV reagents that can quickly be mobilized for rapid vaccine development, antiviral discovery, differential diagnosis, and specific diagnosis.","The advent of the next 'flu season will pose considerable problems, given the lack of reliable laboratory methods for the early diagnosis of SARS. The case definitions, too, will need to be adjusted to a world without SARS; in theory, new cases are \"impossible\" as the criterion of an epidemiological link cannot be fulfilled. Precious time may therefore be lost before a reappearance is detected. Vigilance for SARS must clearly be maintained (see: Alert, verification and public health management of SARS in the post-outbreak period-14 August 2003-rationale for continued vigilance for SARS; http://www.who.int/csr/sars/postoutbreak/ en/). For this purpose, WHO has defined three geographical zones according to their presumed risk for a SARS recurrence: a potential zone of re-emergence, comprising Guangdong and other areas where animal-to-human of SARS-CoV might occur; nodal areas, comprising Hong Kong, Vietnam, Singapore, Canada, and Taiwan, with sustained local transmission in spring 2003 or entry of numerous persons from the potential zone of re-emergence; and low risk areas. SARS-related vigilance should be staged according to the zone in which a particular area is situated; for low risk areas, surveillance should be for clusters of \"alert\" cases among health care workers, other hospital staff, patients and visitors in the same health care unit. A SARS Alert is defined as two or more health care workers or hospital-acquired illness in at least three individuals (health care workers and/or other hospital staff and/or patients and/or visitors) in the same unit fulfilling the clinical case definition of SARS and with onset of illness in the same 10-day period. In the other zones, this should be supplemented by enhanced surveillance, plus special studies for SARS-CoV infections in animal and human populations in the potential zone of re-emergence.","To establish effective communication between health authorities and the public, health authorities must take into account both the channels through which they can convey information most effectively and the timing when the information provided will have the most advantageous effect [23] . General information about SARS and control measures for SARS transmission has been reported in newspapers and TV news. Nevertheless, this study revealed that one-third of respondents changed their mind after they read information about efficacy of SARS control in the hospital. Therefore, in terms of channels, mass media, such as newspaper and television, play the major role in communicating with the public. However, the mass media is a two-edged sword; sometimes the public are relieved that they have less chance to catch SARS in hospital due to a news story, and sometimes they are scared about susceptibility to SARS infection. Thus, health authorities should establish an effective communication system which avoids an epidemic of fear due to poor communication between health authorities and the mass media and the public.","The localised MERS-CoV epidemic reminds us of the importance of communication at all levels and perhaps the need to rethink how stakeholders are informed of the progress of chasing down and studying new disease threats. In May 2014, two cases of MERS-CoV were imported into the USA. A third person was proposed to be the first local transmission event but was subsequently declared a false-positive. These cases served as an excellent example of \"gumshoe epidemiology\" working alongside excellent public communication, comprehensive laboratory support and a well-prepared clinical capacity. Social and mainstream media and press conferences comprehensively informed the public of the extensive findings generated by expert health care supported by laboratory analysis. And yet lessons were still learned about balancing real-time transparency and the need for suitable laboratory confirmation of results. This case highlighted the effectiveness of social media in communicating digestible information to expectant stakeholders compared to the use of a generally slower and more elite peer-reviewed scientific publication pipeline which is often better suited to detailed research description over the long haul, but with some exceptions, a process unsuited for informing a concerned global and always-online public of potential threats to its immediate health or providing context to those threats.","The optimal PPE for preventing transmission of SARS during such ultra-high-risk procedures has not yet been determined. However, PPE should be used that covers all exposed areas of skin including the arms, torso, eyes, nose and mouth. N95 or higher standard respirators are also necessary. A fit-check should be performed each time a respirator is put on. For better protection of staff working inside operating theatres, we used HEPA units with hoods completely covering the head and neck and portions of the shoulders and torso. Factors to consider when choosing respirators in this setting include availability, impact on mobility, comfort, duration of use and recharge power supply. With the units we used, the HCWs did not encounter any major difficulty, apart from slightly reduced mobility and difficulty in communicating while carrying out the operation. Some problems known to be associated with HEPA units include partially charged batteries, ineffective filters, and contamination of HCWs during disrobing. Proper training prior to use may reduce such problems.","First, little attention is paid to the practical implementation of interventions. Overall planning is not adequate. When an outbreak occurs, no authoritative organisation exists to deploy and plan psychological intervention activities in different regions and subordinate departments. Hence, most medical departments start psychological interventional activities independently without communicating with each other, thereby wasting mental health resources, and failing patients in terms of a lack of a timely diagnosis, and poor follow-up for treatments and evaluations.","The severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus was first discovered in 2002/2003 when an epidemic originating in Southern China spread rapidly (in a limited number of cases) to the rest of Asia and then Europe, Canada, and the United States. SARS is a highly contagious virus, with high rates of spread identified in health care workers. The case-fatality rate during the epidemic was 9.6% and was strongly associated with increasing age (case-fatality rate of 43.3% in those older than 60 years). 99 SARS was noted to have multiple modes of transmission, including droplet and airborne spread as well as direct contact with contaminated surfaces. 100, 101 In the nosocomial cases, contaminated surfaces included surfaces in the patient's own rooms.","Definition \u25a0 The term learning disability or impairment is a label \u25a0 It is used as a convenience in discussion and for planning services \u25a0 Every person described as having a learning disability is a person first \u25a0 The term itself was widely adopted in the UK following a speech in 1996 to Mencap by Stephen Dorrell, the then Secretary for Health \u25a0 Many who have the label prefer the term 'people with learning difficulties' -this is the term used by People First, an international advocacy organisation \u25a0 Learning disability or impairment is a term often used when a person has certain limitations in mental functioning (cognition) and in skills such as communicating, taking care of him or herself, and sociability \u25a0 However, in the USA, the same term usually is used to denote specific learning impairments such as dyslexia, rather than impaired cognition \u25a0 Learning impairment affects as many as 3 out of every 100 people: about 2% of the population have a mild learning disability and about 0.35% of the population have a severe learning disability.","patients with learning disability and requires careful assessment \u25a0 Many people with learning disability are amenable to treatment in the dental surgery ( Fig. 3.25 ), although more time may be required -up to one-third may require sedation or a general anaesthetic \u25a0 A greater proportion of people with learning disability require special facilities or an escort nurse to facilitate dental treatment than those who are psychiatrically ill \u25a0 Communication can be difficult with some patients, particularly if the individual has associated visual or hearing impairment \u25a0 Communicating with the patient who has mild learning disability can be aided if dental staff: \u2022 minimise distractions \u2022 use short explanations \u2022 use simple language \u2022 use 'tell-show-do' \u2022 use positive reinforcement \u2022 use verbal praise \u2022 take more time to present information \u2022 teach activities rather than concepts \u2022 encourage consistency \u25a0 When communicating with the patient who has severe learning disability: \u2022 use short simple explanations \u2022 repeat instructions \u2022 practice oral hygiene procedures with the patient and carer \u2022 use positive reinforcement.","Given the surge of increasing number of confirmed cases on a daily basis in China, health workers have to take care of the increasing number of patients flocking in hospitals. Patient overload may lead to staff burnout, physical and mental exhaustion. Some health workers infected with the COVID-19 may feel helpless, hopeless and being isolated too. Thus, health care workers' mental health may be at stake and should not be overlooked. Health authority, stakeholders and health policymakers should make concerted effort to ensure sufficient supplies of protective gear to front line health workers who are arguably at highest risk of contracting the COVID-19. More importantly, health workers should be provided with professional counselling if they showed early signs of burnout, anxiety and/ depression to minimize the risk of developing psychiatric morbidity.","The heavy toll paid by health care workers during the SARS outbreak demonstrated the vulnerability of health care workers in a respiratory epidemic. The risk of transmission was particularly high in the ICU because of the high viral load in the critically ill, as well as aerosol-generating procedures, such as intubation, suctioning, and bronchoscopy. A retrospective cohort study reported a staggering 13-fold increase in the risk of becoming infected among health care workers who performed or assisted in endotracheal intubations [19] .","In recent years, Chinese health workers are often confronted with frustrating situations in the health care system including serious workplace violence against clinicians. A meta-analysis found that the overall prevalence of workplace violence was 62.4% among Chinese health workers 9. Regardless of the unsafe clinical environment, Chinese health workers are always committed to provide timely health services without any hesitation or reservations. For instance, as of February 12, 2020, a total of 189 external expert teams comprising 21,569 health workers from other regions of China have volunteered to work in Hubei province, disregarding the high risk of contracting the infection and the high mortality rate of the COVID-19 among health workers 10.","Guan et al published the largest cohort study to date which included 1,099 hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection from China. They reported that 5.0% of COVID-19 infected patients had nausea or vomiting and 3.8% had diarrhea. 21 30 A recent meta-analysis of 4243 patients from China suggested that approximately 17.6% of patients had any gastrointestinal symptom, including 9.2% with pain, 12.5% with diarrhea, 10.2% with nausea/vomiting. 31 One of the concerns with many of the published studies is the possible duplicate inclusion of the patients across reports, thereby limiting valid performance of pooled estimates in a meta-analysis. 32 There is evidence for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in stool specimens independent of the presence of diarrhea. Some studies showed that stool continued to be positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA even after respiratory samples became negative. Chen et al reported a case of COVID-19 based on compatible symptoms and lung imaging in a patient with positive stool real-time RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 RNA but negative pharyngeal swabs and sputum samples. Furthermore, Wang et al reported confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 positive fecal samples in 2 patients without diarrhea. 12, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40 What are the liver manifestations of COVID-19? Liver injury is estimated to occur in up to 20-30% of patients at the time of diagnosis with SARS-CoV-2 infection. 14 Severe hepatitis has been reported but liver failure appears to be rare. 39 The pattern of liver injury appears to be predominantly hepatocellular, and the etiology remains uncertain but may represent a secondary effect of the systemic inflammatory response observed with COVID-19 disease, although direct viral infection and drug-induced liver injury cannot be excluded. One study of liver biopsy specimens obtained from a patient with COVID-19 disease revealed microvesicular steatosis and mild lobular and portal activity, suggestive of either SARS-CoV-2 infection or drug-induced liver injury. 41 Abnormal liver enzymes may be observed in both adults and children with COVID-19, 42 and do not appear to be a major predictor of clinical outcomes. 15 Early studies have multiple methodologic limitations, with variable laboratory thresholds, limited longitudinal assessment of liver enzymes, heterogeneous evaluation for alternative etiologies, and limited information regarding baseline liver diseases and confounding variables. Additional studies are needed to further characterize the unique clinical considerations for SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients with chronic liver disease and/or cirrhosis, 43 although preliminary guidance has been provided by the AASLD on March 23, 2020. 44 What are the potential risks to health care workers performing endoscopy? SARS-CoV-2 is presumed to spread primarily via respiratory droplets from talking, coughing, sneezing, and close contact with symptomatic individuals. However humanto-human transmission can occur from unknown infected persons (e.g. asymptomatic carriers or individuals with mild symptoms) as well as individuals with virus shedding during the pre-incubation period before symptoms develop. 45 Data related to the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in the early phase of the pandemic have confirmed that health care professionals are at higher risk of infection than the general population. The WHO and Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (China CDC) reported infection of 2055 health care workers as of February 20, 2020 during the index outbreak in Hubei Province, with health care workers facing a rate of infection approximately three times the general population. 46 This prompted the Chinese Department of Health Reform to deploy more than 40,000 additional health-care workers to the region, preserve personal protective equipment (PPE), and implement surveillance measures and quarantine protocols. 46 Such measures appear to have slowed the spread to health care workers, with recent cases primarily attributable to household contacts rather than occupational exposure. Similar trends have been observed in Europe, with an estimated 20% of COVID-19 infections in Italy occurring in health care workers. 47 Preliminary reports in the US also suggest that health care workers are at risk of nosocomial infections, including infection of 20 health care workers among the first 67 COVID-19 positive individuals in Philadelphia, and additional health care workers cases in WA, NY, and MA. 48, 49, 50 The spread of disease via health care workers is concerning for several reasons: a) appropriate PPE may not be utilized effectively, especially when COVID-19 patients cannot be identified quickly, b) shortage of health care workers due to infection and/or quarantine, and c) the concern of the role of infected health care workers to act as a vector for transmission to patients.","A common type of descriptive study that is conducted in clinical settings is the case series. A case series describes the clinical features of a disease and the demographic profiles and other interesting features of patients with the disease. They are typically the domain of practicing clinicians and serve as a way of communicating significant clinical observations. For example, the SARS epidemic was first recognized outside of China as an unusual series of cases of patients with atypical pneumonia. 60 As the case series grew, with evidence of transmission to hospital staff, it became apparent that an unusual outbreak was occurring. More recently, a series of 33 patients hospitalized in a medical intensive care unit during an outbreak of chikungunya virus on Reunion Island demonstrated that chikungunya virus infection can cause severe neurologic disease with the involvement of other organ systems. 61","Conclusions: This multi-step approach has improved pharmacists' knowledge about antibiotic resistance and confidence in communicating with others. Involvement of nursing and ECE students has increased the capacity to provide community education about appropriate antibiotic use in Alberta with the aim of reducing rates of antibiotic resistance.","The information and data from these exercises should be analysed to build and inform readiness and response plans for preventing and controlling health emergencies including the outbreak of COVID-19. The analyses of the operational readiness index have been used to support the development of a draft WHO strategic preparedness and response plan for COVID-19. 23 These findings must be triangulated with the latest risk assessments available for COVID-19 and other assessments such as Joint External Evaluations, after-action reviews, simulation exercises, and others to understand the capacity level of countries and to implement priority actions at the national and subnational levels. 19, 23 The WHO Secretariat is working on the development of a preparedness dashboard to provide real-time information that is based on these capacity assessments. Another limitation is related to the method being based on a deterministic approach; therefore, proportionate or inverse interactions among variables could not be shown. 24 An effective way of managing airborne infections is applying evidence-based public health prevention strategies. 16, 17, 22 This method includes scaling up public awareness of behaviours such as hand hygiene and respiratory etiquette, communicating and engaging with local communities about the risks of the outbreak, and putting in place effective public health response measures. 17, 25, 26 National points of entry should also have the capacity to prevent, detect, and respond to potential threats in line with the IHR. Many countries have low capacities for preventing the occurrence and spread of outbreaks, such as measles, influenza, Ebola virus. 27, 28 Therefore, enhancing national preparedness capacities in line with the gaps identified in this study should incorporate action to strengthen points of entry.","MERS-CoV in May 15 2013. The Saudi Ministry of health announced two cases of MERS-CoV infection in healthcare workers who were exposed to patients with confirmed infection [18] . In a recent publication from Saudi Arabia, four patients' members of an extended family had a total of 28 persons living in the extended household, with frequent contact and more often between husbands and wives and their children. None of the family members apart from the four patients and none of 124 health care workers who had contact with the patients developed respiratory symptoms or illness [10] . The data indicates a clear evidence of limited, non-sustained, human-to-human transmission. The exact route of transmission is not clear, but the most likely modes of transmission include droplet and contact transmission. But further studies are required to better understand the risks. When caring for patients with suspected or confirmed cases of MERS-CoV, the following recommendations for infection control measures in hospital settings include: standard precautions, droplet precautions (wearing a medical mask when in close contact (within 1 m) and upon entering the room or cubicle of the patient); and performing hand hygiene in accordance with the World Health Organization's (WHO) 5 moments of hand hygiene. Additional measures include wearing a particulate respirator when performing aerosol-generating procedures in addition to other precautions as outlined by WHO document [19] . A recent publication of MERS-CoV outbreak in healthcare setting, there was evidence of person-to-person transmission and the outbreak was aborted by the implementation of basic infection control measures [12] . The center for Disease Control and prevention, United States, recommends the placement of the patient in an Airborne Infection Isolation Room (AIIR) [20] .","Recommendation 1: In health care workers performing upper GI procedures, regardless of COVID-19 status*, the AGA recommends use of N95 (or N99, or PAPR) masks instead of surgical masks, as part of appropriate personal protective equipment (Strong recommendation, moderate certainty of evidence) Recommendation 2: In health care workers performing lower GI procedures, regardless of COVID-19 status*, the AGA recommends the use of N95 (or N99 or PAPR) masks instead of surgical masks as part of appropriate personal protective equipment. (Strong recommendation, low certainty of evidence) Recommendation 3: In health care workers performing any GI procedure, in known or presumptive COVID-19 patients, the AGA recommends against the use of surgical masks only, as part of adequate personal protective equipment (Strong recommendation, low certainty of evidence) *These recommendations assume the absence of widespread reliable and accurate rapid testing for the diagnosis of COVID-19 infection or immunity Summary of the Evidence Our systematic literature search did not identify any studies that provided direct evidence to inform our clinical questions for PPE in COVID-19. However, several studies from the SARS outbreak were identified that provide indirect evidence. The SARS outbreak reinforced the vital role of PPE in protecting health care workers from occupationally acquired infection. We used data from two existing systematic reviews by Offeddu 2017 and Tran 2012 to inform our recommendations. 58, 59 First, the systematic reviews by Offeddu et al included a meta-analysis of 3 observational studies that showed a benefit in using N95 respirators over standard masks in protecting health care workers from SARS (OR = 0.86; 95% CI: 0. 22 Table 4B ). Second, a systematic review from Tran et al revealed an increased risk of viral transmission in health care workers performing aerosol-generating procedures (mostly bronchoscopy or tracheal intubation). 59 (Supplemental Figure 3 ). Zamora and colleagues investigated the amount of contamination on the neck and face from individuals using a PAPR mask (in combination with N95) compared with a N95 mask alone 60 ; Individuals who used the PAPR-based strategy experienced a lower risk of face and neck contamination compared to N95 mask alone (RR = 0.08; 95% CI: 0.03-0.19). See Evidence Profile Table 5 , Supplemental Figure 4 . Limitations of these studies include small numbers of health care workers, and data on tracheal intubation or bronchoscopy, not GI endoscopy.","6.4 Concluding the outbreak 6.4.1 Declaring the outbreak over The OMT, with approval from the local public health authority, has responsibility for declaring the outbreak is over. The time from the onset of symptoms of the last case until the outbreak is declared over can vary, and depends on whether the last case was a resident or staff member. Generally, an influenza outbreak can be declared over if no new cases occur within 8 days following the onset of symptoms in the last resident case (8 days is the sum of the usual infectious period [5 days] plus maximum incubation period [3days]). A decision to declare the outbreak over should be made by the OMT, in consultation with the PHU. The OMT may take decisions about ongoing RCF surveillance after declaring the outbreak over, considering the following needs: \u2022 To maintain general infection control measures. \u2022 To monitor the status of ill residents, communicating with the public health authority if their status changes.","The Al-Hasa outbreak in 2013 provided valuable information about MERS-CoV transmission in the health care setting.6 The outbreak initially started in a hemodialysis unit in a private hospital in Al-Hasa and subsequently involved an additional three hospitals.6 The transmission was thought to be person-to-person in 21 of 23 cases and occurred in the hemodialysis unit, the intensive care unit, and/or the in-patient units.6 The transmission was secondary to droplet as well as direct or indirect contact. Further phylogenetic analysis of this outbreak showed that only eight of the 13 epidemiologic transmissions were related, suggesting multiple introductions of MERS-CoV in that outbreak.47 The most recent health care transmission occurred in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia in April\u2013May 2014. There was no change in the virus transmission or mutation.48 Near full genome sequence analyses of three viruses from the early phase of the Jeddah outbreak were highly similar but not identical, with no genome insertions or deletions.48 Most of the human-to-human infections were in the health care setting and 25% of all cases were health care workers.49 In April 2014, another health-care-associated cluster was reported from Al-Ain, United Arab Emirates and resulted in infection of 16 health care workers of the 23 total cases.50 The recent increase in the number of cases of MERS-CoV in April\u2013May 2014 showed that 75% of the cases were secondary cases and that most of these cases were health care workers who acquired the infection in the health care setting.24 In the most recent outbreak in Saudi Arabia, of the 402 cases reported in June 2014, at least 25% were health care workers.11 One study showed that health care workers who contracted MERS-CoV were involved in aerosol generating procedures such as intubation, airway suctioning, and sputum induction.49\u201351","Subunit vaccines, while not viable for infants and therefore of limited use in the normal population, may provide a suitable approach to vaccination in immunosuppressed populations at high risk of severe RSV infection including high risk children, the elderly, and possibly for maternal immunization [38] . One viral surface glycoprotein, the fusion protein (F), has been used as the antigen for developing subunit vaccines (purified F protein [PFP]-1, PFP-2, and PFP-3). These F subunit vaccines have been shown to be moderately immunogenic and well tolerated in healthy seropositive children older than 12 months, children older than 12 months who have cystic fibrosis, and children older than 12 months who have chronic lung disease of prematurity. A meta-analysis of PFP-1 and PFP-2 studies suggested that these vaccines reduced the incidence of RSV infections but not lower respiratory tract infection [44] . The PFP-2 vaccine may show more promise in pregnant women; in a recent trial, it produced fourfold increases in neutralizing antibody titers in mothers and infants at birth and at 2 months of age [45] . Another subunit vaccine candidate is BBG2Na, a peptide from the G (receptor-binding) glycoprotein of RSV that is conjugated to the albuminbinding domain of streptococcal protein G [46, 47] . This vaccine is well tolerated, induces neutralizing antibody responses in healthy young adults, and is immunogenic in elderly individuals. Finally, subunit vaccines containing copurified F, G, and M proteins formulated with an alum adjuvant are being investigated [38, 48] . However, the likely targets for these vaccines will be elderly adults and those at high risk for severe RSV infection.","Conclusion: Stress hyperglycaemia is a common finding in non-diabetic patients with severe sepsis and is not related to a genetic predisposition to diabetes mellitus. It may be related to cytokine related insulin resistance and seems to be a significant predictor of outcome in non-diabetic septic patients. Objectives: Diabetes may be associated with increased mortality after pneumonia due to decreased immunity, impaired lung function, and hyperglycaemic derangement. We examined diabetes as a predictor of 30-day and 90-day mortality in a large cohort of adult patients hospitalized with pneumonia. Methods: Population-based cohort study in the three Danish counties of North Jutland, Viborg and Aarhus between 1994 and 2003. Patients with a first-time hospital discharge diagnosis of pneumonia were identified in hospital discharge registries. Information on diabetes and comorbidities was obtained from discharge registries and prescription databases. All patients were followed for 90 days after hospitalization through the Danish Civil Registration System. We compared mortality rates in patients with and without diabetes, adjusted for gender, age, and comorbidity. Results: A total of 41 793 adult patients were hospitalized with pneumonia (median age 74 years); of these, 3928 patients (9.6%) had diabetes. Overall mortality in diabetic patients compared with other patients with pneumonia was 18.7% vs. 14.8% after 30 days, and 26.5% vs. 21.4% after 90 days. After adjustment, mortality rates in patients with diabetes were only marginally increased (mortality rate ratio = 1.12 (95%CI: 1.04-1.21) after 30 days, and 1.09 (95% CI: 1.02-1.16) after 90 days) compared with non-diabetic pneumonia patients. Conclusion: Our results corroborate previous reports suggesting that diabetes has only a very limited influence on outcome in patients hospitalized with pneumonia. Objective: Although it has been demonstrated that type 2 diabetes patients (DM2) have an increased risk of urinary tract infections (UTIs), not much is known about predictors of a complicated course. A safe and feasible management strategy for patients at high or low risk of UTIs could improve efficient antimicrobial use and may direct preventive measures at those who need it most. We developed a prediction rule for complicated UTIs in DM2 patients in primary care. Methods: We conducted a 12-month prospective cohort study, including DM2 patients aged 45 years or older from the Second Dutch National Survey of General Practice carried out in the period 2000-2001. The primary outcome measure was a complicated course, which was a composite of recurrent cystitis, acute pyelonephritis and prostatitis. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to produce a clinical prediction rule and area under the receiver-operating curve (AUC) characteristics was calculated as a measure of discriminative capacity. For score cut-off points, the following test-characteristics were calculated: positive and negative predictive value, sensitivity, specificity and proportion of subjects selected. Results: Mean age of the 6343 DM2 patients was 67 years (SD 11) and 46% was male. Overall, the incidence rate of the outcome was 3 per 100 patient years (n = 179), 1 per 100 in females and 2 per 100 in males. Independent predictors were increasing age (odds ratio [OR], 1.02; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.00-1.03), male sex (1.72; 1.25-2.35), number of physician contacts (1.06; 1.05-1.07 per class), incontinence of urine (1.87; 1.03-3.38), cerebrovascular disease or dementia (2.14; 1.29-3.56) and renal disease (5.62; 2.11-14.95 ). The AUC was 0.77 (95%CI 0.73-0.80). Subgroup analyses for gender showed no differences in discriminative ability. Using a cut-off score of 4 or more points (range 0-12) 60% of the DM2 patients would be selected for tailored care whereas only 8% of the patients with a complicated course of UTI would be missed. Conclusion: We were able to derive an accurate model to predict complicated UTIs in male and female DM2 patients in primary care. If confirmed in external populations, the model may be used to improve management of UTIs in DM2 patients. Objective: Among elderly persons, those with diabetes (DM) have an elevated risk of complications from lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI). Careful risk assessment using an accurate and objective prediction rule could help general practitioners to target management of these infections more efficiently. However such a rule for an unselected population might be inaccurate for this high-risk group. As part of a large retrospective cohort study among elderly persons aged over 65 years, we conducted a subgroup analysis to determine the applicability of a developed prediction rule for the probability of a complicated course of LRTI in those with diabetes. Methods: In the original cohort study using the computerized database of the University Medical Center Utrecht general practitioners research network, 3166 general practitioner attended episodes of acute bronchitis, exacerbation of COPD or asthma or pneumonia were included. The outcome was a composite of 30-day hospitalization or death following an episode of LRTI. Potential predictors according to the prediction rule in the unselected population were type of LRTI diagnosis, age, presence of heart failure, predisone use, hospitalization in preceding year and antibiotics in previous month. For the high-risk group we were specifically interested in the added value of diabetes specific variables as the presence of cardiovascular co-morbidity and the use of insulin or oral diabetes medications. Calibration was tested with the Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness of fit test and discriminative capacity was estimated with the area under the receiver operating curve (AUC). Results: Among 445 episodes of LRTI among elderly patients with DM, 68 endpoints occurred (attack rate 15%). Reliability of the model was good (goodness-of-fit test p = 0.54). The discriminative properties of the original rule was acceptable (AUC: 0.79, 95% confidence interval: 0.72-0.86). In the low risk group (\u00a3 2 points), 6% of all patients ended with hospitalization or death and 40% in the high risk group ( \u2021 6 points). Conclusion: The prediction rule for the probability of hospitalization or death derived from an unselected elderly population with LRTI appeared to have acceptable discriminative properties in diabetes patients also and may be used to target management of these common diseases. Applying this rule may safely restrict the need for treatment and help GPs to target additional efforts to those patients who need it most. Objectives: Foot infections in patients with diabetes mellitus are among the most common bacterial infections encountered in our clinical practice. The aim of the present study was to evaluate aetiology, medical outcomes, including risks for complications and mortality, in 68 adult patients hospitalized for severe DFI. Methods: This report describes a retrospective analysis of medical records of 68 hospitalized patients who had been admitted or consultated to Infectious Diseases Department for severe DFI from January 2004 to November 2005 in a University hospital. Results: There were 40 males and 28 females. Average patient age was 51.8 years. Most of the patients were in level 1, 2, or 3 on Wagner Scale, only 23 (33.8%) of patients had combined osteomyelitis and deep soft tissue infection. Forty-seven bacteria were documented microbiologically in 39 cases (57.3%). Staphylococcus aureus and Enterobacteriaceae being the most common isolates. Overall, 25 patients (36.7%) were discharged early (&lt; 14 days) and 43 patients (63.2%) were hospitalized for more than 14 days. Of these, 51 required early surgical debridement (75%), 23 (33.8%) underwent at least one digit amputation. Amputation was more common with level 4 patients (62%) compared with those who had SSTI (30%) only. Overall mortality was 14% factors associated with death were male sex, presence of multiple comorbid conditions, congestive hearth failure, morbid obesity, hypoalbuminaemia, renal insufficiency, and shock.","(iv) Difficulty in communicating. device-independent. In the case of a pandemic outbreak, time-consuming production and cost would be major limitations to respirator use. Although a certified respirator is recommended, considering the heavy use of surgical masks and scarcity of respirators, the technology should be easily extendable to masks and other existing infection control measures. Therefore, the aforementioned factors outline the considerations that can enhance respiratory protection for a timely emergency response.","It is important to ensure that national strategic plans are operational.

However, there are three technical obstacles that should be addressed to appropriately measure this risk. First, division of the cumulative number of deaths by that of cases tends to underestimate the actual risk because deaths that will occur have not yet observed, and so the delay in time from illness onset to death must be addressed. Second, the observed dataset of reported cases represents only a proportion of all infected individuals and there can be a substantial number of asymptomatic and mildly infected individuals who are never diagnosed. Third, ascertainment bias and risk of death among all those infected would be smaller when estimated using shorter virus detection windows and less sensitive diagnostic laboratory tests. In the ongoing COVID-19 epidemic, health authorities must cope with the uncertaint...","Severe acute respiratory syndrome is a newly emerged infectious disease with moderately high transmissibility. Nosocomial outbreaks were responsible for the propagation of the epidemic worldwide. Health care workers (HCW) are at particular high risk because of their close contact with patients, involvement in medical procedures, and handling of excreta/fomites. Good hospital organization and appropriate infection control strategies are essential to prevent/interrupt disease transmission from patients to HCWs (and vice versa) and among inpatients and HCWs themselves. Education and training should target broadly to all HCWs.","The health authorities reported that 3,019 Chinese health workers were infected with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), of whom, ten died. This article explored relevant reasons and offered suggestions to reduce the risk of infection and provide emergency psychological response for this population.","The number of confirmed COVID-19 cases admitted in hospitals is continuously increasing in the Philippines. Frontline health care workers are faced with imminent risks of getting infected. In this study, we formulate a theoretical model to calculate the risk of being infected in health care facilities considering the following factors: the average number of encounters with a suspected COVID-19 patient per hour; interaction time for each encounter; work shift duration or exposure time; crowd density, which may depend on the amount of space available in a given location; and availability and effectiveness of protective gears and facilities provided for the frontline health care workers. Based on the simulation results, we recommend the following: (i) decrease the rate of patient encounter per frontline health care worker, e.g., maximum of three encounters per hour in a 12-hour work shift duration; (ii) decrease the interaction time between the frontline health care worker and the patient...","BACKGROUND We described the epidemiological features of the coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) outbreak, and evaluated the impact of non-pharmaceutical interventions on the epidemic in Wuhan, China. METHODS Individual-level data on 25,961 laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 cases reported through February 18, 2020 were extracted from the municipal Notifiable Disease Report System. Based on key events and interventions, we divided the epidemic into four periods: before January 11, January 11-22, January 23 - February 1, and February 2-18. We compared epidemiological characteristics across periods and different demographic groups. We developed a susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered model to study the epidemic and evaluate the impact of interventions. RESULTS The median age of the cases was 57 years and 50.3% were women. The attack rate peaked in the third period and substantially declined afterwards across geographic regions, sex and age groups, except for children (age &lt;20) whose attack ...","Abstract Since the emergence of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in 2012, many questions remain on modes of transmission and sources of virus. In outbreak situations, especially with emerging organisms causing severe human disease, it is important to understand the full spectrum of disease, and shedding kinetics in relation to infectivity and the ability to transmit the microorganism. Laboratory response capacity during the early stages of an outbreak focuses on development of virological and immunological methods for patient diagnosis, for contact tracing, and for epidemiological studies into sources, modes of transmission, identification of risk groups, and animal reservoirs. However, optimal use of this core public health laboratory capacity requires a fundamental understanding of kinetics of viral shedding and antibody response, of assay validation and of interpretation of test outcomes. We reviewed available data from MERS-CoV case reports, and compared this...","Abstract The coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 that has significant implications for the cardiovascular care of patients. First, those with COVID-19 and preexisting cardiovascular disease (CVD) have an increased risk of severe disease and death. Second, infection has been associated with multiple direct and indirect cardiovascular complications including acute myocardial injury, myocarditis, arrhythmias and venous thromboembolism. Third, therapies under investigation for COVID-19 may have cardiovascular side effects. Fourth, the response to COVID-19 can compromise the rapid triage of non-COVID-19 patients with cardiovascular conditions. Finally, the provision of cardiovascular care may place health care workers in a position of vulnerability as they become host or vectors of virus transmission. We hereby review the peer-reviewed and preprint literature pertaining to cardiovascular considerations relate...","Background Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is a novel coronavirus that causes a severe respiratory disease with high case fatality rate. Starting in March 2014, a dramatic increase of cases has occurred in the Arabian Peninsula, many of which were acquired in health care settings. As of May 9, 2014, 536 laboratory-confirmed cases and 145 deaths have been reported globally. Methods Review of publicly available data about MERS-CoV health care\u2013associated transmission. Results We identified 11 events of possible or confirmed health care\u2013associated transmission with high morbidity and mortality, mainly among patients with comorbidities. Health care workers are also frequently affected; however, they tend to have milder symptoms and better prognosis. Gaps in infection control were noted in all events. Currently, health care\u2013associated outbreaks are playing a pivotal role in the evolution of the MERS-CoV epidemic in countries in the Arabian Peninsula. Conclusion There ...","Background: So far, the psychological impact of COVID-19 epidemic among family members of Health care workers (HCWs) in China has been neglected. The present cross-sectional study aimed to investigate the mental health status and related factors of families of HCWs in Designated Hospitals in Ningbo, China. Method: Family members of HCWs working in five designated hospitals in Ningbo, China were recruited between February 10th and 20th, 2020. Information on demographic variables, the COVID-19-related events in the lives, knowledge of COVID-19 and the working status of family members (that is, HCWs) was collected using online self-administered questionnaires. The mental health status were assessed using the Chinese version of Patient Health Questionnare-9 (PHQ-9) and Chinese version of Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7 ). Multivariable logistic regression analyses were conducted to identify the main factors associated with the mental health conditions. Results: A total of 822 partici...","Abstract Guangdong Province is recognized for dense populations of humans, pigs, poultry and pets. In order to evaluate the threat of viral infection faced by those working with animals, a cross-sectional, sero-epidemiological study was conducted in Guangdong between December 2013 and January 2014. Individuals working with swine, at poultry farms, or live poultry markets (LPM), and veterinarians, and controls not exposed to animals were enrolled in this study and 11 (4 human, 3 swine, 3 avian, and 1 canine) influenza A viruses were used in hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assays (7 strains) and the cross-reactivity test (9 strains) in which 5 strains were used in both tests. Univariate analysis was performed to identify which variables were significantly associated with seropositivity. Odds ratios (OR) revealed that swine workers had a significantly higher risk of elevated antibodies against A/swine/Guangdong/L6/2009(H1N1), a classical swine virus, and A/swine/Guangdong/SS1/2012(H1N1),...","Objectives: To study the effectiveness of noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) in the treatment of acute respiratory failure (ARF) in severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), and the associated infection risk. Methods: All patients with the diagnosis of probable SARS admitted to a regional hospital in Hong Kong from March 9 to April 28, 2003, and who had SARS-related respiratory distress complications were recruited for NIPPV usage. The health status of all health-care workers working in the NIPPV wards was closely monitored, and consent was obtained to check serum for coronavirus serology. Patient outcomes and the risk of SARS transmission to health-care workers were assessed. Results: NIPPV was applied to 20 patients (11 male patients) with ARF secondary to SARS. Mean age was 51.4 years, and mean acute physiology and chronic health evaluation II score was 5.35. Coronavirus serology was positive in 95% (19 of 20 patients). NIPPV was started 9.6 days (mean) from symptom o...","Abstract Background : A novel form of Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) in Wuhan has created a confused and rapidly evolving situation. In this situational framework, patients and front-line healthcare workers are vulnerable. Method : Studies were identified using large-circulation international journals found in two electronic databases: Scopus and Embase. Results : Populations of patients that may require tailored interventions are older adults and international migrant workers. Older adults with psychiatric conditions may be experiencing further distress. The COVID-19 epidemic has underscored potential gaps in mental health services during emergencies. Conclusions : Most health professionals working in isolation units and hospitals do not receive any training for providing mental health care. Fear seems more certainly a consequence of mass quarantine.","Protection of healthcare workforce is of paramount relevance for the care of infected and non-infected patients in the setting of a pandemic such as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Healthcare workers are at increased risk to become infected because of contact to infected patients, infected co-workers and their community outside the hospital. The ideal organisational strategy to protect the healthcare workforce in a situation in which social distancing cannot be maintained at the workplace remains to be determined. In this study, we have mathematically modelled strategies for the employment of hospital workforce with the goal to simulate health and productivity of the workers. Therefore, deterministic models were extended to account for stochastic influences potentially occurring in rather small populations. The models were also designed to determine if desynchronization of medical teams by dichotomizing the workers may protect the workforce. Our studies model workforce productivit...","Abstract Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is caused by SARS-COV2 and represents the causative agent of a potentially fatal disease that is of great global public health concern. Based on the large number of infected people that were exposed to the wet animal market in Wuhan City, China, it is suggested that this is likely the zoonotic origin of COVID-19. Person-to-person transmission of COVID-19 infection led to the isolation of patients that were subsequently administered a variety of treatments. Extensive measures to reduce person-to-person transmission of COVID-19 have been implemented to control the current outbreak. Special attention and efforts to protect or reduce transmission should be applied in susceptible populations including children, health care providers, and elderly people. In this review, we highlights the symptoms, epidemiology, transmission, pathogenesis, phylogenetic analysis and future directions to control the spread of this fatal disease.","Abstract Introduction Influenza is a common respiratory infectious disease affecting population worldwide yearly.

In coronaviruses, the receptor binding domain (RBD) in the distal part of S1 subunit of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein can directly bind to angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). RBD promote viral entry into the host cells and is an important therapeutic target. In this study, we discovered that theaflavin showed the lower idock score (idock score: \u22127.95 kcal/mol). To confirm the result, we discovered that theaflavin showed FullFitness score of \u2212991.21 kcal/mol and estimated \u0394G of \u22128.53 kcal/mol for the most favorable interaction with contact area of SARS-CoV-2 RBD by SwissDock service. Regarding contact modes, hydrophobic interactions contribute significantly in binding and additional hydrogen bonds were formed between theaflavin and Arg454, Phe456, Asn460, Cys480, Gln493, Asn501 and Val503 of SARS-CoV-2 RBD, near the direct contact area with ACE2.

The disease has been etiologically linked to a novel coronavirus that has been named the SARS-associated coronavirus. It appears to be spread primarily by large droplet transmission. There is no specific therapy, and management consists of supportive care. This article summarizes currently available information regarding the epidemiology, clinical features, etiologic agent, and modes of transmission of the disease, as well as infection control measures appropriate to contain SARS.","The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in China has been declared a public health emergency of international concern. The cardiac injury was dominate in the process. However, whether N terminal pro B type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) predicted outcome of COVID-19 patients was unknown. The study initially enrolled 102 patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia from a continuous sample. After screening out the ineligible cases, 54 patients were analyzed in this study. Results found that patients with higher NT-proBNP (above 88.64 pg/mL) level had more risks of in-hospital death. After adjusting for potential cofounders in separate modes, NT-proBNP presented as an independent risk factor of in-hospital death in patients with severe COVID-19.","Abstract Among the various respiratory viruses infecting human beings, coronaviruses are important pathogens, which usually infect the upper respiratory tract, where they are mainly associated with common colds. However, in more vulnerable populations, such as newborns, infants, the elderly and immune-compromised individuals, these opportunistic pathogens can also affect the lower respiratory tract, leading to pneumonia, exacerbations of asthma, and various types of respiratory distress syndrome. The respiratory involvement of human coronaviruses has been clearly established since the 1960s. Nevertheless, for almost three decades now, data reported in the scientific literature has also demonstrated that, like it was described for other human viruses, coronaviruses have neuroinvasive capacities since they can spread from the respiratory tract to the central nervous system (CNS). Once there, infection of CNS cells (neurotropism) could lead to human health problems, such as encephalitis a...","Abstract Background Due to the general susceptibility of new coronaviruses, the clinical characteristics and outcomes of elderly and young patients may be different. Objective To analyze the clinical characteristics of elderly patients with 2019 new-type coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19). Methods This is a retrospective study of patients with new coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19) who were hospitalized in Hainan Provincial People's Hospital from January 15, 2020 to February 18, 2020. Compare the clinical characteristics of elderly with Young and Middle-aged patients. Results A total of 56 patients were enrolled 18 elderly patients (32.14%), and 38 young and middle-aged patients (67.86%). The most common symptoms in both groups were fever, followed by cough and sputum. Four patients in the elderly group received negative pressure ICU for mechanical ventilation, and five patients in the young and middle-aged group. One patient died in the elderly group (5.56%), and two patients died in the ...","Abstract Objective To investigate the characteristics and prognostic factors in the elderly patients with COVID-19. Methods Consecutive cases over 60 years old with COVID-19 in Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University from Jan 1 to Feb 6, 2020 were included. The primary outcomes were death and survival till March 5. Data of demographics, clinical features, comorbidities, laboratory tests and complications were collected and compared for different outcomes. Cox regression was performed for prognostic factors. Results 339 patients with COVID-19 (aged 71\u00b18 years,173 females (51%)) were enrolled, including 80 (23.6%) critical, 159 severe (46.9%) and 100 moderate (29.5%) cases. Common comorbidities were hypertension (40.8%), diabetes (16.0%) and cardiovascular disease (15.7%). Common symptoms included fever (92.0%), cough (53.0%), dyspnea (40.8%) and fatigue (39.9%). Lymphocytopenia was a common laboratory finding (63.2%). Common complications included bacterial infection (42.8%), liver enzyme a...","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic that originated in Wuhan, China has spread to more than 60 countries. We estimated the age-specific case fatality ratio (CFR) by fitting a transmission model to data from China, accounting for underreporting of cases and the time delay to death. Overall CFR among all infections was 1.6% (1.4-1.8%) and increased considerably for the elderly, highlighting the expected burden for populations with further expansion of the COVID-19 epidemic around the globe.","The severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is an emerging infection caused by a novel coronavirus which first appeared in southern China at the end of 2002. In early 2003, through a single incident, it spread to Hong Kong, Singapore, Canada and Vietnam. For busy clinicians in large public hospitals, the response to the virus was initially based on ensuring a high level of protection for staff. However, as the epidemic progressed and more information became available about the virus, procedures were rationalized and the virus is currently under control worldwide. There are, however, numerous unanswered questions concerning super-spreading events, the modes of transmission of the virus and, perhaps most importantly, the rapid detection of the virus early in the course of disease. These issues need to be addressed in case the virus becomes more widespread in the near future.","Background Traditional infection control policies have focused on engineering controls, specific protocols, and personal protective equipment (PPE). In light of the variable success in protecting health care workers (HCWs) from Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2003, organizational and individual factors related to self-protective behavior in health care settings may also play an important role. Methods A critical review of the literature was conducted, directed at understanding what organizational and individual factors are important in protecting HCWs from infectious diseases at work. Results Organizational factors, such as a positive safety climate, have been associated with increased HCW adherence to universal precautions. There is some evidence that appropriate training of HCWs could be effective in changing HCW behavior if appropriate follow-up is applied. Very little research into these factors has been conducted with regard to preventing exposures to respiratory tract...","Several cases of life threatening respiratory disease with no identifiable cause were reported from Guangdong Province, China; these were soon followed by reports from many other countries. The disease was named as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). A novel coronavirus, isolated from the respiratory secretions of patients, has been implicated in the causation of SARS. The modes of transmission include droplet spread, close contact, and Fomites; shedding of virus from respiratory tract is the primary mode of transmission. SARS clinically presents with high-grade fever, chills and rigors, myalgia, headache, cough with or without sputum production, dyspnea, and dizziness. Chest radiographs reveal unilateral or bilateral, predominantly peripheral, areas of consolidation progressing with in a short time of bilateral patchy consolidation. Preliminary reports suggest a milder illness in young children. The case definition of probable SARS cases, laboratory investigations and precaution...","Abstract Design, synthesis and biological evaluation of a series of 5-chloropyridine ester-derived severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus chymotrypsin-like protease inhibitors is described. Position of the carboxylate functionality is critical to potency. Inhibitor 10 with a 5-chloropyridinyl ester at position 4 of the indole ring is the most potent inhibitor with a SARS-CoV 3CLpro IC50 value of 30nM and an antiviral EC50 value of 6.9\u03bcM. Molecular docking studies have provided possible binding modes of these inhibitors.","Abstract Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by a novel betacoronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), was first described in a cluster of patients presenting with pneumonia symptoms in Wuhan, China, in December of 2019. Over the past few months, COVID-19 has developed into a worldwide pandemic, with over 400,000 documented cases globally as of March 24, 2020. The SARS-CoV-2 virus is most likely of zoonotic origin, but has been shown to have effective human-to-human transmission. COVID-19 results in mild symptoms in the majority of infected patients, but can cause severe lung injury, cardiac injury, and death. Given the novel nature of COVID-19, no established treatment beyond supportive care exists currently, but extensive public-health measures to reduce person-to-person transmission of COVID-19 have been implemented globally to curb the spread of disease, reduce the burden on healthcare systems, and protect vulnerable populations, including the...","Summary Background Three clusters of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) linked to a tour group from China, a company conference, and a church were identified in Singapore in February, 2020. Methods We gathered epidemiological and clinical data from individuals with confirmed COVID-19, via interviews and inpatient medical records, and we did field investigations to assess interactions and possible modes of transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Open source reports were obtained for overseas cases. We reported the median (IQR) incubation period of SARS-CoV-2. Findings As of Feb 15, 2020, 36 cases of COVID-19 were linked epidemiologically to the first three clusters of circumscribed local transmission in Singapore. 425 close contacts were quarantined. Direct or prolonged close contact was reported among affected individuals, although indirect transmission (eg, via fomites and shared food) could not be excluded. The median incubation period of SARS-C...","Publisher Summary This chapter introduces basic concepts of virology and exemplifies the usage of current technology for identifying and tracking viral pathogens. Virus structure, lifestyle, replication strategies, classication, the varied modes of transmission, infection, and disease manifestations are focussed upon in the chapter. Viruses are extremely simple \u201clife\u201d forms without metabolic capacity, organelles, translational machinery, or autonomous replicative potential; the essential elements of a virus are consequently minimal. A virus enters the host through any opportunistic opening of the body\u2014; such as minute breaks in the skin barrier or mucosal linings of the eye, nose, etc. Antibodies produced during an infection often have the ability to bind the virus and reduce infectivity. An immediate question to solve during a virus outbreak is the mechanism by which the virus spreads. Viruses frequently infect animal or insect vectors that serve to pass the virus to humans. By identi...","Approximately 20% of patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) develop respiratory failure that requires admission to an intensive care unit (ICU). Old age, comorbidity, and elevated lactate dehydrogenase on hospital admission are associated with increased risk for ICU admission. ICU admission usually is late and occurs 8 to 10 days after symptom onset. Acute respiratory distress syndrome occurs in almost all admitted patients and most require mechanical ventilation. ICU admission is associated with significant morbidity, particularly an apparent increase in the incidence of barotrauma and nosocomial sepsis. Long-term mortality for patients admitted to the ICU ranges from 30% to 50%. Many procedures in ICUs pose a high risk for transmission of SARS coronavirus to health care workers. Contact and airborne infection isolation precautions, in addition to standard precautions, should be applied when caring for patients with SARS. Ensuring staff safety is important to maintain ...","Abstract Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) poses an occupational health risk to healthcare workers. Several thousand healthcare workers have already been infected, mainly in China. Preventing intra-hospital transmission of the communicable disease is therefore a priority. Based on the Systems Engineering Initiative for Patient Safety model, the strategies and measures to protect healthcare workers in an acute tertiary hospital are described along the domains of work task, technologies and tools, work environmental factors, and organizational conditions. The principle of zero occupational infection remains an achievable goal that all healthcare systems need to strive for in the face of a potential pandemic.","OBJECTIVE: Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is an emerging and easily clustering infectious disease. We describe an outbreak of SARS in a chest ward of a medical center in southern Taiwan and seek to identify the risk factors of those SARS patients who required mechanical ventilation. We focus on previous health patients. DESIGN: This retrospective case series was collected during the SARS outbreak. Degrees of severity were established, based on whether intubation and mechanical ventilation was necessary. SETTING: A 2500-bed medical center in southern Taiwan. PATIENTS: Forty-four patients exhibited symptoms that met the modified World Health Organization (WHO) definition of SARS. These included of three subgroups: health-care workers (n=16), relatives (n=14), and patients already admitted for other ailments (n=14). Of these, 20 eventually required mechanical ventilation. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Laboratory analyses showed statistically significant differences between intubated...","BACKGROUND: Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a contagious viral illness first recognized in late 2002. It has now been documented in 26 countries worldwide, with significant outbreaks in China, Hong Kong, Singapore, and Toronto. Research into identifying the etiological agent, evaluating modes of disease transmission, and treatment options is currently ongoing. DISCUSSION: The disease can produce a severe bilateral pneumonia, with progressive hypoxemia. Up to 20% of patients require mechanical ventilatory support, with a fatal outcome occurring in about 5% of cases. CONCLUSIONS: We review the current knowledge about this disease, with particular emphasis on ICU management and infection control precautions to prevent disease transmission.

This computational investigation of the viral protease follows protocols that have been effective in studying other homodimeric enzymes. The protease is predicted to display flexible motions in vivo which directly affect the geometry of a known inhibitor binding site and which open new potential binding sites elsewhere in the structure. A database of generated PDB files representing natural flexible variations on the crystal structures has been produced and made available for download from an institutional data archive. This information may inform structure-based drug design and fragment screening efforts aimed at identifying specific antiviral ...","Policies and public health efforts have not addressed the gendered impacts of disease outbreaks.1 The response to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) appears no different. We are not aware of any gender analysis of the outbreak by global health institutions or governments in affected countries or in preparedness phases. Recognising the extent to which disease outbreaks affect women and men differently is a fundamental step to understanding the primary and secondary effects of a health emergency on different individuals and communities, and for creating effective, equitable policies and interventions. Although sex-disaggregated data for COVID-19 show equal numbers of cases between men and women so far, there seem to be sex differences in mortality and vulnerability to the disease.2 Emerging evidence suggests that more men than women are dying, potentially due to sex-based immunological3 or gendered differences, such as patterns and prevalence of smoking.4 However, current sex-disaggrega...","Novel coronavirus infection special intensive care team We set up a special emergency multi-disciplinary intensive care team to discuss the problems that we might encounter and countermeasures. Team members include intensive care unit (ICU) physician, infectious disease physician, nurse, respiratory therapist, nosocomial infection control expert, and administrative staff. We first evaluated the isolation conditions and the capacity of our department to admit a larger number of patients. Second, we specified the protection levels for different types of health care activities. Third, we assigned special work such as patient screening, consultation, and transfer to designated staff to minimize the number of health workers who had contact with patients with nCoV infection.ID - LiaoER -","With the increasing threat of pandemic influenza and catastrophic bioterrorism, it is important for intensive care providers to be prepared to meet the challenge of large-scale airborne epidemics causing mass casualty respiratory failure. The severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak exposed the vulnerability of health care workers and highlighted the importance of establishing stringent infection control and crisis management protocols. Patients who have acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome who require mechanical ventilation should receive a lung protective, low tidal volume strategy. Controversy remains regarding the use of high-frequency oscillatory ventilation and noninvasive positive pressure ventilation. Standard, contact, and airborne precautions should be instituted in intensive care units, with special care taken when aerosol-generating procedures are performed.","Given the scale of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the need for reliable, scalable testing, and the likelihood of reagent shortages, especially in resource-poor settings, we have developed a RT-qPCR assay that relies on an alternative to conventional viral reverse transcriptases, a thermostable reverse transcriptase / DNA polymerase (RTX)1. Here we show that RTX performs comparably to the other assays sanctioned by the CDC and validated in kit format. We demonstrate two modes of RTX use - (i) dye-based RT-qPCR assays that require only RTX polymerase, and (ii) TaqMan RT-qPCR assays that use a combination of RTX and Taq DNA polymerases (as the RTX exonuclease does not degrade a TaqMan probe). We also provide straightforward recipes for the purification of this alternative reagent. We anticipate that in low resource or point-of-need settings researchers could obtain the available constructs from Addgene or our lab and begin to develop their own assays, within whatever regulatory framework ...","This article reviews the current epidemiology and clinical presentation of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection and describes the preparedness plan of several countries. The MERS-CoV was first reported in 2012 and has since infected more than 1600 patients in 26 countries, mostly in Saudi Arabia and the Middle East. The epidemiology of the infection is compatible with multiple introductions of the virus into humans from an animal reservoir, probably dromedary camels. The clinical presentation ranges from no symptoms to severe pneumonitis and respiratory failure. Most confirmed cases so far were part of MERS-CoV clusters in hospital settings, affecting mainly middle-aged men and patients with a chronic disease or immuno-suppressed status. There is no vaccine or anti-viral medication available. Viral epidemics can occur anywhere in today\u2019s \u201cglobal village\u201d. MERS-CoV is a relatively new virus, and this work is intended to add to the still-sparse data on its ep...","Abstract Background Different degrees of disorders are reported in respiratory function, physical function and psychological function in patients with corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19), especially in elderly patients. With the experience of improved and discharged COVID-19 patients, timely respiratory rehabilitation intervention may improve prognosis, maximize functional preservation and improve quality of life (QoL), but there lacks of studies worldwide exploring the outcome of this intervention. Objective To investigate the effects of 6-week respiratory rehabilitation training on respiratory function, QoL, mobility and psychological function in elderly patients with COVID-19. Methods This paper reported the findings of an observational, prospective, quasi-experimental study, which totally recruited 72 participants, of which 36 patients underwent respiratory rehabilitation and the rest without any rehabilitation intervention. The following outcomes were measured: pulmonary function...","Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), a highly lethal respiratory disease caused by a novel coronavirus (MERS-CoV), is an emerging disease with high potential for epidemic spread. It has been listed by the WHO and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) as an important target for vaccine development. While initially the majority of MERS cases were hospital acquired, continued emergence of MERS is attributed to community acquisition, with camels likely being the direct or indirect source. However, the majority of patients do not describe camel exposure, making the route of transmission unclear. Here, using sensitive immunological assays and a cohort of camel workers (CWs) with well-documented camel exposure, we show that approximately 50% of camel workers (CWs) in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) and 0% of controls were previously infected. We obtained blood samples from 30 camel herders, truck drivers, and handlers with well-documented camel exposure and from hea...","Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV [SARS-COV-2]) was detected in humans during the last week of December 2019 at Wuhan city in China, and caused 24 554 cases in 27 countries and territories as of 5 February 2020. The objective of this study was to estimate the risk of transmission of 2019-nCoV through human passenger air flight from four major cities of China (Wuhan, Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou) to the passengers' destination countries. We extracted the weekly simulated passengers' end destination data for the period of 1\u201331 January 2020 from FLIRT, an online air travel dataset that uses information from 800 airlines to show the direct flight and passengers' end destination. We estimated a risk index of 2019-nCoV transmission based on the number of travellers to destination countries, weighted by the number of confirmed cases of the departed city reported by the World Health Organization (WHO). We ranked each country based on the risk index in four quantiles (4(th) quantile being the hig...","","ABSTRACT THE CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL and Prevention has published updated guidelines for isolation precautions that outline how health care workers can prevent the transmission of infectious agents to their patients and to themselves. THE GUIDELINES RE-EMPHASIZE standard precautions, which guide clinicians in the use of appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE), depending on the expected type of exposure. Respiratory hygiene/cough etiquette is incorporated into infection control practices as a new component of standard precautions. THE ARTICLE PROVIDES information on the new guidelines as well as information on newly emerging patho gens and methods to prevent disease transmission in health care settings.","Rapid screening and low-cost diagnosis play a crucial role in choosing the correct course of intervention e.g., drug therapy, quarantine, no action etc. when dealing with highly infectious pathogens. This is especially important if the disease-causing agent has no effective treatment, such as the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (the pathogen causing COVID-19), and shows no or similar symptoms to other common infections. We report a silicon-based integrated Point-of-Need (PoN) transducer (TriSilix) that can chemically-amplify and detect pathogen-specific sequences of nucleic acids (NA) quantitatively in real-time. Unlike other silicon-based technologies, TriSilix can be produced at wafer-scale in a standard laboratory; we have developed a series of methodologies based on metal-assisted chemical (wet) etching, electroplating, thermal bonding and laser-cutting to enable a cleanroom-free low-cost fabrication that does not require processing in an advanced semiconductor foundry. TriSilix is, t...","Abstract Since the middle of December 2019, human-to-human transmission of novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP) has occurred among close contacts. At the same time, greater attention should be paid to psychological crisis intervention (PCI) among affected populations, for the timely prevention of inestimable damage from a secondary psychological crisis. PCI has been initiated via remote (telephone and internet) and onsite medical services to help medical workers, patients, and others affected to overcome any psychological difficulties. This paper outlines experiences based on the work of the Shanghai Medical Team.","R\u00e9sum\u00e9 Les coronavirus humains (HCoV) sont des virus \u00e0 ARN simple brin.
