To prevent the spread of Klebsiella and other infections between patients, healthcare personnel must follow specific infection control precautions including strict adherence to hand hygiene and the use of gloves. In addition, our data clearly indicate that efforts to regularly disinfect environmental surfaces and ensure clean towels for patient caregiving could reduce risk of exposure to patients, healthcare staff and visitors. The government of Bangladesh has taken a number of initiatives to improve infection control in hospitals [36]. Despite this, a 2013 nationally representative survey of healthcare facilities showed that healthcare workers performed recommended hand hygiene in only 9% of 919 opportunities, suggesting low adherence to international standards [30]. Barriers include awareness, training, accountability and appropriate infrastructure (among 875 health facilities, 10% handwashing locations had no water, 20% had no soap and 50\u201380% had no alcohol based sanitizer) to support these behaviours [30, 37, 38] This study highlighted the gaps in practice, as well as the substantial barriers to improvement that will require widespread investments to address. In 2018, the Directorate of Hospital Infection Control, Directorate General of Health Services (DGHS) at the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare in Bangladesh has communicated the intention to form infection control committees in each district and tertiary care hospital across the country to improve the safe care [39]. Further investigation to identify the true contribution of fomites in the transmission of respiratory pathogens within hospital settings could be useful to help these committees prioritize efforts to improve hand and surface cleaning.","The majority of the respondents from hospitals that would admit EVD patients stated that, PPE (i.e. masks, gloves, gowns, eye protection) was easily accessible to healthcare workers particularly in frontline areas (55, 89 %). However, only 37 respondents (54 %) indicated that a process is in place for regular checks (i.e. expiry date) on PPE items to ensure their appropriate usage. The majority of participants, identified that for scarce supplies of PPE, a system is in place (49; 72 %) to prioritize healthcare workers caring for affected cases (Table 5).","The risks of EIDs are inherently dynamic and largely unpredictable. New threats persist, including the recent outbreak of a novel coronavirus COVID-19 emerging from Wuhan, China (4) Government leaders face formidable decisions about the provision of health security measures against outbreaks of these threats. Global actors are seeking to diminish the danger that these pathogens pose to the wellbeing of nations, regions, and the world. Given the range of potential biological threats, their unpredictability, and the limited resources available to address them, policymakers must necessarily prioritize their readiness efforts based on limited knowledge. All too often, they are forced to choose between priorities, and construct so-called limited lists of treatments, using testimony from teams of experts to inform these decisions. As history has shown, however, this approach leaves society vulnerable to unforeseen outbreaks. Therefore, a more rational approach is to develop a broad portfolio of vaccines in a coordinated manner, mitigating the future risk posed by unpredictable outbreaks of these diseases.","It is essential that we prepare ourselves for what seems like will be the inevitability of having the virus at our doorstep, but we must think ahead to enact common sense policies that will not cripple the normal functioning of our healthcare institutions. That may mean sending people home while waiting for a test result to come back or even providing home care to mild cases, 64 Developing countries face with more critical challenges during outbreaks compared with higher income countries, preventing effective management worldwide (Major Issues and Challenges of Influenza Pandemic Preparedness in Developing Countries: oshitani). The lack of IPC in developing countries with limited resources is a major dilemma that leads to high rates of healthcare-associated infections. 65 Hand hygiene is arguably, the most important infection control procedure, and is often neglected by health-care workers in these countries. 66 While developing countries still lack the equipment, expertise, and health infrastructure to detect and manage patients, 65 SARS-CoV-2 is spreading rapidly in these unprepared countries . 67 It has been recommended to promptly prioritize resources, precise surveillance, and capacity development in countries with low preparedness for diagnosing the virus and limiting transmission. 68","Though there is no evidence of the role of chloroquine in prophylaxis against CVID-19, Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) has recommended prophylaxis with CQ or HCQ in asymptomatic healthcare workers involved in the care of suspected or confirmed cases of COVID-19 and asymptomatic lhousehold contacts of laboratory confirmed cases 16 .","As seen in the first reported outbreaks, health care workers are at higher risk for infection with SARS. 5, 17 Worldwide, the proportion of probable SARS cases that were health care workers was 21%, with a range of 0% in the United States and other countries to 57% in Vietnam. 12 Although recent reports suggest that infection control practices can be effective in some settings, 18, 19 outbreaks have been documented among protected health care workers. 20 Prior to our findings presented here, few reports have addressed differences in policies and practices among affected hospitals, which might explain differences in infection control effectiveness among institutions and countries. More research also is needed on the effectiveness of hospital policies for triage and visitor restrictions; staff training and education; patient placement in negative air pressure rooms; 2-stage removal of PPE using anterooms or secondary staging areas; and the use of specific articles of PPE, such as eye protection, head covers, and foot covers. Such knowledge will help hospitals prioritize resources most effectively, especially when resources are limited.","Also at the global level, the UN Office for DRR [8] issued a press release on the 12th of March 2020 urging disaster management agencies to prioritize biological hazards. The UNDRR asked national disaster management agencies to continue with the development of their preparedness and response capacities to include health emergencies as a top priority, alongside earthquakes, floods, storms and other natural hazards (UNDRR, 2020). It also highlighted the importance of silo-breaking in disaster prevention and management, notably the silos between disaster management and health workers. The UNDRR reiterates that the Sendai Framework emphasizes the need for resilient health systems and the integration of disaster risk management into health care provision at all levels. After all, Sendai turns the focus from disaster response and management to preparedness, surveillance and disaster risk management in the health context (UNDRR, 2020). Yet it is not clear whether COVID-19 is leading to collaboration between the WHO and the UNDRR. We appraise the speed and scale by which COVID-19 response funds are made available. International funding organisations, regional government bodies and private entities have proposed major financial measures. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) made $50 billion in loans available to deal with the coronavirus, including $10 billion of zero-interest loans to the poorest IMF member countries (IMF, 2020). The EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen announced a \u20ac25 billion coronavirus investment fund for the health care sector, labour market and SMEs (EU, 2020). The World Bank Group increases COVID-19 Response to $14 billion to help sustain economies and protect jobs. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) announces $6.5 billion initial response to COVID-19 pandemic (ADB, 2020). The UN announced $15 million dollars from the UN's Central Emergency Fund to help fund global efforts to contain the spread of the COVID-19 coronavirus, particularly vulnerable countries with weak health care systems (UN, 2020). It is important to note that in the SFDRR, investment and finance are at the core of Sendai Framework, in terms of the resilience investment needed for countries and communities.","Prevention of 2019-nCoV transmission, like any other infectious agent, involves minimizing risk of exposure. Vaccines are under accelerated development and may be useful in the future for post-exposure prophylaxis. Healthcare personnel are at increased risk and should practice standard, droplet, and airborne precautions when encountering an infected person, a PUI, or any symptomatic close contacts. Healthcare workers handling specimens should also adhere to CDC guidelines and should not attempt to perform any virus isolation or characterization.","These efforts resemble not only what happened with SARS in 2002\u20132003, but also the Ebola virus outbreak in 2014\u20132015. During those outbreaks, special protocols were put in place to quarantine any infected individuals and identify patient contacts at risk 8. Healthcare workers were also at risk, and despite extensive personal protective equipment measures, clinical providers did get infected in both outbreaks 9. There were no specific, antiviral treatments for SARS or Ebola at the time of the outbreaks beyond supportive measures 10, 11, which is a similar situation that healthcare systems are facing with 2019-nCoV.","The number of publications on diseases expected to cause severe outbreaks in the near future showed two clear peaks in the past two decades; one for SARS and one for Ebola. The clear increase in number of publication on the studied diseases during relatively short period of time is an indication of how science and health information flows rapidly across borders to create similar concerns among different countries. Bibliometric methods can be used to prioritize efforts and direct research funds to help control emerging diseases [41]. Although the USA is leading the research on these diseases, the share of Asian, African, and Middle Eastern countries was apparent. International collaboration in research on these diseases was relatively high for most countries. Search for an effective vaccine was clearly strong for Ebola and SARS.","Inevitably, the first report of swH1N1 infection among healthcare workers (HCWs) has already been published. 8 Of 13 HCWs deemed to have acquired infection in the healthcare setting, only three had consistently used PPE. There is another strand to our strategy to prevent infectioneantiviral therapy. Two neuraminidase inhibitors are licensed: oseltamivir and zanamivir. There is modest evidence that oseltamivir (Tamiflu\u00e4), if given orally early enough is effective for prophylaxis. 9 Zanamivir is administered by inhalation and can be used as a back-up. Both drugs work by interfering with release of virus from infected cells. Governments for some time have been establishing a stockpile of these drugs for post-exposure prophylaxis in the community and hospital. Much reliance is being put on oseltamivir for prophylaxis and treatment of the pandemic strain, but no clear or consistent guidance is available defining 'key workers' in an institution/country qualifying for antiviral prophylaxis. This continues to generate considerable debate with significant political overtones. From the infection control perspective, antiviral resistance to the drugs can be predicted to emerge, especially if uncontrolled distribution occurs.","The Shanghai Medical Team dispatched to Wuhan is a major component of the national medical response team. On January 28, the first four psychiatrists were dispatched to Wuhan after a 3-day NCP-specific skill training. The group established a PCI department in the Tongren Hospital of Wuhan University, and set up a work schedule to provide assistance. Due to different populations being affected by the epidemic to different degrees, the psychiatrists identified high-risk populations on which to prioritize their efforts, in order to prevent extreme events such as suicide and impulsive behavior. They drafted the signs of psychological crisis and provided feasible methods, providing timely report to the leading group of the joint prevention and control of the epidemic situation. Thus, the ninth batch of the Shanghai Medical Team was dispatched with 50 psychological therapists on February 21, as a second team for providing of mental health support.","Despite our best preparations, it remains likely that in a pandemic scenario, the number of critically ill patients will overwhelm our critical care capacity. There is a need to develop triage protocols to prioritize access to limited resources, including mechanical ventilation [34] . Triage criteria should be based on clinical indicators of survivability, and resources allocated to those most likely to benefit. These are difficult decisions and cannot be left until times of crisis. Development of triage protocols should be done in advance, with careful consideration of ethical principles [35] . It is crucial to engage the community in this process so that public trust exists when it is most needed.","The third, and perhaps largest objective of the Working Group, is to strengthen influenza-related public health practices, infrastructure, and research. A successful component of this objective is the promotion of adult immunization programs with improved vaccine coverage of individuals at increased risk of complications from influenza. Several groups are developing communications networks and protocols to disseminate up-to-date information to healthcare providers and the public. Research on influenza biology and epidemiology, animal surveillance, and vaccine and antiviral development has been and will continue to be supported by NIH through grants to academic researchers and through grants that support public-private partnerships. Development of cell culture-based vaccines and the testing in humans of candidate pandemic vaccines made using reverse genetics or classical reassortment techniques should be encouraged. There is also a need to test adjuvanted vaccines and to develop new antiviral agents. It is noteworthy that there are currently only two influenza vaccine manufacturers licensed to distribute vaccine in the US for the 2003-2004 influenza season. It is also noteworthy that 80-90% of produced vaccine is purchased privately, and it takes nearly a full year from the time of selection of strains to the production of usable vaccine. As a result, it will be essential to encourage new vaccine manufacturers and new approaches, including reverse genetics to prepare seed strains, in addition to developing and implementing a vaccine policy that ensures adequate and fair procurement and distribution of the vaccine during an influenza pandemic. Such policies will need to take into account liability protection and equitable global access. Finally, identifying appropriate antiviral drugs to stockpile and developing plans to prioritize use of these antivirals are necessary for pandemic preparedness.","Evidence-based public health programming depends on data-driven estimates of disease burden to develop interventions. As such, accurate estimate of the underlying burden of SARS-CoV-2 infection within the US can provide critical information for hospital administrators, county-and state-level Departments of Health, and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to optimize and prioritize resource allocation.","Further research should investigate whether child care subsidies for healthcare workers would reduce absenteeism in the event of school closures from a pandemic. Additionally, research efforts should identify how school closures in pandemics impact more vulnerable populations for whom robust data does not currently exist. Further research efforts should also be placed to determine the effect of school closures on the absenteeism of other kinds of essential workers, instead of just healthcare workers.","The identification of who might be more affected by COVID-19, not epidemiologically but simply by working and living in affected regions, carries important implications. Such identification can help to prioritize those who might need more help, and psychologists, mental health professionals and social workers can provide services to start addressing at least the mental health issues, even during the lockdown. Affected regions are growing globally by the day, and COVID-19 is no longer confined to China Croakey, 2020) . To contain COVID-19 transmission , policymakers in other countries are considering implementing restrictive measures . We present this early evidence of disruptions one month into the .

Manufacturing a candidate vaccine for which there is no immediate market poses a significant dilemma because most stages of advanced vaccine development are carried out by large pharmaceutical companies that need to make profit to stay in business. While emerging infectious diseases pose a public health threat, they rarely present a compelling commercial opportunity. Vaccines require a large investment and historically have a relatively low probability of being successful without an extensive iterative process of evaluation and redesign. Therefore, in addition to new biological tools, there needs to be political will to prioritize public funding of advanced vaccine development and new business models for managing this process. 3 In this review, we describe the vaccine development efforts for three distinct viruses that collectively capture many of the challenges faced when developing vaccines for emerging viral threats. Ebola, a member of the Filoviridae family, is spread by body fluids and secretions with a relatively low attack rate but causes a systemic disease with high mortality. Chikungunya, an alphavirus in FIGURE 28.1 Time from identification of a viral pathogen to vaccine availability. Vaccine development is a lengthy process often measured in decades. Many steps are required even for a traditional empirical approach including identification of target antigen; assay development; defining seroprevalence and incidence in relevant populations; understanding transmission dynamics and whether there is an intermediate animal host; developing animal models; exploring pathogenesis and defining immune mechanisms of protection; designing vaccine antigens; determining formulation, delivery route and method; preclinical evaluation for safety and immunogenicity; manufacturing; and several years of clinical evaluation and clearing regulatory hurdles. Vaccines can fail at any of these steps, and it is rare for the first attempted concept to become the final product.","The Interagency Pandemic Influenza Working Group is also focused on improving national readiness to respond to a pandemic. The CDC has developed a planning guide for state and local health officials (http://www.cdc.gov/od/nvpo/ pandemicflu.htm) that has helped in the development of pandemic planning guides for 47 states, 4 of which are available on the internet. The focus of these plans is to create decision-making protocols for response to a pandemic, to develop flexible contingency plans for procurement and distribution of vaccines and antivirals, to reduce liability risks, and to prioritize groups for receipt of vaccines and/or antivirals. Improved readiness has also focused on identification of specific resources required for a response, including additional medical personnel, medications and vaccines. A web-based program, FluAid 2.0 (http://www2.cdc.gov/od/fluaid) has been developed which will help states estimate the potential impact of influenza.","In an infectious disease outbreak, the immediate priority is to limit and contain the threat to human health and wellbeing. Research during and following the outbreak can also be important for developing effective treatments and preventive measures, and for guiding public health policies. Recently, research conducted within ongoing investigations of H1N1 infection has demonstrated that pregnant women may be at elevated risk for complications from infection [38]. These findings have led to recommendations to prioritize pregnant women for vaccination and, if infected, for antiviral therapy. Several published candidate gene studies of susceptibility to viral and bacterial diseases have demonstrated the feasibility and utility of integrating host genomics into epidemiologic studies and surveillance [36,39-42]. The greatest public health impact of such research may be through accelerating the development of preventive vaccines; however, novel diagnostic tests developed for clinical use may also prove useful for epidemic monitoring and triage during outbreaks. For example, scientists recently demonstrated that human gene expression profiles are an effective tool for determining the etiology of respiratory infections, providing a striking example of rapid translation from basic research to potential clinical and public health application [43].","A possible tactic that could be used in a biological weapons attack is that of a mimic. The initial symptoms of pneumonic plague are almost identical to those at the beginning of many other respiratory illnesses, including in particular those of influenza and the common cold. 36 Furthermore, there are other diseases that could mimic plague in the later stages such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Francisella tularensis, and a severe viral pneumonia from influenza A or B viruses. 27 If a deliberate release of plague occurred alongside a deliberate release of influenza or, released alongside the normal seasonal variations of influenza, then there would be a significantly higher number of people having the initial symptoms of both, including cough, fevers, and coryzal symptoms. This could lead to a huge number of patients presenting to many healthcare centers with fear of having the symptoms of pneumonic plague, overwhelming the services. A prehospital treatment model with the usage of rapid diagnostic dipstick could potentially aid in the triage of patients and prioritize the treatment of those having Y. pestis infection. 85, 107 ","The antigenic cross-reactivity of this set of antibodies precipitated an investigation into their molecular recognition determinants. The potential relevance of a human antibody motivated the investigation to prioritize studies of CR3022, for which a sequence was available (ter Meulen et al., 2006) .","However, further in vitro and in vivo studies are required to investigate the exact antiviral mechanisms, determine potential synergistic effects, and to confirm their antiviral efficacy in an animal model to prioritize and select drugs for potential use in patients affected by the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak. Seven FDA-approved drugs that are not shown in Fig. 3 were analyzed by time-of-addition assay experiments, as described in Fig. 3 . the author/funder. All rights reserved.

Our main purpose is to prioritize diseases, traits or proteins with potential causal links with ACE2 expression, and hence possibly increased susceptibility to 2019-nCov infection. Owing to relatively modest sample size of the outcome dataset of GTEx (N = 515), we expect the power to be modest. Also in view of the exploratory and hypothesis-generating nature of this study, we have not implemented stringent multiple testing procedures such as Bonferroni correction. On the other hand, we examined the consistency of the observed associations across different datasets, and considered those supported by more than one set of data as relatively more trustworthy or robust, similar to the approach adopted by Pendergrass et al. 40 . However, we emphasize that our findings will require further replications and support by further clinical and experimental studies.","During the SARS outbreak, 21% of the infected individuals globally were healthcare workers. 15 In Canada, a final count of 251 cases of SARS was confirmed; 43% of them were healthcare workers, the majority were from Toronto. 15 Concerns were raised about infections in healthcare workers despite apparently appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE). Analysis of this experience uncovered several important lessons. 19 First, the protection of healthcare workers is not just about PPE; it encompasses all principles of infection prevention and control. 20 Whilst the initial focus for protecting anaesthesiologists or personnel involved in aerosol-generating medical procedures (tracheal intubation, non-invasive ventilation, tracheotomy, cardiopulmonary resuscitation, manual ventilation before intubation, and bronchoscopy) was on the need for more stringent PPE, such as powered air-purifying respirators or double gloves during the SARS outbreak, further investigation did not support a risk of transmission with tracheal intubation if appropriate precautions and more standard PPE were used. 21 22 In areas, such as the emergency department or ICU where SARS patients were managed, there were 'uncontrolled situations characterized by multiple opportunities for extensive contamination and staff exposure prior to the intubation event'. 21 Healthcare workers were exposed to risk of infection before PPE was used. It reflects the importance of triage, early recognition, and prompt isolation for suspected cases of infected patients. 20 Second, a post-SARS investigation interviewing healthcare workers involved in the intubation of SARS patients in Toronto highlighted non-compliance or sub-optimal adherence to the use of PPE. 23 Although much is unknown about the 2019-nCoV, it is believed to spread from person to person amongst close contact via respiratory droplets and contact transmission. Strict adherence to the use of PPE, including procedure mask, eye protection, gown, and gloves, is highly effective in limiting droplet and contact transmission. 21 The current WHO and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidance for the protection of personnel during aerosol-generating medical procedures in patients with confirmed/suspected 2019-nCoV centres around principles of clear communication, minimising personnel in the room during the procedure, appropriate use of PPE, and avoidance of procedures that generate high amounts of aerosols. Some considerations are provided as follows to help prepare for airway management of confirmed/suspected COVID-19 patients. 20 24 25 These suggestions are by no means comprehensive. Hospitals should develop local plans for aerosolgenerating medical procedures in suspected/confirmed COVID-19 patients using a collaborative approach that engages anaesthesiologists, intensivists, emergency medicine physicians, respiratory therapists, resuscitation team members, infection prevention and control, occupational health and safety specialists, and environmental services staff.","Despite some interesting findings, due to limited knowledge of how the drugs act on the targets and their directions of effect, as well as the pathophysiology of COVID-19, we consider our results as exploratory findings which require further investigations. We note that a number of drugs may act on more than one target, but the exact pharmacological action on each target is often unclear; the overall direction and magnitude of effect of each drug may not be easily determined and must be verified in further studies. We emphasize that the drugs highlighted in this work are meant to prioritize suitable candidates to speed up discovery for treatments, and are not supposed to be applied to clinical practice or trials yet. However, due to the potential huge cost and extreme urgency of developing new therapies, we believe that any drug repositioning/discovery attempt that may improve the success rate even by a small margin may still be much valuable.","Under extreme circumstances, it may be necessary to prioritize which breast cancer patients can receive radiotherapy services. Prioritization of patients for whom RT is anticipated to provide a survival benefit is paramount. Based on available evidence and nascent clinical judgement, we have defined tiers of elevated priority (see Table 2 ). Of note, prioritization within each tier is left to the treating physicians' discretion based on patient age, comorbidities, risk of exposure and predicted benefit of RT.","By making the resource available to all academic researchers, we enable scientists to not only dive deeper into insights that are aligned with existing knowledge but also to prioritize the novel insights which warrant further experimental validation. Looking forward, we plan to automate the integration of the rapidly growing number of scRNA-seq studies so that access to the entire world's knowledge of single cell transcriptomes is just one click away for any researcher. As we do so, we encourage interactive feedback from the scientific community so that this platform can evolve to optimally support the research needs across the biomedical ecosystem, beyond the COVID-19 focus on the current study.","A blog run by Public Health England (PHE) is a good example of real-time risk communication as it allows readers to post questions which have then been answered by the blog editor the same day. For example, a question posed about the use of masks for the UK public received a same day response that there is little evidence of their widespread benefit from use outside of clinical settings, and people concerned would do better to prioritize good personal, respiratory and hand hygiene [34] .","The drugs we highlighted in this study may help researchers to prioritize repositioning candidates for further studies, given the huge cost in developing a brand-new drug and that detailed investigations on every existing mediation will be impractical. We briefly discuss a few drugs highlighted by our analysis. Fostamatinib targets the largest number (seven) of proteins potentially linked to ACE2 expression. According to DrugBank, it serves as an inhibitor for all these proteins, and all were linked to elevated ACE2 expression in the present MR analysis except one. This drug has been approved for treating Immune Thrombocytopenic Purpura (ITP), and is a spleen tyrosine kinase inhibitor 42 . There has been trials on rheumatoid arthritis (RA) 43 and IgA nephropathy as well 42 .","One of the included trials 7 , seven of the cohort studies [9] [10] [11] [13] [14] [15] 17 , three of the retrospective studies 20,21,25 , and seven case reports/series 28,38,39,42,43,50,51 reported treatment related adverse events while two retrospective studies and three case reports/series reported that no treatment related adverse events occurred. In the trial 7 examining the effectiveness of ribavirin/lopinavir/ritonavir compared to no treatment as a prophylactic measure for healthcare workers, treatment-related adverse events were widely reported in the prophylaxis arm, including: GI symptoms (diarrhea n=9, nausea n=9, stomatitis n=4), anemia (n=9), leucopenia (n=8) and hyperbilirubinemia (n=20). All adverse effects occurred during prophylactic therapy and resolved shortly after conclusion of treatment with no further intervention. Overall, the most commonly reported adverse events were anemia (n=12 studies) and altered liver function (n=5 studies) in patients treated with ribavirin. Other treatment related adverse events included gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting), changes in kidney function, cardiac events (e.g., bradycardia, atrial fibrillation), hyperglycemia, and changes in mental status (e.g., confusion, anxiety). It should be noted however, that in the studies reporting cardiac adverse events, hyperglycemia, and mental status changes patients were receiving steroids as well as ribavirin.","[14]. These results are essential to guide the design and evaluation of efficient and 131 specific serological assays, as well as help prioritize vaccine target designs during 132 this unprecedented crisis. 133 author/funder.

The age-specific differences in mortality can be intuitively understood by comparing the age distributions of cases and deaths in both settings ( Figure 1B and D) , with an even more marked age shift in Italy resulting in higher mortality estimates in that group ( Figure 3A and 5A). The specific causes of this age trend are unknown, but early discussions have focused on the associations between SARS-CoV-2 and comorbidities such as diabetes and hypertension and the role of ACE inhibitors [35] . Here, we simply compared the prevalence of four comorbidities (diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, cardio-vascular disease and hypertension) among deaths associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection in China with the expected prevalence according to the age distribution of deaths. Only for diabetes was there an excess among SARS-CoV-2-associated deaths. The prevalence of the other comorbidities was similar or lower than expected in a Chinese population with that age distribution. The reliance on data that are not gender-disaggregated means that hypotheses about the potential influence of gender-related differences like smoking patterns could not be explored. This ecological observation does not refute any causality between these comorbidities and SARS-CoV-2-related mortality, as the age trend itself may be related to a higher prevalence of ageing-associated diseases, but highlights that the very specific age pattern of mortality associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection must be accounted for when discussing association with comorbidities.","Despite the increasing availability of preventive vaccines, morbidity amongst those children who do become infected remains high, possibly in relation to the many challenges faced in the diagnosis and management in resource-constrained settings. The early identification of risk factors for a poor outcome among pneumonia patients could help prioritize the management of those patients with an uncertain prognosis and perhaps increase their likelihood of surviving. Previous studies have described a series of factors including young age of the patient (or the patient's mother), malnutrition, anaemia, or the confirmation of grunting, cyanosis, or chest indrawing, among others, as harbingers of a negative outcome. [10] [11] [12] [13] Scarce and limited epidemiological, clinical, and microbiological data are available regarding paediatric respiratory tract infections in the Kingdom of Morocco, a middle-income country in north-western Africa, although the World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that up to 26.5% of all deaths in children aged 1-59 months are secondary to pneumonia. 14 In this analysis, part of a wider surveillance project on the aetiology of paediatric respiratory infections, we aimed to describe factors associated with a poor outcome among hospitalized children under the age of five admitted to a Moroccan reference hospital with a diagnosis of WHO-defined severe pneumonia.","In conclusion, it is time to translate research findings into more effective measures, as with other priority diseases [7] , such as a vaccine or effective therapeutic options, aimed at controlling viruses with clear epidemic potential, and to prioritize those interventions, to reduce and control the negative impact of diseases such as those caused by CoV, including the new emerging 2019-nCoV. ","In this study, we wish to answer the following question: What conditions or traits may lead to increased ACE2 expression, which may in turn result in greater susceptibility to 2019-nCov infection? Since COVID-19 is a new disease and prior knowledge is lacking, we employed a phenome-wide approach in which a large variety of traits are studied for causal associations with ACE2 expression. This analysis may help to prioritize resources for better prevention of the infection in those susceptible subjects.","At an international level, community acquired, novel pathogens have been recognized as a significant cause of ARDS in the last 15\u201320 years (31). In 2015, the World Health Organization (WHO) developed a panel of experts to prioritize emerging pathogens to likely cause severe outbreaks in the near future, and for which little or no preventative or curative treatments are available (39). The list includes two novel coronaviruses, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV and MERS-CoV, which are widely recognized as noteworthy causes of ARDS.","Background 60 The novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) seems to sweep across the globe 61 ever since its first successful jump from bat to the human being through a yet illness, and severe viral pneumonia[2, 6-8].

At the time of drafting this editorial, COVID-19 has swept through more than 115 countries and infected over 200,000 people around the globe [2\u20134]. More than 7000 individuals have died during the early phase of the pandemic, implying a high estimated case-fatality rate of 3.5% [2\u20134]. The rapidly spreading outbreak imposes an unprecedented burden on the effectiveness and sustainability of our healthcare system. Acute challenges include the exponential increase in emergency department (ED) visits and inpatient admission volumes, in conjunction with the impending risk of health care workforce shortage due to viral exposure, respiratory illness, and logistical issues due to the widespread closure of school systems [5]. Subsequent to the WHO declaration, the United States Surgeon General proclaimed a formal advisory to cancel elective surgeries at hospitals due to the concern that elective procedures may contribute to the spreading of the coronavirus within facilities and use up medical resources needed to manage a potential surge of coronavirus cases [6]. The announcement escalated to a nationwide debate regarding the safety and feasibility of continuing to perform elective surgical procedures during the COVID-19 pandemic [7, 8]. Many health care professionals erroneously interpreted the Surgeon General\u2019s recommendation as a \u201cblanket directive\u201d to cancel all elective procedures in the Country [9]. This notion was vehemently challenged in an open letter to the Surgeon General on behalf of United States hospitals [10]. The letter outlined a significant concern that the recommendation could be \u201cinterpreted as recommending that hospitals immediately stop performing elective surgeries without clear agreement on how we classify various levels of necessary care \u201c[10]. Notably, the Surgeon General\u2019s recommendation was based on a preceding statement by the American College of Surgeons (ACS) with a call to prioritize appropriate resource allocation during the coronavirus pandemic as it relates to elective invasive procedures.","We use state-level child care costs from CCAoA and adjust them to county-level by applying the ratio between state-level and county-level fair market rents from HUD. We calculate state-level rents from HUD by taking population-weighted averages of county rents. To estimate the number of healthcare workers with children at the county-level, we take the state-level proportion of healthcare workers with children from IPUMS and apply it to the county-level number of healthcare workers from ACS. We then calculate the county-level cost of providing child care to healthcare workers by multiplying child care costs by the proportion of healthcare workers with children.","In Yokohama, Japan, an outbreak of COVID-19 has been unfolding on board the Princess Cruise Ship, which has been under quarantine orders since February 5, 2020, after a former passenger of the Diamond Princess Ship tested positive for the virus after disembarking in Hong Kong (National Instatitute of Infectious Disease, 2020; Minister of Health, 1647). As of February 22, 2020, two days after the scheduled two-week quarantine came to an end, a total of 621 symptomatic and asymptomatic people including one quarantine officer, one nurse and one administrative officer tested positive for COVID-19 out of the 3711 passengers and crew members on board. Laboratory tests by PCR that prioritize symptomatic or high-risk groups have been conducted.","During certain clinical activities and treatments, the virus might aerosolize, thereby becoming spread by the airborne route, rather than the droplet method. Past studies looking at the SARS CoV showed that healthcare workers are more at risk of becoming infected with that coronavirus while participating in certain nursing procedures [9]. For example, the pooled odds ratio for risk of transmission for healthcare workers exposed to suction before intubation is 3.5 (0.5, 24.6). Healthcare workers exposed to tracheal intubation had a 6.6 OR pooled (4.1- 10.6).","In response to the need for improved in-hospital management, the WHO acute hospital care guidelines, termed the Emergency Triage, Assessment, and Treatment (ETAT) guidelines, were developed. This training program is designed to prioritize care for children who need urgent resuscitation and hospital admission. In Malawi, uptake and implementation of the ETAT guidelines streamlined the delivery of care and reduced hospital mortality by half (10\u201318% down to 6\u20138%) (4). However, the first 48 hours of admission were identified as the vulnerable period where skills beyond emergency care were needed. ETAT-plus admission care (ETAT+) was developed in Kenya to address this (37). Despite some positive results of ETAT+ implementation and further dissemination of these guidelines and training, reports indicate significant variation in uptake of best practices (36, 38\u201341).","The next important factor to consider for the 2019-nCoV outbreak is our ability to contain the spread of this new virus. There was a lag of three months between the commencement of the SARS epidemic and the initiation of investigation by healthcare officials in 2003 in China. 10 Consequently, the infection spread to approximately 8100 people in 29 countries and resulted in 774 deaths. 10 Since mild illness is uncommon in SARS infection and infected individuals are easily identifiable, SARS could be contained effectively and eradicated without vaccination or effective antiviral therapy. 10 Currently, there are a limited number of studies from China that investigate the efficacy and potential of lopinavir/ritonavir (Kaletra), a combination of protease inhibitors used to treat and prevent HIV/AIDS, in the treatment of 2019-nCoV infection. 11 Other agents, including nucleoside analogues, neuraminidase inhibitors, remdesivir, umifenovir (arbidol), tenofovir disoproxil (TDF), and lamivudine (3TC), along with several Chinese traditional medicines, are reported as viable options for antiviral treatment of human pathogenic coronavirus. 11 Clinical efficacy of remdesivir for the treatment of the first US case of pneumonia caused by 2019-nCoV was recently reported. 12 However, these data are derived from preliminary stages of studies and are insufficient to support the implementation for clinical use in treatment of 2019-nCoV infection. 11, 12 The severe lack of information during the initial stage of the 2019-nCoV outbreak posed challenges to and complicated the containment of the infection in specific limited areas. A higher proportion of mild 2019-nCoV infections facilitates rapid spreading of the virus. Present efforts for containment may not be completely effective. However, we can hope that these efforts may delay the spread of 2019-nCoV, and provide us with sufficient time to develop effective vaccines and antiviral agents against the virus.","The next important factor to consider for the 2019-nCoV outbreak is our ability to contain the spread of this new virus.

The susceptible strains of influenza A virus are commonly treated with adamantanes and neuraminidase inhibitors. As the occurrence of genetic variations is highly substantial among influenza strains, resistance to either class of antiviral agents may develop quickly. However, the dosages of antiviral agents currently recommended for seasonal influenza are developed for fully susceptible strains and evaluated in clinical trials mandating the requirement of treatment within 3 days of the onset of symptoms. 65 Early antiviral treatment has been shown to provide maximal benefit, and treatment should not be delayed until confirmation of positive influenza test results. Negative results of influenza diagnostic tests, especially the rapid antigen tests, do not conclusively exclude influenza disease. Therefore, treatment after 48 h of symptomatic infection may still provide some clinical benefit to those with more severe disease. 61 The efficacy of ribavirin for the treatment of RSV CAP in infants is debatable, as certain in vitro studies have shown activity of ribavirin against RSV, but its usage for RSV infection is not routinely recommended in the management of lower respiratory tract disease because of the high cost, aerosol administration, and possible toxic effects among healthcare providers. Palivizumab (Synagis), a humanised murine monoclonal antibody is another effective prophylaxis for RSV infection that is administered intramuscularly. 66 Although parainfluenza virus, adenovirus, metapneumovirus, rhinovirus, coronavirus, and bocavirus are associated with pediatric CAP, there are no prospective, controlled studies for antiviral therapy against these viruses.","Importation of resistant and highly pathogenic viruses including influenza viruses can occur worldwide. Despite this, there is lack of studies and data on drug susceptibility, and a very limited number of studies and reports on viral isolates, except for one study conducted in Jeddah, according to the best of our knowledge [78]. Most importantly, this highlights the importance of circulating influenza viruses in Saudi Arabia, hence there is need to ensure effective use of antivirals for prophylaxis and treatment of influenza. Furthermore, the rate of vaccination against influenza is very low among pilgrims and healthcare workers [78,90]. Moreover, studies are needed to provide a clear picture on the impact of drug resistance on Saudi Arabia\u2019s endemic pathogens, including the influenza viruses. In a recent communique, the Ministry of Environment, Water, and Agriculture for Saudi Arabia reported two cases of H5N8 avian influenza in the Kharj Governorate [91]. The latest update by the Ministry revealed that the number of samples collected from Saudi regions since the start of the influenza outbreak had reached 12,829. Positive results from samples and laboratory tests indicate 171 positive cases, and the Saudi authorities have taken action by culling as many as 254,050 birds within a 24-h period [91]. ","We estimate the cost of providing child care to healthcare workers with children by estimating county-level child care costs and the number of healthcare workers with children per county. We estimate county-level child care costs with a method similar to that used by the Economic Policy Institute's Family Budget Calculator (see Supplement). 30 To compare the two costs, we divide the cost of healthcare worker absenteeism from school closure by the cost of providing child care to all healthcare workers with children at the county level to get a coefficient \u03c9. We then calculate the percentage of counties with \u03c9 &gt; 1 at each level of \u03b4 , indicating the percentage of counties where it is cheaper to provide child care to all healthcare workers with children than it is to bear the costs of healthcare worker absenteeism from school closure.","In doing so, we contribute to the existing literature by four main points. Firstly, the risk perception of COVID-19 danger significantly increases the likelihood of wearing medical masks. Secondly, we find that before the COVID-19 epidemic, the elder is not likely to wear medical masks. However, after the COVID-19 outbreaks, the rise in age significantly increases the likelihood of using masks. Thirdly, price is the only factor that significantly decreases the willingness to buy medical masks. Fourthly and finally, those who use masks before the COVID-19 pandemic tend to maintain their behaviors. We are running to fight the virus, and the COVID-19 study has to trade thoroughness off against speed, at least to some extent. However, based on our dataset, our analytical results are striven to prioritize the accuracy as well as potential policymakers.","The RCF should provide ongoing education to staff, residents and volunteers, and opportunistic education to regular visitors (e.g. residents' families) about outbreak prevention, infection control and related policies. Topics for staff (some apply to residents) include: \u2022 Personal hygiene, particularly hand hygiene, sneeze and cough etiquette. 6.1 Preparing for influenza outbreaks Seasonal influenza typically peaks over winter and early spring, although sporadic cases occur year-round. Outbreaks of influenza are not uncommon in RCFs. To protect the health of staff and residents and to ensure the RCF is well prepared to manage an outbreak of influenza, it is important to consider the following actions: \u2022 Plan for a possible outbreak: 200 a. Develop easily accessible internal policies and procedures on infection control and an outbreak management plan. A copy of these guidelines and the Influ-Info Kit produced by the Department of Social Services should be used as references.27 b. Include a medical practitioner (or equivalent) in the development of the outbreak management plan; this is essential for consideration of use of antiviral medications. c. Acquire adequate stocks of materials such as personal protective equipment (PPE) and cleaning materials (refer to Appendices 1 and 2). Consider having an outbreak kit / box specifically for use in an outbreak. d. Ensure RCF staff know the symptoms and signs of influenza, and are trained in infection control procedures for use of PPE (Appendix 1). e. Policies supporting use of antiviral drugs for prophylaxis should reflect the reduced effectiveness of antivirals with either delays in implementation or low levels of compliance, and a response option for poor compliance. f. If there is an intention to use influenza antivirals for prophylaxis in the management of outbreaks, RCFs may develop processes with attending GPs for antiviral prescriptions/ standing orders prior to the influenza season (see 6.2.9), as to be effective antiviral medication must be used in a widespread fashion at the same time. g. For residents with renal failure, GP assessment of the renal function is needed before or soon after prophylaxis commences (Appendix 16). Note. Legislation relating to the use of standing drug orders may differ between jurisdictions. \u2022 Develop a systematic method for detecting and recording residents in the facility who develop symptoms of ILI, such as fever or cough. An ILI detection system may include increased frequency of temperature observation during winter and methods to alert the responsible clinician of symptomatic residents. \u2022 Maintain a functional system for the timely detection of potential influenza outbreaks (3 residents/staff with ILI within 3 days) in the RCF. This may be a daily summary of all ILI records. Ensure daily hand-over time for ILI monitoring and outbreak detection for those assigned to this important task. \u2022 Early in the year, plan to ensure at least 95% of staff and residents are vaccinated (refer to Section 3: Vaccination). Encourage staff, family members and regular visitors such as hairdressers etc., volunteers, allied health and support workers to be vaccinated. This helps keep them healthy and reduces the likelihood of influenza being brought into the facility. \u2022 Keep vaccination records for staff and residents up-to-date, and ensure they are easily accessible when needed for an outbreak response."],"title":["Contamination of hospital surfaces with respiratory pathogens in Bangladesh","Preparedness of institutions around the world for managing

In this study we estimated the most vulnerable areas in Brazil for COVID-19, both in terms of risk of introduction and risk of mortality associated with social vulnerability. We explore the most likely routes of spread through the country, from the already exposed cities, according to human mobility statistics. The resulting maps should help authorities in their efforts to prioritize actions and if resource allocation to mitigate the effects of the pandemic.","Summary The Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) has infected over 1600 individuals with nearly 600 deaths since it was first identified in human populations in 2012. No antiviral therapies or vaccines are available for its treatment or prophylaxis. Approaches to the development of MERS vaccines are discussed herein, including a summary of previous efforts to develop vaccines useful against human and non-human coronaviruses. A striking feature of MERS is the important role that camels have in transmission. Camel vaccination may be a novel approach to preventing human infection.","Abstract Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) poses an occupational health risk to healthcare workers. Several thousand healthcare workers have already been infected, mainly in China. Preventing intra-hospital transmission of the communicable disease is therefore a priority. Based on the Systems Engineering Initiative for Patient Safety model, the strategies and measures to protect healthcare workers in an acute tertiary hospital are described along the domains of work task, technologies and tools, work environmental factors, and organizational conditions. The principle of zero occupational infection remains an achievable goal that all healthcare systems need to strive for in the face of a potential pandemic.","The novel coronavirus 2019-nCoV has caused major outbreaks in many parts of the world. A better understanding of the pathophysiology of COVID-19 is urgently needed. Clinically, it is important to identify who may be susceptible to infection and identify treatments for the disease. There is good evidence that ACE2 is a receptor for 2019-nCoV, and studies also suggested that high expression of ACE2 may increase susceptibility to infection. Here we conducted a phenome-wide Mendelian randomization (MR) study to prioritize diseases/traits and blood proteins that may be causally linked to ACE2 expression in the lung. Expression data was based on GTEx. We also explored drug candidates whose targets overlapped with the top-ranked proteins in MR analysis, as these drugs could potentially alter ACE2 expression and may be clinically relevant. Notably, MR is much less vulnerable to confounding and reverse causality compared to observational studies. The most consistent finding was a tentative caus...","Introduction The COVID 19 outbreak is posing an unprecedented challenge to healthcare workers. This study analyzes the geo temporal effects on disease severity for the 1,688 Chinese healthcare workers infected with COVID 19. Method Using the descriptive results recently reported by the Chinese CDC, we compare the percentage of infected healthcare workers in severe conditions over time and across three areas in China, and the fatality rate of infected healthcare workers with all the infected individuals in China aged 22 to 59 years. Results Among the infected Chinese healthcare workers whose symptoms onset appeared during the same ten day period, the percentage of those in severe conditions decreased statistical significantly from 19.7% (Jan 11 to 20) to 14.4% (Jan 21 to 31) to 8.7% (Feb 1 to 11). Across the country, there was also a significant difference in the disease severity among patients symptoms onset during the same period, with Wuhan being the most severe (17%), followed by Hu...","Human coronaviruses (HCoVs), including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV, also known as SARS-CoV-2), lead global epidemics with high morbidity and mortality. However, there are currently no effective drugs targeting 2019-nCoV/SARS-CoV-2. Drug repurposing, representing as an effective drug discovery strategy from existing drugs, could shorten the time and reduce the cost compared to de novo drug discovery. In this study, we present an integrative, antiviral drug repurposing methodology implementing a systems pharmacology-based network medicine platform, quantifying the interplay between the HCoV\u2013host interactome and drug targets in the human protein\u2013protein interaction network. Phylogenetic analyses of 15 HCoV whole genomes reveal that 2019-nCoV/SARS-CoV-2 shares the highest nucleotide sequence identity with SARS-CoV (79.7%). Specifically, the envelope and nucleocapsid proteins of 2019-nCoV/SARS-CoV-2 are two evolutionarily co...","Summary SARS coronavirus continues to cause sporadic cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in China. No active or passive immunoprophylaxis for disease induced by SARS coronavirus is available. We investigated prophylaxis of SARS coronavirus infection with a neutralising human monoclonal antibody in ferrets, which can be readily infected with the virus. Prophylactic administration of the monoclonal antibody at 10 mg/kg reduced replication of SARS coronavirus in the lungs of infected ferrets by 3\u00b73 logs (95% Cl 2\u00b76\u20134\u00b70 logs; p&lt;0\u00b7001), completely prevented the development of SARS coronavirus-induced macroscopic lung pathology (p=0\u00b7013), and abolished shedding of virus in pharyngeal secretions. The data generated in this animal model show that administration of a human monoclonal antibody might offer a feasible and effective prophylaxis for the control of human SARS coronavirus infection.","Protection of healthcare workforce is of paramount relevance for the care of infected and non-infected patients in the setting of a pandemic such as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Healthcare workers are at increased risk to become infected because of contact to infected patients, infected co-workers and their community outside the hospital. The ideal organisational strategy to protect the healthcare workforce in a situation in which social distancing cannot be maintained at the workplace remains to be determined. In this study, we have mathematically modelled strategies for the employment of hospital workforce with the goal to simulate health and productivity of the workers. Therefore, deterministic models were extended to account for stochastic influences potentially occurring in rather small populations. The models were also designed to determine if desynchronization of medical teams by dichotomizing the workers may protect the workforce. Our studies model workforce productivit...","Abstract Objective MERS-CoV infection is uncommonly identified among patients visiting healthcare facilities &amp; we were vigilant in screening all patients entering our hospital to prevent cross infection among patients, visitors &amp; healthcare providers and aiming to prevent potential outbreaks with MERS-CoV infection. In spite of our efforts on practicing Failure Mode Effect Analysis for MERS-CoV infection management we ended up having an outbreak with MERS-CoV. Based on our experience, we actively implemented policies, procedures &amp; practices on early identification &amp; appropriate isolation practices along with supplemental infection prevention &amp; control measures for preventing future outbreaks at our healthcare facility. Methods Retrospectively we analyzed our failure in preventing the outbreak of MERS-CoV infection among our hospitalized patients by identifying the outbreak &amp; actively intervening as a team to control the outbreak with the support of Hospital Higher management, Administr...","Up to 25% of patients with profound neutropenia lasting for &gt;10 days develop lung infiltrates, which frequently do not respond to broad-spectrum antibacterial therapy. While a causative pathogen remains undetected in the majority of cases, Aspergillus spp., Pneumocystis jirovecii, multi-resistant Gram-negative pathogens, mycobacteria or respiratory viruses may be involved. In at-risk patients who have received trimethoprim\u2013sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) prophylaxis, filamentous fungal pathogens appear to be predominant, yet commonly not proven at the time of treatment initiation. Pathogens isolated from blood cultures, bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) or respiratory secretions are not always relevant for the etiology of pulmonary infiltrates and should therefore be interpreted critically. Laboratory tests for detecting Aspergillus galactomannan, \u03b2-d-glucan or DNA from blood, BAL or tissue samples may facilitate the diagnosis; however, most polymerase chain reaction assays are not yet standardi...","","BACKGROUND: The ongoing worldwide outbreak of the 2019-nCoV is markedly similar to the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak 17 years ago. During the 2002-2003 SARS outbreak, healthcare workers formed a special population of patients. Although virus-specific IgG play important roles in virus neutralization and prevention against future infection, limited information is available regarding the long term persistence of IgG after infection with SARS-like coronavirus. METHODS: A long-term prospective cohort study followed 34 SARS-CoV-infected healthcare workers from a hospital with clustered infected cases during the 2002-2003 SARS outbreak in Guangzhou, China, with a 13-year follow-up. Serum samples were collected annually from 2003-2015. Twenty SARS-CoV-infected and 40 non-infected healthcare workers were enrolled in 2015, and their serum samples were collected. All sera were tested for IgG antibodies with ELISA using whole virus and a recombinant nucleocapsid protein of SARS...","BACKGROUND: There is an ongoing debate regarding the type of respiratory protection that should be recommended for use for healthcare workers. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was conducted in three countries: China, Pakistan and Vietnam. RESULTS: In China and Pakistan, the infection control guidelines were developed to be in line with the recommendations from the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, while in the Vietnamese guidelines the recommendations correspond with the WHO suggestions only. The guidelines from all three countries document the need for training and fit testing; however there is no system to monitor the training and fit testing programs. Across the three countries, there was some inconsistency with regard to the types of products (i.e. masks vs. respirators) recommended for influenza, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and tuberculosis. CONCLUSIONS: Available evidence should be examined and a compre...","The novel coronavirus infection (COVID-19 or Coronavirus disease 2019) that emerged from Wuhan, Hubei province of China has spread to many countries worldwide. Efforts have been made to develop vaccines against human coronavirus (CoV) infections such as MERS and SARS in the past decades. However, to date, no licensed antiviral treatment or vaccine exists for MERS and SARS. Most of the efforts for developing CoV vaccines and drugs target the spike glycoprotein or S protein, the major inducer of neutralizing antibodies. Although a few candidates have shown efficacy in in vitro studies, not many have progressed to randomized animal or human trials, hence may have limited use to counter COVID-19 infection. This article highlights ongoing advances in designing vaccines and therapeutics to counter COVID-19 while also focusing on such experiences and advances as made with earlier SARS- and MERS-CoVs, which together could enable efforts to halt this emerging virus infection.","Currently, there has been an increasing socioeconomic impact of zoonotic pathogens transmitted from animals to humans worldwide. Recently, in the Arabian Peninsula, including in Saudi Arabia, epidemiological data indicated an actual increase in the number of emerging and/or reemerging cases of several viral zoonotic diseases. Data presented in this review are very relevant because Saudi Arabia is considered the largest country in the Peninsula. We believe that zoonotic pathogens in Saudi Arabia remain an important public health problem; however, more than 10 million Muslim pilgrims from around 184 Islamic countries arrive yearly at Makkah for the Hajj season and/or for the Umrah. Therefore, for health reasons, several countries recommend vaccinations for various zoonotic diseases among preventive protocols that should be complied with before traveling to Saudi Arabia. However, there is a shortage of epidemiological data focusing on the emerging and reemerging of zoonotic pathogens tran...","Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infections sharply increased in the Arabian Peninsula during spring 2014. In Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, these infections occurred primarily among healthcare workers and patients. To identify and describe epidemiologic and clinical characteristics of persons with healthcare-associated infection, we reviewed laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV cases reported to the Health Authority of Abu Dhabi during January 1, 2013\u2013May 9, 2014. Of 65 case-patients identified with MERS-CoV infection, 27 (42%) had healthcare-associated cases. Epidemiologic and genetic sequencing findings suggest that 3 healthcare clusters of MERS-CoV infection occurred, including 1 that resulted in 20 infected persons in 1 hospital. MERS-CoV in healthcare settings spread predominantly before MERS-CoV infection was diagnosed, underscoring the importance of increasing awareness and infection control measures at first points of entry to healthcare facilities.","Emerging infections, many zoonotic, are caused by a variety of pathogens with global distribution. Previously rare pathogens have emerged; global travel facilitates their rapid spread. Human encroachment on remote areas has brought contact with zoonotic diseases never before characterized. Although systematic study of rare outbreaks can be challenging, knowledge of emerging pathogens and their effects on women is accumulating. This article discusses effects of lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus, West Nile virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, avian influenza A virus, viral hemorrhagic fevers, spirochetal illnesses, and Chagas' disease. The potential impact of candidate bioterror agents and issues of prophylaxis and therapy are discussed.","Abstract Background and Aims Multiple issues in management of COVID have emerged, but confusion persists regarding rational interpretation. Aim of this brief review is to review these issues based on current literature. Methods This is a narrative review with Pubmed and Google Scholar search till 23 March 2020. Search terms were, COVID-19, treatment of coronavirus, COVID 19 and following terms; chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, ibuprofen, ACE-inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers, cardiovascular disease, diarrhoea, liver, testis and gastrointestinal disease. Results We discuss evidence regarding role of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine in treatment and prophylaxis, use of inhibitors of the renin angiotensin system, safety of ibuprofen, unusual clinical features like gastrointestinal symptoms and interpretation of tests for cardiac enzymes and biomarkers. Conclusions While our conclusions on management of COVID-19 patients with co-morbidities are based on current evidence, howeve...","School closures have been enacted as a measure of mitigation during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic due to their ability to reduce transmission. It has been shown that school closures could cause absenteeism amongst healthcare workers with dependent children, but there is a need for detailed high-resolution analysis of the relationship between school closures and healthcare worker absenteeism to inform local community preparedness. We provide national- and county-level simulations of school closures and absenteeism across the United States. At the national level, we estimate the projected absenteeism rate to range from 7.5% to 8.6%, and the effectiveness of school closures to range from 172 to 218 fewer hospital beds used per 100,000 people at peak demand. At the county-level, we find substantial variations of projected absenteeism and school closure effects, ranging from 2.0% to 18.6% absenteeism and 88 to 280 fewer hospital beds used per 100,000 people at peak demand. We also find sign...","BACKGROUND We described the epidemiological features of the coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) outbreak, and evaluated the impact of non-pharmaceutical interventions on the epidemic in Wuhan, China. METHODS Individual-level data on 25,961 laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 cases reported through February 18, 2020 were extracted from the municipal Notifiable Disease Report System. Based on key events and interventions, we divided the epidemic into four periods: before January 11, January 11-22, January 23 - February 1, and February 2-18. We compared epidemiological characteristics across periods and different demographic groups. We developed a susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered model to study the epidemic and evaluate the impact of interventions. RESULTS The median age of the cases was 57 years and 50.3% were women. The attack rate peaked in the third period and substantially declined afterwards across geographic regions, sex and age groups, except for children (age &lt;20) whose attack ...","Whether severe acute respiratory syndrome\u2013associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) infection can be asymptomatic is unclear. We examined the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV among 674 healthcare workers from a hospital in which a SARS outbreak had occurred. A total of 353 (52%) experienced mild self-limiting illnesses, and 321 (48%) were asymptomatic throughout the course of these observations. None of these healthcare workers had antibody to SARS CoV, indicating that subclinical or mild infection attributable to SARS CoV in adults is rare.","Antiviral agents are drugs approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment or control of viral infections. Available antiviral agents mainly target stages in the viral life cycle. The target stages in the viral life cycle are; viral attachment to host cell, uncoating, synthesis of viral mRNA, translation of mRNA, replication of viral RNA and DNA, maturation of new viral proteins, budding, release of newly synthesized virus, and free virus in body fluids. At least half of available antiviral agents are for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infections. The others are used mainly for the management of herpesviruses, hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), and respiratory viruses. Antiviral agents can be used for prophylaxis, suppression, preemptive therapy, or treatment of overt disease. Two important factors that can limit the utility of antiviral drugs are toxicity and the development of resistance to the antiviral agent by the virus. In ...","Summary Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) emerged recently as a new infectious disease that was transmitted efficiently in the healthcare setting and particularly affected healthcare workers (HCWs), patients and visitors. The efficiency of transmission within healthcare facilities was recognised following significant hospital outbreaks of SARS in Canada, China, Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan and Vietnam. The causative agent of SARS was identified as a novel coronavirus, the SARS coronavirus. This was largely spread by direct or indirect contact with large respiratory droplets, although airborne transmission has also been reported. High infection rates among HCWs led initially to the theory that SARS was highly contagious and the concept of \u2018super-spreading events\u2019. Such events illustrated that lack of infection control (IC) measures or failure to comply with IC precautions could lead to large-scale hospital outbreaks. SARS was eventually contained by the stringent application of I...","Abstract The outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003 was the first emergence of an important human pathogen in the 21st century. Responding to the epidemic provided clinicians with extensive experience in diagnosing and treating a novel respiratory viral disease. In this article, we review the experience of the SARS epidemic, focusing on measures taken to identify and isolate patients, prevent the transmission of infection to healthcare workers and develop effective therapies. Lessons learned from the SARS epidemic will be especially important in responding to the current emergence of another highly pathogenic human coronavirus, the agent of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), and to the recently emerging H7N9 influenza A virus in China. This paper forms part of a symposium in Antiviral Research on \u201cFrom SARS to MERS: 10years of research on highly pathogenic human coronaviruses.\u201d","Background COVID-19 is leading to the implementation of social distancing policies around the world and in the United States, including school closures. The evidence that mandatory school closures reduce cases and ultimately mortality mostly comes from experience with influenza or from models that do not include the impact of school closure on the healthcare labor supply or the role of the healthcare labor force in reducing the per infection mortality from the pathogen. There is considerable uncertainty of the incremental effect of school closures on transmission and lives saved from school closures. The likely, but uncertain, benefits from school closure need to be weighed against uncertain, and seldom quantified, costs of healthcare worker absenteeism associated with additional child care obligations. Methods We analyze data from the US Current Population Survey to measure the potential child care obligations for US healthcare workers that will need to be addressed if school closures...","Abstract2019-nCoV, which is a novel coronavirus emerged in Wuhan, China, at the end of 2019, has caused at least infected 11,844 as of Feb 1, 2020. However, there is no specific antiviral treatment or vaccine currently. Very recently report had suggested that novel CoV would use the same cell entry receptor, ACE2, as the SARS-CoV. In this report, we generated a novel recombinant protein by connecting the extracellular domain of human ACE2 to the Fc region of the human immunoglobulin IgG1. An ACE2 mutant with low catalytic activity was also used in the study. The fusion proteins were then characterized. Both fusion proteins has high affinity binding to the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV and 2019-nCoV and exerted desired pharmacological properties. Moreover, fusion proteins potently neutralized SARS-CoV and 2019-nCoV in vitro. As these fusion proteins exhibit cross-reactivity against coronaviruses, they could have potential applications for diagnosis, prophylaxis, and treatmen...","BACKGROUND: Experimental animal data show that protection against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) infection with human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) is feasible. For an effective immune prophylaxis in humans, broad coverage of different strains of SARS-CoV and control of potential neutralization escape variants will be required. Combinations of virus-neutralizing, noncompeting mAbs may have these properties. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Human mAb CR3014 has been shown to completely prevent lung pathology and abolish pharyngeal shedding of SARS-CoV in infected ferrets. We generated in vitro SARS-CoV variants escaping neutralization by CR3014, which all had a single P462L mutation in the glycoprotein spike (S) of the escape virus. In vitro experiments confirmed that binding of CR3014 to a recombinant S fragment (amino acid residues 318\u2013510) harboring this mutation was abolished. We therefore screened an antibody-phage library derived from blood of a convalescent SARS pat...","The 2009 influenza A (H1N1) pandemic highlighted the importance of quality hospital care of the severely ill, yet there is evidence that the impact of the 2009 pandemic was highest in low\u2010 and middle\u2010income countries with fewer resources. Recent data indicate that death and suffering from seasonal influenza and severe illness in general are increased in resource\u2010limited settings. However, there are limited clinical data and guidelines for the management of influenza and other severe illness in these settings. Life\u2010saving supportive care through syndromic case management is used successfully in high\u2010resource intensive care units and in global programs such as the Integrated Management of Childhood Illness (IMCI). While there are a variety of challenges to the management of the severely ill in resource\u2010limited settings, several new international initiatives have begun to develop syndromic management strategies for these environments, including the World Health Organization's Integrated M...","Background: During the first week of March, the surge of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases reached over 100 countries with more than 100,000 cases. Healthcare authorities have already initiated awareness and preparedness activities beyond borders. A poor understanding of the disease among healthcare workers (HCWs) may result in delayed treatment and the rapid spread of infection. This study aimed to investigate the knowledge and perceptions of HCWs about COVID-19. Methods: A cross-sectional, web-based study was conducted among HCWs about COVID-19 during the first week of March 2020. A 23-item survey instrument was developed and distributed randomly to HCWs using social media; it required 5 minutes to complete. A chi-square test was used to investigate the level of association among variables at the significance level of p&lt;0.05. Results: Of 529 participants, a total of 453 HCWs completed the survey (response rate: 85.6%); 51.6% were males, 32.1% were aged 25-34 years, and most w...","Abstract Background : A novel form of Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) in Wuhan has created a confused and rapidly evolving situation. In this situational framework, patients and front-line healthcare workers are vulnerable. Method : Studies were identified using large-circulation international journals found in two electronic databases: Scopus and Embase. Results : Populations of patients that may require tailored interventions are older adults and international migrant workers. Older adults with psychiatric conditions may be experiencing further distress. The COVID-19 epidemic has underscored potential gaps in mental health services during emergencies. Conclusions : Most health professionals working in isolation units and hospitals do not receive any training for providing mental health care. Fear seems more certainly a consequence of mass quarantine.","Abstract Yersinia pestis is the causative agent of plague and is considered one of the most likely pathogens to be used as a bioweapon. In humans, plague is a severe clinical infection that can rapidly progress with a high mortality despite antibiotic therapy. Therefore, early treatment of Y. pestis infection is crucial. This review provides an overview of its clinical manifestations, diagnosis, treatment, prophylaxis, and protection requirements for the use of clinicians. We discuss the likelihood of a deliberate release of plague and the feasibility of obtaining, isolating, culturing, transporting and dispersing plague in the context of an attack aimed at a westernized country. The current threat status and the medical and public health responses are reviewed. We also provide a brief review of the potential prehospital treatment strategy and vaccination against Y. pestis. Further, we discuss the plausibility of antibiotic resistant plague bacterium, F1-negative Y. pestis, and also th...","Background: In the beginning of January 2020, new unknown virus pneumonia cases started to emerge in local hospitals in Wuhan, China. This virus epidemic quickly became a public health emergency of international concern by the WHO. Enormous amount of medical supplies as well as healthcare personals from other provinces were mobilized to support Wuhan. This current work tent to help people understanding how infectious disease spread and the purpose and consequences of various efforts based on simulation model. Method: a simulation model was created using known parameters. R0 set to 3 and mean incubation time to be 7.5days. the epidemic was divided to 3 periods. Simulation would run 50 times to mimic different patient0 status. Personal activity index was used to mimic different level of control measures. 141427709 simulated patients were created. Cumulation number of patients at the end of period 1 (day50) is 2868.7 \u00b1 1739.0. Total infected patients could be 913396.5 \u00b1 559099.9 by the en...","Summary Background Studies on the fusion-inhibitory peptides derived from the heptad repeat 1 and 2 (HR1 and HR2) regions of the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein gp41 provided crucial information on the viral fusogenic mechanism. We used a similar approach to study the fusogenic mechanism of severe-acute-respiratory-syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV). Methods We tested the inhibitory activity against infection of two sets of peptides corresponding to sequences of SARS-CoV spike protein HR1 and HR2 regions and investigated the interactions between the HR1 and HR2 peptides by surface plasmon resonance, sedimentation equilibration analysis, circular dichroism, native polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis, size exclusion high-performance liquid chromatography, and computer-aided homology modelling and molecule docking analysis. Findings One peptide, CP-1, derived from the HR2 region, inhibited SARS-CoV infection in the micromolar range. CP-1 bound with high affinity to a peptide from the H...","Hospital-acquired infections (HAIs) are serious problems for healthcare systems, especially in developing countries where public health infrastructure and technology for infection preventions remain undeveloped. Here, we characterized how strategy and technology could be mobilized to improve the effectiveness of infection prevention and control in hospitals during the outbreaks of Ebola, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in Asia and West Africa. Published literature on the hospital-borne outbreaks of SARS, Ebola, and MERS in Asia and West Africa was comprehensively reviewed. The results showed that healthcare systems and hospital management in affected healthcare facilities had poor strategies and inadequate technologies and human resources for the prevention and control of HAIs, which led to increased morbidity, mortality, and unnecessary costs. We recommend that governments worldwide enforce disaster risk management, even when no ou...","Importance A large number of healthcare workers (HCWs) were infected by SARS-CoV-2 during the ongoing outbreak of COVID-19 in Wuhan, China. Hospitals are significant epicenters for the human-to-human transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 for HCWs, patients, and visitors. No data has been reported on the details of hospital environmental contamination status in the epicenter of Wuhan. Objective To investigate the extent to which SARS-CoV-2 contaminates healthcare settings, including to identify function zones of the hospital with the highest contamination levels and to identify the most contaminated objects, and personal protection equipment (PPE) in Wuhan, China. Design A field investigation was conducted to collect the surface swabs in various environments in the hospital and a laboratory experiment was conducted to examine the presence of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Setting Six hundred twenty-six surface samples were collected within the Zhongnan Medical Center in Wuhan, China in the mist of the CO...","Background:SARS-CoV-2-caused coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is posinga large casualty. The features of COVID-19patients withand without pneumonia,SARS-CoV-2 transmissibility in asymptomatic carriers, and factors predicting disease progression remain unknown. Methods: We collected information on clinical characteristics, exposure history, andlaboratory examinations of all laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients admitted to PLA General Hospital. Cox regression analysis was applied to identify prognostic factors. The last follow-up was February 18, 2020. Results:We characterized 55 consecutive COVID-19 patients. The mean incubation was 8.42(95% confidence interval [CI], 6.55-10.29) days. The mean SARS-CoV-2-positive duration from first positive test to clearance was 9.71(95%CI, 8.21-11.22) days. COVID-19 course was approximately 2 weeks. Asymptomatic carriers might transmit SARS-CoV-2. Compared with patients without pneumonia, those with pneumonia were 15 years older and had a higher rate ...","Abstract The nucleocapsid (N) protein of SARS-coronavirus (SARS-CoV) is the key protein for the formation of the helical nucleocapsid during virion assembly. This protein is believed to be more conserved than other proteins of the virus, such as spike and membrane glycoprotein. In this study, the N protein of SARS-CoV was expressed in Escherichia coli DH5\u03b1 and identified with pooled sera from patients in the convalescence phase of SARS. A plasmid pCI-N, encoding the full-length N gene of SARS-CoV, was constructed. Expression of the N protein was observed in COS1 cells following transfection with pCI-N. The immune responses induced by intramuscular immunization with pCI-N were evaluated in a murine model. Serum anti-N immunoglobulins and splenocytes proliferative responses against N protein were observed in immunized BALB/c mice. The major immunoglobulin G subclass recognizing N protein was immunoglobulin G2a, and stimulated splenocytes secreted high levels of gamma interferon and IL-2 ...","Abstract Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) was diagnosed in more than 8437 patients in 25 countries between February and July 2003. During this period the World Health Organisation issued a global alert about SARS and together with the Centre for Disease Control have coordinated their efforts to investigate its pathogenesis and treatment. The outbreak in Hong Kong has been dramatic due to its geographical proximity with Guangdong province, China where the first case of SARS was reported. SARS has been described as a rapidly progressive, sometimes fatal pneumonia with a case fatality rate of 7.6% requiring intensive care. The four case reports illustrate a number of important points concerning the recognition, treatment, management and prevention of SARS, and highlights the importance of considering vigilant assessment and monitoring of patients with SARS. The purpose of this paper is to share our experiences in caring for critically ill patients with SARS in the intensive care u...","DNA microarrays have emerged as a viable platform for detection of pathogenic organisms in clinical and environmental samples. These microbial detection arrays occupy a middle ground between low cost, narrowly focused assays such as multiplex PCR and more expensive, broad-spectrum technologies like high-throughput sequencing. While pathogen detection arrays have been used primarily in a research context, several groups are aggressively working to develop arrays for clinical diagnostics, food safety testing, environmental monitoring and biodefense. Statistical algorithms that can analyze data from microbial detection arrays and provide easily interpretable results are absolutely required in order for these efforts to succeed. In this article, we will review the most promising array designs and analysis algorithms that have been developed to date, comparing their strengths and weaknesses for pathogen detection and discovery.","AbstractThe beginning of 2020 has seen the emergence of COVID-19 outbreak caused by a novel coronavirus, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). There is an imminent need to better understand this new virus and to develop ways to control its spread. In this study, we sought to gain insights for vaccine design against SARS-CoV-2 by considering the high genetic similarity between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, which caused the outbreak in 2003, and leveraging existing immunological studies of SARS-CoV. By screening the experimentally-determined SARS-CoV-derived B cell and T cell epitopes in the immunogenic structural proteins of SARS-CoV, we identified a set of B cell and T cell epitopes derived from the spike (S) and nucleocapsid (N) proteins that map identically to SARS-CoV-2 proteins. As no mutation has been observed in these identified epitopes among the available SARS-CoV-2 sequences (as of 9 February 2020), immune targeting of these epitopes may potentially offer pr...","The beginning of 2020 has seen the emergence of COVID-19 outbreak caused by a novel coronavirus, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).

We are not aware of any gender analysis of the outbreak by global health institutions or governments in affected countries or in preparedness phases. Recognising the extent to which disease outbreaks affect women and men differently is a fundamental step to understanding the primary and secondary effects of a health emergency on different individuals and communities, and for creating effective, equitable policies and interventions. Although sex-disaggregated data for COVID-19 show equal numbers of cases between men and women so far, there seem to be sex differences in mortality and vulnerability to the disease.2 Emerging evidence suggests that more men than women are dying, potentially due to sex-based immunological3 or gendered differences, such as patterns and prevalence of smoking.4 However, current sex-disaggrega...","","","","Sarcoidosis is a granulomatous disease of unknown etiology, characterized by a Th1 immunophenotype, most commonly involving the lung, skin, lymph node and eyes. Molecular and immunologic studies continue to strengthen the association of sarcoidosis with infectious antigens, particularly those derived from Propionibacterium and Mycobacterium species. Independent studies report the presence of microbial nucleic acids and proteins within sarcoidosis specimens. Complementary immunologic studies also support the role of infectious agents in sarcoidosis pathogenesis. Th-1 immune responses directed against mycobacterial virulence factors have been detected within sarcoidosis diagnostic bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). Th1 and Th17 immune responses against propionibacteria have also been reported. More recently, case reports and clinical trials from Japanese, European and American investigators have emerged regarding the efficacy of antimicrobials against Propionibacterium and Mycobacterium speci...","The Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) was first described in 2012 and, subsequently, many cases were reported with a lower case fatality rate than initial cases. Humans can become infected within their communities and transmission can then be amplified in the healthcare setting. Contact investigation among cases shows a variable amount of spread among family members and healthcare workers. So far, circulating virus strains remain similar under continuous monitoring, with no genetic changes. Here, we discuss the transmission pattern, phylogenetic evolution, and pathogenesis of MERS-CoV infection.","","","Background On February 27, 2020, the first patient with COVID-19 was reported in the Netherlands. During the following weeks, nine healthcare workers (HCWs) were diagnosed with COVID-19 in two Dutch teaching hospitals, eight of whom had no history of travel to China or Northern-Italy. A low-threshold screening regimen was implemented to determine the prevalence and clinical presentation of COVID-19 among HCWs in these two hospitals. Methods HCWs who suffered from fever or respiratory symptoms were voluntarily tested for SARS-CoV-2 by real-time reverse-transcriptase PCR on oropharyngeal samples. Structured interviews were conducted to document symptoms for all HCWs with confirmed COVID-19. Findings Thirteen-hundred fifty-three (14%) of 9,705 HCWs employed were tested, 86 (6%) of whom were infected with SARS-CoV-2. Most HCWs suffered from relatively mild disease and only 46 (53%) reported fever.
