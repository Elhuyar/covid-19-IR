First, we summarize the research articles presented in this Special Issue and then issue a call for renewed action to end discrimination and marginalization in our societies, and to strengthen wider efforts to support the health of the most marginalized people. ","Although the scientific basis for these interventions might be robust, ethical considerations are multi faceted. 9 Importantly, political leaders must enact quarantine and social-distancing policies that do not bias against any population group. The legacies of social and economic injustices perpetrated in the name of public health have lasting repercussions. 10 Interventions might pose risks of reduced income and even job loss, disproportionately affecting the most disadvantaged populations: policies to lessen such risks are urgently needed. Special attention should be given to protections for vulnerable populations, such as homeless, incarcerated, older, or disabled individuals, and undocumented migrants. Similarly, exceptions might be necessary for certain groups, including people who are reliant on ongoing medical treatment.","Mental health and suicide are significant issues among marginalized populations which do not receive sufficient attention. In this issue, Gilmour et al. [7] describe the suicide mortality rates of foreigners living in Japan compared with those in their country of origin and in Japanese nationals. They showed that, distinct from other nationalities, Koreans living in Japan have substantially higher mortality rates than both Japanese people and Koreans living in Korea, possibly due to the particular social, economic, and cultural pressures that this marginalized population face in Japan. Houser et al. [8] investigated the role that mental health plays in parole decisions in Pennsylvania, in the United States, and found that mental health plays only a limited role in these decisions. This is important evidence for developing guidelines and institutional frameworks for protecting marginalized people from further discrimination in the law enforcement system. ","While school closures have proven to be an important means for delaying or reducing outbreaks (13, 14) , they come with large economic and societal costs, with generally an outsized impact on disadvantaged and vulnerable populations (15) .","The special issue also touches on risk behaviors among marginalized populations. Wang and Shuanglong [16] explored generational differences in smoking, alcohol and dietary consumption behaviours among British minorities. They found that the second generation of migrants is more likely to smoke and consume alcohol and less likely to eat fruits and vegetables than white British, and identified a need for targeting second-generation ethnic minorities adopting unhealthy lifestyles. Pallesen et al. [17] conducted a study of the feasibility of a participatory intervention for improving dietary behaviour among ethnic minority women in Denmark. They reported that minority women of lower socioeconomic backgrounds easily engaged with a culturally relevant and acceptable cardiovascular disease prevention intervention, which positively motivated healthy dietary behaviour, and showed that, with the correct engagement, marginalized groups can have reduced dietary risks. Dearle et al. [18] also explored cultural factors related to risk for NCDs, examining knowledge and attitudes towards diabetes among Fijians. They investigated attitudes towards a traditional diet, the influence of family members, community beliefs, and awareness of diabetes, and found that effective intervention should incorporate cultural values and practices, emphasizing the essential role of family networks and church groups in conveying health messages. ","The papers in this Special Issue describe a variety of health issues among marginalized communities in both developed and developing nations, ranging from not only infectious to non-communicable diseases but also some emerging problems such as Ebola, HIV, and suicide. Although marginalization remains a significant and serious cause of ill health and health inequality globally, no aspect of the health challenges that marginalized people face is insurmountable. With proper respect for the dignity of every individual and a commitment to end discrimination, marginalization and stigmatization, it is possible to ensure that all members of the global community enjoy the same high standards of health, and by attending to and investing more in the health of marginalized people, we can make progress towards health for all.","The transition from innovation in the health system to the promotion of health is a prerequisite for ensuring the long-term supply of health services on an equal basis and with equal distribution of all produced results. However, the dilemma of attaining maximalist objectives-the effective development of the health system-at the expense of the minimalist implementation of coverage for the socially disadvantaged, particularly in times of crisis, is of particular interest and guides the analysis of health policies with regards to the allocation of available resources.","Communities can serve as valuable resources in managing difficulties of family matters. For instance, parents' committees can work together to bridge the needs of students with school requirements and to advocate for children's rights to a healthy lifestyle. Psychologists can provide online services to cope with mental health issues caused by domestic conflicts, tension with parents, and anxiety from becoming infected. 7 Social workers can play an active role in helping parents cope with family issues arising from the situation, when needed. Such a social safety net could be particularly useful for disadvantaged or single-parent families, 9 but action is needed to make it accessible to them.","As HIV is the canonical example of an infectious disease that thrives in environments of marginalization and discrimination, this special issue naturally included several articles discussing this epidemic. Peng et al. [12] described willingness to use Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) among Men Who Have Sex with Men (MSM) in China and found a high level of willingness to take free PrEP in this high-risk population. They gave suggestions for reducing community and self-stigmatization toward MSM in order to promote PrEP uptake and adherence among this marginalized group. Vendula B. et al. [13] reported on the social needs and acceptance of support among clients of a supervised injecting facility in Australia, where harm reduction is the main response to HIV. They found that people with higher self-perceived need were more likely to accept assistance, and identified referral from low-threshold programs along with increased attention to the improvement of services in high-threshold programs as essential to linking high-risk individuals to appropriate care. Meanwhile, Hill et al. [14] examined condom use and its associated factors among Japanese MSM in Tokyo\u2014another population at high risk of HIV [15]. They showed that inconsistent condom use varies among MSM with different types of sex partners, and the use of condoms is associated with education level, self-efficacy for safer sex, marital status, and drinking alcohol, again showing the role of self-stigmatization and marginalization in increasing risk behaviors. They recommended tailored strategies to improve condom use in this community and show the importance of updating research strategies as well as outreach methods when tackling the HIV epidemic in young, rapidly-changing hidden populations.","Although it has been more than 40 years since \u201chealth for all\u201d was presented as a focus in the Alma Ata declaration [1], the world is still far from achieving this goal. Although great progress has been made since then in many areas of health, much of that progress has been confined to rich countries, and even within the richest of countries, health inequality persists. New health problems and threats have arisen in the generations since that hopeful statement, with the scourge of HIV and the challenge of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) facing high and low-income countries alike [2]. With these new challenges, we see inequalities forming along the same old social fault lines and the same axes of deprivation and discrimination. In high-income countries, new risk factors such as obesity and food insecurity cluster in the poorest communities [3,4], while on a global level, we see the greatest burden of new diseases such as HIV falling on the poorest countries [5], and continuing challenges of health access and financing for the poorest people [6]. Much of this inequality arises from simple economic inequality and the consequences of colonialism, but much also results from the marginalization of certain individuals and groups at community, national and global levels. Sexual minorities, people with mental illness, migrants, refugees, the homeless, transient populations, transgender people, sex workers and many other groups who do not conform to existing social norms, or who have historically been marginalized and excluded, experience many often completely preventable illnesses. Discrimination against some members of the community, their exclusion from economic, cultural and social processes, and the selective provision of basic services to these communities put them at increased risk of poor health and expose them to preventable risk factors. Because the marginalization of these people is socially and historically determined, the health consequences for these people continue to be severe and pernicious, despite being preventable.","The development of safe and effective vaccines to protect against global infectious diseases (e.g., tuberculosis, malaria, HIV/ AIDS), enteric diseases, and other neglected diseases of the developing world is of critical public health importance. Development and availability of such vaccines, particularly for use in the developing countries most affected by these diseases, will benefit U.S. and global health. In 2011, the FDA published a revised guidance document to assist sponsors in developing vaccines targeted against infectious diseases or conditions endemic in areas outside the United States. The FDAAA of 2007 revised the FD&amp;C Act by adding Section 524, recognizing the importance of having products to treat and prevent tropical diseases that disproportionately affect poor and marginalized populations and for which there is no significant market in developed nations. Under Section 524, the Agency can grant priority review of applications under Section 505(b)(1) of the FD&amp;C Act or Section 351 of the PHS Act for the treatment and prevention of specified tropical diseases, including tuberculosis, malaria, cholera, and \"any other infectious disease for which there is no significant market in developed nations and that disproportionately affects poor and marginalized populations, designated by regulation by the Secretary.\" Consequently, this guidance provides general recommendations for regulatory pathways to use in the development of vaccines to protect against global infectious diseases for U.S. licensure and clarifies applicable regulations: (a) the FDA can license vaccines to protect against infectious diseases or conditions that are not endemic or have not been reported to occur in the United States; (b) the regulatory pathways to U.S. licensure for the development of vaccines to protect against infectious diseases that are not endemic or have not been reported to occur in the United States are the same as for vaccines to protect against diseases that are endemic in the United States; (c) a sponsor may submit data from clinical trials conducted outside the United States to support product licensure, (d) noting that the accelerated approval regulations may be used in appropriate cases; and (e) that when pivotal studies are conducted outside the United States, in some instances, it may not be necessary to conduct studies in the United States. This guidance also responded to the congressional mandate in Section 740 of the fiscal year 2010 Appropriation Act (Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2010, Public Law 111-80) by requiring the FDA to make recommendations on appropriate preclinical, trial design, and regulatory paradigms to prevent, diagnose, and treat rare diseases and neglected diseases.","The COVID-19 pandemic continues to wreak havoc on our providers, medical systems, economy, and populace. But as the saying goes, crisis creates opportunity. In this case, the opportunity for us as a surgical community to is to lead by applying our lessons learned from combat, trauma, and critical care patient management and take an active role in triage, resource allocation, contingency planning, and even in the care of the gravely ill patient. The alternative is to sit on the sidelines and be marginalized for a \"nonsurgical\" problem -when our nation, hospitals, and patients need us most.","Pathogens that are neglected because their effects are limited to particular populations or particular locations are, in our increasingly mobile and globalized world, ripe to emerge-they will evolve to adopt new transmission routes, invade new hosts, use new vehicles of infection, and produce new pathologies. As many parasitic infections have been neglected, it is no surprise to see that many are now emerging, appearing in unexpected hosts, in new locations, using different transmission vehicles, or resulting in a different spectrum of symptoms. In this chapter, just six foodborne parasites are used as examples, but others could also have been selected. In recognizing these emerging foodborne parasites and rising to combat them in their new situations, we do ourselves the additional favor of also having the opportunity of addressing pathogens that, although neglected, have been a significant burden, both in terms of health and socioeconomy, often in impoverished or otherwise marginalized communities.","The entire world, including India, was taken by surprise and countries did not get any time for elaborate preparation. Social and physical distancing is a good move by the government but basic needs of different sections of the society should also be addressed. Welfare of stranded, poor, daily workers should also be addressed by government, corporates, and NGOs with government funding. The finance ministry has recently announced relief packages for the marginalized communities, but implementation at ground level needs careful and risk free planning amidst lockdown period. Government should also enhance testing facilities, hospital support, and personal hygiene on a war footing as exponential growth may not give a lot of time to react for the various officials and departments. Specific R&amp;D centers in the country should work to quickly create the best possible solutions for cure like vaccines, oral medicines, Ayurveda substitutes, preventive kits, apart from focusing on producing hand sanitizers &amp; masks. A lot of companies are in race to test the vaccine but yet the situation looks troublesome for now. In fact at the global level, WHO should immediately initiate joint R&amp;D for cure by .

As a consequence, mouth-guards are not recommended for everyday life activities.","From this discussion, it should be clear why viral infections can result a such a wide array of presentations. Because of the intracellular, parasitic nature of viruses and the resulting dependence on host cell metabolic machinery for proliferation, the use of antiviral drug therapy is limited. Many of the drugs developed for viral disease also have an effect on rapidly growing cells, which limits their use in the newborn. Thus, the newborn is not only vulnerable to infection, but also is disadvantaged for viable treatment options.","Many of the studies in this special issue identified strategies to improve the health of marginalized groups. Wallimann and colleagues [19] explored the primary care network of Eritrean immigrants in Switzerland. They found language difficulties and intercultural understanding are barriers to properly accessing care and identified six key lessons for practices to facilitate health care access for Eritrean immigrants. Pudpong et al. [20] assessed a voluntary health insurance scheme for migrants in Thailand. They found that it improved access for previously uninsured migrants and reduced the financial burden for public hospitals in the project area. They suggested further efforts to raise community understanding of the benefits of being insured in order to improve the sustainability and effectiveness of the program. Gaboardi et al. [21] assessed the goals and principles of providers working with people experiencing homelessness in eight European countries, indicating a contrast between providers who were more focused on their client\u2019s autonomy and those whose primary focus was on the client\u2019s basic needs such as food, health and temporary accommodation. Braun-Lewensohn et al. [22] explored the coping strategies for stressors among women in Bedouin society and described the stability of sense of coherence (SOC) in this minority society as it underwent rapid social and cultural changes. Significant differences were found between age groups, and the oldest women were identified as an at-risk population due to limitations in their coping strategies and SOC. In related research in a very different community, Millan et al. [23] examined the health beliefs and practices of Gypsies and Travelers in the UK, where these communities experience significant marginalization and discrimination. They described this community\u2019s health problems and their experiences in health care systems, including discrimination and negative stereotypes. The authors indicate the need for a more concentrated and intensive approach to improve health among travelers in the UK.","What must be done to mitigate the impact of large outbreaks of COVID-19 in prisons? The public health importance of prison responses to influenza outbreaks has been recognised in the USA, 8 where the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have developed a checklist for pandemic influenza preparedness in correctional settings. WHO has also issued prisonspecific guidance for responding to COVID-19 (panel). 9 Prison health is public health by definition. Despite this and the very porous borders between prisons and communities, prisons are often excluded or treated as separate from public health efforts. The fast spread of COVID-19 will, like most epidemics, disproportionately affect the most disadvantaged people. Therefore, to","In an era of personalized medicine, one should not lose sight of how molecular medicine can be used to improve global health. Cheaper drugs and vaccines for all communities is an important benefit that should come from molecular-based technologies. Another would be better NATs. In this respect it is intriguing to recall how direct-to-consumer DNA testing (Chapter 5) makes effective use of the Internet. Could the Internet be one way to improve accessibility for disadvantaged communities or those in rural and remote regions? Consideration of how genomics can play a part in the bioeconomy, with its potential to generate income, improve food production and sustain a better environment, are some of the challenges now being taken up by bodies such as the OECD.","A striking feature of our analysis is the very high value of the basic reproduction number we identified in the period of time up to the closure of Wuhan city. Three of our modeling methods -including the best-fitting method based on a Poisson loss function -identified a value of \" greater than 5, with some possibility of a value over 6. Basic reproduction numbers in the 5-7 range are consistent with extremely contagious diseases such as mumps and smallpox, and indicate a disease with a very high risk of becoming a global pandemic. This finding has significant implications for cities like Singapore, Japan and London which are beginning to experience the first signs of spread of the disease without importation. In light of the epidemic threat identified here, these cities should consider implementing more aggressive prevention policies as necessary, while respecting human rights and the dignity of affected individuals and of those who might be disadvantaged by stricter quarantine and control mechanisms.","Patients with lung cancer may be doubly disadvantaged by COVID-19 infection due to the respiratory changes which seems the predominant mode of death in people infected with the virus [39] . Many lung cancer patients will already have compromised lung function and the pneumonitis cause by therapeutic radiation may conceivably increase risk for patients. In this context patient selection for treatment, particularly with respect to fitness and frailty is crucial. Although modest hypofractionation is possible in non-small cell lung cancer dose constraints with acceptable lung V20 of less than 30% may be challenging if the PTV is large. In patients suitable for stereotactic radiosurgery with local access then a single fraction regimen may be possible and preferable to a 3 fraction regimen [40, 41] . Sequential regimens might be preferred for stage III unresectable disease over concurrent RT-CT for reducing the risk of lymphopenia; no data are currently available on the incidence and severity of COVID-19 in patients undergoing maintenance immunotherapy with anti PD-L1 inhibitors after chemoradiation, so caution is advised.","Consequently, the elucidation of the Spike-ACE2 binding interface is needed to design novel therapeutics. To that end, we used the PIPE-Sites algorithm to predict the three most likely putative interaction interfaces between the Spike (P0DTC2) and ACE2 (Q9BYF1) proteins ( Figure 6 ). Note that all predicted subsequence offsets are 0-indexed. With a maximum landscape peak of 6, the PIPE-Sites algorithm identified three putative interaction interfaces: Most interestingly, certain of these region along the Spike protein appears to coincide with mismatched or gap regions along the dot plot alignment depicted in Figure 7 ). For example, upon closer investigation of the alignment around residue 420, we note six mismatches. Their proximity to a candidate region of interaction certainly warrant additional experimental investigation (Figure 7 ). While numerous inhibitory strategies exist, including the use of small molecules or small interfering RNAs, this research is most directly amenable to the design small inhibitory peptides that inhibit virus infection by preventing Spike protein-mediated receptor binding and blocking viral fusion and entry. Unfortunately, much like small peptides and interfering RNAs, peptide-based solutions are disadvantaged by their low antiviral potency.","Clearly, any decision to start a DMT during the COVID-19 pandemic will need to be taken carefully and will depend on the state of the COVID-19 pandemic, not only in the particular country concerned, but in the specific area the patient lives and receives therapy. For example, aggressive public health steps to contain the spread of the virus locally may make it relatively safe for a patient to start an immunosuppressive therapy. Our concern is that the COVID-19 pandemic may trigger a large number of neurologists and patients to reconsider treatment strategy and choice of initial DMT and to opt for less effective immunomodulatory DMTs. This change needs to be considered carefully. The COVID-19 pandemic in all likelihood will be short lived and it would be unfair to patients treated during the epidemic to be disadvantaged in the long term regarding the management of their MS. Neurologists have spent an extraordinary amount of time and effort to activate the MS community: to advance the principle that 'time is brain', to treat MS proactively to a target of no evident disease activity (NEDA) and more recently, to flip the pyramid and use higher efficacy treatments first line. These treatment principles are evidence-based and should not be thrown out in the context of a potential, but yet undefined, risk to our patients.","We used a Bayesian framework to fit the model to imported cases by origin, travel date, and confirmation date. Cases with partial information (e.g. missing date and/or origin of travel) were included by defining latent variables marginalized out during inference. The model was then used to nowcast imported cases two weeks in the future. All details of the analysis are reported in the Appendix.","Subsequently as more data are gathered, we anticipate publishing observational studies, and eventually longer-term epidemiological studies. As per editorial policy, all submissions will be subject to peer review, but we will expedite publication and all accepted papers related to COVID-19 will be published open access free of charge in the interest of public knowledge. We believe that in taking a proactive leadership role in this crisis, the journal and the American Association for Geriatric Psychiatry (AAGP) will empower the scientific and global health community to effectively plan for the care of older adults (4), avoid the risk that this population is marginalized in policy discussions around COVID-19 (12) and generate the highest possible level of valid evidence-based data to guide the most effective care at this critical time.","The rapid spread of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) presents China with a critical challenge. As normal capacity of the Chinese hospitals is exceeded, healthcare professionals struggling to manage this unprecedented crisis face the difficult question of how best to coordinate the medical resources used in highly separated locations. Many cities in China have been imposing a lockdown, due to the high risk of infection and the characteristic of human-to-human transmission 1 . Not only have patients been marginalized, but many clinicians working in the regional hospitals have limited access to the specialist consultations and treatment guidelines they need from provincial-level hospitals to manage pneumonia cases caused by COVID-19. As long as the crisis continues, simply relying on the traditional communicative practices, such as physician office visit or face-to-face consultations within the health professional network, could pose significant costs and health concerns.","The relevant factors regarding emergence or reemergence have already altered the spread and distribution of various pathogens, and will also affect their epidemiology in the future as ecosystems continue to evolve, and new technologies enable us to identify and characterize these pathogens. Increased consumption of fish, and, in some areas, increased consumption of raw or inadequately cooked fish which is necessary for transmission; although establishment of the lifecycle in nonendemic areas is unlikely, human migration and tourism mean that infected people may live in places where the parasite is not endemic, and thus are less likely to be diagnosed due to lack of knowledge among diagnosticians-lack of diagnosis and treatment increases the risk of CCA developing; the increasing aquaculture market is also considered to be a probable route for the parasite to travel outside its endemic area Change and adaptation to change are ongoing processes and mean that we should try to stay aware of the current state of the events such that we can address not only the situation today, but also the trends in the future. With this in mind, this chapter also provides a section on mitigation approaches that should be of both relevance now, and also to safeguard future public health regarding these foodborne parasites. As well as describing parasitespecific practical interventions, the chapter concludes with drawing attention to initiatives, recent, ongoing, and recently established, which indicate how foodborne parasites, both in general and the specific parasites under discussion, are being taken seriously be several groups globally. Tackling these issues from a One Health perspective, such that human infections, animal health, and the environment are all considered to have roles, should enable us to ensure that the impacts associated with foodborne parasites, as we know them now decrease and maybe disappear entirely. Although clinical signs and symptoms of alveolar echinococcosis (AE) may take decades to appear, they are severe, with proliferation of the larval stage of the parasite, particularly within the liver, resulting in a range of symptoms similar to those associated with liver cancer, possibly spreading to other organs. Without treatment, the disease is likely to be fatal within a decade. Echinococcosis is listed on the WHO list of neglected tropical diseases (WHO, 2017), due to its association with severe morbidity and mortality in the hotspot areas where human cases occur (particularly western China, Tibet, eastern Russia, and the Near East) and also because the populations affected are often poor, pastoral communities, who may be remote from the general population in the region; thus, the disease is frequently of low priority in the region's healthcare budget. Furthermore, due to the requirement for relatively expensive equipment for detecting the disease (imaging equipment such as CT scan), the infection may easily go undiagnosed in such populations; even if diagnosed, the treatment required is long-term, which is difficult to follow-up in isolated, marginalized communities (Craig et al., 2007) . Although human infection with E. multilocularis is rare in most European countries and definitive evidence for its foodborne transmission is lacking, due to the severity of its symptoms, this parasite has nevertheless been considered to be among the most important foodborne parasites in Europe (Bouwknegt, Devleesschauwer, Graham, Robertson, &amp; van der Giessen, 2018) . Indeed, although targeted interventions have resulted in a significant decrease in the prevalence of human infection with Echinococcus granulosus (causing cystic echinococcosis (CE)) in several regions that used to be highly endemic, the same has not been achieved for E. multilocularis (Craig, Hegglin, Lightowlers, Torgerson, &amp; Wang, 2017) . This is presumably because the domestic dog-livestock cycle associated with E. granulosus is relatively easier to interrupt (by worming dogs, preventing dogs from scavenging domestic animal remains at abattoirs and in the fields, and efforts at meat inspection), than the predominantly sylvatic E. multilocularis cycle (foxes-rodents). Not only is the prevalence of E. multilocularis apparently not decreasing, but the distribution of the parasite seems to be spreading in some areas of northern Europe and it seems to be emerging, becoming identified in some areas previously not considered particularly associated with the parasite, in other regions of the world (Conraths &amp; Deplazes, 2015; Davidson, Romig, Jenkins, Tryland, &amp; Robertson, 2012; Gottstein et al., 2015; Vuitton et al., 2015) . For example, a case-finding study noted an increase in the prevalence of human AE in Switzerland over a 50-year period from 1956 to 2005, which could not be explained by improved diagnosis; the authors suggested that this change in prevalence may be associated with a rising fox population, which, in turn, is associated with a successful antirabies vaccination program (Schweiger et al., 2007) . In North America, canine infections with E. multilocularis seem to be extending beyond their \"traditional\" limits of the Arctic and north-central North America, with a few cases being identified in dogs in Ontario (Trotz-Williams et al., 2017) and a relatively high prevalence being found in urban coyotes in Calgary and Edmonton (Catalano et al., 2012) ; this indicates the potential for an elevated threat to human health in these regions of Canada, and an unprecedented cluster of human cases was diagnosed in Alberta between 2013 and 2017. The reasons for the occurrence of E. multilocularis in new regions of Canada has been considered to be not only due to the range of wild hosts (coyotes, foxes) being extended, but also the import of dogs from endemic areas, including Europe, may be partly responsible for this apparent spread (Trotz-Williams et al., 2017) . Indeed, the discovery of European haplotypes in Canadian wildlife does indicate the introduction of this parasite from Europe (Gesy &amp; Jenkins, 2015) .","Candace K. Mathiason (Department of Microbiology, Immunology and Pathology, Colorado State University, Fort Collins, CO, USA) explored the natural transience of reproductive microbiota and placental immune cell profiles on transplacental trafficking of infectious agents. Maternal infections during pregnancy induce immune factors and present infectious agents to the maternal-fetal interface. Prenatal exposures to infectious pathogens are increasingly recognized to play an important etiologic role in the development of fetal disorders with lifelong effects, i.e., zika\u2014severe brain defects including microcephaly; influenza\u2014marginalized immune responses, depression, and schizophrenia; prions\u2014asymptomatic carrier state. The hallmark of successful pregnancy includes a maternal immunological profile skewed towards an anti-inflammatory response. Disruption of microbiota has been linked to proinflammatory responses. It is known that the decidua immune cell profile and the placental microbiome community transition throughout pregnancy. Yet, the relationships between these responses and the impact their interactions have on transplacental trafficking are unknown. To investigate the role altered placental microbiome and immune responses may play in facilitating or inhibiting the transfer of infectious agents from mother to baby The Mathiason lab employ direct use of: (i) reproductive tissue (uterus, placenta, vagina) microbiome analysis; (ii) decidua/fetal membrane flow cytometric specific immune cell profile analysis; (iii) placental organotypic slice cultures and (iv) 3-D culture of primary trophoblast cells. The overarching goal of this work was to answer the question: How does the natural transience of the placental microbiome and/or immune cell profile exacerbate or hinder pathogen transfer from mother to baby, and how can we take advantage of this to better design preventative/therapeutic strategies?","The World Health Organisation estimates that: \uf0b7 14% of infected cases are severe and require hospitalisation. \uf0b7 5% of infected cases are very severe and require intensive care admission, mostly for ventilation. \uf0b7 4% of infected die. (9) Severity is associated with increasing age and co-morbidities such as chronic heart and lung disease.(9) This virus is highly contagious with an R0 of \u22653 i.e on average it appears that each case infects some 3 others. This sets off a chain reaction, in this particular case, with a doubling time of one week or less, so that populations reach 60-80% infection rates. It is naturally difficult to estimate rates as quite a few individuals are infected and remain well (especially children) but are contagious. (9) For this reason, unless large proportions of populations are tested, we cannot possibly accurately estimate the total that have actually contracted the disease. (8) J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Draconian containment measures in China have reduced new cases by more than 90%. (10) This has not been the case elsewhere, and Italy has been severely affected with the number of patients infected since February following an exponential trend.(10) Intensive care units have been overwhelmed, with the bottleneck being availability of ventilators to tide critically ill patients over their intensive care stay. (10) This had led to suggestions that multiple patients could be ventilated with one machine, effectively multiplying intensive care capacity to deal with such -surges\u2016. (11) The careful application of basic containment measures cannot be overestimated: hand washing with soap and water, avoiding touching the face and social distancingstaying home, avoiding crowds and refraining from touching one another.","There is a disproportionate number of individuals with mental and somatic illnesses among persons in detention (Bhugra, 2020; Ginn, 2012) . It is also known that infections which are transmitted human to human via droplet or close contact spread particularly well in confined spaces. Since transfer options for further treatment are more difficult (especially in detention facilities) preventive measures are strongly emphasized, particularly in the case of viral droplet infections. For example, in the context of influenza, vaccination of detainees and staff is recommended (NHS 2019) . If such options are not available, prisons and other closed facilities, like asylum centers, shelters, and closed psychiatric hospitals, pose a risk for the rapid spread of such diseases. In the past, Australia for example has described the rapid spread of influenza among prison inmates (Awofeso et al., 2001) . The Spanish flu is also reported to have affected about a quarter of all inmates; a prevalence much higher when compared to data from the general population (Finnie, Copley, Hall, &amp; Leach, 2014) . We are also currently receiving news from China, which reports a rapid spread of Covid-19 infections among prisoners from the Hubei Province. Regarding Covid-19, the spread seems to have been caused by infected security personnel importing it into detention facilities. According to the media, the Chinese government reacted to the outbreak among inmates by locking down affected prisons, suspending the transportation of goods, testing inmates who were in contact with the diagnosed wardens, and also by dismissing the prison directors and setting up a commission to analyse the spread of the virus among detained individuals (Caixing Global 2019). Correctly, there has recently been talk of a \"blind spot\" in the media regarding the spread of Covid-19 among prison inmates. (Global Times 2020) We argue that the blind spot extends further to particularly marginalized groups such as individuals using and abusing drugs and people without legal residence status, especially since these groups often overlap with individuals in detention (Liem, Wang, Wariyanti, Latkin, &amp; Hall, 2020) . Under normal circumstances, the psychological and psychiatric care of individuals in prison is already a major challenge for many health care systems; a problem that is even more evident in times of crisis, as is currently observed. The difficulties arise on different levels and affect detained individuals, security personnel, as well as medical staff alike (Chen et al., 2020) . Fears, worries, and uncertainties, especially for isolated or quarantined patients, can cause an increase in stress-related illnesses but also the exacerbation of pre-existing mental disorders (Duan &amp; Zhu, 2020) . This leads to a dilemma: the higher level of care and support that is required is contravened by recommendations that, especially under conditions of isolation, advise against the routine consultation of clinical psychologists, psychiatrists, and social workers in order to prevent the spread of infections. In this situation, medical staff, who are primarily focused on treating the infection (or complications thereof), must then additionally provide psychological care and be ready to intervene during a mental health crisis. Against this backdrop, some authors advocate for the use of online counselling tools and web platforms to support individuals in isolation and those affected (Liu et al., 2020) . Although these recommendations are directed at the general population and not at a prison population, it does not seem reasonable that such channels of care should not be used for individuals under detention as well. Other models could be envisaged, such as the provision of telephone counselling for prisoners and staff. However, for the current outbreak of Covid-19, such elements may not be implemented quickly enough. This raises the question of how to provide rational, basic psychiatric care under the current challenging conditions. We urge that governments take into account special needs of people in confined closed spaces. They must try: -Preserving continuity in provision of psychiatric and psychological care to individuals in detention is imperative and should remain so during the Covid-19 outbreak. -Early coordination between regional prison authorities, prison psychiatry, and general medical and general psychiatric care providers (e.g. in cases of referrals). This must also include close liaison with court diversion schemes, probation officers and others. Some clear guidance needs to be developed urgently regarding visitors to prisons and jails. -Given the potential shortage of time and human resources, the more severe psychiatric and psychological cases must be carefully triaged.","There is a disproportionate number of individuals with mental and somatic illnesses among persons in detention (Bhugra, 2020; Ginn, 2012) .

Sharing of accurate information without bias and panic is critical. -Ensuring the provision of masks, disinfectants and protective measures in sufficient quantity for psychological and psychiatric staff visiting individuals in detention. -Particular attention should also be paid to certify that staff deployed to provide psychological-psychiatric care in institutions are informed and/or sensitized of known potential risk factors for a more severe course of a Covid-19 infection of their own (advanced age, somatic comorbidities, chronic respiratory diseases, hypertension, cancer, known immune deficiencies etc.). Due to the currently limited understanding of Covid-19, it may be advisable to prohibit employees with such conditions from providing psychological or psychiatric care to individuals in detention and prisons. -If there is a sudden shortage of staff providing psychological and psychiatric care to detained individuals with a mental illness, staff from general psychiatry may have to fill consequential gaps. This needs careful planning on an urgent basis so that the potential of extremely long working hours of medical staff during the current outbreak can be managed successfully.","We made an effort to distribute and reach all sectors of Israel's population. The survey is distributed in 5 languages -Hebrew, Arabic, English, Russian, and Amharic to reflect and serve the diverse spoken languages of Israel's population. Although at this point we do not see an unbiased representation of the Israeli population in our responses, special efforts to reach underrepresented populations are currently done through several channels: call centers, media appearance and promotion of the survey through Arabic-speaking TV stations to gain interest and compliance in all sectors of the population.","Table 4 gives estimates of some reproductive parameters for Ethiopian camel populations in different areas. Generally, it appears that females reach puberty well ahead of their male counterparts. Age at which female and male camels achieve puberty ranges between 3.9 and 4.7 years and 5.5 and 6.5 years, respectively. The lowest and longest reported age at first calving was 4.95 and six years, respectively (Table 4). On average, female camels deliver their first offspring around five years under Ethiopian conditions. Traditionally managed bulls reach age at first service at 5.5 years and achieve full sexual maturity at seven years of age during which time they achieve the capacity to accomplish 11 services per day and also successfully breed 60 to 70 cows in a breeding season (Ahmed Shek et al. 2005a, b).","It should be observed that the three populations C, R and D are expected to level off at three different values. With respect to Eq. (3) , this simply means that one should regard \u03b2 = 0 . 928 as an average figure. In fact, each population will be characterized by slightly different value of \u03b2, which will yield considerably different plateaus, since they are all close to the singularity at \u03b2 = 1 (see again Eq. (3) ). The prediction (3) should not be regarded as the true asymptotic value to be expected at the end of the outbreak for either populations. Rather, it should be regarded as an estimate of the total population initially within the ensemble of people who will eventually get infected. In fact, the elements of the ensemble ( C, R, D ) are not independent, as people get infected, recover and die as time goes by, thus effectively transf erring elements from one population to another. We will show in the next section how this can be accounted for within a simple kinetic scheme, where eventually such interactions will cause the population of infected individuals I to die out and the R and D populations to reach two separate plateaus as observed. Furthermore, it should be noticed that the data plotted in Fig. 1 start from the first pair of successive values (P n +1 , P n ) encountered in the data sheets with P n +1 , P n &gt; 0 , consistent with the fact that P = 0 is also a (trivial) fixed point of the map (1) .","is the (which was not peer-reviewed) The copyright holder for this preprint . https://doi.org/10. 1101 of the COVID-19 epidemic in Hubei Province peaked at over 15,000 on February 12 th and became almost zero in mid-March (Xinhua, 2020) . Our simulation results indicate that the containment of this highly contagious disease was achieved by stringent control measures by the Chinese government. Without continued and aggressive control measures, the epidemic in Hubei Province would have become persistent. If the infection rate is reduced through the enhanced protective measures by 25%, the epidemic would reach the peak in mid-February and fade out in late September. Reducing the average node degree inside each city via social distancing measures, the number of infectious cases would peak at mid-February and decrease to zero at mid-June. Only with combined implementation of enhanced protective measures and social distancing measures, the epidemic dynamics would peak at around mid-February and approximate the actual epidemic trajectory in March. This can be an important message for countries going through the exponential growth of the epidemic in the current days.","China is the most populous country in the world, with1.3 billion people on land of 9.6 million square kilometers -approximately 20% of the total world population living on 6.7% of the world land. The average population density is 130 people per square kilometer, with an uneven distribution of over 400 in the eastern coastal region, 200 in the central region, and less than 10 in the western region. 42 About 16 million babies are born every year; the population is still increasing annually by 0.57% and will reach 1.5 billion by 2033. 43 The increased susceptible population will increase the potential for disease transmission, and increased population density can directly contribute to the spread of respiratory diseases, as occurred in the SARS outbreak in 2003. 44 The number of older people is also growing in China. The percentage of the population aged over 60 years is now about 10%, and will reach 14.8% in 2015, i.e. up to 200 million. Aging is related to an increased susceptibility to some zoonotic diseases; the incidence of active pulmonary tuberculosis in individuals aged over 60 years is three times the average incidence in China. 45 In addition, the incidence of malignant tumors increases with age, and those populations receiving immunosuppressive therapy are susceptible to opportunistic pathogens. For example, Toxoplasma gondii is an important opportunistic pathogen associated with malignant disorders and HIV patients. 46, 47 ","In the midst of so much confusion, is it possible to reach any conclusions on asthma and allergy prevention which are applicable to the here and now? Will we have to change the way we lead our lives? It is obvious, and no one would say otherwise, that it is not possible or desirable to turn back the clock on advances in quality of life which hygiene measures have brought to populations. This is of course not a defence of those urging an obsessively sterile lifestyle, which is sometimes advocated by pressure groups with financial interests in those areas. But this is already calling into question advice to which we have all been privy, and which is sometimes taken too much to heart by parents of allergic and/or asthmatic children, or children at risk of these diseases, to keep the house clean and avoid animals in early life.

Will we have to change the way we lead our lives? It is obvious, and no one would say otherwise, that it is not possible or desirable to turn back the clock on advances in quality of life which hygiene measures have brought to populations. This is of course not a defence of those urging an obsessively sterile lifestyle, which is sometimes advocated by pressure groups with financial interests in those areas. But this is already calling into question advice to which we have all been privy, and which is sometimes taken too much to heart by parents of allergic and/or asthmatic children, or children at risk of these diseases, to keep the house clean and avoid animals in early life.

Seroconversion rates increase sharply when monkeys reach the age of sexual maturity, with prevalence rates of 80-100% in adult populations (Weigler, 1992; Weigler et al., 1993) . There is no evidence for vertical transmission of BV.","In Scenario 2, the basic SEIR results showed that the confirmed cases will take 9-22 months (275-650 days) to reach the peak and most of the population would eventually be infected in a long period if there are no any control measures. Appendix C lists the detail results of basic SEIR model predictions of different countries. In addition, the active number of cases at the peak time will reach to around 10-20% of these countries' population, overloading the healthcare system, which is the worst scenario, as shown in Table 2 .",".

The impact of the threshold is qualitatively similar. Typically, as in the case of a single population, there seems to be a clear optimal threshold value which leads to the smallest final epidemic size. Applying the control too early or too late leads to higher attack rates. Fixing the threshold value and increasing the duration of control, see Figure 5 (a), or the efficacy of control [ Figure 5 (d)]leads to smaller attack rates. Both these effects are nullified if the intervention is too early or too late. The impact of the intervention based on the global level of (I + R)(t) [see figure 5 (b,e)] or on the first sub-population to reach a threshold [see figure 5 (c,f)] are similar, but qualitatively different compared to the individually-targeted intervention. First of all, there a is a monotonic but slow decrease in the attack rate with increasing values of the threshold, duration of control and efficacy. However, the decrease is modest and this is due to the fact that when control is deployed the epidemics in some sub-populations may have effectively 12 .

The situation is very similar when control is based on the first population to reach a threshold, see figure 5 (c,f). Finally, it is clear that the biggest impact on the attack rate still comes from the value of the threshold. Larger values of the threshold mean that control is more likely to hit more of the individual epidemics as they become established at different times. The duration of control and its efficacy only really matter at lower values.","All continents reported confirmed cases of COVID-19. Africa confirmed its first case in Egypt on Feb 14, 2020. China is Africa's leading commercial part ner; thus, there are large travel volumes through which severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 could reach the continent. Several measures have already been implemented to prevent and control possible case importations from China; 3,4 however, the ability to limit and control local transmission after importation depends on the application and execution of strict measures of detection, prevention, and control. These measures include heightened surveillance and rapid identification of suspected cases, followed by patient transfer and isolation, rapid diagnosis, tracing, and follow-up of potential contacts. 1 The application of such a vast technical and operational set of interventions depends on each country's public health and laboratory infrastructures and resources.","In this work, we apply the model to study the COVID-19 spreading progression in Japan and the USA. Data of confirmed and recovered cases in 47 Japanese prefectures or regions (January 15 to March 20, 2020) and 51 states in the USA including Washington DC (February 20 to March 20, 2020) are used for fitting with the model and retrieval of parameter values. The parameters found are then adjusted to produce future progression trajectories corresponding to the implementation of different levels of active intervention. From the set of best-fit parameters, we reveal that the actual number of infected individuals could be up to 20-fold and 5-fold as many as the confirmed numbers in Japan and the USA, respectively, as of March 19, 2020. Furthermore, if the level of active intervention is kept unchanged, the percentage of population eventually infected in Osaka-fu and Tokyo-to will reach around 12% and 4.2% of the population (around 2,300,000 and 600,000 people), respectively, and in total, Japan will have about 6.55% of its population eventually infected. However, implementing a four-fold elevated active intervention will improve the situation substantially, with the percentage of population infected in Osaka-fu and Tokyo-to reduced to 4.2% and 2.3%, respectively, and over 75% reduction in the overall number of infected cases in Japan. Our results for the USA also show a rather detrimental situation if the level of active intervention remains at the status quo in the coming months, with California and New York state having around 15% and 37.5% of their population (5,800,000 and 7,300,000 people) eventually infected, respectively, and the overall infected population will reach 18.2%. However, by implementing four-fold elevated active intervention, the percentage of infected population in the USA can be reduced to 9.3%. Furthermore, the effectiveness of the public in exercising protective measures can be assessed by varying the infection rates in the model, and it is found that active government intervention is more effective for Japan, while exercising protective measures by the public is more important for the USA. With the public raising its level of vigilance in exercising strict protective measures and the government drastically elevating its active intervention, the percentage of population getting infected can be reduced to 0.23% in Japan and 2.7% in the USA.","The National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China (NHC) and The Center for Disease Control and Prevention of China (CDC) have publicly shared detailed epidemiological information about COVID-19 every day since January 20, 2020.(7, 8) Based on the information and published studies about COVID-19, many scholars have expressed different opinions on the effect of these measures and the trend of this epidemic. Michael Levitt, a professor of Stanford University, speculated that since January 25, 2020, the national death toll and the death toll in Hubei province showed a monotonous declining trend. The external linear correlation suggests that the number of new deaths in the coming week will decline rapidly, leading to the conclusion that the epidemic would terminate soon. (9) However, there are many other different opinions. The University of Lancaster, the University of Florida, and the Centre for Viral Research at the University of Glasgow carried out modeling analysis based on the data before January 21, 2020. They estimated that the number of infected individuals may be as high as 14464 cases on January 22, 2020 in Wuhan. If there were no effective measures, the total number of infection cases would reach as high as 105077 on January 29, 2020.(10) A team of researchers from Xi'an Jiaotong University in China and York University in Canada worked together to build a more realistic Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered (SEIR) model, and the novel coronavirus infection could reach an inflection point on March 10, 2020.(11) Big gaps existed between different predictions. Which one is identical with the actual situation? In addition, being the eye of the storm, Wuhan city and Hubei Province show a different situation compared to that in the other provinces in China. Therefore, we compared the data of different places to predict the trend of this epidemic in China.","We know that epidemic control at different times (such as closing city) will have an important impact on the spread of the epidemic, obviously the earlier the better. Combined with the actual situation of Wuhan's closure from January 23, we simulated the comparison of the spread of the epidemic situation on January 18 and January 28, as shown in Figure 5 . The red curve and the orange curve in the figure respectively represent the official curve and the simulation curve (when the \"cities were closed\" measures were taken on January 23). Obviously, the two curves match well, and the simulated final number of infected people is 69000, which is also close to the actual situation. If the control is started five days in advance, that is, on January 18, the blue line shows that the number of infected people is about 28000, which is 0.42 times of the number of confirmed cases. If the measures are delayed for 5 days, it can be seen from the yellow line that the number of people will be as high as 156000, about 2.26 times of the current number of patients. Zhong Nanshan's team once predicted that if the closure measures were delayed for five days, the number of patients would reach three times of the current number, i.e. 210000 [5] . Our results are more optimistic. It can be seen from this figure that it is necessary to take timely measures to control the spread of the epidemic, which can also be used as a reference for some overseas countries.

Infectious disease refers to that, after being infected by the pathogenic microorganisms, the human bodies produce infectious factors that can cause epidemic diseases under certain conditions. Viruses, bacteria, fungi, and mycoplasma can cause infectious diseases, but the spread of infectious diseases need to meet three conditions: there must be a source of infection, a path of transmission, and susceptible populations. Source of infection refers to human or animals, which already have the growth and reproduction of the pathogen in their body and have been able to excrete the pathogen in certain ways. This includes a patient and a human or animal that carries the pathogen. The way that pathogens leave the source of infection and then reach another susceptible object is known as the route of transmission, including the transmission through respiratory tract (droplets), digestive tract, insect-borne, blood and other body fluids. People who suffer from a specific immune deficiency toward a certain disease are known as susceptible populations. The spread of infectious disease must meet the three prerequisites mentioned above at the same time.1 In addition to the three basic conditions, there are other factors that will affect the spread of infectious diseases, including natural factors and social factors. Natural factors mainly refer to the temperature, humidity, ecological conditions, animals and plants. Different pathogens have different growth and reproduction in different environment. Their capabilities to adapt to temperature and humidity, and their pH tolerance also vary. Social factors include population density, life habits, economic status and communication degree. First discovered in Guangdong, China, in 2002, the \u201cSevere Acute Respiratory Syndrome\u201d virus (SARS-CoV) is currently considered to spread across species lines from civet cats to human bodies. Nevertheless, we cannot deny that there is a link between the spread of the disease and the local eating habits. Historically, it will take months for worldwide pandemic disease to spread to different countries. However, nowadays, with the advanced aviation industry, the virus can spread from Asia to the Americas overnight, and soon causes worldwide epidemic diseases.","The HCoV-229E, -OC43, -NL63 and -HKU1 strains all present a worldwide distribution and genetic variability, as they exist in different genotypes (Dominguez et al., 2012; Gerna et al., 2006; Lau et al., 2011; Vabret et al., 2006; Vijgen et al., 2005; Woo et al., 2006) . These four strains are endemic in humans and infections mainly occurs in winter and early spring (Cabeca et al., 2013; Gaunt et al., 2010; Larson et al., 1980; Myint, 1995) , in different parts of the world (Chiu et al., 2005; Mackay et al., 2012; Theamboonlers et al., 2007; Vabret et al., 2009 ). Most of the times, they infect the upper respiratory tract, where they are mainly associated with rhinitis, laryngitis or otitis but, as opportunistic pathogens, in more vulnerable populations such as newborns, infants, the elderly and immune-compromised individuals, they can also reach the lower respiratory tract, where they could instead be associated with bronchitis, bronchiolitis, pneumonia, exacerbations of asthma, respiratory distress syndrome (Talbot et al., 2008; Vabret et al., 2009) .","The study provides a deterministic mathematical model to analyse and predict characteristics of an infectious disease spreading in an extremely large population with strong prevention and control measures. The model depends purely on statistic data of categorised epidemic cases reported in public. We apply the model to the emergence of COVID-19 in China. Although the model is not yet perfect, it is effective, robust and consistent as long as there is no sudden change in control measures. Comparing with the classic SIR model, we extract the basic reproduction number, R 0 , and make predictions on the time when the effective reproduction number will become less than one and on the total number of confirmed cases in the end. Our study indicates that it is essential to take effective control measures as early as possible for curbing an infectious disease and it is important to report epidemic data precisely and timely for epidemiological modelling. In the era of globalisation, an infectious disease can spread as far as any individual can reach on the earth, that makes the whole world population to be susceptible. As COVID-19 has spread around the world, we anticipate our method can be adapted in modelling the spread and help public health authorities make policy decisions.","Although rates of tuberculosis cases in the USA are at record lows (less than 10 000 new cases were reported in 2012), the disease continues to disproportionately aff ect people born outside the USA and racial and ethnic minorities. 116 Outbreaks also occur in hard-to-reach populations, such as drug users and the homeless. 117, 118 Diagnosis and management of the 11 million people in the USA with latent tuberculosis infection is a challenge but is essential since most active disease results from such infections. 119, 120 Key strategies include targeted testing and treatment and engagement of medical providers outside of public health departments. 119 Although more pressing globally, management of tuberculosis and HIV co-infection and surveillance for drug resistance are important components of tuberculosis control eff orts in the USA. 116, 121 Multidrug-resistant (MDR) and extensively drug-resistant strains continue to challenge elimination goals for tuberculosis, and fi rst-generation and second-generation antituberculosis drug shortages have occurred. The FDA accelerated approval of bedaquiline, a novel drug for the treatment of pulmonary MDR tuberculosis. 122"],"title":["Progress towards Health for All: Time to End Discrimination and

In addition, due to the long incubation period for most foodborne parasites, source attribution is often difficult, if not impossible. However, global trends have enabled foodborne parasites to emerge in different populations in new locations, transmitted through different food types, and sometimes with unexpected symptoms. This emergence of foodborne parasites has brought them into focus. In this chapter, six foodborne parasites are used as examples on emergence: Echinococcus multilocularis is spreading to new locations; Cryptosporidium spp. are beginning to be associated not only with water, but also with salads; Trypanosoma cruzi is being manifest with acute disease due to foodborne transmission, particularly transmitted with juices; Trichinella spp. ha...","An outbreak of clusters of viral pneumonia due to a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV/SARS-CoV-2) happened in Wuhan, Hubei Province in China in December 2019. Since the outbreak, several groups reported estimated R0 of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) and generated valuable prediction for the early phase of this outbreak. After implementation of strict prevention and control measures in China, new estimation is needed. An infectious disease dynamics SEIR (Susceptible, Exposed, Infectious, and Removed) model was applied to estimate the epidemic trend in Wuhan, China under two assumptions of Rt. In the first assumption, Rt was assumed to maintain over 1. The estimated number of infections would continue to increase throughout February without any indication of dropping with Rt = 1.9, 2.6, or 3.1. The number of infections would reach 11,044, 70,258, and 227,989, respectively, by 29 February 2020.

In Europe, the situation of Italy first and later Spain has generated great concern, and despite other countries show better prospects, large uncertainties yet remain on the future evolution and the efficacy of containment, mitigation or attack strategies. Here we applied a modified SEIR compartmental model accounting for the spread of infection during the latent period, in which we also incorporate effects of varying proportions of containment. We fit data to quarantined populations in order to account for the uncertainties in case reporting and study the scenario projections for the 17 individual regions (CCAA). Results indicate that with data for March 23, the epidemics follows an evolution similar to the isolation of 1.5 percent of the population and if there were no effects of intervention actions it might reach a maximum over 1.4M infected around A...","BACKGROUND The outbreak of the new coronavirus infection in Wuhan City, Hubei Province in December 2019, poses a huge threat to China and even global public health security. Respiratory droplets and contact transmission are the main routes of transmission of new coronaviruses. Compared with SARS and Ebola viruses, new coronavirus infections are infectious during the incubation period. Traditional SEIR (susceptibility-exposure-infection-Removal) There are some differences in conditions for the prediction of the epidemic trend of new coronavirus infection. The outbreak of the new coronavirus infection coincided with the Spring Festival before and after the Chinese Spring Festival.It is necessary to make appropriate optimization and amendments to the traditional model to meet the actual evolution of the epidemic situation. METHODS The traditional SEIR model assumes that the virus-infected person is not infectious during the incubation period and that the infected person did not take isola...","By proposing a varying coefficient Susceptible-Infected-Removal model (vSIR), we track the epidemic of COVID-19 in 30 provinces in China and 15 cities in Hubei province, the epicenter of the outbreak. It is found that the spread of COVID-19 has been significantly slowing down within the two weeks from January 27 to February 10th with 87.0% and 84.3% reductions in the reproduction number R0 among the 30 provinces and 15 Hubei cities, respectively. This suggests the extreme control measures implemented since January 23, which include cutting off Wuhan and many other cities and towns, a great public awareness and high level of self isolation at home, have contributed to a substantial decline in the reproductivity of the COVID-19 in China. We predict that Hubei province will reach its peak between February 20 and 22, 2020, and if the removal rate can be increased to 0.1, the epidemic outside Hubei province will end in May 2020, and inside Hubei in early June.","Background: After the outbreak of novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) starting in late 2019, a number of researchers have reported the predicted the virus transmission dynamics. However, under the strict control policy the novel coronavirus does not spread naturally outside Hubei Province, and none of the prediction closes to the real situation. Methods and findings: We used the traditional SEIR model, fully estimated the effect of control measures, to predict the virus transmission in Wuhan, the capital city of Hubei Province, and Beijing. We forecast that the outbreak of 2019-nCoV would reach its peak around March 6\u00b110 in Wuhan and March 20\u00b116 in Beijing, respectively. The infectious population in Beijing would be much less (only 0.3%) than those in Wuhan at the peak of this transmission wave. The number of confirmed cases in cities inside Hubei Province grow exponentially, whereas those in cities outside the province increase linearly. Conclusions: The unprecedented province lockdown subs...","Background: Although the COVID-19 has been well controlled in China, it is rapidly spreading outside China that may lead to catastrophic results globally without implementation of necessary mitigation measures. Because the COVID-19 outbreak has made comprehensive and profound impacts on the world, an accurate prediction of its epidemic trend is significant. Although many studies have predicted the COVID-19 epidemic trend, most of these studies have used the early stage data and focused on the China cases. Methods: We predicted the COVID-19 epidemic trend in China and across the world using the machine learning approach. We first built the models for predicting the daily numbers of cumulative confirmed cases (CCCs), new cases (NCs), and death cases (DCs) of COVID-19 in China based on the data from Jan 20, 2020, to Mar 1, 2020. Furthermore, we built the models, derived from the models for the China cases, for predicting the epidemic trend across the world (outside China). Findings: The C...","COVID-19 is spreading really fast around the world. The current study describes the situation of the outbreak of this disease in India and predicts the number of cases expected to rise in India. The study also discusses the regional analysis of Indian states and presents the preparedness level of India in combating this outbreak. The study uses exploratory data analysis to report the current situation and uses time-series forecasting methods to predict the future trends. The data has been considered from the repository of John Hopkins University and covers up the time period from 30th January 2020 when the first case occurred in India till the end of 24th March 2020 when the Prime Minister of India declared a complete lockdown in the country for 21 days starting 25th March 2020. The major findings show that number of infected cases in India is rising quickly with the average infected cases per day rising from 10 to 73 from the first case to the 300th case. The current mortality rate fo...","The purpose of this article is to reach all those who find it difficult to become well informed about the repercussions of a lockdown strategy to tackle the COVID-19 pandemic and to spark discussion and thought. Here we use simple stochastic simulations to evaluate different approaches taken to tackle the crisis, along with the efficiency they will hold and the number of casualties they may incur. It is clear that the less strict the social distancing the more time it will take for life to return to normal, and the more lives will be at risk. This is shown through simulations formed by an open sourced code, which allows evaluation of the outcomes from different intervention scenarios or conditions.","On the basis of a semi-realistic SIR microsimulation for Germany and Poland, we show that the R0 parameter interval for which the COVID-19 epidemic stays overcritical but below the capacity limit of the health care system to reach herd immunity is so narrow that a successful implementation of this strategy is likely to fail. Our microsimulation is based on official census data and involves household composition and age distribution as the main population structure variables. Outside household contacts are characterised by an out-reproduction number R* which is the only free parameter of the model. For a subcritical domain we compute the time till extinction and prevalence as a function of the initial number of infected individuals and R*. For the Polish city of Wroclaw we also discuss the combined impact of testing coverage and contact reduction. For both countries we estimate R* for disease progression until 20th of March 2020.","Practical relevance Blood transfusions are a potentially life-saving procedure that are within the reach of most small animal practitioners. Only minimal equipment is required. Patient group Any cat with clinical signs attributable to a reduced red blood cell mass that is affecting oxygen transport (as a result of reduced packed cell volume or acute blood loss) is a potential candidate for a transfusion. Clinical challenges Although the principles of transfusion medicine are not complicated, there can be fatal consequences if certain steps are omitted. Diagnostics Blood typing kits and blood filters are readily available from veterinary wholesalers, laboratories and blood banking services. Evidence base Over the past three decades, a substantial body of clinical research and reports has built up covering feline blood types and transfusion medicine. This article draws on that research to provide clinical guidance aimed at all veterinarians in feline or small animal practice who either c...","Most pathogens initiate their infections at the human mucosal surface. Therefore, mucosal vaccination, especially through oral or intranasal administration routes, is highly desired for infectious diseases. Meanwhile, protein-based antigens provide a safer alternative to the whole pathogen or DNA based ones in vaccine development. However, the unique biopharmaceutical hurdles that intranasally or orally delivered protein vaccines need to overcome before they reach the sites of targeting, the relatively low immunogenicity, as well as the low stability of the protein antigens, require thoughtful and fine-tuned mucosal vaccine formulations, including the selection of immunostimulants, the identification of the suitable vaccine delivery system, and the determination of the exact composition and manufacturing conditions. This review aims to provide an up-to-date survey of the protein antigen-based vaccine formulation development, including the usage of immunostimulants and the optimization ...","Abstract Mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) is a pH-dependent virus that uses mouse transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1) for entry into cells. Previous studies demonstrated that MMTV could induce pH 5-dependent fusion-from-with of mouse cells. Here we show that the MMTV envelope-mediated cell\u2013cell fusion requires both the entry receptor and low pH (pH 5). Although expression of the MMTV envelope and TfR1 was sufficient to mediate low pH-dependent syncytia formation, virus infection required trafficking to a low pH compartment; infection was independent of cathepsin-mediated proteolysis. Human TfR1 did not support virus infection, although envelope-mediated syncytia formation occurred with human cells after pH 5 treatment and this fusion depended on TfR1 expression. However, although the MMTV envelope bound human TfR1, virus was only internalized and trafficked to a low pH compartment in cells expressing mouse TfR1. Thus, while human TfR1 supported cell\u2013cell fusion, because it was not internaliz...","Background Since December 2019, pneumonia associated with the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) has emerged in Wuhan, China. The exponential increase of the confirmed number of cases of 2019n-CoV is of great concern to the global community. The fears and panic among residents in the epicenters have prompted diverse responses, which are understudied. During such a crisis, community trust and support for the government and health authorities are important to contain the outbreak. We aimed to investigate the influence of institutional trust on public responses to the 2019-nCoV outbreak. Methods An anonymous Internet-based, cross-sectional survey was administered on January 29, 2020. The study population comprised all residents currently residing or working in the province of Hubei, where Wuhan is the capital city. The level of trust in information provision and preventive instructions, individual preventive behaviors and treatment-seeking behaviors were queried. Findings The majority of ...","The ongoing COVID-19 outbreak has expanded rapidly throughout China. Major behavioral, clinical, and state interventions are underway currently to mitigate the epidemic and prevent the persistence of the virus in human populations in China and worldwide. It remains unclear how these unprecedented interventions, including travel restrictions, have affected COVID-19 spread in China. We use real-time mobility data from Wuhan and detailed case data including travel history to elucidate the role of case importation on transmission in cities across China and ascertain the impact of control measures. Early on, the spatial distribution of COVID-19 cases in China was well explained by human mobility data. Following the implementation of control measures, this correlation dropped and growth rates became negative in most locations, although shifts in the demographics of reported cases are still indicative of local chains of transmission outside Wuhan. This study shows that the drastic control mea...","Recent outbreak of 2019-nCoV in Wuhan raised serious public health concerns. By February 15, 2020 in Wuhan, the total number of confirmed infection cases has reached 37,914, and the number of deaths has reached 1123, accounting for 56.9% of the total confirmed cases and 73.7% of the total deaths in China. People are eager to know when the epidemic will be completely controlled and when people's work and life will be on the right track. In this study we analyzed the epidemic dynamics and trend of 2019-nCoV in Wuhan by using the data after the closure of Wuhan city till February 12, 2020 based on the SEIR modeling method. The optimal parameters were estimated as R0=1.44 (interquartile range: 1.40-1.47)\uff0cTI=14 (interquartile range: 14-14) and TE=3.0 (interquartile range: 2.8-3.1). Based on these parameters, the number of infected individuals in Wuhan city may reach the peak around February 19 at about 45,000 people. Once entering March, the epidemic would gradually decline, and end around ...","Italy recorded its first case of confirmed acute respiratory illness because of coronavirus on February 18, 2020, soon after the initial reports in China. Since that time, Italy and nations throughout the world have adopted very stringent and severe measures to protect populations from spread of infection. Despite these measures, the number of infected people is growing exponentially, with a significant number of patients developing acute respiratory insufficiency. Endoscopy departments face significant risk for diffusion of respiratory diseases that can be spread via an airborne route, including aspiration of oral and fecal material via endoscopes. The purpose of this article is to discuss the measures, with specific focus on personal protection equipment and dress code modalities, implemented in our hospital to prevent further dissemination of COVID-19 infection.","Background: During the first week of March, the surge of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases reached over 100 countries with more than 100,000 cases. Healthcare authorities have already initiated awareness and preparedness activities beyond borders. A poor understanding of the disease among healthcare workers (HCWs) may result in delayed treatment and the rapid spread of infection. This study aimed to investigate the knowledge and perceptions of HCWs about COVID-19. Methods: A cross-sectional, web-based study was conducted among HCWs about COVID-19 during the first week of March 2020. A 23-item survey instrument was developed and distributed randomly to HCWs using social media; it required 5 minutes to complete. A chi-square test was used to investigate the level of association among variables at the significance level of p&lt;0.05. Results: Of 529 participants, a total of 453 HCWs completed the survey (response rate: 85.6%); 51.6% were males, 32.1% were aged 25-34 years, and most w...","Objective: To evaluate the spectrum of comorbidities and its impact on the clinical outcome in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Design: Retrospective case studies Setting: 575 hospitals in 31 province/autonomous regions/provincial municipalities across China Participants: 1,590 laboratory-confirmed hospitalized patients. Data were collected from November 21st, 2019 to January 31st, 2020. Main outcomes and measures: Epidemiological and clinical variables (in particular, comorbidities) were extracted from medical charts. The disease severity was categorized based on the American Thoracic Society guidelines for community-acquired pneumonia. The primary endpoint was the composite endpoints, which consisted of the admission to intensive care unit (ICU), or invasive ventilation, or death. The risk of reaching to the composite endpoints was compared among patients with COVID-19 according to the presence and number of comorbidities. Results: Of the 1,590 cases, the mean age w...","Background Paper-based diaries and self-report of symptom worsening in COPD may lead to underdetection of exacerbations. Epidemiologically, COPD exacerbations exhibit seasonal patterns peaking at year-end. We examined whether the use of a BlackBerry-based daily symptom diary would detect 95% or more of exacerbations and enable characterization of seasonal differences among them. Methods Fifty participants with GOLD (Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease) stage I to IV COPD began a community-based study in December 2007. Another 30 began in December 2008. Participants transmitted daily symptom diaries using a BlackBerry. Alerts were triggered when symptom changes, missed diary transmissions, or medical care for a respiratory problem occurred. Participant encounters were initiated if COPD exacerbations were suspected. Participants used their BlackBerrys to report returns to normal breathing. Results Participants transmitted 99.9% of 28,514 possible daily diaries. All 191...","Bats and rodents are being increasingly recognized as reservoirs of emerging zoonotic viruses. Various studies have investigated bat viruses in tropical regions, but to date there are no data regarding viruses with zoonotic potential that circulate in bat and rat populations in Viet Nam. To address this paucity of data, we sampled three bat farms and three wet markets trading in rat meat in the Mekong Delta region of southern Viet Nam. Faecal and urine samples were screened for the presence of RNA from paramyxoviruses, coronaviruses and filoviruses. Paramyxovirus RNA was detected in 4 of 248 (1%) and 11 of 222 (4.9%) bat faecal and urine samples, respectively. Coronavirus RNA was detected in 55 of 248 (22%) of bat faecal samples; filovirus RNA was not detected in any of the bat samples. Further, coronavirus RNA was detected in 12 of 270 (4.4%) of rat faecal samples; all samples tested negative for paramyxovirus. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the bat paramyxoviruses and bat and ra...","Background: The 2019 Coronavirus (COVID-19) has turned into a global pandemic with unprecedented challenges for the global community. Understanding the state of the disease and planning for future trajectories relies heavily on data on the spread and mortality. Yet official data coming from various countries are highly unreliable: symptoms similar to common cold in majority of cases and limited screening resources and delayed testing procedures may contribute to under-estimation of the burden of disease. Anecdotal and more limited data are available, but few have systematically combined those with official statistics into a coherent view of the epidemic. This study is a modeling-in-real-time of the emerging outbreak for understanding the state of the disease. Our focus is on the case of the spread of disease in Iran, as one of the epicenters of the disease in the first months of 2020. Method: We develop a simple dynamic model of the epidemic to provide a more reliable picture of the st...","We are proposing to use machine learning algorithms to be able to improve possible case identifications of COVID-19 more quicker when we use a mobile phone-based web survey. This will also reduce the spread in the susceptible populations.","The COVID-19 pandemic has shown a markedly low proportion of cases among children. Age disparities in observed cases could be explained by assortative mixing patterns and reactive school closures which decrease mixing between children, or by children exhibiting lower susceptibility to infection, or by children having a lower propensity to show clinical symptoms. We formally test these hypotheses by fitting an age-structured mathematical model to epidemic data from six countries, finding strong age dependence in the probability of developing clinical symptoms, rising from around 20% in under 10s to over 70% in older adults. We find that interventions aimed at halting transmission in children may have minimal effects on preventing cases depending on the relative transmissibility of subclinical infections. Our estimated age-specific clinical fraction has implications for the expected global burden of clinical cases because of demographic differences across settings. In younger populations...","Backgrounds Up to February 16, 2020, 355 cases have been confirmed as having COVID-19 infection on the Diamond Princess cruise ship. It is of crucial importance to estimate the reproductive number (R0) of the novel virus in the early stage of outbreak and make a prediction of daily new cases on the ship. Method We fitted the reported serial interval (Mean and standard deviation) with a gamma distribution and applied \u201cearlyR\u201d package in R to estimate the R0 in the early stage of COVID-19 outbreak. We applied \u201cprojections\u201d package in R to simulate the plausible cumulative epidemic trajectories and future daily incidence by fitting the data of existing daily incidence, a serial interval distribution, and the estimated R0 into a model based on the assumption that daily incidence obeys approximately Poisson distribution determined by daily infectiousness. Results The Maximum-Likelihood (ML) value of R0 was 2.28 for COVID-19 outbreak at early stage on the ship. The median with 95% confidence...","Zoonotic transmission of novel viruses represents a significant threat to global public health and is fueled by globalization, the loss of natural habitats, and exposure to new hosts. For coronaviruses (CoVs), broad diversity exists within bat populations and uniquely positions them to seed future emergence events. In this review, we explore the host and viral dynamics that shape these CoV populations for survival, amplification, and possible emergence in novel hosts.","What has happened in China shows that quarantine, social distancing, and isolation of infected populations can contain the epidemic.1 This impact of the COVID-19 response in China is encouraging for the many countries where COVID-19 is beginning to spread. However, it is unclear whether other countries can implement the stringent measures China eventually adopted. Singapore and Hong Kong, both of which had severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemics in 2002\u201303, provide hope and many lessons to other countries. In both places, COVID-19 has been managed well to date, despite early cases, by early government action and through social distancing measures taken by individuals. The course of an epidemic is defined by a series of key factors, some of which are poorly understood at present for COVID-19. The basic reproduction number (R0), which defines the mean number of secondary cases generated by one primary case when the population is largely susceptible to infection, determines the...","Problem: Due to the spread of SARS CoV-2 virus infection and COVID-2019 disease, there is an urgent need to analyze COVID-2019 epidemic perception in Poland. This would enable authorities for preparation of specific actions minimizing public health and economic risks. Methods: We study the perception of COVID-2019 epidemic in Polish society using quantitative analysis of its digital footprints on the Internet (on Twitter, Google, YouTube, Wikipedia and electronic media represented by Event Registry) from January 2020 to 12.03.2020 (before and after official introduction to Poland on 04.03.2020). To this end we utilize data mining, social network analysis, natural language processing techniques. Each examined internet platform was analyzed for representativeness and composition of the target group. Results: We identified three major cluster of the interest before disease introduction on the topic COVID-2019: China- and Italy-related peaks on all platforms, as well as a peak on social me...","Since the first suspected case of coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) on December 1st, 2019, in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, a total of 40,235 confirmed cases and 909 deaths have been reported in China up to February 10, 2020, evoking fear locally and internationally. Here, based on the publicly available epidemiological data for Hubei, China from January 11 to February 10, 2020, we provide estimates of the main epidemiological parameters. In particular, we provide an estimation of the case fatality and case recovery ratios, along with their 90% confidence intervals as the outbreak evolves. On the basis of a Susceptible-Infected-Recovered-Dead (SIDR) model, we provide estimations of the basic reproduction number (R0), and the per day infection mortality and recovery rates. By calibrating the parameters of the SIRD model to the reported data, we also attempt to forecast the evolution of the of the outbreak at the epicenter three weeks ahead, i.e. until February 29. As the number of inf...","This paper focuses on the formulation of a deterministic 2019-nCov transmission model by considering the exposed and recovered populations with immunity. The scenario of the simulation is depicted based on the patient zero in Malaysia. The transmission model is found to be able to predict the next confirmed case given a single case introduced in a fully susceptible population. The mathematical model is developed based on the SEIR model which has susceptible, exposed, infectious and recovered populations. The system of equations which were obtained were solved numerically and the simulation results were analyzed. The analysis includes the impact of the disease if no control is taken.","Middle East Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is a novel coronavirus discovered in 2012 and is responsible for acute respiratory syndrome in humans. Though not confirmed yet, multiple surveillance and phylogenetic studies suggest a bat origin. The disease is heavily endemic in dromedary camel populations of East Africa and the Middle East. It is unclear as to when the virus was introduced to dromedary camels, but data from studies that investigated stored dromedary camel sera and geographical distribution of involved dromedary camel populations suggested that the virus was present in dromedary camels several decades ago. Though bats and alpacas can serve as potential reservoirs for MERS-CoV, dromedary camels seem to be the only animal host responsible for the spill over human infections.","Background: The novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic is driving many countries to adopt global isolation measures in an attempt to slow-down its spread. These extreme measures are associated with extraordinary economic costs. Objective: To compare the cost-effectiveness of global isolation of the whole population to focused isolation of individuals at high risk of being exposed, augmented by thorough PCR testing. Design: We applied a modified Susceptible, Exposed, Infectious, Removed (SEIR) model to compare two different strategies in controlling the SARS-CoV-2 spread. Data sources and target population: We modeled the dynamics in Israel, a small country with ~ 9 million people. Time horizon: 200 days. Interventions: 1. Global isolation of the whole population (strategy 1) 2. Focused isolation of people at high risk of exposure with extensive PCR testing (strategy 2). Outcome measures: Number of deaths and the cost per one avoided death in strategy 1 vs 2. Results of Base-Case analy...","Background: Since pneumonia caused by coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) broke out in Wuhan, Hubei province, China, tremendous infected cases has risen all over the world attributed to high transmissibility. We managed to mathematically forecast the inflection point (IFP) of new cases in South Korea, Italy, and Iran, utilizing the transcendental model from Hubei and non-Hubei in China. Methods: We extracted data from reports released by the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China (Dec 31, 2019 to Mar 5, 2020) and World Health Organization (Jan 20, 2020 to Mar 5, 2020) as the training set to deduce the arrival of the IFP of new cases in Hubei and non-Hubei on subsequent days and the data from Mar 6 to Mar 9 as validation set. New close contacts, newly confirmed cases, cumulative confirmed cases, non-severe cases, severe cases, critical cases, cured cases, and death data were collected and analyzed. Using this state transition matrix model, the horizon of the IFP of...","Background: Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID19) is currently a global public health threat. Outside of China, Italy is one of the most suffering countries with the COVID19 epidemic. It is important to predict the epidemics trend of COVID19 epidemic in Italy to help develop public health strategies. Methods: We used time series data of COVID 19 from Jan 22,2020 to Mar 16,2020. An infectious disease dynamic extended susceptible infected removed (eSIR) model, which covers the effects of different intervention measures in dissimilar periods, was applied to estimate the epidemic trend in Italy. The basic reproductive number was estimated using Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods and presented using the resulting posterior mean and 95% credible interval (CI). Hunan, with similar total number of populations in Italy, was used as a comparative item. Results: In the eSIR model, we estimated that the basic reproductive number for COVID 19 was respectively 4.10 (95% CI: 2.15 to 6.77) in Italy and 3.1...","The Brighton Collaboration Viral Vector Vaccines Safety Working Group (V3SWG) was formed to evaluate the safety and characteristics of live, recombinant viral vector vaccines. A recent publication by the V3SWG described live, attenuated, recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (rVSV) as a chimeric virus vaccine for HIV-1 (Clarke et al., 2016). The rVSV vector system is being explored as a platform for development of multiple vaccines. This paper reviews the molecular and biological features of the rVSV vector system, followed by a template with details on the safety and characteristics of a rVSV vaccine against Zaire ebolavirus (ZEBOV). The rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine is a live, replication competent vector in which the VSV glycoprotein (G) gene is replaced with the glycoprotein (GP) gene of ZEBOV. Multiple copies of GP are expressed and assembled into the viral envelope responsible for inducing protective immunity. The vaccine (designated V920) was originally constructed by the National Microbi...","Governments around the world must rapidly mobilize and make difficult policy decisions to mitigate the COVID-19 pandemic. Because deaths have been concentrated at older ages, we highlight the important role of demography, particularly how the age structure of a population may help explain differences in fatality rates across countries and how transmission unfolds. We examine the role of age structure in deaths thus far in Italy and South Korea and illustrate how the pandemic could unfold in populations with similar population sizes but different age structures, showing a dramatically higher burden of mortality in countries with older versus younger populations. This powerful interaction of demography and current age-specific mortality for COVID-19 suggests that social distancing and other policies to slow transmission should consider both the age composition of local and national contexts as well as the social connectedness of older and younger generations. We also call for countries t...","The ongoing pandemic of 2019-nCov (COVID-19) coronavirus has made reliable epidemiological modeling an urgent necessity. Unfortunately, most of the existing models are either too fine-grained to be efficient or too coarse-grained to be reliable. Here we propose a computationally efficient hybrid approach that uses SIR model for individual cities which are in turn coupled via empirical transportation networks that facilitate migration among them. The treatment presented here differs from existing models in two crucial ways: first, self-consistent determination of coupling parameters so as to maintain the populations of individual cities, and second, the incorporation of distance dependent temporal delays in migration. We apply our model to Indian aviation as well as railway networks taking into account populations of more than 300 cities. Our results project that through the domestic transportation, the significant population is poised to be exposed within 90 days of the onset of epidem...","Chinese government has taken strong measures in response to the epidemic of new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) from Jan.23, 2020. The number of confirmed infected individuals are still increasing rapidly. Estimating the accurate infected population and the future trend of epidemic spreading under control measures is significant and urgent. There have been reports external icon of spread from an infected patient with no symptoms to a close contact, which means the incubation individuals may has the possibility of infectiousness. However, the traditional transmission model, Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered (SEIR) model, assumes that the exposed individual is being infected but without infectiousness. Thus, the estimating infected populations based on SEIR model from the existing literatures seems too far more than the official reported data. Here, we inferred that the epidemic could be spread by exposed (incubation) individuals. Then, we provide a new Exposed-identified-Recovered (EIR) ...","Most new emerging viruses are derived from strains circulating in zoonotic reservoirs. Coronaviruses, which had an established potential for cross-species transmission within domesticated animals, suddenly became relevant with the unexpected emergence of the highly pathogenic human SARS-CoV strain from zoonotic reservoirs in 2002. SARS-CoV infected approximately 8000 people worldwide before public health measures halted the epidemic. Supported by robust time-ordered sequence variation, structural biology, well-characterized patient pools, and biological data, the emergence of SARS-CoV represents one of the best-studied natural models of viral disease emergence from zoonotic sources. This review article summarizes previous and more recent advances into the molecular and structural characteristics, with particular emphasis on host\u2013receptor interactions, that drove this remarkable virus disease outbreak in human populations.","Background: Sustained spread of SARS-CoV-2 has happened in major US cities. Capacity needs in Chinese cities could inform the planning of local healthcare resources. Methods: We described the intensive care unit (ICU) and inpatient bed needs for confirmed COVID-19 patients in two Chinese cities (Wuhan and Guangzhou) from January 10 to February 29, 2020, and compared the timing of disease control measures in relation to the timing of SARS-CoV-2 community spread. We estimated the peak ICU bed needs in US cities if a Wuhan-like outbreak occurs. Results: In Wuhan, strict disease control measures were implemented six weeks after sustained local transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Between January 10 and February 29, COVID-19 patients accounted for an average of 637 ICU patients and 3,454 serious inpatients on each day. During the epidemic peak, 19,425 patients (24.5 per 10,000 adults) were hospitalized, 9,689 (12.2 per 10,000 adults) were considered to be in serious condition, and 2,087 patients (2....","The study of virus evolution has historically been concerned with disease and its emergence and has not been integrated into the general study of evolution. Yet viruses dominate our planet and their evolution is a broad and applied field that can be studied in the real time (such HIV in human disease) and can also be applied to biotechnological problems. Virus evolution is very similar, but not identical, to host evolution. Darwinian principles apply, such as with Fisher population genetics, but other features, such as reticulated and quasispecies-based evolution, distinguish virus evolution. In RNA viruses, high error rates have led to the quasispecies concept in which collective populations are the basis of evolution. These populations provide viruses with high capacities for adaptation. Yet some RNA viruses show remarkable evolutionary stability. With DNA viruses, especially of bacteria, extensive recombination defines vast dynamic and ancient genetic pools. Temperate viruses can di...","","Abstract Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is caused by SARS-COV2 and represents the causative agent of a potentially fatal disease that is of great global public health concern. Based on the large number of infected people that were exposed to the wet animal market in Wuhan City, China, it is suggested that this is likely the zoonotic origin of COVID-19. Person-to-person transmission of COVID-19 infection led to the isolation of patients that were subsequently administered a variety of treatments. Extensive measures to reduce person-to-person transmission of COVID-19 have been implemented to control the current outbreak. Special attention and efforts to protect or reduce transmission should be applied in susceptible populations including children, health care providers, and elderly people. In this review, we highlights the symptoms, epidemiology, transmission, pathogenesis, phylogenetic analysis and future directions to control the spread of this fatal disease.","Abstract The worldwide outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) raises concerns of widespread panic and anxiety in individuals subjected to the real or perceived threat of the virus. Compared to general populations, patients who are institutionalized in a closed unit are also very vulnerable to COVID-19 infection and complications. This crisis touched on difficult issues of not only psychiatric care and ethics, but also psychological impacts to psychiatric care givers. In this Viewpoint, we address both physical and biopsychosocial aspects of this infection, as well as the psychoneuroimmunity of preventive strategies of healthy lifestyle, regular exercise, balanced nutrition, quality sleep and a strong connection with people. Social distancing and wearing masks might help us from pathogen exposure, yet such these measures also prevent us from expressing compassion and friendliness. Therefore, all forms of psychological support should be routinely implemented not only to consider...","Various epidemic prevention and control measures aimed at reducing person-to-person contact has paid a certain cost while controlling the epidemic. So accurate evaluation of these measures helps to maximize the effectiveness of prevention and control while minimizing social costs. In this paper, we develop the model in Dirk Brockmann and Dirk Helbing (2013) to theoretically explain the impact mechanism of traffic control and social distancing measures on the spread of the epidemic, and empirically tests the effect of the two measures in China at the present stage using econometric approach. We found that both traffic control and social distancing measures have played a very good role in controlling the development of the epidemic. Nationally, social distancing measures are better than traffic control measures; the two measures are complementary and their combined action will play a better epidemic prevention effect; Traffic control and social distancing do not work everywhere. Traffic ...","Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is infecting people throughout the world. It is probable that coronavirus disease (COVID-19) will be transmitted to people experiencing homelessness, which will become a major problem in particular in North America where there are sizable populations of people experiencing homelessness in nearly every metropolitan city in the USA and Canada. In the USA, more than 500 000 people were reported to be experiencing homelessness on any given night over the past decade (2007\u201319).1 The State of Homelessness in Canada 2016 report2 estimated 35 000 people are experiencing homelessness on any given night in Canada. People experiencing homelessness live in environments that are conducive to a disease epidemic. Many people experiencing homelessness live in congregate living settings\u2014be it formal (ie, shelters or halfway houses) or informal (ie, encampments or abandoned buildings)\u2014and might not have regular access to basic hygiene supplies...","Summary Objectives To assess associations between the functional polymorphisms G-2518A at the chemokine (C\u2013C motif) ligand 2 gene (CCL2) and mannose binding lectin (MBL) codon 54 variant (A/B) and susceptibility to SARS. Methods We genotyped the CCL2 G-2518A and MBL codon 54 variant (A/B) in 4 case\u2013control populations of Chinese descent, totally consisting of 932 patients with SARS and 982 control subjects. Results Both the high-CCL2-producing GG genotype and the low-MBL-producing B allele were consistently associated with increased risks of SARS-CoV infection in all 4 case\u2013control populations (joint P = 1.6 \u00d7 10\u22124 and 4.9 \u00d7 10\u22128, for CCL2 and MBL respectively), with no interaction between polymorphisms could be detected. Furthermore, all the 4 case\u2013control studies demonstrated a cumulative effect on risk of SARS-CoV infection for the combination of polymorphisms (joint P = 1.3 \u00d7 10\u221210). However, tests using the area under the curve (AUC) indicated that at this stage, the polymorphisms...","Respiratory viruses cause significant morbidity and mortality in immunocompromised populations such as stem cell transplant and solid organ transplant patients. Few viruses causing respiratory tract infection have an approved therapy, and many of the viruses have no therapeutic options at all. In this article, we describe novel agents under development for treatment options against several respiratory viruses.","Infectious respiratory disease in dogs is a constant challenge because of the involvement of several pathogens and environmental factors. Canine respiratory coronavirus (CRCoV) is a new coronavirus of dogs, which is widespread in North America, Japan, and several European countries. CRCoV has been associated with respiratory disease, particularly in kenneled dog populations. The virus is genetically and antigenically distinct from enteric canine coronavirus; therefore, specific tests are required for diagnosis."],"title":["Chapter Four Parasites in Food: From a Neglected Position to an Emerging Issue","Phase-adjusted estimation of the number of Coronavirus Disease 2019 cases in Wuhan, China","Phase adjusted estimation of the number of 2019 novel coronavirus cases in Wuhan, China","A modified SEIR model to predict the COVID-19 outbreak in Spain: simulating control scenarios and multi-scale epidemics","Prediction of New Coronavirus Infection Based on a Modified SEIR Model","Tracking and Predicting COVID-19 Epidemic in China Mainland","The lockdown of Hubei Province causing different transmission dynamics of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) in Wuhan and Beijing","Predicting the epidemic trend of COVID-19 in China and across the world using the machine learning approach","Trend Analysis and Forecasting of COVID-19 outbreak in India","COVID-19 Modelling: the Effects of Social Distancing","Mitigation and herd immunity strategy for COVID-19 is likely to fail","Feline blood transfusions A pinker shade of pale","Intranasal and oral vaccination with protein-based antigens: advantages, challenges and formulation strategies","Mouse mammary tumor virus uses mouse but not human transferrin receptor 1 to reach a low pH compartment and infect cells","The role of institutional trust in preventive and treatment-seeking behaviors during the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak among residents in Hubei, China","The effect of human mobility and control measures on the COVID-19 epidemic in China","When will the battle against novel coronavirus end in Wuhan: a SEIR modeling analysis","Coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak: what the department of endoscopy should know","Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) Knowledge and Perceptions: A Survey of Healthcare Workers","Comorbidity and its impact on 1,590 patients with COVID-19 in China: A Nationwide Analysis","Detection of COPD Exacerbations and Compliance With Patient-Reported Daily Symptom Diaries Using a Smartphone-Based Information System","Detection of potentially novel paramyxovirus and coronavirus viral RNA in bats and rats in the Mekong Delta region of southern Viet Nam","Simulation-based Estimation of the Spread of COVID-19 in Iran","Identification of COVID-19 Can be Quicker through Artificial Intelligence framework using a Mobile Phone-Based Survey in the Populations when Cities/Towns Are Under Quarantine","Age-dependent effects in the transmission and control of COVID-19 epidemics","Estimation of the reproductive number of Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) and the probable outbreak size on the Diamond Princess cruise ship: A data-driven analysis","Jumping species\u2014a mechanism for coronavirus persistence and survival","How will country-based mitigation measures influence the course of the COVID-19 epidemic?","Perception of emergent epidemic of COVID-2019 / SARS CoV-2 on the Polish Internet","Data-Based Analysis, Modelling and Forecasting of the COVID-19 outbreak","Transmission Dynamics of 2019-nCoV in Malaysia","Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) origin and animal reservoir","Global versus focused isolation during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic-A cost-effectiveness analysis","The Prediction for Development of COVID-19 in Global Major Epidemic Areas Through Empirical Trends in China by Utilizing State Transition Matrix Model","Extended SIR prediction of the epidemics trend of COVID-19 in Italy and compared with Hunan, China","rVSV\u0394G-ZEBOV-GP (also designated V920) recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus pseudotyped with Ebola Zaire Glycoprotein: Standardized template with key considerations for a risk/benefit assessment","Demographic science aids in understanding the spread and fatality rates of COVID-19","Multi-city modeling of epidemics using spatial networks: Application to 2019-nCov (COVID-19) coronavirus in India","Simulating the infected population and spread trend of 2019-nCov under different policy by EIR model","SARS-CoV and emergent coronaviruses: viral determinants of interspecies transmission","The demand for inpatient and ICU beds for COVID-19 in the US: lessons from Chinese cities","Evolution of Viruses","Comparative genetic analysis of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV/SARS-CoV-2) receptor ACE2 in different populations","The epidemiology and pathogenesis of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak","Using psychoneuroimmunity against COVID-19","Which Measures are Effective in Containing COVID-19?
