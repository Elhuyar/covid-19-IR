Inefficient human-to-human transmission of zoonotic strains may initially limit the spread of transmission, but an infection may be contracted by touching contaminated surfaces. Enveloped viruses are often susceptible to environmental stresses, but the human coronaviruses responsible for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) have recently caused increasing concern of contact transmission during outbreaks. We report here that pathogenic human coronavirus 229E remained infectious in a human lung cell culture model following at least 5 days of persistence on a range of common nonbiocidal surface materials, including polytetrafluoroethylene (Teflon; PTFE), polyvinyl chloride (PVC), ceramic tiles, glass, silicone rubber, and stainless steel. We have shown previously that noroviruses are destroyed o...","Summary Currently, the emergence of a novel human coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, has become a global health concern causing severe respiratory tract infections in humans. Human-to-human transmissions have been described with incubation times between 2-10 days, facilitating its spread via droplets, contaminated hands or surfaces. We therefore reviewed the literature on all available information about the persistence of human and veterinary coronaviruses on inanimate surfaces as well as inactivation strategies with biocidal agents used for chemical disinfection, e.g. in healthcare facilities. The analysis of 22 studies reveals that human coronaviruses such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) coronavirus, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) coronavirus or endemic human coronaviruses (HCoV) can persist on inanimate surfaces like metal, glass or plastic for up to 9 days, but can be efficiently inactivated by surface disinfection procedures with 62\u201371% ethanol, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide o...","Summary The novel human coronavirus 2019-nCoV has become a global health concern causing severe respiratory tract infections in humans. Human-to-human transmissions have been described, probably via droplets but possibly also via contaminated hands or surfaces. In a recent review on the persistence of human and veterinary coronaviruses on inanimate surfaces it was shown that human coronaviruses such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) coronavirus, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) coronavirus or endemic human coronaviruses (HCoV) can persist on inanimate surfaces like metal, glass or plastic for up to 9 days. Some disinfectant agents effectively reduce coronavirus infectivity within 1 minute such 62% - 71% ethanol, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide or 0.1% sodium hypochlorite. Other compounds such as 0.05% - 0.2% benzalkonium chloride or 0.02% chlorhexidine digluconate are less effective. An effective surface disinfection may help to ensure an early containment and prevention of fur...","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID19) is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARSCoV2), it was first identified in 2019 in Wuhan, China and has resulted in the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic. As of March 1, 2020, 79,968 patients in China and 7169 outside of China had tested positive for COVID19 and a mortality rate of 3.6% has been observed amongst Chinese patients. Its primary mode of transmission is via respiratory droplets from coughs and sneezes. The virus can remain viable for up to three days on plastic and stainless steel or in aerosols for upto 3 hours and is relatively more stable than the known human coronaviruses. It is stable in faeces at room temperature for at least 1-2 days and can be stable in infected patients for up to 4 days. Heat at 56 degree Celsius kills the SARS coronavirus at around 10000 units per 15 minutes. Thus, temperature is an important factor in survival of COVID19 virus and this article focuses on understanding th...","The main route of transmission of SARS CoV infection is presumed to be respiratory droplets. However the virus is also detectable in other body fluids and excreta. The stability of the virus at different temperatures and relative humidity on smooth surfaces were studied. The dried virus on smooth surfaces retained its viability for over 5 days at temperatures of 22\u201325\u00b0C and relative humidity of 40\u201350%, that is, typical air-conditioned environments. However, virus viability was rapidly lost (&gt;3 log(10)) at higher temperatures and higher relative humidity (e.g., 38\u00b0C, and relative humidity of &gt;95%). The better stability of SARS coronavirus at low temperature and low humidity environment may facilitate its transmission in community in subtropical area (such as Hong Kong) during the spring and in air-conditioned environments. It may also explain why some Asian countries in tropical area (such as Malaysia, Indonesia or Thailand) with high temperature and high relative humidity environment d...","The antiviral properties of zeolite (sodium aluminosilicate) powders amended with metal ions were assessed using human coronavirus 229E, feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV), and feline calicivirus F-9. Zeolites containing silver and silver/copper caused significant reductions of coronavirus 229E after 1 h in suspension. The silver/copper combination yielded a &gt;5.13-log(10) reduction within 24 h. It was also the most effective (&gt;3.18-log(10)) against FIPV after 4 h. Other formulations were ineffective against FIPV. On plastic coupons with incorporated silver/copper-zeolites, &gt;1.7-log(10) and &gt;3.8-log(10) reductions were achieved for coronavirus 229E and feline calicivirus within 24 h, respectively. Silver/copper zeolite reduced titers of all viruses tested, suggesting that it may be effective against related pathogens of interest [i.e., SARS coronavirus, other coronaviruses, human norovirus (calicivirus)]. Of note, it was effective against both enveloped and nonenveloped viruses....","Protection of frontline HCPs is paramount. However, PPE is a limited resource and often requires providers to be adaptive and resourceful in a crisis. The inexpensive and simple method of using clear drapes during extubation (and possibly intubation) of COVID-19 patients may be considered by frontline HCPs and infection control specialists as an additional precaution. Modifications of the clear plastics can be adapted for surgical procedures that may be AGMPs.","Abstract Persistence was established after most of the SARS-CoV-infected Vero E6 cells died. RNA of the defective interfering virus was not observed in the persistently infected cells by Northern blot analysis. SARS-CoV diluted to 2 PFU failed to establish persistence, suggesting that some particular viruses in the seed virus did not induce persistent infection. Interestingly, a viral receptor, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE)-2, was down-regulated in persistently infected cells. G418-selected clones established from parent Vero E6 cells, which were transfected with a plasmid containing the neomycin resistance gene, were infected with SARS-CoV, resulting in a potential cell population capable of persistence in Vero E6 cells. Our previous studies demonstrated that signaling pathways of extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK1/2), c-Jun N-terminal protein kinase (JNK), p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), and phosphatidylinositol 3\u2032-kinase (PI3K)/Akt were activated in SARS-Co...","The number of confirmed COVID-19 cases admitted in hospitals is continuously increasing in the Philippines. Frontline health care workers are faced with imminent risks of getting infected. In this study, we formulate a theoretical model to calculate the risk of being infected in health care facilities considering the following factors: the average number of encounters with a suspected COVID-19 patient per hour; interaction time for each encounter; work shift duration or exposure time; crowd density, which may depend on the amount of space available in a given location; and availability and effectiveness of protective gears and facilities provided for the frontline health care workers. Based on the simulation results, we recommend the following: (i) decrease the rate of patient encounter per frontline health care worker, e.g., maximum of three encounters per hour in a 12-hour work shift duration; (ii) decrease the interaction time between the frontline health care worker and the patient...","Abstract Medicine shortages have been spreading in European countries. In many cases, the unavailability of medicinal products has a substantial impact on the capability of National Healthcare Systems in ensuring the continuity of care. Shortages originate from multifactorial causes. In particular, they can be due to supply-related factors (e.g., manufacturing issues, regulatory issues, logistics, distribution) and demand-related ones (e.g., fluctuating drug demand, parallel market, tendering, price and reimbursement policies). However, some extraordinary geopolitical events (e.g., Brexit) may also affect medicines\u2019 availability. The capability of European Regulatory Authorities and other stakeholders, which are involved in the pharmaceutical distribution chain and the healthcare assistance services, to define suitable problem-solving strategies has been limited for years by the fragmentation of the European regulatory framework, starting from the lack of a univocal definition of a med...","With limited infection control practices in overcrowded Bangladeshi hospitals, surfaces may play an important role in the transmission of respiratory pathogens in hospital wards and pose a serious risk of infection for patients, health care workers, caregivers and visitors. In this study, we aimed to identify if surfaces near hospitalized patients with respiratory infections were contaminated with respiratory pathogens and to identify which surfaces were most commonly contaminated. Between September-November 2013, we collected respiratory (nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal) swabs from patients hospitalized with respiratory illness in adult medicine and paediatric medicine wards at two public tertiary care hospitals in Bangladesh. We collected surface swabs from up to five surfaces near each case-patient including: the wall, bed rail, bed sheet, clinical file, and multipurpose towel used for care giving purposes. We tested swabs using real-time multiplex PCR for 19 viral and 12 bacterial...","Abstract Bone marrow stromal antigen 2 (BST2), an interferon-inducible antiviral factor, has been shown to block the release of various enveloped viruses from cells. It has also been identified as an innate immune system component. Most enveloped viruses subject to BST2 restriction bud at the plasma membrane. Here we report our findings that (a) the production of human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E) progeny viruses, whose budding occurs at the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC), markedly decreases in the presence of BST2; and (b) BST2 knockdown expression results in enhanced HCoV-229E virion production. Electron microscopy analyses indicate that HCoV-229E virions are tethered to cell surfaces or intracellular membranes by BST2. Our results suggest that BST2 exerts a broad blocking effect against enveloped virus release, regardless of whether budding occurs at the plasma membrane or intracellular compartments.","Zoonotic transmission of novel viruses represents a significant threat to global public health and is fueled by globalization, the loss of natural habitats, and exposure to new hosts. For coronaviruses (CoVs), broad diversity exists within bat populations and uniquely positions them to seed future emergence events. In this review, we explore the host and viral dynamics that shape these CoV populations for survival, amplification, and possible emergence in novel hosts.","","BACKGROUND: The ongoing worldwide outbreak of the 2019-nCoV is markedly similar to the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak 17 years ago. During the 2002-2003 SARS outbreak, healthcare workers formed a special population of patients. Although virus-specific IgG play important roles in virus neutralization and prevention against future infection, limited information is available regarding the long term persistence of IgG after infection with SARS-like coronavirus. METHODS: A long-term prospective cohort study followed 34 SARS-CoV-infected healthcare workers from a hospital with clustered infected cases during the 2002-2003 SARS outbreak in Guangzhou, China, with a 13-year follow-up. Serum samples were collected annually from 2003-2015. Twenty SARS-CoV-infected and 40 non-infected healthcare workers were enrolled in 2015, and their serum samples were collected. All sera were tested for IgG antibodies with ELISA using whole virus and a recombinant nucleocapsid protein of SARS...","Background: The overall objective of this rapid review was to identify infection protection and control recommendations from published clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) for adults aged 60 years and older in long-term care settings Methods: Comprehensive searches in MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, and relevant CPG publishers/repositories were carried out in early March 2020. Title/abstract and full-text screening, data abstraction, and quality appraisal (AGREE-II) were carried out by single reviewers. Results: A total of 17 relevant CPGs were identified, published in the USA (n=8), Canada (n=6), Australia (n=2), and the United Kingdom (n=1). All of the CPGs dealt with infection control in long-term care facilities (LTCF) and addressed various types of viral respiratory infections (e.g., influenza, COVID-19, severe acute respiratory syndrome). Ten or more CPGs recommended the following infection control measures in LTCF: hand hygiene (n=13), wearing personal protective equipment...","Abstract There are many diseases for which a microbial aetiology is suspected. The hypothesis that a disease has an infectious cause is supported by: clinical features (similar to those of known infectious diseases, e.g. fever, leucocytosis), epidemiology (case clustering in time or location), histology (inflammation of affected tissues, e.g. granulomata) or characteristic microbial structures, treatment (clinical response to antimicrobial treatment), and prevention of disease by vaccines targeting microbial antigens. Proof that a microbe causes a disease requires more rigorous evidence. Future attempts to identify novel microbes associated with human disease may use sequence-based approaches. High-throughput sequencing may allow identification of unique microbial nucleic acid sequences in a background of host DNA. The complete sequencing of the human genome and multiple microbial genomes make this approach more feasible. DNA microarrays are also likely to be used in the search for nov...","Abstract A major challenge facing agriculture at present is the development of techniques that can screen field samples and other plant materials simultaneously for the presence of many viruses. Microarray techniques show promise in this regard, as their high throughput nature can potentially detect a range of viruses using a single test. In this paper we present an array that can detect a wide spectrum of 169 plant virus species from 13 different genera. The array was constructed using an automated probe design protocol which generated a minimal number of probes to detect viruses at the genus level. The designed arrays showed a high specificity and sensitivity when tested with a set of standard virus samples. Field samples collected from a severe disease outbreak of Panax notoginseng farms in Yunnan, China, in 2001 were screened, where a potyvirus infection was identified associated with the disease.","Abstract The notion that an infectious respiratory pathogen can damage the central nervous system (CNS) and lead to neurological disease was tested using a human respiratory coronavirus, the OC43 strain of human coronavirus (HCoV-OC43). First, primary cell cultures were used to determine the susceptibility of each type of neural cells to virus infection. Neurons were the target cells, undergoing degeneration during infection, in part due to apoptosis. Second, neuropathogenicity was investigated in susceptible mice. Intracerebral inoculation of HCoV-OC43 into BALB/c mice led to an acute encephalitis with neuronal cell death by necrosis and apoptosis. Infectious virus was apparently cleared from surviving animals, whereas viral RNA persisted for several months. Some of the animals surviving to acute encephalitis presented an abnormal limb clasping reflex and a decrease in motor activity starting several months post-infection. These results suggest that viral persistence could be associat...","Ginkgolic acids (GA) are alkylphenol constituents of the leaves and fruits of Ginkgo biloba. GA has shown pleiotropic effects in vitro, including: antitumor effects through inhibition of lipogenesis; decreased expression of invasion associated proteins through AMPK activation; and potential rescue of amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) induced synaptic impairment. GA was also reported to have activity against Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus. Several mechanisms for this activity have been suggested including: SUMOylation inhibition; blocking formation of the E1-SUMO intermediate; inhibition of fatty acid synthase; non-specific SIRT inhibition; and activation of protein phosphatase type-2C. Here we report that GA inhibits Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) by inhibition of both fusion and viral protein synthesis. Additionally, we report that GA inhibits human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) genome replication and Zika virus (ZIKV) infection of normal human astrocytes (NHA). We show a broad spectrum of fus...","The etiological agent of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) was identified as a new coronavirus, termed SARS-CoV. Establishment of an efficient and sensitive diagnostic system of SARS-CoV genetic materials is crucial for SARS control. In this study, we quantified SARS-CoV mRNAs in both infected cell culture lysate and in supernatant by using Real-time quantitative revere transcription-PCR based on EvaGreen\u2122 dye and Taqman-MGB probes. For extensive evaluation of sensitivities and specificities, 13 pairs of primers and 4 probes were designed based on different genes of SARS-CoV. Glyceraldehydes-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) was selected as the internal control gene. Results showed that S-gene-specific PCR was the most sensitive for detection, but because of its sequence variability in the different viral strains, primers and a probe based on the N gene were suitable substitutions. Meanwhile, we found the mRNA concentrations in cell culture lysates were much higher than in cell ...","Abstract C57BL/6 mice infected with mouse hepatitis virus, strain JHM (JHMV) develop a rapidly fatal acute encephalitis. Previously, we showed that this disease is partially CD4 T cell-mediated since infection with a recombinant JHMV (rJ) mutated in only a single immunodominant CD4 T cell epitope (epitope M133, rJ.MY135Q) results in a nonlethal disease. Increased mortality correlated with a greater number of JHMV-specific CD4 T cells in the brains of rJ compared to rJ.MY135Q-infected mice. Here, we extend these results to show that the diminished number of virus-specific T cells correlates with a reduced cytokine/chemokine response in the infected brain. We also show that regulatory CD4 T cells (Tregs) are critical for mild disease in rJ.MY135Q-infected mice because their depletion results in increased mortality. Further, a relative paucity of Tregs characterizes lethal infection because adoptive transfer of Tregs into rJ-infected mice increases survival from 0% to 50%. These results s...","The ongoing COVID-19 outbreak has expanded rapidly throughout China. Major behavioral, clinical, and state interventions are underway currently to mitigate the epidemic and prevent the persistence of the virus in human populations in China and worldwide. It remains unclear how these unprecedented interventions, including travel restrictions, have affected COVID-19 spread in China. We use real-time mobility data from Wuhan and detailed case data including travel history to elucidate the role of case importation on transmission in cities across China and ascertain the impact of control measures. Early on, the spatial distribution of COVID-19 cases in China was well explained by human mobility data. Following the implementation of control measures, this correlation dropped and growth rates became negative in most locations, although shifts in the demographics of reported cases are still indicative of local chains of transmission outside Wuhan. This study shows that the drastic control mea...","Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome caused substantial morbidity and mortality during the 2002\u20132003 epidemic. Many of the features of the human disease are duplicated in BALB/c mice infected with a mouse-adapted version of the virus (MA15), which develop respiratory disease with high morbidity and mortality. Here, we show that severe disease is correlated with slow kinetics of virus clearance and delayed activation and transit of respiratory dendritic cells (rDC) to the draining lymph nodes (DLN) with a consequent deficient virus-specific T cell response. All of these defects are corrected when mice are treated with liposomes containing clodronate, which deplete alveolar macrophages (AM). Inhibitory AMs are believed to prevent the development of immune responses to environmental antigens and allergic responses by interacting with lung dendritic cells and T cells. The inhibitory effects of AM can also be nullified if mice or AMs are pretreated with poly I:C, which directly activate AMs an...","BACKGROUND: There is an ongoing debate regarding the type of respiratory protection that should be recommended for use for healthcare workers. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was conducted in three countries: China, Pakistan and Vietnam. RESULTS: In China and Pakistan, the infection control guidelines were developed to be in line with the recommendations from the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, while in the Vietnamese guidelines the recommendations correspond with the WHO suggestions only. The guidelines from all three countries document the need for training and fit testing; however there is no system to monitor the training and fit testing programs. Across the three countries, there was some inconsistency with regard to the types of products (i.e. masks vs. respirators) recommended for influenza, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and tuberculosis. CONCLUSIONS: Available evidence should be examined and a compre...","[Image: see text] Infectious diseases are a leading cause of mortality worldwide, with viruses and bacteria in particular having enormous impacts on global healthcare. One major challenge in combatting such diseases is a lack of effective drugs or specific treatments. In addition, drug resistance to currently available therapeutics and adverse effects caused by long-term overuse are both serious public health issues. A promising treatment strategy is to employ cell-membrane mimics as decoys to trap and to detain the pathogens. In this Perspective, we briefly review the infection mechanisms adopted by different pathogens at the cellular membrane interface and highlight the applications of cell-membrane-mimicking nanodecoys for systemic protection against infectious diseases. We also discuss the implication of nanodecoy\u2013pathogen complexes in the development of vaccines. We anticipate this Perspective will provide new insights on design and development of advanced materials against emergi...","Abstract Previous studies with calves and other species have provided evidence that blood serum-derived proteins and fructooligosaccharides (FOS) may benefit intestinal health. We assessed the effects of supplementing products containing serum proteins as a component of arrival fluid support or serum proteins plus FOS (in addition to additional solids, minerals, and vitamins) in an early life dietary supplement on performance, morbidity, and mortality of stressed (transport, cold) male calves. Male Holstein calves (n=93) &lt;1 wk old were stratified by arrival body weight (BW) and plasma protein concentration, and then randomly assigned to 1 of 4 treatment groups in a 2\u00d72 factorial arrangement of one-time administration of fluid support [either control electrolyte solution (E) or the serum protein-containing arrival formula (AF)] and 14d of either no supplementation (NG) or supplementation with Gammulin (G; APC Inc., Ankeny, IA), which contains serum proteins and FOS in addition to other ...","A novel human coronavirus, now named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2, referred to as HCoV-19 here) that emerged in Wuhan, China in late 2019 is now causing a pandemic. Here, we analyze the aerosol and surface stability of HCoV-19 and compare it with SARS-CoV-1, the most closely related human coronavirus.2 We evaluated the stability of HCoV-19 and SARS-CoV-1 in aerosols and on different surfaces and estimated their decay rates using a Bayesian regression model","Abstract Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a life-threatening disease caused by a novel coronavirus termed SARS-CoV. Due to the severity of this disease, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that manipulation of active viral cultures of SARS-CoV be performed in containment laboratories at biosafety level 3 (BSL3). The virus was inactivated by ultraviolet light (UV) at 254nm, heat treatment of 65\u00b0C or greater, alkaline (pH &gt; 12) or acidic (pH &lt; 3) conditions, formalin and glutaraldehyde treatments. We describe the kinetics of these efficient viral inactivation methods, which will allow research with SARS-CoV containing materials, that are rendered non-infectious, to be conducted at reduced safety levels.","Relevant pandemic-spread scenario simulations provide guiding principles for containment and mitigation policy developments. Here we devise a simple model to predict the effectiveness of different mitigation strategies. The model consists of a set of simple differential equations considering the population size, reported and unreported infections, reported and unreported recoveries and the number of Covid-19-inflicted deaths. For simplification, we assume that Covid-19 survivors are immune (e.g. mutations are not considered) and that the virus can only be passed on by persons with undetected infections. While the latter assumption is a simplification (it is neglected that e.g. hospital staff may be infected by detected patients with symptoms), it was introduced here to keep the model as simple as possible. Moreover, the current version of the model does not account for age-dependent differences in the death rates, but considers higher mortality rates due to temporary shortage of intens...","Abstract A recombinant transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus (rTGEV) in which E gene was deleted (rTGEV-\u0394E) has been engineered. This deletion mutant only grows in cells expressing E protein (E+ cells) indicating that E was an essential gene for TGEV replication. Electron microscopy studies of rTGEV-\u0394E infected BHK-pAPN-E\u2212 cells showed that only immature intracellular virions were assembled. These virions were non-infectious and not secreted to the extracellular medium in BHK-pAPN-E\u2212 cells. RNA and protein composition analysis by RNase-gold and immunoelectron microscopy showed that rTGEV-\u0394E virions contained RNA and also all the structural TGEV proteins, except the deleted E protein. Nevertheless, full virion maturation was blocked. Studies of the rTGEV-\u0394E subcellular localization by confocal and immunoelectron microscopy in infected E\u2212 cells showed that in the absence of E protein virus trafficking was arrested in the intermediate compartment. Therefore, the absence of E protein i...","Abstract Background The objective of the study was to investigate the effectiveness of non-pharmacological interventions in preventing cases of influenza requiring hospitalization. Methods We performed a multicenter case-control study in 36 hospitals, in 2010 in Spain. Hospitalized influenza cases confirmed by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction and three matched controls (two hospital and one community control) per case were selected. The use of non-pharmacological measures seven days before the onset of symptoms (frequency of hand washing, use of alcohol-based hand sanitizers and handwashing after touching contaminated surfaces) was collected. Results We studied 813 cases hospitalized for influenza and 2274 controls. The frequency of hand washing 5-10 times (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]=0.65) and &gt;10 times (aOR=0.59) and handwashing after contact with contaminated surfaces (aOR=0.65) were protective factors and were dose-responsive (p&lt;0.001). Alcohol-based hand sanitizers we...","Introduction: The highly pathogenic coronaviruses severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) are lethal zoonotic viruses that have emerged into human populations these past 15 years. These coronaviruses are associated with novel respiratory syndromes that spread from person-to-person via close contact, resulting in high morbidity and mortality caused by the progression to Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). Areas covered: The risks of re-emergence of SARS-CoV from bat reservoir hosts, the persistence of MERS-CoV circulation, and the potential for future emergence of novel coronaviruses indicate antiviral drug discovery will require activity against multiple coronaviruses. In this review, approaches that antagonize viral nonstructural proteins, neutralize structural proteins, or modulate essential host elements of viral infection with varying levels of efficacy in models of highly pathogenic coronavirus di...","Background: The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has placed unprecedented challenges on hospital environmental hygiene and medical staff protection. It is crucial to assess hospital environmental hygiene to understand the most important environmental issues for controlling the spread of COVID-19 in hospitals. Objective: To detect the presence of COVID-19 in the samples from the area at risk of contamination in the First Hospital of Jilin University. Methods: Viruses in the air were collected by natural sedimentation and air particle sampler methods. Predetermined environmental surfaces were sampled using swabs at seven o'clock in the morning before disinfection. The real-time reverse-transcription PCR method was used to detect the existence of COVID-19 pathogens. Results: Viruses could be detected on the surfaces of the nurse station in the isolation area with suspected patients and in the air of the isolation ward with an intensive care patient. Conclusion: Comprehensiv...","Abstract Bacterial pneumonia caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and Klebsiella pneumoniae represents a frequent cause of mortality worldwide. The increased incidence of pneumococcal diseases in both developed and developing countries is alarmingly high, affecting infants and aged adult populations. The growing rate of antibiotic resistance and biofilm formation on medical device surfaces poses a greater challenge for treating respiratory infections. Over recent years, a better understanding of bacterial growth, metabolism, and virulence has offered several potential targets for developing therapeutics against bacterial pneumonia. This chapter will discuss the current and developing trends in treating bacterial pneumonia.","Deletion of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) envelope (E) gene attenuates the virus. E gene encodes a small multifunctional protein that possesses ion channel (IC) activity, an important function in virus-host interaction. To test the contribution of E protein IC activity in virus pathogenesis, two recombinant mouse-adapted SARS-CoVs, each containing one single amino acid mutation that suppressed ion conductivity, were engineered. After serial infections, mutant viruses, in general, incorporated compensatory mutations within E gene that rendered active ion channels. Furthermore, IC activity conferred better fitness in competition assays, suggesting that ion conductivity represents an advantage for the virus. Interestingly, mice infected with viruses displaying E protein IC activity, either with the wild-type E protein sequence or with the revertants that restored ion transport, rapidly lost weight and died. In contrast, mice infected with mutants lacking IC acti...","Background:Patients with the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) have different degrees of psychological pain, such as anxiety and depression, which may related to their prognosis. Psychological intervention can be conducted in different ways to improve psychological pain and improve the treatment effect. Objective:The present study aimed to investigate and analyze the psychological status of patients with COVID-19 during the course of illness, and to evaluate the effect and influencing factors of psychological crisis intervention, so as to explore the effective mode of clinical psychological intervention in acute patients under isolation environment. Methods:A total of 143 persons participated in the study, including 26 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 in the isolation ward (COVID-19 group), 87 patients with general pneumonia in the observation ward (General Pneumonia group) and 30 healthy volunteers (Normal group). All the patients in the ward received comprehensive psychological int...","Abstract In December 2019, the outbreak of the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in China spread worldwide, becoming an emergency of major international concern. SARS-CoV-2 infection causes clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus. Human-to-human transmission has been described with incubation times between 2-14 days, facilitating its spread via droplets, contaminated hands or surfaces. Early diagnosis, quarantine, and supportive treatments are essential to cure patients. We therefore reviewed the literature on all available information about the epidemiology, diagnosis, isolation and treatments of COVID-19. Treatments, including antiviral agents, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, corticosteroids, antibodies, convalescent plasma transfusion and vaccines, will be discussed in this article. Additionally, registered trials about treatment were listed to develop approaches for the current urgent demand for therapy.","Abstract The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a pandemic with the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The infection has predominantly respiratory transmission and is transmitted through large droplets or aerosols, and less commonly by contact with infected surfaces or fomites. The alarming spread of the infection and the severe clinical disease that it may cause, have led to the widespread institution of social distancing measures. Due to repeated exposure to potentially infectious patients and specimens, healthcare and laboratory personnel are particularly susceptible to contract COVID-19. This review paper provides an assessment of the current state of knowledge about the disease and its pathology, and the potential presence of the virus in cytology specimens. It also discusses the measures that cytology laboratories can take to function during the pandemic, and minimize the risk to their personnel, trainees and pathologists. In addition, it explores potential means to continue to educate traine...","BACKGROUND: The recent emergence of a novel coronavirus in the Middle East (designated MERS-CoV) is a reminder of the zoonotic and pathogenic potential of emerging coronaviruses in humans. Clinical features of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) include atypical pneumonia and progressive respiratory failure that is highly reminiscent of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) caused by SARS-CoV. The host response is a key component of highly pathogenic respiratory virus infection. Here, we computationally analyzed gene expression changes in a human airway epithelial cell line infected with two genetically distinct MERS-CoV strains obtained from human patients, MERS-CoV SA 1 and MERS-CoV Eng 1. RESULTS: Using topological techniques, including persistence homology and filtered clustering, we performed a comparative transcriptional analysis of human Calu-3 cell host responses to the different MERS-CoV strains, with MERS-CoV Eng 1 inducing early kinetic changes, between 3 and 12 hours...","Abstract Genetic manipulation of the RNA genomes by reverse genetics is a powerful tool to study the molecular biology and pathogenesis of RNA viruses. During construction of an infectious clone from a Vero cell-adapted coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), we found that a G\u2013C point mutation at nucleotide position 15526, causing Arg-to-Pro mutation at amino acid position 132 of the helicase protein, is lethal to the infectivity of IBV on Vero cells. When the in vitro-synthesized full-length transcripts containing this mutation were introduced into Vero cells, no infectious virus was rescued. Upon correction of the mutation, infectious virus was recovered. Further characterization of the in vitro-synthesized full-length transcripts containing the G15526C mutation demonstrated that this mutation may block the transcription of subgenomic RNAs. Substitution mutation of the Arg132 residue to a positively charged amino acid Lys affected neither the infectivity of the in vitro-synthe...","Human coronaviruses (HCoVs), including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV, also known as SARS-CoV-2), lead global epidemics with high morbidity and mortality. However, there are currently no effective drugs targeting 2019-nCoV/SARS-CoV-2. Drug repurposing, representing as an effective drug discovery strategy from existing drugs, could shorten the time and reduce the cost compared to de novo drug discovery. In this study, we present an integrative, antiviral drug repurposing methodology implementing a systems pharmacology-based network medicine platform, quantifying the interplay between the HCoV\u2013host interactome and drug targets in the human protein\u2013protein interaction network. Phylogenetic analyses of 15 HCoV whole genomes reveal that 2019-nCoV/SARS-CoV-2 shares the highest nucleotide sequence identity with SARS-CoV (79.7%). Specifically, the envelope and nucleocapsid proteins of 2019-nCoV/SARS-CoV-2 are two evolutionarily co...","Abstract On the Internet, there is a lot of open access information related to infectious diseases, e.g., official announcement, media news, bulletin boards, blogs, and other social media. If proper data retrieval and screening methods were applied on these Internet-based data, it would be very useful to improve the timeliness of early detection for infectious diseases. In China, we practice early warning using Internet-based data with routine intelligence screening assessment every day, and respond to any unusual event in a timely manner. Through this mechanism, the surveillance and early warning of Internet-based data for infectious disease and public health emergency plays an important supplemental role to the traditional surveillance systems.","As the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is rapidly progressing, the need for the development of an effective vaccine is critical. A promising approach for vaccine development is to generate, through codon pair deoptimization, an attenuated virus. This approach carries the advantage that it only requires limited knowledge specific to the virus in question, other than its genome sequence. Therefore, it is well suited for emerging viruses for which we may not have extensive data. We performed comprehensive in silico analyses of several features of SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequence (e.g., codon usage, codon pair usage, dinucleotide/junction dinucleotide usage, RNA structure around the frameshift region) in comparison with other members of the coronaviridae family of viruses, the overall human genome, and the transcriptome of specific human tissues such as lung, which are primarily targeted by the virus. Our analysis identified the spike (S) and nucleocapsid (N) proteins as promising targets for deoptimizatio...","Abstract Purpose The aim of the study was to identify characteristic clinical features and outcomes of critically ill patients with confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). Materials and Methods This retrospective study enrolled all patients admitted to a 12-bed SARS intensive care unit (ICU) in a tertiary care medical center in Taipei between May 15 and July 17, 2003. Patients with positive results of either reverse transcriptase\u2013polymerase chain reaction or antibody to SARS coronavirus were defined as SARS cases and others with negative results as control cases. Results Of the 50 patients, 14 had confirmed SARS. Demographics were similar between the 2 groups. The highest leukocyte and neutrophil counts, lactate dehydrogenase, and creatine kinase; positive end-expiratory pressure; and use of corticosteroids, ribavirin, and intravenous immunoglobulin were higher in the SARS group. In contrast, the lowest lymphocyte count and the ratio of Pao 2 to the fraction of inspired oxy...","BACKGROUND: Infection prevention and control measures are critical to prevent the possible spread of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome-coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in healthcare facilities. Therefore, healthcare workers should be aware of all procedures concerning prevention of and protection from MERS-CoV. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to improve the knowledge of the dental students and evaluate their awareness about MERS-CoV. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A questionnaire was made according to MOH information and 200 dental students (Al-Farabi Colleges, Jeddah) were interviewed to evaluate their knowledge about MERS-CoV. RESULTS: More than half of the dental students (54%) interviewed had good knowledge about the etiology, symptoms, and treatment of MERS-CoV. Measurements for infection control and protection were also known (79%). The sources of information for the students were: college (27%), MOH (25%), media (24%), and social community (23%), while 17% of the students interviewed had no id...","The study of virus evolution has historically been concerned with disease and its emergence and has not been integrated into the general study of evolution. Yet viruses dominate our planet and their evolution is a broad and applied field that can be studied in the real time (such HIV in human disease) and can also be applied to biotechnological problems. Virus evolution is very similar, but not identical, to host evolution. Darwinian principles apply, such as with Fisher population genetics, but other features, such as reticulated and quasispecies-based evolution, distinguish virus evolution. In RNA viruses, high error rates have led to the quasispecies concept in which collective populations are the basis of evolution. These populations provide viruses with high capacities for adaptation. Yet some RNA viruses show remarkable evolutionary stability. With DNA viruses, especially of bacteria, extensive recombination defines vast dynamic and ancient genetic pools. Temperate viruses can di...","Abstract The Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is a newly identified pathogen able of human transmission that causes a mortality of almost 40%. As in the case of SARS-CoV, MERS virus lacking E protein represents a potential vaccine. In both cases, abolishment of channel activity may be a contributor to the attenuation observed in E-deleted viruses. Herein, we report that purified MERS-CoV E protein, like SARS-CoV E protein, is almost fully \u03b1-helical, has a single \u03b1-helical transmembrane domain, and forms pentameric ion channels in lipid bilayers. Based on these similarities, and the proposed involvement of channel activity as virulence factor in SARS-CoV E protein, MERS-CoV E protein may constitute a potential drug target.","Abstract The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) 8b protein, which is not expressed by other known coronaviruses, can down-regulate the envelope (E) protein via a proteasome-dependent pathway. Here, we showed that the down-regulation of E is not dependent on the lysine residues on 8b and the reduction of polyubiquitination of E mutants is not correlated with their down-regulation by 8b, suggesting an ubiquitin-independent proteasome pathway is involved. A time-course study revealed that 8b was expressed at late-stages of SARS-CoV infection. By using Vero E6 cells stably expressing green fluorescence protein-tagged 8b, ectopic expression of 8b was shown to significantly reduce the production of progeny virus and down-regulate E expression. Taken together, these results suggest that 8b negatively modulates virus replication by down-regulating E via an ubiquitin-independent proteasome pathway.","AbstractCoronaviruses (CoVs) are important human pathogens with significant zoonotic potential. Progress has been made toward identifying potential vaccine candidates for highly pathogenic human CoVs, including use of attenuated viruses that lack the CoV envelope (E) protein or express E mutants. However, no approved vaccines or anti-viral therapeutics exist. CoVs assemble by budding into the lumen of the early Golgi prior to exocytosis. The small CoV E protein plays roles in assembly, virion release, and pathogenesis. CoV E has a single hydrophobic domain (HD), is targeted to Golgi membranes, and has cation channel activity in vitro. The E protein from the avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) has dramatic effects on the secretory system, which requires residues in the HD. Mutation of the HD of IBV E during infection results in impaired growth kinetics, impaired release of infectious virions, accumulation of IBV S protein on the plasma membrane when compared IBV WT

However, human coronavirus 229E, an important pathogenic virus but also a surrogate for MERS coronavirus, which is structurally very similar, was rapidly inactivated on copper alloys. Inactivation results from a combination of direct copper ion attack and reactive oxygen species generation. The latter is particularly important as the copper content decreases, ensuring that rapid inactivation still occurs in alloys with lower percentages of copper. Therefore, incorporation of copper alloys in communal areas could help to reduce infection spread from touching surfaces contaminated with coronaviruses. This is especially important in infectious disease where the infectious dose is low, surface contamination is high, and effective therapies are limited. The mechanism of action of copper is complex and may be enhanced by radical formation but is ultimately nonspecific, ensuring continuous kill and inactivation of a wide range of pathogenic microorganisms with completely different morphologies. Concerns about the biocide resistance, possible concomitant drug resistance, and horizontal gene transfer that have been observed with other biocides (51) can be allayed because of the destruction of viral nucleic acid observed following exposure to copper surfaces. It is not feasible to cover every surface in copper, and many materials in the built environment, including stainless steel, will continue to be used because of resilience, anticorrosion, and other beneficial attributes. Incorporation of even a few copper surfaces may have an impact in effectively reducing transmission of infectious material from a surface to an individual, provided that stringent, regular, and effective cleaning regimens are employed for all surfaces. The use of copper does not serve as an excuse to relax cleaning regimens. However, the choice of cleaning reagents is critical for copper alloys because it is essential to maintain copper ion release for efficacy, so avoidance of chelators is necessary.","HCoV-19 was most stable on plastic and stainless steel and viable virus could be detected up to 33 72 hours post application ( Figure 1A ), though the virus titer was greatly reduced (plastic from 10 3.7 to 34 10 0.6 TCID 50 /mL after 72 hours, stainless steel from 10 3.7 to 10 0.6 TCID 50 /mL after 48 hours). SARS-CoV-35 1 had similar stability kinetics (polypropylene from 10 3.4 to 10 0.7 TCID 50 /mL after 72 hours, stainless steel 36 from 10 3.6 to 10 0.6 TCID 50 /mL after 48 hours). No viable virus could be measured after 4 hours on copper 37 for HCoV-19 and 8 hours for SARS-CoV-1, or after 24 hours on cardboard for HCoV-19 and 8 hours for 38 SARS-CoV-1 ( Figure 1A ). This article is a US Government work. It is not subject to copyright under 17 USC 105 and is also made available author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.","The experimental study by van Doremalen et al further demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 may stay viable on copper surfaces up to 4 hours, on cardboard surfaces up to 24 hours, and on plastic and stainless steel surfaces up to 72 hours. 72 These data combined with the available epidemiologic and airflow dynamics studies of related coronavirus infections, suggest that GI procedures may contribute to nosocomial transmission of COVID-19. Thus, the use of negative pressure rooms with anterooms may mitigate the spread of the infection within health care facilities. The panel acknowledges that the use of a negative pressure room may impact efficiency and procedural workflow but anticipate that GI procedures performed during the initial pandemic phase will be predominantly limited to time-sensitive procedures performed in hospitalized settings.","Direct contact with contaminated surfaces may also lead to inoculation, for example when the health worker examines the patient and then uses the contaminated hand to rub one's eye or touch their face. SARS-CoV-2 is detectable for up to four hours on copper, up to 24 hours on cardboard and up to two to three days on plastic and stainless steel 6 .","Close contact is defined by the United States (US) Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) as: being within 2 meters of a COVID-19 patient for a prolonged period of time [16] \u2022 Recent investigation shows that the COVID-19 virus may suspend in the air for two to three hours (depending on heat and humidity, and presumably air flow), and exist on external surfaces for more than three days (more stable on plastic and stainless steel than on copper and carboard) [14] Exercising good hand hygiene is very important to avoid SARS-CoV-2 entering the eyes, nose and mouth after touching an infected surface","There was a significant difference in appearance between purified HuCoV-229E exposed to stainless steel and that exposed to copper surfaces (Fig. 6). On stainless steel, uniform virions were visible following a 10-min exposure (Fig. 6A), but on copper, clumps of damaged virus particles (Fig. 6B) as well as a few intact particles could be seen. The extent of damage increased upon further exposure to copper (Fig. 6C).","Zeolite powders containing antiviral heavy metals have many potential applications. They may be added to materials such as plastics, paints, and synthetic fabrics (Quintavalla and Vicini 2002; Takai et al. 2002), and may be bonded to surfaces such as stainless steel (Bright et al. 2002; Cowan et al. 2003; Rusin et al. 2003). The effectiveness of the Ag/Cu zeolite against substantially different viruses appears promising for its potential use in applications to reduce environmental contamination of fomites by viral pathogens and thus the spread of diseases. Additional tests utilizing zeolites containing copper ions alone or in combination with various metals against other disparate viruses are needed.","We have observed previously (27) that exposure to copper surfaces resulted in significant morphological changes to nonenveloped norovirus, where possible disassociation of the capsid subunits exposed the viral genome to copper inactivation. In this study, we observed rapid damage, including clumping, breakage, membrane damage, and loss of surface spikes, to the coronavirus particles following exposure to copper, and some particles appeared smaller and seemed to have lost rigidity, folding up on themselves. These changes were not observed with virus recovered from stainless steel surfaces.","The transmission of influenza can be mathematically modeled to help predicting how the virus will spread in a population [27, 28] . People who contract influenza are most infectious between the second and third days after infection, and infectivity lasts for around 10 days [27] . Children are much more infectious than adults, and shed virus from just before they develop symptoms until 2 weeks after infection [27, 29] . For influenza control it is very important to investigate viral shedding and resistant viruses [29] . According to Mitamura and colleagues [29] , viral loads are decreased after the start of antiviral agents, but resistant viruses are detected in some patients. Influenza can be spread by direct transmission when an infected person sneezes mucus into the eyes, nose, or mouth of another person; through people inhaling the aerosols produced by infected people with coughing, sneezing, and spitting; and through hand-to-mouth transmission from contaminated surfaces or direct personal contact [30, 31] . The relative importance of airborne, droplet, and contact transmission of influenza A virus and the efficiency of control measures depends on the inactivation of viruses in different environmental media. Weber and colleagues [31] systematically reviewed information on the environmental inactivation of influenza A viruses and modes of transmission. The airborne route is a potentially important transmission pathway for influenza in indoor environments. The importance of droplet transmission has to be reassessed. Contact transmission can be limited by fast inactivation of influenza virus on hands, and is more dependent on behavioral parameters than airborne transmission. However, the potentially large inocula deposited in the environment through sneezing and the protective effect of nasal mucus on virus survival could make contact transmission a key transmission mode. In the airborne route, it has been demonstrated that the inhalation of just one inhalable droplet (0.5-5 lm in diameter) might be enough to cause an infection [31] . Although a single sneeze releases up to 40,000 droplets [32] , most of these droplets are large and will quickly settle out of the air [31] . The influenza virus can also be transmitted by contaminated surfaces. Successful control of a viral disease requires knowledge of the different vectors that could promote its transmission among hosts. Thomas and colleagues [33] assessed the survival of human influenza viruses on banknotes, given that billions of these notes are exchanged daily worldwide. Banknotes were experimentally contaminated with representative influenza virus subtypes at various concentrations, and survival was tested after different time periods. Influenza A viruses tested by cell culture survived up to 3 days when they were inoculated at high concentrations. The same inoculum in the presence of respiratory mucus showed a striking increase in survival time (up to 17 days). B/Hong Kong/335/2001 virus was still infectious after 1 day when it was mixed with respiratory mucus. When nasopharyngeal secretions of naturally infected children were used, influenza virus survived for at least 48 h in one-third of the cases. The investigators concluded that unexpected stability of influenza virus in this nonbiological environment suggests that unusual environmental contamination should be considered in the setting of pandemic preparedness [33] . Bean and colleagues investigated the transmission of influenza viruses via hands and environmental surfaces; the survival of laboratory-grown influenza A and influenza B viruses on various surfaces was studied. Both influenza A and B viruses survived for 24 to 48 hours on hard, nonporous surfaces such as stainless steel and plastic, but survived for less than 8 to 12 hours on cloth, paper, and tissues. Measurable quantities of influenza A virus were transferred from stainless steel surfaces to hands for 24 hours and from tissues to hands for up to 15 minutes. Virus survived on hands for up to 5 minutes after transfer from the environmental surfaces. Their observations suggest that the transmission of virus from donors who are shedding large amounts could occur for 2 to 8 hours via stainless steel surfaces and for a few minutes via paper tissues. The investigators concluded that the transmission of influenza virus via fomites may be possible under conditions of heavy environmental contamination [34] . However, if the virus is present in mucus, the virus can survive for longer periods [31] .","and up to 72 hours on plastic and stainless steel surfaces 11 . Aerosol models in healthy humans have 24 measured droplets from coughing as small as 0.1 microns, with the vast majority (97 percent) of 25 droplets as submicron in size 12 . Viral aerosols, such as those generated by influenza, tend to skew 26 towards this submicron size distribution 13 . 27","The environmental survival of Ebola virus has been studied using culture-based techniques under a variety of environmental conditions (eg, temperature, humidity), in various liquids, aerosols, and surfaces. [43] [44] [45] [46] [47] [48] [49] These studies may be summarized as follows. First, viable Ebola can survive in liquids (eg, liquid media, tissue culture media, water, liquid blood, plasma) for days to weeks. Second, viable Ebola virus can also survive dried on a variety of surfaces (eg, plastic, glass, stainless steel, polypropylene, nitrile, bank notes) for days to weeks. Third, Ebola survives in liquids and on surfaces for a longer duration of time at lower temperatures (eg, 4\u00b0C vs 21\u00b0C). Fourth, although aerosol transmission has not been observed, Ebola virus has been demonstrated to survive in an aerosol for &gt;3 hours. Fifth, survival of Ebola on porous surfaces, such as cotton, is substantially less than on steel and plastic surfaces.","Metal coupons (10 by 10 by 0.5 mm) were degreased in acetone, stored in absolute ethanol, and flamed prior to use as described previously (19). Metal samples were supplied by the Copper Development Association and are described in Table 1. Coupons of nonmetal surfaces (PTFE, polyvinyl chloride [PVC], ceramic tiles, glass, and silicone rubber) of the same size were sterilized by autoclaving at 121\u00b0C and 1.06 \u00d7 105 pascals (1.06 bar) for 15 min. Stainless steel controls for comparison were also autoclaved for method consistency for these experiments.","The pathogen behind the current pandemic COVID-19 derives its uniqueness from its molecular structure, discussed above. Even casual contact such as handshakes is sufficient to spread this deadly virus, and its epidemiology makes it hard to detect this infection at an early stage. Scientists have found that the pathogen remains on surfaces for a long time ranging from 3 hours in aerosols, 24 hours on cardboard and up to 3 days on plastic and stainless steel. Worse still, a large number of affected patients don't show symptoms for five or more days after exposure.","Viruses causing respiratory infections are spread by droplets expelled by coughs and sneezes, which can also contaminate the environment 2 m and 6 m away, respectively (33), and a single droplet may easily contain an infectious dose (34). Enveloped respiratory viruses, although more susceptible to environmental stress than nonenveloped viruses, have been shown to persist on surfaces and contaminate more than 50% of surfaces in household and day care centers (35). Animal coronaviruses, including transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) and mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), have been shown to retain infectivity for long periods on hard surfaces (36) and for several hours on health care gowns, gloves, and masks (37), but human coronavirus 229E (HuCoV-229E) did not persist for above a few hours on surfaces (38). In contrast, we have observed that a relatively low titer of infectious human coronavirus 229E persisted on 5 surface materials, common to communal and domestic environments, for at least 5 days. Our virus preparation contained a high proportion of lung cell debris to mimic natural contamination in respiratory secretions, which may have protected the virus from desiccation, and a human lung cell line was used for the assay, which may have been more sensitive. The relatively low virus concentration used suggests that higher viral concentrations which can occur in sputum may persist for longer periods. During coronavirus infection, the viral load is highest later in the infection and large numbers of infectious virus which may also contaminate the surrounding environment can be shed as symptoms subside over long periods (4). There is scant information on minimum infectious doses, but for many respiratory viruses, the minimum infectious dose is believed to be low, i.e., just a few virus particles. Coronavirus persistence on surfaces represents a considerable infection risk if contaminated surfaces are touched and infectious virus transferred to the mouth, nasal mucosa, or conjunctiva. Nicas and Best (39) observed that individuals in office environments touched their face an average of 15 times an hour, giving ample opportunities for infection spread. The use of antiviral surfaces in health care and community facilities could help to reduce infection spread in this way. HuCoV-229E was rapidly inactivated on copper surfaces, with the inactivation rate being roughly proportional to the percentage of copper in the alloy. Alloys containing &gt;90% copper inactivated 103 PFU coronavirus in &lt;30 min, and a surface oxidation layer or increased copper ion release on C70600 increased efficacy, which has been observed for this alloy before (27). Brasses were more efficacious than copper nickels at a lower percentage of copper.","Background: This is the first large-scale study that focused on the prevalence of LTBI in the laboratory personnel, especially in the intermediate incidence setting. Methods: We recruited 173 laboratory personnel and performed QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube test (QFT-G) and tuberculin skin test (TST). Agreement between QFT-G and TST was analyzed, and risk factors for the positivity of each test were assessed. Results: QFT-G was positive in 21.4% of the enrolled laboratory personnel, and TST was positive in 33.3% with a cut-off of 10 mm. The agreement between the two tests was fair (kappa = 0.234; 95% confidence interval = 0.054-0.414). Age and duration of health care profession were significantly associated with positive QFT-G and TST results by univariate analyses. With multivariate logistic regression analyses, household contact to TB patients (P = 0.013), the laboratory sections of microbiology (P = 0.045) and chemistry/immunology (P = 0.014) were significantly associated with positive QFT-G results. Conclusions: Our data shows the high prevalence of LTBI in the laboratory personnel, and emphasizes the importance of LTBI screening for the health care workers. QFT-G seems to be superior to TST for the LTBI screening. T. Panayea, G. Petrikkos, A. Armaganidis, H. Giamarellou (Chaidari, Athens, GR) Objectives: Copper has been shown to have antimicrobial properties and when used on hospital surfaces it minimized environmental contamination by pathogenic bacteria. We investigated the effects of two copper alloys on the survival of VIM and/or KPC-producing multi-drug resistant (MDR) Enterobacteriaceae. Methods: MDR clinical isolates were screened for the production of VIM or KPC carbapenemase using the EDTA-imipenem or the boronic acid-meropenem synergy test, respectively. The genes were confirmed by PCR with specific primers. To assess the antimicrobial properties of copper, coupons (1 cm \u00d7 1 cm) of copper alloys (A and B containing Cu99% and Cu63%Zn37%, respectively) were sterilized, inoculated with 20 ml of bacterial suspension (10 8 cfu/ml) and incubated at room temperature for 0, 1, 3, 5, 6 and 24 hours. Then coupons were placed in sterile neutralizing broth (Difco) and vortexed. The broth was serially diluted and quantitatively cultured for recovery of viable bacteria. The lower limit of detection was 2.6 log10 cfu/ml. Stainless steel (C) and polyvinylchloride (D) coupons were used as controls. Mean viable counts (log10 cfu/ml) after incubation at each time interval with each coupon were compared for statistical analysis. Reduction of viable counts by 3 log10 from starting inoculum was characterized as bactericidal activity. Results: Thirteen isolates including K. pneumoniae (7), E. coli (4) and Enterobacter spp. (2) producing either VIM (2), KPC (10) or both (1) were tested. At 3 and 5 hours, mean viable bacterial counts on coupon A decreased by 1.2 and 3.4 log10, respectively while the reduction produced by coupon B at 5 and 6 hours was 2.1 and 3.2 log10, respectively. Controls C and D reduced bacterial counts by 2.1 log10 at 6 and by 2.3 log10 at 24 hours, respectively. A bactericidal effect was detected by coupons A and B at 5 and 6 hours, respectively. Viable bacteria could not be recovered from 10/13 tested strains incubated on coupon A after 5 hours and from 8/13 strains after 6 hours of incubation on coupon B.","EDTA, BCS, d-mannitol, and Tiron did not significantly affect the virus on stainless steel control surfaces or in suspension (not shown).","Incorporation of chelators ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) (20 mM) and bathocuproine disulfonic acid (BCS) (20 mM) to chelate Cu(II) and Cu(I), respectively, at the time of inoculation of virus onto the metal surfaces was investigated using a plaque assay. In addition, 20 mM d-mannitol and 20 mM Tiron (4,5-dihydroxy-1,3-benzene disulfonic acid) were used to quench hydroxyl radicals and superoxide, respectively. Stainless steel was used as a control surface and to determine if quenchers and chelators affect viral replication.","The coronavirus is one of the two most common pathogens for upper respiratory tract infection (URTI)[14]and it is also the most probable pathogen for SARS.[4]Transmission methods may, therefore, be similar for both infections. The WHO has reported that SARS is not airborne but is carried in virus-laden droplets.[1]This suggests that transmission is possible when aerosolised viral particles come into contact with the susceptible host\u2019s mucous membranes, most commonly the nose, but also with the mouth and eyes. The virus has been found to be stable in faeces (and urine) at room temperature for at least 1\u20132 days.[15]Transmission through a defective sewage system was, in fact, proven in the case of the outbreak at Amoy Gardens Estate in Hong Kong.[16]The SARS virus has been reported as occurring in saliva, tears and urine.[1]At the time of writing, no evidence of the SARS virus in a patient\u2019s sweat has been reported. Nevertheless, it is still reasonable to assume that the SARS virus may be present in a patient\u2019s sweat as it is in other bodily fluids. As summarised by the WHO,[1]the SARS-CoV has been isolated after 36 hours from seating, paper, a Formica surface, a plastered wall; after 72 hours from a plastic surface and stainless steel; and after 96 hours on a glass slide. It is, therefore, possible that the virus can be transmitted by hands that have been in contact with these infected surfaces.","Extensive environmental contamination has been documented by both culture and RT-PCR in clinical areas housing MERS patients. 84, 85 Positive sites have included patient room surfaces (eg, bed sheets, bedrails, intravenous fluid hangers), anteroom surfaces, medical devices (eg, portable x-ray machines, thermometers), and air-ventilating equipment. Touchable surfaces have been found to be contaminated through respiratory secretions from clinically fully recovered patients. 84 MERS-CoV has also been detected in air samples in the vicinity of patients. 85 However, 1 large outbreak evaluation failed to demonstrate any transmission via the potentially contaminated environment without direct contact with the index case. 86 MERS-CoV has been shown to be recoverable after 48 hours on steel or plastic washers (20\u00b0C and 40% relative humidity). 87 Further, no decrease in stability was observed during aerosolization experiments. Multiple studies on CoVs other than MERS-CoV have demonstrated that these viruses can remain viable for days to weeks on environmental surfaces. 88, 89 Survival is enhanced at low temperatures (ie, 4\u00b0C vs 20\u00b0C). 89 ","Brasses containing at least 70% copper were very effective at inactivating HuCoV-229E (Fig. 2A), and the rate of inactivation was directly proportional to the percentage of copper. Approximately 103 PFU in a simulated wet-droplet contamination (20 \u00b5l per cm2) was inactivated in less than 60 min. Analysis of the early contact time points revealed a lag in inactivation of approximately 10 min followed by very rapid loss of infectivity (Fig. 2B). As observed previously for norovirus, zinc demonstrated a slight antiviral effect compared to that seen with stainless steel (neither metal contains copper).","HuCoV-229E was purified from crude infected-cell lysate. Polyethylene glycol (PEG) precipitation (BioVision PEG virus precipitation kit) was followed by sucrose density (25% to 55%) centrifugation at 96,000 \u00d7 g for 16 h at 4\u00b0C. The virus band was resuspended in water and the virus pelleted at 77,000 \u00d7 g for 1 h at 4\u00b0C. The supernatant was discarded, the tubes were allowed to drain, and the final pellet was resuspended in ice-cold nuclease-free deionized distilled water after incubation on ice for 30 min. The preparation was applied to copper and stainless steel as described in the Figure 6 legend and was removed by gentle pipetting. Samples were fixed, applied to TEM grids, washed with water, and stained with 5% ammonium molybdate for 10 s.","A single study has examined the ability of MERS-CoV to survive in the environment [150]. Plastic or steel surfaces were inoculated with 106 TCID50 of MERS-CoV at different temperature and relative humidity (RH) and virus recovery was attempted in cell culture. At high ambient temperature (30 \u00b0C) and low RH (30 %) MERS-CoV remained viable for 24 h [150]. By comparison, a well known and efficently transmitted respiratory virus, influenza A virus, could not be recovered in culture beyond four hours under any conditions [150]. Aerosol experiments found MERS-CoV viability only decreased 7 % at low RH at 20 \u00b0C. In comparison, influenza A virus decreased by 95 % [150]. MERS-CoV survival is inferior to that previously demonstrated for SARS-CoV [152]. For context, pathogenic bacteria can remain viable and airborne for 45 min in a coughed aerosol and can spread 4 m. MERS-CoV\u2019s ability to remain viable over long time periods gives it the capacity to thoroughly contaminate a room\u2019s surfaces when occupied by an infected and symptomatic patient [153]. Whether MERS-CoV can remain adrift and infectious for extended periods (truly airborne) remains unknown. Such findings expand our understanding of the possibilities for droplets to transmit respiratory viruses in many settings, including hospital waiting rooms, emergency departments, treatment rooms, open intensive care facilities and private patient rooms. The nature and quality of air exchange, circulation and filtration are important variables in risk measurement and reduction as is the use of negative pressure rooms to contain known cases. Droplet spread between humans is considered the mechanism of human-to-human transmission and the need for droplet precautions was emphasized after the Al-Ahsa hospital, the KSA and the South Korean outbreaks [21, 23, 154, 155]. By extrapolation, aerosol-generating events involving DCs (urination, defecation, and preparation and consumption of DC products) should be factored into risk measurement and reduction efforts and messaged using appropriate context. The provision of evidence supporting the best formulation of personal protective equipment to be worn by HCWs who receive, manage or conduct procedures on infectious cases remains a priority.","An inoculum of 103 plaque forming units (PFU) persisted on polyfluorotetraethylene (Teflon; PTFE), polyvinyl chloride (PVC), ceramic tiles, glass, and stainless steel for at least 5 days (and 3 days for silicon rubber) at 21\u00b0C and a relative humidity of 30% to 40% (Fig. 1).","Previous studies have shown that murine norovirus (MNV) and human norovirus, highly infectious nonenveloped viruses that are resistant to environmental stress and impervious to many cleaning agents, are destroyed on copper and copper alloy surfaces (26\u201328). HuCoV-229E is associated with a wide range of respiratory disease from mild colds to severe pneumonia in immunocompromised people and has been implicated as an autoimmune trigger in multiple sclerosis (29, 30). Infection with this virus occurs in a high proportion of the population in approximately 3-year cycles, incurring considerable hidden costs in lost work hours, and in this study was also used as a surrogate for the more virulent coronaviruses responsible for SARS and MERS (rather than using animal viruses or coronaviruses that primarily infect the gastrointestinal tract). In addition, a recent study also observed that HuCoV-229E shares important characteristics with MERS-coronavirus and also has an ancestral link with bats (31). In this study, the ability of HuCoV-229E to retain infectivity on a range of common surface materials was investigated to understand the risk of disease dissemination. The potential use of biocidal surfaces to provide constant antiviral activity against continual surface recontamination could help to limit the spread of respiratory viruses; accordingly, the efficacy of a range of copper alloys to inactivate HuCoV-229E was also determined.","It has been postulated that coronaviruses can be transmitted from contaminated dry surfaces including selfinoculation of mucous membranes of the nose, eyes or mouth [4, 5] . One ml of sputum has been described to contain approximately 10 8 viral copies [6] . In a recent review all E-mail address: guenter.kampf@uni-greifswald.de. available data on the persistence of coronaviruses on inanimate surfaces were summarized [7] . Most data were described with the endemic human coronavirus (HCoV) strain 229E which can remain infectious for 2 h -9 d on different types of materials. A higher temperature such as 30 C or 40 C is associated with a shorter persistence of highly pathogenic Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) coronavirus. Few comparative data obtained with SARS-CoV indicate that persistence was longer with higher inocula. In addition it was shown at room temperature that HCoV-229E persists better at 50% relative humidity compared to 30% [8] .","It has been postulated that coronaviruses can be transmitted from contaminated dry surfaces including selfinoculation of mucous membranes of the nose, eyes or mouth [4, 5] .

At 30 \u2022 C and 80% RH, MERS-CoV remained viable for 8 h and for 24 h at 30 \u2022 C, 30% RH (van Doremalen et al., 2013) . By comparison, influenza A virus A/Mexico/4108/2009 (H1N1) could not be recovered in Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells beyond 4 h under any conditions (van Doremalen et al., 2013) . Aerosol experiments found MERS-CoV viability decreased by 89% at 70% RH but only decreased 7% at 40% RH when an aerosol was generated at 20 \u2022 C while influenza A virus A/Mexico/4108/2009 (H1N1) decreased by 62% and 95% respectively (van Doremalen et al., 2013) . MERS-CoV survival is inferior to that previously demonstrated by SARS-CoV (Chan et al., 2011) however for context, pathogenic bacteria can remain viable for 45 min in a coughed aerosol and can spread 4 m, thus MERS-CoV's ability to remain viable over long time periods gives it the capacity to thoroughly contaminate a room occupied by an infected and symptomatic patient (Knibbs et al., 2014) .

Droplet spread between humans is considered the mechanism of human-to-human transmission and the need for droplet precautions has been emphasised after the Al-Ahsa hospital outbreak Assiri et al., 2013a,b; Zumla and Memish, 2014) . By extrapolation, aerosol-generating events involving camels (urination, defecation, and the processes of preparation and consumption of camel products) should be factored into risk measurement and reduction efforts and the need to define whether a more stringent level of personal protective equipment should be worn by HCWs and animal handlers remains a priority.","Human coronaviruses such as SARS-CoV, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), or endemic human coronaviruses (HCoV) can persist on surfaces like metal, glass, or plastic for up to a couple of days51,56. Therefore, contaminated surfaces that are frequently contacted in healthcare settings are a potential source of coronavirus transmission. Dental practices derived droplets and aerosols from infected patients, which likely contaminate the whole surface in dental offices. In addition, it was shown at room temperature that HCoV remains infectious from 2 h up to 9 days, and persists better at 50% compared with 30% relative humidity. Thus, keeping a clean and dry environment in the dental office would help decrease the persistence of 2019-nCoV.","A Medline search has been done on January 28, 2020. The following terms were used, always in combination with \"coronavirus\", \"TGEV\", \"MHV\" or \"CCV\": survival surface (88 / 10 / 25 / 0 hits), persistence surface (47 / 1 / 32 / 0 hits), persistence hand (8 / 0 / 3 / 0 hits), survival hand (22 / 0 / 3 / 1 hits), survival skin (8 / 0 / 0 / 1 hits), persistence skin (1 / 0 / 0 / 1 hit), virucidal (23 / 3 / 3 / 1 hits), chemical inactivation (33 / 0 / 6 / 1), suspension test (18 / 0 / 0 / 0 hits) and carrier test (17 / 4 / 0 / 0 hits). Publications were included and results were extracted given they provided original data on coronaviruses on persistence (surfaces, materials) and inactivation by biocidal agents used for disinfection (suspension tests, carrier tests, fumigation studies). Data with commercial products based on various different types of biocidal agents were excluded. Reviews were not included, but screened for any information within the scope of this review.","Surface contamination has recently been found to be more significant than originally thought in the spread of many diseases (12). Symptoms of respiratory disease often result in continuous recontamination of surfaces which are then touched, and infectious virus particles may be transferred to facial mucosa. In addition, ineffective cleaning agents may leave residual particles that can initiate infection (13). The use of biocidal surfaces may help to reduce the incidence of infections spread by touching contaminated surfaces. Copper alloys have demonstrated excellent antibacterial and antifungal activity against a range of pathogens in laboratory studies (14\u201319). Copper ion release has been found to be essential to maintaining efficacy, but the mechanism of action is variable (20, 21). A reduction in microbial bioburden and acquisition of nosocomial infection has now been observed in clinical trials of incorporation of copper alloy surfaces in health care facilities (22\u201325).","a. Cover the autopsy table with an absorbent sheet that has a waterproof backing. Drape instrument trays, working surfaces, and weighing pans with plastic or disposable plastic underpads. Use clear 2-inch plastic tape to connect seams and to secure edges against the table. b. Because prion infectivity is retained after drying and the dried material is harder to clean from surfaces, reusable instruments should be kept wet between time of use and disinfection. c. Use disposable equipment (headrest, cutting board, scalpels, forceps, scissors, brain knife, plastic formalin containers) to the greatest extent possible. d. Dedicate a set of instruments for autopsies involving possible transmissible spongiform encephalopathies, to include Stryker saw, blade and wrench, skull breaker and hammer, 5-inch forceps, 5-inch scissors, and rib cutter. e. Reduce bone dust aerosol during brain removal. Place a plastic bag over the head, and tie it securely around the neck.","The mechanism of bacterial death on copper surfaces is complex, involving not only direct action of copper ion on multiple targets but also the generation of destructive oxygen radicals, resulting in \u201cmetabolic suicide\u201d (20). This was not observed for norovirus destruction on copper, presumably because of the lack of respiratory machinery (26). However, it appears that superoxide and hydroxyl radical generation may be important in the inactivation of coronaviruses on copper alloys but that inactivation on 100% copper surfaces is primarily due to the direct effect of copper ions. Following application of a wet droplet to a copper surface, the predominant ionic species to dissolute from the metal surface is Cu(II), but reduction to Cu(I) and the Fenton reaction with oxidative intermediates from cell debris, molecular oxygen, or viral envelope could produce the highly toxic hydroxyl radical. ROS are generated in the natural course of coronavirus infection (42) and contribute to pathogenesis and apoptosis. Fujimori et al. (43) observed inactivation of influenza A H1N1 pandemic 2009 strain by Cu(I) iodide nanoparticles which involved hydroxyl radicals and resulted in degradation of hemagglutinin and neuraminidase viral proteins. They surmised that, although there was no exogenous hydrogen peroxide to fuel the Fenton reaction (equation 3), Cu(I) reacted with molecular oxygen to generate superoxide (equation 1) and, subsequently, hydrogen peroxide (equation 2) (which could also produce hydroxyl radicals via the Haber Weiss reaction) as follows:","Ebola virus is not inactivated by detergents. 53 Using RT-PCR, Cook et al 54 demonstrated that Ebola virus outbreak variants dried with an organic soil load on a stainless steel carrier were inert after 5 minutes exposure to sodium hypochlorite (\u22650.5%) and after 2.5 minutes exposure to 70% ethanol. Smither et al 55 confirmed the activity of sodium hypochlorite; 10 4 Ebola viruses as measured by PCR were inactivated by 0.75% sodium hypochlorite with 10 minutes contact time. In a later study, Smither et al 56 reported that multiple disinfectants (ie, 0.5% hypochlorite, 10% hypochlorite, 5% peracetic acid, 70% ethanol) were effective against dried cell culture medium containing Ebola virus. However, only 5% peracetic acid consistently reduced Ebola virus titers in dried blood to undetectable levels. Based on the hierarchy of microbial susceptibility to germicides and studies of germicide efficacy, the CDC states that any US Environmental Protection Agency-(EPA) registered hospital disinfectant with a label claim for a nonenveloped virus (eg, norovirus, rotavirus, adenovirus) can be used to disinfect environmental surfaces in rooms of patients with known or suspected EVD. 57 In a systematic review, Kampf 58 reported that 80% ethanol was highly effective against all 21 tested, enveloped viruses within 30 seconds. A &gt;4-log 10 reduction of an Ebola strain was achieved in 15 seconds using the following povidone-iodine solutions: 4%, 7.5%, 10%, and 3.2% iodine with 78% alcohol. 59 Therefore, data suggests that hand antisepsis for skin contamination with Ebola virus can be obtained with either povidone-iodine or 70%-80% alcohol (although proper PPE should always be worn).","Widespread contamination of the surface environment has been reported by multiple investigators. 138 Importantly, contaminated sites have included sites in the patient's room such as surfaces, toilets, ventilator/respiratory equipment, and sites outside of the patient's room such as computer workstations, thermometers, glucometers, housekeeping carts, dialysis equipment, ultrasound equipment, and vital sign machines. 138 The environmental survival of C auris has been studied. 144, 147, 148 In laboratory tests, C auris and other Candida spp were demonstrated to persist for 7 days on moist or dry (steel disks) surfaces. 147 Survival on dry linen for up to 7 days has been demonstrated. 148 C auris cells have been demonstrated to remain viable on plastic surfaces for at least 4 weeks, or 2 weeks after they were no longer culturable. 148 ","Strategies to manage CRE colonized/infected patients and to control outbreaks in health care facilities have been reviewed. [109] [110] [111] Both the WHO 112 and the CDC 113 provide detailed guidance on methods to control CRE. The use of bundles to control horizontal transmission of CRE in health care facilities have been reviewed. 114 Environmental contamination and survival CRE has been isolated from the environment in the vicinity of hospitalized colonized/infected patients including pillows, infusion pumps, bedside tables, and toilet areas. [115] [116] [117] The frequency of recovery has varied among studies, but objects closer to the patient are more likely contaminated with 5%-15% of samples from bedrails and over bed tables yielding CRE. 115, 116 Fecal continence is an independent predictor of being a nonspreader of CRE. 117 CRE has also been isolated in the environment of long-term care facilities. 118 Havill et al 119 reported survival of CRE on stainless steel discs for &gt;10 days. However, Weber et al 120 reported that 3 species of CRE (Klebsiella, Enterobacter, and Escherichia coli) survived poorly (&gt;85% die-off in 24 hours). Likely this difference was owing to the fact that Havill et al 119 used a high inoculum (ie, 5-7-log 10 ) whereas Weber used a low inoculum (ie, \u00bb2-log 10 ), which is similar to the actual amount of CRE found on surfaces in the vicinity of patients colonized/ infected with CRE.","Conclusions: This study fails to identify any significant association between nosocomial CDAD and measures of ED crowding or increased patient contacts due to room changes or the use of multi-bed ward rooms. However, the validity of our methodology is supported by the association between antibiotic prescriptions and nosocomial CDAD occurrence, as already quoted in the literature. We note a temporal decrease in the reported rate of Clostridium difficile infection in our institution since the study period (April 1, 2003 -March 31, 2004 and suggest that the most likely reason is improving housekeeping practices over this period. thermal conditions to kill C. difficile spores in PBS (i.e. no organic challenge) was also evaluated using spore suspension testing at 80oC and 90oC. Two different makes of W-BPWs were evaluated. Results: Our data on suspension testing showed that the C. difficile spore count was not reduced after 5 minutes at 90oC. Simulated-use testing demonstrated that the ward-BPW when used without detergent, did not effectively eliminate C. difficile spores from inoculated plastic or stainless steel bedpans whereas the CPD-BPW did. The thermal disinfection default cycle in the two makes of W-BPW and the CPD-BPW was 80\u00baC for 1 minute. The ISO15883\u22123 guidance document recommends these thermal conditions as adequate for reprocessing of bedpans. Exposure to these conditions resulted in~1 Log10 reduction in spores. However, the 80oC for 1 min thermal cycle combined with the 116\u00baC drying cycle for 7 mins used by the CPD-BPW killed 6 Log10 C. difficile spores. Further testing showed that using an alkaline detergent along with the W-BPW did reliably eliminate C. difficile spores. Conclusion: Despite the wide use of 80\u00baC for 1 minute, our data showed that these thermal conditions alone were not effective in killing C. difficile spores. Only when alkaline detergent was used was the W-BPW able to eliminate C. difficile spores from bedpans. We recommend that alkalkine detergent always be used with W-BPWs to reduce the risk of C. difficile spores remaining on reprocessed bedpans as this could pose a risk for nosocomial transmission. (ST80) harbours an H2 haplotype which is described as the ancestral allele that gave rise to the other variants. These trends, although largely regionalised, must be taken into account when targeting skin infections as well as other infections, including community-acquired pneumonia. In summary, these emerging tendencies towards increased incidence of CA-MRSA and decreased susceptibility to antimicrobial agents must be considered when choosing empiric treatment options. In most, but not all, U.S. cities, CA-MRSA is now the most common pathogen cultured from patients with skin and soft tissue infections in emergency departments. Epidemic community-associated MRSA disease has also been reported from some rural areas. In Canada, a similar pattern of emergence is occurring with the West Coast being most affected. Of concern is the risk of greater incidence of communityacquired pneumonias caused by MRSA in the future. Although severe pneumonia caused by CA-MRSA was reported in children soon after this pathogen emerged in the U.S., reports in adults have been rare and typically associated with influenza virus infection. However, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported 10 cases of severe MRSA CAP in 2006; six of the 10 patients died. Although a small sampling of patients, these cases nonetheless underscore the need for healthcare providers to be extremely vigilant for cases of severe CAP caused by MRSA. The emergence of MRSA strains since 1961 has complicated the treatment of S. aureus infections, and glycopeptides (vancomycin or teicoplanin) are, in many cases, the only therapeutic alternative. Glycopeptides remain the first-line option when infection due to MRSA is suspected or diagnosed. However, vancomycin treatment failure is not uncommon, even when MRSA strains are fully susceptible to vancomycin (MIC 2 mg/mL). A reduction in the efficacy of vancomycin against MRSA strains with a high vancomycin MIC (1\u22122 mg/mL) has been described in observational studies with low number of patients, suggesting that subtle changes in the MIC may explain clinical failures. These findings require healthcare practitioners to consider alternative treatments and look to the future, as newer, more active compounds are developed to improve the treatment armamentarium against communityacquired infections with drug resistant S. aureus.","attacker. The most feared and studied use of plague as a biological weapon would be a deliberate release of pneumonic plague as an aerosol. 2 Aerosolized biological warfare agents, in particulate form between 0.3-5 mm in diameter pose a huge risk to the public in a bioweapons attack 46,62 as they can penetrate directly into the alveoli with normal inhalation. Y. pestis has the potential, in an aerosol form, to be a true silent killer; the particles could be delivered into the lungs without any warning. 62 As an aerosol it would be odorless and invisible to susceptible and unknowing humans of all ages and sexes. 17, 62 Therefore, the deployment of medical countermeasures would only be undertaken once cases were found from the emergence of signs and symptoms -for pneumonic plague this could take up to 4 days for some people, although most commonly signs and symptoms occur within 2 days. 25 Aerosol generators such as a Collison nebulizer, or other makeshift devices if needed, mounted on any form of vehicle, including aircraft, would enable mechanical aerosol release of Y. pestis. 3 The WHO estimated that an aerosol release of 50 kg of plague over a city of 5 million people would result in 150,000 initial clinical cases, and 36,000 deaths. Even more dangerous they reported, would be the transmission to secondary cases leading to a total of up to 500,000 hospitalizations and up to 100,000 deaths spread over a number of weeks, not including the spread to other cities. 3 Aerosolization involves a complicated process and can spread plague in either dry or liquid form. In liquid form it would be easy to disseminate with commercially available sprayers; however, it would be difficult to prevent the bacteria from dying during this process. Although release of a freeze-dried powder would be much easier, its production would be a very dangerous process. The major difficulty in aerosolization would be producing particles less than 5 mm in diameter, as any larger particles would not be able to reach the alveoli and hence be useless in propagating the disease. Therefore, the most difficult step in the process of creating a plague bioweapon would likely be its aerosolization. 63 Another possible release strategy could include air conditioning units and the use of the London Underground as a commuter hub. 46 This is a preferred location for an attack as it offers the opportunity to infect the large numbers of people who use the trains, who are in close proximity to one another (within the necessary two meters) making it easy to transmit to secondary cases. Moreover, in this transmission process, locating the source of the release would probably prove more difficult as passengers would be traveling to and from many locations. Furthermore, being underground there would be no direct sunlight to degrade the bacteria. 14 There would be multiple surfaces for Y. pestis to seed onto and survive on, as it can survive on glass and stainless steel for up to 72 h, 64 and theoretically the air currents in the tube network could then re-aerosolize the pathogen from these surfaces causing further dissemination.","The high mortality of Ebola coupled with the low inoculated dose required to initiate infection has led to a massive public health response in the United States, including screening by public health personnel of persons returned from epidemic countries in West Africa, development of specialized Ebola treatment centers, and training of thousands of HCP in the use of specialized PPE to minimize the risk of Ebola acquisition during patient care. Detailed recommendations on screening for Ebola among potentially infected returned travelers and management of patients with EVD are available on the CDC Web pages and in published articles. [65] [66] [67] Given the high volume of diarrhea and vomiting and the potential for fomite transmission, environmental control is a critical issue in the care of an Ebola-infected patient. Ebola virus may persist on steel and plastic surfaces for &gt;7 days. 68, 69 It may also persist in liquid media for prolonged periods. Sodium hypochlorite (0.5% and 1%) sterilized surfaces within 5 minutes, and 67% ethanol sterilized carriers at 5 minutes. 68 A &gt;4 log10 reduction of an Ebola strain was achieved in 15 seconds using the following povidone iodine solutions: 4%, 7.5%, 10%, and 3.2% iodine with 78% alcohol. 70 Consistent use of appropriate PPE with strict adherence to donning and doffing protocols is crucial to preventing acquisition of EVD during patient care. [65] [66] [67] A key component of reducing HCP risk is proper training in PPE donning and doffing with ongoing training to maintain competency.","Balb/C mice (6-7 weeks old) were also obtained from the Charles River Laboratories subsidiary. For cytokine studies groups of 15 mice Balb/C mice were immunised s.c. with 1 g of vaccine adjuvanted with 0.2% alum. Booster injections with the same formulation were given 14 and 28 days post primary immunisation. Mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation 21 and 35 days after the primary immunisation (five mice per group). A single cell suspension was prepared from the pooled spleens of five animals by forcing minced tissue through 200 mesh stainless steel sieves. Red blood cells were depleted by incubation for 5 min at room temperature with lysis buffer containing 0.15 M NH 4 Cl, 10 mM KHCO 3 and 0.1 M Na 2 -EDTA, pH 7.4 and the leukocytes were suspended in complete cell culture medium.","We produced a thermally-stable silicone-based holder encased in a 3D printed polylactic acid (PLA) housing (Figures 3F and S5) to characterize the performance of electrochemical sensing using the TriSilix chip.

To form biofilm, the 5cm square stainless steel plate was added in TSB of each bacterial suspension of McFarland No.0.5 and incubated at 37\u00baC for 24hr under anaerobic conditions. These stainless plates were added in water tank and irradiated a supersonic wave of 38 kHz for 5, 10 or 30 minutes. Whereas, a plasma flow generated by a dielectric barrier discharge in air at 12 kVpp with 2 k Hz was irradiated to another plates with each biofilm-formed bacteria for 1, 10 or 30 minutes. After irradiation, each plate was cultured on the MH agar plate at 37 oC for 24hr. Bactericidal effect was observed using the scanning electron microscope (SEM) and the above-mentioned cultural method. Results: Both strains of A. baumannii and P. aeruginosa except biofilmformed strains were sterilized by the supersonic wave for 5 minutes. However, biofilm-formed both strains were not sterilized by that of 30 minutes. On the other hand, all strains were sterilized within 10 minutes by the plasma irradiation. With or without biofilm, the bursting of bacteria by the plasma irradiation was confirmed using the SEM.","Similarities include the following: caused by coronaviruses of animal origin; severe respiratory disease; global spread through infected travelers; no effective therapies or vaccines; disease transmission to family and HCP; and infection control in health care facilities plays a critical role in limiting transmission. 87 Differences include the following: no evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission of MERS-CoV; limited evidence of superspreaders of MERS; slower global spread of MERS, likely because of lower infectivity; and higher mortality of MERS compared with SARS (may be an artifact of ascertainment). 87 MERS-CoV has been shown to be recoverable after 48 hours on steel or plastic washers (20\u00b0C and 40% relative humidity). 101 Further, no decrease in stability was observed during aerosolization experiments. This study, studies on SARS-CoV (discussed previously), and studies on other coronaviruses suggest that they survive on environmental surfaces for a sufficient time to allow fomite transmission. 102 Studies on inactivation of SARS-CoV (previously discussed) and other coronaviruses are inactivated within 1 minute by phenolics (1.3-2.0 log10 reduction) and 70% ethanol (3.2-3.9 log10 reduction). 103 Hypochlorite with a 1:00 dilution, had a 1 minute decrease of &lt;1 log10.","Excised gel band of interest was in-gel digested with modiWed bovine trypsin [14] . Excess Coomassie brilliant blue stain was removed by washing twice with 1 ml of 100 mM NH 4 HCO 3 , 50% acetonitrile for 1 h at room temperature. Then clear gel pieces were vacuum dried completely using a SpeedVac concentrator (Savant). The dried gel pieces were re-hydrated by adding 10 l of digestion buVer (50 mM NH 4 HCO 3 ) containing 0.5 g of trypsin. After allowing 30 min for gel pieces to completely absorb the solution, an additional 200 l of digestion buVer without trypsin was added to fully immerse the gel pieces. Digestion continued for about 16 h at 37\u00b0C. The digestion buVer, now containing extracted peptides, was carefully removed and transferred into a clean microfuge tube. The gel pieces were re-extracted twice by adding 100 l of 0.1% TFA in 50% acetonitrile and incubating for 30 min at room temperature. The pooled extracts were vacuum concentrated to reduce the volume to less than 10 l. A volume of 0.5 l of matrix solution ( -cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid saturated in 50% v/v acetonitrile/0.5% v/v TFA) was mixed with the same volume of the extract, then applied onto stainless steel target. Mass spectra were recorded in positive ion reXection mode of a matrix assisted laser desorption ionization-time of Xight (MALDI-ToF) Voyager DE PRO (Applied Biosystems). Peptide masses obtained were searched against NCBInr database without any species limit using the Mascot search engine available online (www.matrixscience.com).","In brief, the peptides from each gel slice in 1% (vol/vol) formic acid were injected onto an Acclaim PepMap C18 nano-trap column (Thermo Scientific). After washing with 0.5% (vol/vol) acetonitrile 0.1% (vol/vol) formic acid, peptides were resolved on a 250 mm \u00d7 75 \u03bcm Acclaim PepMap C18 reverse phase analytical column (Thermo Scientific) over a 150 min organic gradient, using 7 gradient segments (1-3% solvent B over 1 min, 3-15% B over 58 min, 15-32%B over 58 min, 32-40%B over 5 min, 40-90%B over 1 min, held at 90%B for 6 min and then reduced to 1%B over 1 min) with a flow rate of 300 nl min \u22121 . Solvent A was 0.1% formic acid and Solvent B was aqueous 80% acetonitrile in 0.1% formic acid. Peptides were ionized by nanoelectrospray ionization at 2.2 kV using a stainless-steel emitter with an internal diameter of 30 \u03bcm (Thermo Scientific) and a capillary temperature of 250 \u00b0C.","Lesson two: yet again, prevention is better than cure Clinically, MERS-CoV infection may range from an asymptomatic or mild upper respiratory illness to a rapidly progressive and fatal disease. 13e15 The majority of hospitalized patients with MERS-CoV infection present with fever and respiratory symptoms including cough and shortness of breath with clinical and radiological evidence of pneumonia. 16,17 Fatigue, myalgia, headache, and gastrointestinal symptoms such as vomiting and diarrhoea are also frequent. 16, 17 Respiratory and renal failure are frequent complications of severe MERS-CoV infection, in addition to acute liver injury, cardiac dysrhythmias, and coagulopathy. 16e20 Overall mortality is around 35.6%, but exceeds 70% in critically ill patients and in those with significant comorbidities. 1,18e22 For reasons yet to be understood, MERS-CoV infection is rare in children. 23, 24 In-vitro studies have identified numerous agents with anti-MERS-CoV activity including interferon, ribavirin, mycophenolate, cyclosporine and lopinavir. 25 The combination of interferon and ribavirin showed promising results in experimentally infected macaques. 26 However, in retrospective clinical studies the combination was not associated with significantly improved overall survival. 21,22 Treatment of patients with MERS-CoV infections remains largely dependent on supportive measures. 27 Diagnosis is confirmed by detection of MERS-CoV RNA in respiratory samples by real-time PCR targeting the upE and ORF 1b genes. 28 Samples obtained from the lower respiratory tract have higher viral loads and better diagnostic yield than those obtained from the throat or nasopharynx. 11,29,30 Moreover, viral shedding is considerably prolonged in symptomatic and severely ill MERS-CoV patients compared with asymptomatic infected contacts. 31 Interestingly, detection of MERS-CoV in blood has been associated with worse clinical outcome. 22,32 MERS-CoV may also be detected in stool for up 16 days and in urine for up to 13 days from disease onset. 11 Under certain conditions, MERS-CoV can survive on plastic and steel surfaces for up to 30 h. 33 In the absence of appropriate precautions, the environment surrounding a symptomatic MERS-CoV patient can therefore become extensively contaminated with viable, potentially infectious virus.","Zeolite (sodium aluminosilicate) powders (AgION Technologies, Wakefield, MA, USA) form porous crystals. Metal ions may reside within these pores and zeolites can act as ion exchangers, exchanging metal ions for other cations in the environment. Although the effect of metal-zeolites has been documented in numerous studies with bacteria (Bright et al. 2002; Takai et al. 2002; Cowan et al. 2003; Rusin et al. 2003; Kwakye-Awuah et al. 2008), the use of zeolite powders containing heavy metal ions to reduce coronaviruses and caliciviruses has not been previously reported. This paper describes the antiviral effect of suspensions of zeolite powders amended with silver (Ag), copper (Cu), and zinc (Zn) ions in phosphate-buffered saline against human coronavirus 229E and feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV; feline coronavirus). This report also includes tests of the survival of human coronavirus 229E, FIPV, and feline calicivirus on the surfaces of plastics with zeolite containing Ag and Cu ions incorporated into the plastic.","The preparation of MNC from spleen and MLN was described previously (VanCott et al., 1993 (VanCott et al., , 1994 . Briefly, single cell suspensions of MNC were obtained by pressing the tissues from spleen and MLN through stainless steel mesh screens of a cell collector (E-C Apparatus Corp., St Petersburg, FL). The MNC from spleen and lamina propria were treated with HEPES (Gibco, Life Technologies, Inc., Grant Island, NY) (25 mM, pH 7.4) buffered ammonium chloride ( 145 mM) to lyse splenic erythrocytes. The MNC preparations of spleen and MLN were isolated on Ficoll-Paque (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) after centrifugation at 4OOxg for 30 min at 4\u00b0C. The small intestinal lamina propria lymphocytes from the duodenum or ileum were isolated using modifications of techniques described previously by VanCott et al. ( 1994) and others (Wilson et al., 1986; Van der Heijden and Stok, 1987) . Briefly, after rinsing the tissues with Hank's medium (HBSS) (Gibco) containing 5 mM EDTA, the tissues were digested using 300 U ml-' collagenase (Sigma) and 0.25 mg ml-' DNase (Sigma) in RPM1 1640 at pH 7.2 with shaking at 37\u00b0C for a total of 30 min. Then, the suspensions containing MNC were combined, treated with the ammonium chloride buffer at 37\u00b0C for 7 min, washed with RPM1 1640 (Gibco) containing 5% fetal bovine serum, and purified by centrifugation (4OOxg 30 min) in a discontinuous Percoll (Sigma) gradient (40-60%). The MNC were collected from the gradient interface and diluted to 5 x 1 O6 cells ml-', 5 x lo5 cells ml-' and 5 x 1 O4 cells ml-' with enriched RPM1 1640 containing 8% fetal bovine serum, 2 mM Lglutamine, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 0.1 mM nonessential amino acids, 50 ,uM 2mercaptoethanol, 20 mM HEPES (pH 7.2), ampicillin ( 10 lug ml-' ), and gentamicin ( 100 pg ml-' ).","Aerosol challenge. Hamsters were exposed to MERS-CoV isolate HCoV-EMC/2012 using a 38 liter, whole body exposure chamber within a Class II biological safety cabinet inside high containment. The animals received a single, 10 minute aerosol exposure and were contained using stainless steel, wire mesh cages (2 hamsters/cage). Anesthesia was not administered to the animals. The aerosol challenge consisted of 5 runs with each run containing 4 wire mesh cages. Viral inoculum and collection material were prepared the day of the exposure using DMEM and 1% fetal calf serum. Aerosol particles were generated by a 3-jet Collison nebulizer (BGI Inc., MA, USA) operating at 7.5 lpm (25-30 PSI) and ranged from 1\u20133 \u00b5m in size. The contents of the aerosol exposure were collected in an All Glass Impinger (AGI, Ace Glass Inc., NJ, USA) continuously operating at 6.0 lpm. Both generator and sampler were flow checked using a frictionless bubble meter (Gilibrator, Sensidyne LP, FL, USA) to ensure the desired flow rates and pressure were achieved. In between aerosol runs a period of 5 minutes allowed the particles from the previous run to settle. The exposure chamber maintained negative pressure throughout the duration of the inoculation. An aerosol management platform (AeroMP, Biaera Technologies, USA) was used to conduct the exposures. The automated aerosol system controls, monitors, and maintains several parameters that impact aerosol studies [11]. Respiratory minute volume rates were determined using a formula derived by Alexander et al [12]. Weights were averaged for aerosol exposure group/run (n=8, n=40 total). A presented dose was calculated using the simplified formula D = R x Caero x Texp [11], where D is the presented or inhaled dose (expressed in TCID50), R is the respiratory minute volume (L/min), Caero is the aerosol concentration (TCID50/L), and Texp is duration of the exposure (min).","After the operation, sodium hypochlorite diluted 1:49 was used to clean the floor, the operating table and environmental surfaces as soon as possible. The cleaners all wore appropriate PPE as described above. All waste materials and disposable instruments were treated as highly contagious and were disposed of appropriately according to the hospital\u2019s guidelines. Samples collected for pathology and microbiology were placed in two clean plastic bags. If there was evidence of soiling, an extra plastic bag was to be used. Maternal SARS infection was clearly labeled on the laboratory forms.","Accidental self-inflicted cuts, particularly to the distal thumb and index and middle fingers, are the most frequent injuries sustained by pathologists. 10 This type of injury usually occurs during dissection or trimming of tissues for microscopy. The frequency of hand injuries sustained while performing autopsy procedures can be reduced by several simple practices (Box 3-2). A pair of scissors can adequately substitute for a scalpel during most autopsy procedures, including evisceration. The use of blunt-tipped, rather than pointed, scissors for almost all autopsy tissue dissection is advisable. When dissecting with a sharp implement in one hand, one should apply countertraction on tissues by using a long-handled tissue forceps held in the opposite hand; do not hold tissues with the fingers of the noncutting hand. For high-risk cases or dissections, steel-link gloves or some other scalpel-resistant material can be used. Plastic or Kevlar cut-resistant gloves provide protection while still allowing relative dexterity, and we encourage their use whenever possible."],"title":["Human Coronavirus 229E Remains Infectious
