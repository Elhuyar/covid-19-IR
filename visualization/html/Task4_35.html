The sporadic nature of these infections hampers our understanding of these diseases and limits the opportunities to design appropriate medical countermeasures against them. Because of this, animal models are utilized to gain insight into the pathogenesis of disease with the overall goal of identifying potential targets for intervention and evaluating specific therapeutics and vaccines. For these reasons it is imperative that animal models of disease recapitulate the human condition as closely as possible in order to provide the best predictive data with respect to the potential efficacy in humans. In this article we review the current status of disease models for highly pathogenic and emerging viral p...","The outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003 was controlled by public health measures at a time when specific interventions such as antiviral drugs, vaccines and immunotherapy were not available. Since then, several animal models have been developed for the study of SARS and, although no model replicates the human disease in all aspects, the use of animal models for SARS has led to the establishment of several important principles for vaccine and immunotherapy. Consistency and reproducibility of findings in a given model must be demonstrated to establish the superiority of one model over others. Here, we suggest aspects of an ideal animal model for studies of SARS pathogenesis and vaccine development and present our assessment of the strengths and limitations of the current animal models for SARS.","Recently, two coronaviruses, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, have emerged to cause unusually severe respiratory disease in humans. Currently, there is a lack of effective antiviral treatment options or vaccine available. Given the severity of these outbreaks, and the possibility of additional zoonotic coronaviruses emerging in the near future, the exploration of different treatment strategies is necessary. Disease resilience is the ability of a given host to tolerate an infection, and to return to a state of health. This review focuses on exploring various host resilience mechanisms that could be exploited for treatment of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus and other respiratory viruses that cause acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome.","Early analysis of outbreaks of novel pathogens to evaluate their likely public health impact depends on fitting predictive models to data gathered and updated in real-time. Both transmission rates and the critical threshold (i.e. the pathogen's 'reproductive number') are inferred by finding the values that provide the best model fit to reported case incidence. These models and inferred results are then the basic tools used for public health planning: how many people expected to be infected, at what scales of time and space, and whether potential intervention strategies impact disease transmission and spread. An underlying assumption, however, is that the ability to observe new cases is either constant, or at least constant relative to diagnostic test availability. We present a demonstration, discussion, and mathematical analysis of how this assumption of predictable observability in disease incidence can drastically impact model accuracy. We also demonstrate how to tailor estimations o...","Summary Respiratory viruses that emerge in the human population may cause high morbidity and mortality, as well as concern about pandemic spread. Examples are severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and novel variants of influenza A virus, such as H5N1 and pandemic H1N1. Different animal models are used to develop therapeutic and preventive measures against such viruses, but it is not clear which are most suitable. Therefore, this review compares animal models of SARS and influenza, with an emphasis on non-human primates, ferrets and cats. Firstly, the pathology and pathogenesis of SARS and influenza are compared. Both diseases are similar in that they affect mainly the respiratory tract and cause inflammation and necrosis centred on the pulmonary alveoli and bronchioles. Important differences are the presence of multinucleated giant cells and intra-alveolar fibrosis in SARS and more fulminant necrotizing and haemorrhagic pneumonia in H5N1 influenza.

We compare the interaction between the human ACE2 receptor and the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein with that of other pathogenic coronaviruses using molecular dynamics simulations. SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, and HCoV-NL63 recognize ACE2 as the natural receptor but present a distinct binding interface to ACE2 and a different network of residue-residue contacts. SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 have comparable binding affinities achieved by balancing energetics and dynamics. The SARS-CoV-2\u2013ACE2 complex contains a higher number of contacts, a larger interface area, and decreased interface residue fluctuations relative to SARS-CoV. These findings expose an exceptional evolutionary exploration exerted by coronaviruses toward host recognition. We postulate that the versatility of cell receptor binding strategies has immediate implications on therapeutic strategies.One Sentence SummaryMolecular dynam...","Abstract Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a newly emerging infectious disease caused by a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV), which has overwhelmed more than 30 countries claiming nearly 8400 cases with over 800 fatalities. Thanks to the unprecedented international collaboration, the whole-genomes of SARS-CoVs were successfully deciphered shortly after the identification of the causative pathogen for outbreak of SARS in southern China, in 2003. Hitherto, the SARS-CoV, as a viral paradigm of emerging infectious entities, has been extensively studied that has ranged from epidemiology, molecular virology/immunology to structural genomics. Also, several lines of breakthroughs have been record-brokenly obtained, that included the finding of ACE2, a functional receptor for the SARS-CoV, solution of the 3CLpro structure, a first crystal structure of SARS-related macromolecules, revealing of bats as natural reservoirs for SARS-like viruses and the possible involvement of civet cats in the...","Background: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) broke out in Wuhan, Hubei, China. This study sought to elucidate a novel predictor of disease severity in patients with coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) cased by SARS-CoV-2. Methods: Patients enrolled in this study were all hospitalized with COVID-19 in the Central Hospital of Wuhan, China. Clinical features, chronic comorbidities, demographic data, and laboratory and radiological data were reviewed. The outcomes of patients with severe pneumonia and those with non-severe pneumonia were compared using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA) to explore clinical characteristics and risk factors. The receiver operating characteristic curve was used to screen optimal predictors from the risk factors and the predictive power was verified by internal validation. Results: A total of 377 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 were enrolled in this study, including 117 with severe pneumonia ...","AIM: To characterize enzymatic activity of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus (CoV) 3C-like protease (3CL(pro)) and its four site-directed mutants. METHODS: Based on the fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) principle using 5-[(2\u2032-aminoethyl)-amino] naphthelenesulfonic acid (EDANS) and 4-[[4-(dimethylamino) phenyl] azo] benzoic acid (Dabcyl) as the energy transfer pair, one fluorogenic substrate was designed for the evaluation of SARS-CoV 3CL(pro) proteolytic activity. RESULTS: The kinetic parameters of the fluorogenic substrate have been determined as K(m)=404 \u03bcmol\u00b7L(\u22121), k(cat)=1.08 min(\u22121), and k(cat)/K(m)=2.7 mmol(\u22121)\u00b7L\u00b7min(\u22121). SARS-CoV 3CL(pro) showed substantial pH and temperature-triggered activity switches, and site-directed mutagenesis analysis of SARS-CoV 3CL(pro) revealed that substitutions of His(41), Cys(145), and His(163) resulted in complete loss of enzymatic activity, while replacement of Met(162) with Ala caused strongly increased activity.

Search Query performs well in forecasting the epidemics. It is still a question whether search engine data can forecast the drift and the inflexion in 2019-nCov pneumonia. Based on the Baidu Search Index, we propose three prediction models: composite Index, composite Index with filtering and suspected NCP(Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia). The result demonstrates that the predictive model of composite index with filtering performs the best while the model of suspected NCP has the highest forecast error. We further predict the out-of-the-set NCP confirmed cases and monitor that the next peak of new diagnoses will occur on February 16th and 17th.","Anthropization of natural habitats including climate change along with overpopulation and global travel have been contributing to emerging infectious diseases outbreaks. The recent COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan, highlights such threats to human health, social stability and global trade and economy. We used species distribution modelling and environmental data from satellite imagery to model Blueprint Priority Diseases occurrences. We constructed classical regression and Support Vector Machine models based on environmental predictor variables such as landscape, tree cover loss, climatic covariates. Models were evaluated and a weighed mean was used to map the predictive risk of disease emergence. We mapped the predictive risk for filovirus, Nipah, Rift Valley Fever and coronavirus diseases. Elevation, tree cover loss and climatic covariates were found to significant factors influencing disease emergence. We also showed the relevance of disease biogeography and in the identification potentia...","Background: As the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID19) is a worldwide pandemic it is rapidly expanding in Iran realtime analyses of epidemiological data are needed to increase situational awareness and inform interventions. In this study we built a predictive model based on the cumulative trend of new cases and deaths for the top five provinces. we will also look at modeling the trends for confirmed cases deaths and recovered for the whole country. Method: In this study we have chosen to apply the exponential smoothing model to iteratively forecast future values of a regular time seires from weighted averages of past daily values of the series. This method is exponential because the value of each level is influenced by every preceeding actual value to an exponentially decreasing degree more recent values are given a greater weight. The available data is too small to identify seasonal patterns and make predictable variation in value, such as annual fluctuation in temperature ...","Background Elevated serum C-reactive protein (CRP) level was observed in most patients with COVID-19. Methods Data of COVID-19 patients with clinical outcome in a designated hospital in Wuhan, China, were retrospectively collected and analyzed from Jan 30 to Feb 20, 2020. The prognostic value of admission CRP was evaluated in patients with COVID-19. Results Out of 298 patients enrolled, 84 died and 214 recovered. Most non-survivors tended to be males, old aged, or with chronic diseases. Compared to survivors, non-survivors showed significantly higher white blood cell and neutrophil count, neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR), systemic immune-inflammation index (SII, defined by platelet count multiply by NLR), CRP, procalcitonin, and D-dimer, and lower red blood cell, lymphocyte, and platelet count. Age, neutrophil count, platelet count, and CRP were identified as independent predictors of adverse outcome. The area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) of CRP (0....","SARS-CoV-2 viral infection is a global pandemic disease (COVID-19). Reaching a swift, reliable diagnosis of COVID-19 in the emergency departments is imperative to direct patients to proper care and to prevent disease dissemination. COVID-19 diagnosis is based on the identification of viral RNA through RT-PCR from oral-nasopharyngeal swabs, which however presents suboptimal sensitivity and may require several hours in overstressed laboratories. These drawbacks have called for an additional, complementary first line approach. CT is the gold standard method for the detection of interstitial pneumonia, a hallmark feature of COVID-19, often present in the asymptomatic stage of the disease. Here, we show that CT scan presents a sensitivity of 95.48% (std.err=0.35%), vastly outperforming RT-PCR. Additionally, as diagnostic accuracy is influenced by disease prevalence, we argue that predictive values provide a more precise measure of CT reliability in the current pandemics. We generated a mode...","Summary Emerging infectious diseases arising from livestock and wildlife pose serious threats to global human health, as shown by a series of continuous outbreaks involving highly pathogenic influenza, SARS, Ebola and MERS. The risk of pandemics and bioterrorism threats is ever present and growing, but our ability to combat them is limited by the lack of available vaccines, therapeutics and rapid diagnostics. The use of high bio-containment facilities, such as the CSIRO Australian Animal Health Laboratory, plays a key role studying these dangerous pathogens and facilitates the development of countermeasures. To combat diseases like MERS, we must take a holistic approach that involves the development of early biomarkers of infection, a suite of treatment options (vaccines, anti-viral drugs and antibody therapeutics) and appropriate animal models to test the safety and efficacy of candidate treatments.","An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and a rapid immunochromatographic test for detection of immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies in severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) patients were developed by utilizing the well-characterized recombinant proteins Gst-N and Gst-U274. The ELISA detected IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV in all 74 convalescent-phase samples from SARS patients while weakly cross-reacting to only 1 of the 210 control sera from healthy donors. This finding thus led to a kit sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of 100, 99.5, and 99.6%, respectively. The test thus provided a positive predictive value (PPV) of 98.7% and a negative predictive value (NPV) of 100%. In addition, the ELISA gave a positive delta of 5.4 and a negative delta of 3.6, indicating an excellent differentiation between positives and negatives. The same recombinant proteins were also applied to a newly developed platform for the development of a 15-min rapid test. The resulting rapid test has an excel...","Human coronaviruses (HCoVs) are large RNA viruses that infect the human respiratory tract. The emergence of both Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome and Middle East Respiratory syndrome CoVs as well as the yearly circulation of four common CoVs highlights the importance of elucidating the different mechanisms employed by these viruses to evade the host immune response, determine their tropism and identify antiviral compounds. Various animal models have been established to investigate HCoV infection, including mice and non-human primates. To establish a link between the research conducted in animal models and humans, an organotypic human airway culture system, that recapitulates the human airway epithelium, has been developed. Currently, different cell culture systems are available to recapitulate the human airways, including the Air-Liquid Interface (ALI) human airway epithelium (HAE) model. Tracheobronchial HAE cultures recapitulate the primary entry point of human respiratory viruses w...","BACKGROUND: Coronavirus can cross the species barrier and infect humans with a severe respiratory syndrome. SARS-CoV-2 with potential origin of bat is still circulating in China. In this study, a prediction model is proposed to evaluate the infection risk of non-human-origin coronavirus for early warning. METHODS: The spike protein sequences of 2666 coronaviruses were collected from 2019 Novel Coronavirus Resource (2019nCoVR) Database of China National Genomics Data Center on Jan 29, 2020. A total of 507 human-origin viruses were regarded as positive samples, whereas 2159 non-human-origin viruses were regarded as negative. To capture the key information of the spike protein, three feature encoding algorithms (amino acid composition, AAC; parallel correlation-based pseudo-amino-acid composition, PC-PseAAC and G-gap dipeptide composition, GGAP) were used to train 41 random forest models. The optimal feature with the best performance was identified by the multidimensional scaling method, ...","Abstract The recent identification of a novel human coronavirus responsible of a SARS-like illness in the Middle-East a decade after the SARS pandemic, demonstrates that reemergence of a SARS-like coronavirus from an animal reservoir remains a credible threat. Because SARS is contracted by aerosolized contamination of the respiratory tract, a vaccine inducing mucosal long-term protection would be an asset to control new epidemics. To this aim, we generated live attenuated recombinant measles vaccine (MV) candidates expressing either the membrane-anchored SARS-CoV spike (S) protein or its secreted soluble ectodomain (Ssol). In mice susceptible to measles virus, recombinant MV expressing the anchored full-length S induced the highest titers of neutralizing antibodies and fully protected immunized animals from intranasal infectious challenge with SARS-CoV. As compared to immunization with adjuvanted recombinant Ssol protein, recombinant MV induced stronger and Th1-biased responses, a hall...","The emergence of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), two strains of animal coronaviruses that crossed the species barrier to infect and cause severe respiratory infections in humans within the last 12 years, have taught us that coronaviruses represent a global threat that does not recognize international borders. We can expect to see other novel coronaviruses emerge in the future. An ideal animal model should reflect the clinical signs, viral replication and pathology seen in humans. In this review, we present factors to consider in establishing an animal model for the study of novel coronaviruses and compare the different animal models that have been employed to study SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.","Abstract The causative agent of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) has been identified as a new type of coronavirus, SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV). CD8 T cells play an important role in controlling diseases caused by other coronaviruses and in mediating vaccine-induced protective immunity in corresponding animal models. The spike protein, a main surface antigen of SARS-CoV, is one of the most important antigen candidates for vaccine design. Overlapping peptides were used to identify major histocompatibility complex class I-restricted epitopes in mice immunized with vectors encoding codon-optimized SARS-CoV spike protein. CD8 T-cell responses were mapped to two H-2b-restricted epitopes (S436\u2013443 and S525\u2013532) and one H-2d-restricted epitope (S366\u2013374). The identification of these epitopes will facilitate the evaluation of vaccine strategies in murine models of SARS-CoV infection. Furthermore, codon and promoter optimizations can greatly enhance the overall immunogenicity ...","Abstract Two novel coronaviruses have emerged to cause severe disease in humans. While bats may be the primary reservoir for both viruses, SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) likely crossed into humans from civets in China, and MERS coronavirus (MERS-CoV) has been transmitted from camels in the Middle East. Unlike SARS-CoV that resolved within a year, continued introductions of MERS-CoV present an on-going public health threat. Animal models are needed to evaluate countermeasures against emerging viruses. With SARS-CoV, several animal species were permissive to infection. In contrast, most laboratory animals are refractory or only semi-permissive to infection with MERS-CoV. This host-range restriction is largely determined by sequence heterogeneity in the MERS-CoV receptor. We describe animal models developed to study coronaviruses, with a focus on host-range restriction at the level of the viral receptor and discuss approaches to consider in developing a model to evaluate countermeasures agai...","AbstractWuhan Novel Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak has become a global outbreak which has raised the concern of scientific community to design and discover a definitive cure against this deadly virus which has caused deaths of numerous infected people upon infection and spreading. To date, no antiviral therapy or vaccine is available which can effectively combat the infection caused by this virus. This study was conducted to design possible epitope-based subunit vaccines against the SARS-CoV-2 virus using the approaches of reverse vaccinology and immunoinformatics. Upon continual computational experimentation three possible vaccine constructs were designed and one vaccine construct was selected as the best vaccine based on molecular docking study which is supposed to effectively act against SARS-CoV-2. Later, molecular dynamics simulation and in silico codon adaptation experiments were carried out in order to check biological stability and find effective mass production strate...","COVID-19 is an acute respiratory disease that has been classified as a pandemic by the World Health Organization. Information regarding this particular disease is limited, however, it is known to have high mortality rates, particularly among individuals with preexisting medical conditions. Creating models to identify individuals who are at the greatest risk for severe complications due to COVID-19 will be useful to help for outreach campaigns in mitigating the diseases worst effects. While information specific to COVID-19 is limited, a model using complications due to other upper respiratory infections can be used as a proxy to help identify those individuals who are at the greatest risk. We present the results for three models predicting such complications, with each model having varying levels of predictive effectiveness at the expense of ease of implementation.","The rapid global spread of the novel, pathogenic, SARS-CoV-2 causing the severe acute respiratory disease COVID-19, becomes a major health problem worldwide and pose the need for international predictive programs. Given the lack of both specific drugs and an efficient preventive vaccine, the expectation that the SARS-CoV-2 transmission rate might decrease in temperate regions during summer, dominated in the social scene. Here, we attempted a prediction of the worldwide spread of the infections based on climatic data, expressed by bioclimatic variables. The calculated probability maps shown that potential areas of infection follow a shift from the Tropical to Temperate and Mediterranean Bioclimatic regions. Maps show an increased probability of infections in Europe, followed by an expansion covering areas of the Middle East and Northern Africa, as well as Eastern coastal areas of North America, South-Eastern coastal areas of Latin America and two areas of Southern Australia. Our approac...","Accurate and rapid diagnosis of COVID-19 suspected cases plays a crucial role in timely quarantine and medical treatment. Developing a deep learning-based model for automatic COVID-19 detection on chest CT is helpful to counter the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2. A weakly-supervised deep learning-based software system was developed using 3D CT volumes to detect COVID-19. For each patient, the lung region was segmented using a pre-trained UNet; then the segmented 3D lung region was fed into a 3D deep neural network to predict the probability of COVID-19 infectious. 499 CT volumes collected from Dec. 13, 2019, to Jan. 23, 2020, were used for training and 131 CT volumes collected from Jan 24, 2020, to Feb 6, 2020, were used for testing. The deep learning algorithm obtained 0.959 ROC AUC and 0.976 PR AUC. There was an operating point with 0.907 sensitivity and 0.911 specificity in the ROC curve. When using a probability threshold of 0.5 to classify COVID-positive and COVID-negative, the algorithm ...","Coronaviruses (CoVs) have formerly been regarded as relatively harmless respiratory pathogens to humans. However, two outbreaks of severe respiratory tract infection, caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), as a result of zoonotic CoVs crossing the species barrier, caused high pathogenicity and mortality rates in human populations. This brought CoVs global attention and highlighted the importance of controlling infectious pathogens at international borders. In this review, we focus on our current understanding of the epidemiology, pathogenesis, prevention, and treatment of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, as well as provides details on the pivotal structure and function of the spike proteins (S proteins) on the surface of each of these viruses. For building up more suitable animal models, we compare the current animal models recapitulating pathogenesis and summarize the potential role of host receptor...","Abstract We summarize findings of SARS-CoV infections in several animal models each of which support viral replication in lungs accompanied by histopathological changes and/or clinical signs of illness to varying degrees. New findings are reported on SARS-CoV replication and associated pathology in two additional strains (C57BL/6 and 129S6) of aged mice. We also provide new comparative data on viral replication and associated pathology following infection of golden Syrian hamsters with various SARS-CoV strains and report the levels of neutralizing antibody titers following these infections and the cross-protective efficacy of infection with these strains in protecting against heterologous challenge. Finally, we summarize findings of a variety of vaccine approaches and discuss the available in vitro and in vivo data addressing the potential for disease enhancement following re-infection in animals previously vaccinated against or infected with SARS-CoV.","The CoViD-19 outbreak has escalated to a pandemic in the last few weeks, with no signs of stopping. Pharmaceutical solutions based upon virologic studies, at this point, remain inconclusive. In contrast, this paper looks towards epidemiological models during this phase of viral growth, in particular, by providing a responsive, timely model of the R value based on the previous few days' results. Such an R value, although bearing less statistical precision due to limited sampling, could allow R to become a more effective, responsive standalone measure of infectious transmission. It demonstrates that the R value can be used as a dynamic, time-dependent indicator without the use of curve-fitting, and also estimates the most recent R-value of the CoViD-19 outbreak to be about 4.29, based on the data from the previous 3 days.","The epidemic of a novel coronavirus illness (COVID-19) becomes as a global threat. The aim of this study is first to find the best prediction models for daily confirmed cases in countries with high number of confirmed cases in the world and second to predict confirmed cases with these models in order to have more readiness in healthcare systems. This study was conducted based on daily confirmed cases of COVID-19 that were collected from the official website of Johns Hopkins University from January 22th, 2020 to March 1th, 2020. Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model was used to predict the trend of confirmed cases. Stata version 12 was used. Mainland China and Thailand had almost a stable trend. The trend of South Korea was decreasing and will become stable in near future. Iran and Italy had unstable trends. Mainland China and Thailand were successful in haltering COVID-19 epidemic. Investigating their protocol in this control like quarantine should be in the first lin...","Background Approximately 15-20% of COVID-19 patients will develop severe pneumonia, about 10 % of which will die if not properly managed. Methods 125 COVID-19 patients enrolled in this study were classified into mild (93 cases) and severe (32 cases) groups, basing on their 3 to 7-days clinical outcomes. Patients' gender, age, comorbid with underlying diseases, epidemiological history, clinical manifestations, and laboratory tests on admission were collected and subsequently analyzed with single-factor and multivariate logistic regression methods. Finally, we evaluate their prognostic values with the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis. Results Seventeen factors on admission differed significantly between mild and severe groups. Next, only four factors, including the comorbid with underlying diseases, increased respiratory rate (&gt;24/min), elevated C-reactive protein (CRP &gt;10mg/liter), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH &gt;250U/liter), were found to be independently associat...","Abstract The aim of this chapter is to describe the animal models generated by transgenic technology for the functional analysis of the protective axis of the renin\u2013angiotensin system, consisting of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), angiotensin (Ang)-(1-7), and Mas. Transgenic overexpression of the components of this axis in general led to an ameliorated cardiac and vascular damage in disease states and to an improved metabolic profile. Knockout models for ACE2 and Mas, however, show aggravated cardiovascular pathologies and a metabolic syndrome-like state. In particular, the local production of Ang-(1-7) in the vascular wall, in the heart, and in the brain was found to be of high physiological relevance by the use of transgenic animals overexpressing ACE2 or Ang-(1-7) in these tissues.","Most new emerging viruses are derived from strains circulating in zoonotic reservoirs. Coronaviruses, which had an established potential for cross-species transmission within domesticated animals, suddenly became relevant with the unexpected emergence of the highly pathogenic human SARS-CoV strain from zoonotic reservoirs in 2002. SARS-CoV infected approximately 8000 people worldwide before public health measures halted the epidemic. Supported by robust time-ordered sequence variation, structural biology, well-characterized patient pools, and biological data, the emergence of SARS-CoV represents one of the best-studied natural models of viral disease emergence from zoonotic sources. This review article summarizes previous and more recent advances into the molecular and structural characteristics, with particular emphasis on host\u2013receptor interactions, that drove this remarkable virus disease outbreak in human populations.","Biosyntheses of proteins, nucleotides and fatty acids, are essential for the malignant proliferation and survival of cancer cells. Cumulating research findings show that amino acid restrictions are potential strategies for cancer interventions. Meanwhile, dietary strategies are popular among cancer patients. However, there is still lacking solid rationale to clarify what is the best strategy, why and how it is. Here, integrated analyses and comprehensive summaries for the abundances, signalling and functions of amino acids in proteomes, metabolism, immunity and food compositions, suggest that, intermittent dietary lysine restriction with normal maize as an intermittent staple food for days or weeks, might have the value and potential for cancer prevention or therapy. Moreover, dietary supplements were also discussed for cancer cachexia including dietary immunomodulatory.","","Abstract We report the design and synthesis of a series of dipeptide-type inhibitors with novel P3 scaffolds that display potent inhibitory activity against SARS-CoV 3CLpro. A docking study involving binding between the dipeptidic lead compound 4 and 3CLpro suggested the modification of a structurally flexible P3 N-(3-methoxyphenyl)glycine with various rigid P3 moieties in 4. The modifications led to the identification of several potent derivatives, including 5c\u2013k and 5n with the inhibitory activities (K i or IC50) in the submicromolar to nanomolar range. Compound 5h, in particular, displayed the most potent inhibitory activity, with a K i value of 0.006 \u03bcM. This potency was 65-fold higher than the potency of the lead compound 4 (K i = 0.39 \u03bcM). In addition, the K i value of 5h was in very good agreement with the binding affinity (16 nM) observed in isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC). A SAR study around the P3 group in the lead 4 led to the identification of a rigid indole-2-carbon...","Abstract An important effort has been performed after the emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic in 2003 to diagnose and prevent virus spreading. Several types of vaccines have been developed including inactivated viruses, subunit vaccines, virus-like particles (VLPs), DNA vaccines, heterologous expression systems, and vaccines derived from SARS-CoV genome by reverse genetics. This review describes several aspects essential to develop SARS-CoV vaccines, such as the correlates of protection, virus serotypes, vaccination side effects, and bio-safeguards that can be engineered into recombinant vaccine approaches based on the SARS-CoV genome. The production of effective and safe vaccines to prevent SARS has led to the development of promising vaccine candidates, in contrast to the design of vaccines for other coronaviruses, that in general has been less successful. After preclinical trials in animal models, efficacy and safety evaluation of the most promising vaccin...","","Abstract Objectives To develop and test machine learning-based CT radiomics models for predicting hospital stay in patients with pneumonia associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Design Cross-sectional Setting Multicenter Participants A total of 52 patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and their initial CT images were enrolled from 5 designated hospitals in Ankang, Lishui, Zhenjiang, Lanzhou, and Linxia between January 23, 2020 and February 8, 2020. As of February 20, patients remained in hospital or with non-findings in CT were excluded. Therefore, 31 patients with 72 lesion segments were included in the final analysis. Intervention CT radiomics models based on logistic regression (LR) and random forest (RF) were developed on features extracted from pneumonia lesions in training and inter-validation datasets. The predictive performance was further evaluated in test dataset on lung lobe- and patients-level. Main outcomes Short-term hospital stay (\u226410 days) and long-term...","[Abstract]Objective Coronavirus disease 2019 has become pandemic in the world. The need for IgG/IgM combined antibody test is booming, but data on diagnostic indexes evaluation was inadequate. The aim of this study was to evaluate diagnostic indexes of a rapid IgG/IgM combined antibody test for SARS-CoV-2. Methods A total of 179 patients were enrolled. Serum were collected for IgG-IgM combined antibody test and corresponding nasal and pharyngeal swab specimens were collected for SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR. According to SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR results, patients under study were categorized as PCR positive group in 90 patients and PCR negative group in 89 patients. Results 1. Of the 90 PCR positive samples, 77 were tested positive by SARS-CoV-2 IgG-IgM test kit, yielding a sensitivity of 85.6%. Meanwhile, of the 89 PCR negative sample, 8 samples were detected positive, resulting in a specificity of 91%. Positive predictive value, negative predictive value and accuracy of this test kit was 95.1%, 82.7%,...","The ongoing COVID-19 epidemic continues to spread within and outside of China, despite several social distancing measures implemented by the Chinese government. Limited epidemiological data are available, and recent changes in case definition and reporting further complicate our understanding of the impact of the epidemic, particularly in the epidemic\u2019s epicenter. Here we use previously validated phenomenological models to generate short-term forecasts of cumulative reported cases in Guangdong and Zhejiang, China. Using daily reported cumulative case data up until 13 February 2020 from the National Health Commission of China, we report 5- and 10-day ahead forecasts of cumulative case reports. Specifically, we generate forecasts using a generalized logistic growth model, the Richards growth model, and a sub-epidemic wave model, which have each been previously used to forecast outbreaks due to different infectious diseases. Forecasts from each of the models suggest the outbreaks may be n...","SUMMARYIn the analysis of genomic sequence data, so-called \u201calignment free\u201d approaches are often selected for their relative speed compared to alignment-based approaches, especially in the application of distance comparisons and taxonomic classification1,2,3,4. These methods are typically reliant on excising K-length substrings of the input sequence, called K-mers5. In the context of machine learning, K-mer based feature vectors have been used in applications ranging from amplicon sequencing classification to predictive modeling for antimicrobial resistance genes6,7,8. This can be seen as an analogy of the \u201cbag-of-words\u201d model successfully employed in natural language processing and computer vision for document and image classification9,10. Feature extraction techniques from natural language processing have previously been analogized to genomics data11; however, the \u201cbag-of-words\u201d approach is brittle in the RNA virus space due to the high intersequence variance and the exact matching r...","ABSTRACTSevere Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 is rapidly spreading around the world. There is no existing vaccine or proven drug to prevent infections and stop virus proliferation. Although this virus is similar to human and animal SARS- and MERS-CoVs the detailed information about SARS-CoV-2 proteins structures and functions is urgently needed to rapidly develop effective vaccines, antibodies and antivirals. We applied high-throughput protein production and structure determination pipeline at the Center for Structural Genomics of Infectious Diseases to produce SARS-CoV-2 proteins and structures. Here we report the high-resolution crystal structure of endoribonuclease Nsp15/NendoU from SARS-CoV-2 \u2013 a virus causing current world-wide epidemics. We compare this structure with previously reported models of Nsp15 from SARS and MERS coronaviruses.","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is optimized to spread widely: Its signs and symptoms are largely indistinguishable from those of other respiratory viruses. This commentary specifically addresses best ways to protect our hospitals against COVID-19.","SARS-CoV-2 emerged by the end of 2019 to rapidly spread in 2020. At present, it is of utmost importance to understand the virus biology and to rapidly assess the potential of existing drugs and develop new active compounds. While some animal models for such studies are under development, most of the research is carried out in the Vero E6 cells. Here, we propose fully differentiated human airway epithelium cultures as a model for studies on the SARS-CoV-2. Further, we also provide basic characteristics of the system.","AbstractCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a new emerging human infectious disease caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2, also previously known as 2019-nCoV), originated in Wuhan seafood and animal market, China. Since December 2019, more than 69,000 cases of COVID-19 have been confirmed in China and quickly spreads to other counties. Currently, researchers put their best efforts to identify effective drugs for COVID-19. The neutralizing antibody, which binds to viral capsid in a manner that inhibits cellular entry of virus and uncoating of the genome, is the specific defense against viral invaders. In this study, we investigate to identify neutralizing antibodies that can bind to SARS-CoV-2 Sipke (S) protein and interfere with the interaction between viral S protein and a host receptor by bioinformatic methods. The sequence analysis of S protein showed two major differences in the RBD region of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein compared to SARS-CoV and SARS-...","Contact tracing is a central public health response to infectious disease outbreaks, especially in the early stages of an outbreak when specific treatments are limited. Importation of novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) from China and elsewhere into the United Kingdom highlights the need to understand the impact of contact tracing as a control measure. Using detailed survey information on social encounters coupled to predictive models, we investigate the likely efficacy of the current UK definition of a close contact (within 2 meters for 15 minutes or more) and the distribution of secondary cases that may go untraced. Taking recent estimates for COVID-19 transmission, we show that less than 1 in 5 cases will generate any subsequent untraced cases, although this comes at a high logistical burden with an average of 36.1 individuals (95th percentiles 0-182) traced per case. Changes to the definition of a close contact can reduce this burden, but with increased risk of untraced cases; we estimate...","Aims: Temperature screening is important in the population during the outbreak of 2019 Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19). This study aimed to compare the accuracy and precision of wrist and forehead temperature with tympanic temperature under different circumstances. Methods: We performed a prospective observational study in a real-life population. We consecutively collected wrist and forehead temperatures in Celsius (C) using a non-contact infrared thermometer (NCIT). We also measured the tympanic temperature using a tympanic thermometers (IRTT) and defined fever as a tympanic temperature \u226537.3C. Results: We enrolled a total of 528 participants including 261 indoor and 267 outdoor participants. We divided outdoor participants into four types according to their means of transportation to the hospital as walk, bicycle, electric vehicle, car, and inside the car. Under different circumstance, the mean difference ranged from -1.72 to -0.56C in different groups for the forehead measurements, and...","Abstract Background In 2003, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) resulted in hundreds of infections and deaths globally. We aim to assess immunogenicity and protective efficacy of purified inactivated Vero-cell SARS vaccine in monkeys. Methods The cultures of SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) BJ-01 strain infected Vero cells were inactivated with \u03b2-propiolactone. Sequential procedures, including ultrafiltration, gel filtration and ion exchange chromatography, were performed to obtain purified inactivated SARS vaccine. The purified SARS vaccine was analyzed with electron microscope, HPLC and Western blotting. We immunized three groups of cynomolgus macaques fascicularis with adjuvant-containing purified vaccine, purified vaccine and unpurified vaccine, respectively, and a fourth group served as a control.

It could be used as a metric to determine how effective certain public health policies are, but in predictive models, it may be too fundamentally unstable. This explains why many previous models using a static R as a predictive variable did not make accurate predictions. As such, static R values are often misleading, and do not provide a good prediction of the situation. Trend-wise, it appears that the coronavirus R-value is about 4.3, and generally decreasing.","Self-organization and the evolution of RNA molecules as an origin of biological information are discussed in Chapter 1. Autocatalytic chemical reactions, such as replication of RNA, presents issues such as how to optimize a rugged fi tness landscape yet allow the study of evolution in vitro with RNA. RNA in vitro reduces genotype-phenotype issues to RNA secondary structure and minimal free energy states. This allows both continuity and discontinuity to be measured. These same issues are crucial for the study of RNA viruses, whose sites of secondary structure often defi ne replicator identity. These models currently offer the best system to evaluate an early and simple biological world for evolutionary principles (see Chapter 3). Viruses and viroids with their RNA genomes may be the only extant survivors of this pre-DNA world. Since it was the consideration of error-prone replication that led to the development of the concept of quasispecies (see Chapter 2), such models have provided a conceptual foundation which led to several basic concepts. Chapter 4 discussed the foundations and various aspects of quasispecies theory. Viruses appear to operate close to the error threshold, thus allowing maximum evolutionary exploration ( Biebricher and Eigen, 2006 ) . However, as presented below, the loss of the \" fi ttest \" type concept has also led to clear experimental evaluations of consortia-based evolutionary behaviors. Such behaviors were not predicted by classical Darwinian models. Although virologists were initially attracted to quasispecies models, many evolutionary biologists were initially hostile to the application of the quasispecies concept to evolution. It was thought that the classical mathematical models of population biology, as originally developed by Wright and Fisher, and later applied by Kimura and Maruyama to asexual haploid populations at the mutationselection balance, had already fully developed the needed models and precluded additional need for the quasispecies concept. The classical models were thus argued to provide adequate mathematical coverage for viruses, including quasispecies and error threshold ( Wilke, 2005 ) . However, these two approaches differ fundamentally with regard to the signifi cance of error-prone replication and it was the quasispecies approach that led to the clear experimental establishment that quasispecies selection, per se , is important for viral pathology and fi tness (see below).","The most immediately useful clinicopathologic information in horses with colic are the packed cell volume and total protein, because one can use them to substantiate clinical estimates of dehydration and they correlate strongly with prognosis. 20, 21 A serum biochemical profile is useful for assessing electrolyte imbalances, tissue perfusion (anion gap or lactate), and kidney and liver function. One can use serum biochemical or blood gas analysis to assess acid-base status. Horses with colic most frequently show evidence of metabolic acidosis associated with poor tissue perfusion caused by hypovolemia or endotoxemia, but one may note other abnormalities such as metabolic alkalosis in association with extensive loss or sequestration of stomach chloride. Metabolic acidosis has been investigated further in horses with colic by measuring blood lactate, although this test is not offered routinely in many laboratories. Lactate levels also have been inferred from measurement of the anion gap, although one study noted that lactate in horses with colic did not account for the entire anion gap. 22 Lactate levels and anion gap closely correlate with prognosis for survival. 20, 23, 24 Other key components of assessment of the horse with colic are abdominocentesis and complete blood count. The total white blood cell count and differential can provide crucial evidence of systemic inflammation associated with endotoxemia stemming from colic attributable to colitis (leukopenia, neutropenia, and a left shift) rather than an obstruction (highly variable complete blood count findings). Peritoneal fluid may be helpful in determining the integrity of the intestine. Specifically, as the intestine becomes progressively devitalized, the peritoneal fluid becomes serosanguinous as red blood cells leak into the abdomen, followed by an elevation in the total protein (&gt;2.5 g/dl) and progressive increases in total nucleated cell count (&gt;10,000 cells/\u00b5l). However, these findings do not always correlate well with the condition of the intestine, particularly in horses with large colon volvulus. For example, in a study of 57 horses with large colon volvulus, the average total protein (2.5 g/dl) and total nucleated cell count (1000 cells/\u00b5l) were normal despite the fact that only 36% with a 360-degree volvulus survived. 4, 25 These measures may appear normal because the development of severe mucosal injury following large colon volvulus is rapid and may not allow enough time for protein and leukocytes to equilibrate with the abdominal fluid. 26 Investigators have taken all the variables routinely assessed during evaluation of horses for colic and have attempted to develop models to predict accurately the need for surgery and the prognosis for life. [27] [28] [29] [30] None of these predictor models has taken the place of clinical decision making, although these studies have added 924 PART II Disorders of Specific Body Systems signs are excellent predictors of whether a horse requires surgical exploration of the abdomen. In fact, refractory pain supersedes all other predictors of the need for surgery in the colic patient. Once signs of colic have been recognized and categorized as to their severity, rapidly and effectively relieving the pain is critical for the well-being of the horse and to reduce the owner's anxiety. In addition, pain is best managed before it becomes severe. 13 Several classes of analgesics are readily available to treat horses with colic (Table 13. 15-3), including \u03b1 2 -agonists (xylazine, detomidine), opiates (butorphanol), and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs, such as flunixin meglumine). Although much of this information is familiar to most practitioners, several principles deserve emphasis. The short-duration drugs xylazine and butorphanol, which provide analgesia for 30 to 45 minutes, allow the veterinarian to determine if pain is recurrent within the time period of the typical examination. In contrast, flunixin meglumine is not as potent as an analgesic but has a much longer duration of action. To avoid deleterious effects on gastrointestinal mucosa and the kidneys, one should not administer flunixin meglumine more frequently than recommended. 14, 15 The recent discovery of two isoforms of cyclooxygenase (COX), the enzyme inhibited by NSAIDs, has resulted in discovery of drugs that can more selectively inhibit proinflammatory COX-2 while permitting continued constitutive production of prostanoids. Such specificity may be advantageous in horses with colic, particularly when one considers recent evidence of reduced intestinal recovery from an ischemic event with flunixin compared with a drug that is more selective for COX-2. 16 One should reserve the \u03b1 2agonist detomidine for horses with severe, unrelenting pain because of its tremendous potency. 17 In addition, one should remember that \u03b1 2 -agonists reduce the heart rate associated with a transient increase in blood pressure, 18, 19 thereby reducing the predictive value of the heart rate and pulse pressure. tremendously to understanding of the importance of some prognostic factors, particularly those reflecting cardiovascular function.","Early identification of an epidemic-level incident mobilizes all health services professionals, both in regards to human and to animal health, according to M. Van Kerkhove. Human and animal health and the state of ecosystems are inextricably linked, and it is believed that nearly 60% of EIDs, including those re-emergent, are of zoonotic origin. It is through this exploration of the connections between animals and humans that the means of transmission and propagation of MERS-CoV within the human species could be revealed. This virus is an example of a potentially epidemic emergence.","The differences between adherence to seasonal and pandemic influenza vaccination after the implementation of a vaccination program between health-care workers were assessed and compared by age, gender, professional category and workplace. Two different prognostic models for predicting adherence to seasonal and pandemic influenza were developed. In statistical analysis, univariate logistic regression was performed to identify risk factors associated with adherence to vaccinations. Multiple regression analysis backwards, stepwise variable selection was used to identify independent risk factors for adherence. The internal validation of the predictive models was evaluated by measures of calibration and discrimination power. Results: 7.6% of professionals were vaccinated against pandemic influenza, and 33.7% against seasonal influenza. Statistically significant differences were observed for both vaccines when comparing vaccinated to unvaccinated professionals as for age, professional category and workplace, while sex differences were only related to pandemic influenza. The predictive model of adherence to pandemic H1N1 vaccine, which showed a good discriminatory power (Area under ROC curve: 0.843), included the variables age, professional category, workplace and previous vaccination against seasonal influenza as independent predicting factors. On the contrary, the predictive model of adherence to seasonal vaccine, which showed a poor discriminatory power (Area under ROC curve: 0.567), included the variables age, gender and workplace. Both models showed a good calibration (table 1) . Conclusions: Adherence to pandemic H1N1 and seasonal influenza vaccination program was very low, which suggests the need to implement new strategies into vaccination programs aimed at healthcare professionals. A good model for predicting adherence to pandemic vaccine was developed when compared with the poor discriminating power of the predictive model for seasonal influenza vaccination.","Primate models have been used for many years to study respiratory tract infection and immunity to measles virus ( Figure 34 .1) (Blake and Trask, 1921b; Putz et al., 2003) , influenza (Renegar, 1992; Rimmelzwaan et al., 2001; Soike et al., 1984) , parainfluenza (Durbin et al., 2000; Hall et al., 1993; Schmidt et al., 2002) , respiratory syncytial virus (Belshe et al., 1977; Cheng et al., 2001; Hancock et al., 2000; Kakuk et al., 1993; Leaman et al., 2002; Teng et al., 2000) and, more recently, monkeypox (Zaucha et al., 2001) . The majority of published work is focused on vaccine development. Possibly the best studied example of differing host species pathogenicity, and hence the use of an animal model, is the case of measles virus. Both rodent and primate animal models have been used for measles vaccine research, but wildtype strains of measles virus do not replicate in rodent species, with the exception of cotton rats, so that vaccine-induced protective immunity can be tested only in humans or susceptible nonhuman primates (Putz et al., 2003) . Similar restrictions are a concern for animal models of influenza virus (Renegar, 1992; Soike et al., 1984) .","Animal testing is often the only available option, but many diseases lack even good animal models, and animal studies are technically difficult to conduct and typically limited in size. Consequently, regulatory science is needed to develop and validate improved predictive models. Regulatory science can also support the identification and validation of surrogate measures of product efficacy. Biomarkers that predict efficacy are not yet available for most terrorism threats, emerging pathogens or major global infectious diseases. Efforts to develop, refine, and validate new biomarkers may lower development costs and improve and speed the development of safe and effective products for unmet public health needs.","Although N/L, CRP, and D-dimer were independent risk factors for the severity of COVID-19, the ROC curve showed that they have a low predictive value for the severity of the infection. In clinical practice, a very high negative predictive value is crucial in the evaluation of a patient with the severity of COVID-19, since failure to detect severe patients could have devastating consequences for these individuals. This study suggested that the product of N/L*CRP*D-dimer had better predictive performance for the severity of COVID-19 relative to single biomarkers. The predictive value of N/L*CRP*D-dimer was also confirmed in the internal validation stage. The observed negative predictive value of .

The best predictive model achieved the maximum ACC of 98.18% coupled with the MCC of 0.9638 when the feature GGAP (g = 3) was selected, which indicated that the feature GGAP with parameter 3 had the optimal representation ability to distinguish coronaviruses with different phenotypes of cross-species transmission. As shown in Table 2, the number of false positives was 59. The reason for the false positives may be the sporadic infection of coronavirus that originated from an animal or a conflicting description of the ability of human receptor binding. With the improvement of annotation in the database, the false rate could be reduced [19].","Establishing an animal model of infection and disease pathogenesis is imperative for understanding several essential elements of viral disease in the infected host, including host tropism, immune responses, and modes of transmission, as well as for the progression of therapeutic development. Having an animal model that can recapitulate human disease is essential for vaccine and therapeutic development as well as testing. For a potential animal model to be susceptible to infection, the virus must be able to 1.) gain entry into host cells; 2.) overcome the host's antiviral responses; and 3.) disseminate virus following infection to allow infection of other neighbouring cells and tissues. It is also of importance for the model to be able to recapitulate human disease and viral transmission modes. When evaluating the ability of an animal to be infected by a virus and serve as a model, viral shedding, clinical disease, and seroconversion should be determined. The past animal models for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV were not universal due to the expression of the virus-specific cellular receptors for entry [63] . As SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV do not share a cellular receptor, they do not share the same host range and susceptibility, which includes research animal models [64] . Cynomolgus macaques, ferrets, and cats were some of the first animals to be determined susceptible to SARS-CoV [65, 66] . The advantage of ferrets is that they are a smaller animal compared to non-human primates and also are able to recapitulate some of the clinical symptoms and transmission kinetics of human respiratory viruses including coughing, sneezing, fever, and weight loss [67] . Although mice can be infected with SARS-CoV, as shown by recovery of vRNA and the elicitation of neutralizing antibodies, infection does not cause severe disease [68] . However, SARS-CoV could be passaged in mice (15 times) for the establishment of a model with clinical features [69] . After the identification of MERS-CoV, it was quickly determined that typical research animal models were not susceptible to the virus including mice, Syrian hamsters, and ferrets. Larger non-human primate models, such as Rhesus macaques and common marmoset were determined susceptible. To make use of small animal models, transgenic mice have been engineered for MERS-CoV susceptibility through expression of the human DPP4 receptor [70] . Other attempts at other mouse model developments were not successful, including an immunocompromised 129/SATA1-/-1 mouse [63] . Having an understanding of the animal models and model development previously utilized for the other coronaviruses of interest will aid in the development of a model for 2019-nCoV. As is necessary, elucidation of the receptor will help guide in development, and creating a clinical picture of the acute symptoms in humans will be essential for vaccine and antiviral evaluation.","Mathematical models have been used to simulate scenarios and predict evolution of infectious diseases since the early 20th century. 11 Models are usually driven by a disease's intrinsic mechanism or fitted through sufficient data, but they are frequently expected to provide quick insights of, and predictive power on, a new pathogen in the early stages of an outbreak, which are seemingly contradictory expectations. 2, 12 Indeed, it is not clear whether early cases of COVID-19 were from infection by animal or human, and data are limited and unreliable. In this case, models fitted by early data probably produce results divorced from reality. Early modelling studies have proved overly optimistic about the situation in Wuhan. 12 The closer to reality, the more resources a model requires. Modellers must compromise with reality most of the time.","Patient numbers were aggregated across all included studies for each group included in the meta-analysis. Gender was compared between groups using the Chi2 test in STATA (15). This was not possible for age due to a lack of individuallevel data. The predictive value of symptoms and comorbidities for each of severe disease and ICU admission was estimated with random effects meta-analysis in STATA. Random effects models were used to account for between study heterogeneity (16) , which was estimated with Tau-squared. This provided a pooled odds ratio (pOR), 95% confidence intervals, and a p-value, for each symptom or comorbidity. A p-value of &lt;0.05 was used as a marker for evidence of significant association. Detailed forest plots of the predictive symptoms and comorbidities common to both disease severity and ICU admission are illustrated in the supplementary information file","1. Sensitivity; 2.

Meanwhile, a medium RB value (0.5 \u2212 0.9 in general) could take the requirements on model robustness and sensitivity into consideration at the same time. Among 27 groups (9 cases times 3 groups of models) under comparison, the AICc value helps to find out 18 best models (by RMSE), and the rest 9 best models all have the second lowest AICc values (see Table. I and Table. II for details).","Between January 10 and February 3, 2020, there were 9,059 patients attending the ED. A total of 419 patients were referred to the designated clinic. COVID-19 pneumonia was diagnosed in 20 of them, which corresponds to a positive predictive value of 4.8% (20/419) of the screening criteria. The clinical symptoms of our patients were largely similar to those reported elsewhere. 1 Five patients (25%) did not have respiratory symptoms but had fatigue, myalgia, or nausea instead. All patients except 1 were stable, which contrasts with the findings in a case series of 99 patients, of whom 17% developed acute respiratory distress syndrome. 2 From the ED perspective, several lessons are apparent. Effective screening procedures in the ED are essential. A positive predictive value of 4.8% of our screening criteria is low, but it can be explained by the low prevalence of the disease in Shenzhen (245 cases as of February 3). Clinical features do not seem helpful in diagnosis because 25% of our patients did not have respiratory symptoms. Therefore, the importance of clinical vigilance cannot be overemphasized. CT scan is preferred to chest radiograph in aiding diagnosis because the sensitivity and positive predictive value of the latter for pneumonia are poor. 3 To the best of our knowledge, there has been no research published on COVID-19 by the emergency medicine community. Because interdisciplinary collaboration is critical to manage the outbreak, we look forward to more ED-based research.

However, there were many obstacles in SARS vaccine development. Firstly, researchers did not have a comprehensive understanding of the pathogenic mechanism of SARS-CoV. Secondly, animal models of SARS-CoV infection could not simulate human disease because of an incongruent pathogenesis. Thirdly, in order to test the efficacy, many people must be tested in areas where the virus is endemic. Once the SARS epidemic ended, human trials were not possible [59] . Although several candidate vaccines against SARS-CoV have been produced and tested, at present, unfortunately, there is no FDA approved vaccine against SARS.","Exploration of temporal structure, i.e. presence of molecular clock in the data, was assessed by regression of divergence -root-to-tip genetic distance-against sampling time using TempEst 19 . In this case, absence of a linear trend indicates that the data does not contain temporal signal and that the data is not appropriate for phylogenetic inference using molecular clock models.","The outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003 was controlled by public health measures at a time when specific interventions such as antiviral drugs, vaccines and immunotherapy were not available. Since then, several animal models have been developed for the study of SARS and, although no model replicates the human disease in all aspects, the use of animal models for SARS has led to the establishment of several important principles for vaccine and immunotherapy. Consistency and reproducibility of findings in a given model must be demonstrated to establish the superiority of one model over others. Here, we suggest aspects of an ideal animal model for studies of SARS pathogenesis and vaccine development and present our assessment of the strengths and limitations of the current animal models for SARS.","\u2022 Defi nitive diagnosis is diffi cult without surgical exploration.

Prediction. It is a very one-sided pursuit of the lowest fitting errors (measured by MSE, RMSE, correlation coefficients, etc.) for a predictive model, though it is always the case in most published works! In fact, there are tremendous evidences to show that the best fitting does not always lead to the best forecast (see the Boltzmann factor).","Using receiver operating characteristic analysis, the predictive value of the NLR for the incidence of severe illness was compared to that of the MuLBSTA and CURB-6 models. The results showed that the NLR had the highest area under curve (AUC) (0.849), and had higher sensitivity and specificity than the other two models ( Table 2 ). ","When using the threshold of 0.5 to make COVID-19 detection prediction (i.e., if the probability of COVID-19 was larger than 0.5, the patient was classified as COVID-positive, and vice versa), the algorithm obtained an accuracy of 0.901 with a positive predictive value (PPV) of 0.840 and a negative predictive value (NPV) of 0.982. By varying the probability threshold, we obtained a series of COVID-19 detection accuracy, PPV and NPV in Table 2 . Our data showed that the COVID-19 prediction accuracy obtained by the DeCoVNet algorithm was higher than 0.9 when the threshold ranged from 0.2 to 0.5. At the threshold setting of 0.5, there were 12 false positive predictions in total and only one false positive prediction by the algorithm in our study, indicating that the algorithm to have a very high negative predictive value.","Abdominocentesis. Cytologic, biochemical and immunologic tests on the abdominal fluid are more useful than blood tests. These tests include: \u2022 Cytology. Peritoneal fluid from a cat with wet FIP will typically reveal a non-septic exudate. The fluid is pale to straw-colored, may contain white flecks (fibrin) and may clot upon standing. Cytology reveals a high-protein background (stippling, crescent formation) and mature neutrophils. Chylous effusion may also occur. \u2022 Total protein, albumin and globulin levels. As in serum, but of more diagnostic value: the higher the total protein and globulin level, and lower the albumin to globulin ratio, the more likely the cat has FIP. Total protein \u2265 120 g/L (12 g/dl) had a specificity of 99% and positive predictive value of 89% in one study, while gamma-globulins \u2265 30 g/L (3.0 g/dl) and gamma-globulin content &gt;32% in the fluid as demonstrated by protein electrophoresis have been reported to have 100% specificity and positive predictive values for FIP. An albumin to globulin ratio of 1 was reported to have a negative predictive value of 91% (and a higher ratio would presumably have a higher negative predictive value.) -Rivalta's test is useful to confirm that the fluid is an exudate, by testing for coagulation of protein in an acetic acid solution. Five ml of distilled water and one drop of 98% (glacial) acetic acid are mixed in a test tube. Vinegar should be a practical alternative to use as a point-of-care test.","Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) of the SARS-CoV rNP-based IgG ELISA were calculated in comparison with neutralizing antibody assay or with naive SARS-CoV antigen-based IgG ELISA (Qing et al., 2003) .","We input the daily numbers of CCCs or DCs and their corresponding days to Eureqa to obtain a formula which perfectly shapes the relationship between both variables. Due to insufficient sample size of the datasets for COVID-19 cases outside China because of their recent outbreak, we did not directly use Eureqa to build the predictive models for the COVID-19 epidemic trend outside China. Instead, we derived the predictive models from the models for the China cases on the assumption that the COVID-19 epidemic trend outside China is similar to that in China with a time lag.","Considerably less is known of the relationships between the evolution of RNA viruses with respect to virulence. The dynamics of quasispecies has explained the failure of monotherapy and synthetic antiviral vaccine but opened up new avenues for exploration [14]. Specifically, unanswered questions pertaining to quasispecies remain\u2014What are the underlying mutations responsible for long term tenacity compared to those of extinction? Are there any molecular determinants which are the root cause of higher virulence in a quasispecies population?","The NCIP is considered a relative of the deadly Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) coronaviruses. They are characterized by pneumonia symptoms, such as fever, radiographic evidence of pneumonia, respiratory symptoms and possibly transmitted from animal to human [3] [4] [5] . The public health authorities proposed NCIP definitions that combined clinical features (e.g., fever, cough, and anhelation) with epidemiological factors (e.g., travel to a seafood and wet animal wholesale market in Wuhan or direct contact with another patient with NCIP) to improve diagnostic accuracy [6, 7] . Unfortunately, these epidemiological features are not specific and have poor positive predictive value during the outbreak.","Very rapid tests include Becton-Dickinson Influenza A and Influenza A/B, enzyme immunoassays (EIA), Zstat Flu, an endogenous viral encoded assay (EVEA), FluOIA, an optical immunoassay (OIA), Quickvue Influenza, a lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA), and Binax Now Flu A and Flu B, an immunochromatographic membrane (ICT) assay. The ZStat Flu, QuickVue Influenza, and Binax Now FluA and FluB are currently CLIA-waived which allows for in-clinic testing. The features of the different assays have been summarized recently (Nicholson et al., 2003) . Unfortunately, reported sensitivities and specificities of these various tests cannot be directly compared, since different 'gold standards', source populations, sample types (fresh versus frozen; nasal versus throat), and operators (i.e. research laboratory versus clinical laboratory versus physician office) were used to evaluate each test. Use of a particular rapid diagnostic test for influenza should be determined according to the level of identification needed (influenza A or B versus influenza A and B), price, CLIA status, specimen type, staff familiarity with methods, turn-around-time, and relative sensitivity and specificity of the test. Additionally, the predictive value depends on the prevalence of disease. For example, if the sensitivity and specificity of the test was 80%, and the prevalence of influenza was 5%, the positive predictive value (PPV) of the test would be 17%; if the prevalence was 20%, the PPV would be 50%. Rapid testing is best used in individuals with a strong pre-test probability of influenza during the influenza season. When clinically important (for example, in hospitalized patients), negative rapid test results should be confirmed by culture.","The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is . https://doi. org/10.1101 org/10. /2020 Note: PPV, positive predictive value; NPV, negative predictive value. 248 249 All rights reserved.

Two types of data that may be used in the future extension are the daily number of suspected cases and the daily number of hospitalized cases.

For example, the number of suspected cases is largely dependent on the diagnostic protocols, which have been revised a few times since the outbreak of the disease, and the sensitivity of the RNA test. Given such concerns, our strategy in the proposed model was to only use necessary data for analysis, and over the course of improved data quality in the near future, our toolbox may be extended to enjoy greater statistical power and more accurate predictions.","Higher proportions of disease were transmitted by insect vectors or belonged to stage 5 pathogens in the temperate climate compared to the tropics (Wolfe et al., 2007) .

Tissue core biopsy or surgical wedge biopsy yield improved diagnostic accuracy. \u2022 Surgical exploration and wedge biopsy are required if there is evidence of extra-hepatic biliary stasis, severe biliary sludging or clinically significant choleliths. \u2022 In addition, surgical exploration permits a complete evaluation of the biliary tree and pancreas, aspiration of bile for culture (although this may be carried out percutaneously by ultrasound guidance), biopsy of pancreas, and intestine and placement of feeding tubes.","The New Coronavirus Pneumonia Prevention and Control Program (7th edition) published by the National Health Commission of China also recommended that any suspicious cases together with positive IgM/IgG antibodies can be deemed as positive COVID-19 cases. However, data concentrating on its sensitivity, specificity were inadequate, which were of paramount value in the decision whether, when and how to use IgM/IgG antibodies detection. The aim of this study was to evaluate the sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), especially Kappa efficiency with PCR and its anti-interference ability.

However, these cases are difficult to treat because of the patchy distribution of the lesions and the possibility of lesions extending beyond the limits of surgical resection. In addition, further infarction may occur following surgery. The prognosis is fair for horses with intermittent mild episodes of colic that may be amenable to medical therapy but is poor in horses that require surgical intervention. 77, 78 surgical exploration of a horse with on-going intestinal injury exacerbates shock induced largely by endotoxin traversing damaged mucosa, and this in turn correlates with mortality. 3","Diagnosis for some respiratory infections is achievable within 2-3 hours using techniques such as antigen detection (see below). However, these techniques are not universally available, even in hospitals in the developed world, mainly because they are labour-and expertise-intensive. Commercially available point-of-care diagnostic tests, usually lateral flow assays in 'kit format' , are available for the diagnosis of influenza virus A and B and for RSV. They are however, expensive, and while they have adequate positive and negative predictive value of infection during influenza epidemics, they can have poor predictive values during periods of low influenza activity. 66 The increasing need to accurately detect avian influenza H5N1 is best done by sensitive molecular methods (e.g. RT-PCR) because other techniques are less sensitive and virus culture necessitates biosafety level 3 facilities. This is driving reference laboratories, especially in developing countries where H5N1 disease sporadically occurs, to invest in these newer technologies. In time, this will hopefully allow molecular tests for multiple respiratory pathogens (Multiplex PCR) to be undertaken in these same laboratories. However, these methods remain resource-and expertise-intensive and need regular quality control exercises. Microarray techniques that have the potential to detect multiple pathogens in a single test are in development. These methods have enormous potential ","Abdominal imaging or surgical exploration may be necessary to confirm the hernia.","Patients with N/L*CRP*D-dimer results of less than 5.32 were classified as patients with non-severe pneumonia in predicted groups. Otherwise, they were classified as patients with severe pneumonia. As can be seen from Tables 4 and 5, the negative predictive value (a diagnosis of non-severe pneumonia) of less than 5.32 for the N/L*CRP*D-dimer was 93.75% (95% CI: 0.8456-0.9799), and the positive predictive value (a diagnosis of severe pneumonia)","Moreover, most of the concerns leading to the undervaluation of CT as a first line diagnostic test stem from overrating specificity instead of predictive values. A more informative approach to measure the effective performance of a diagnostic test used to screen a given population, e.g. patients with clinical suspicion of COVID-19, should measure the fraction of true positive and true negative patients correctly identified among all the positive and negative results, hence the Positive Predictive Value (PPV) and the Negative Predictive Value (NPV). PPV and NPV largely depend on the pre-test probability of occurrence for a given disease, which is in turn directly linked to the prevalence of the disease in the given population 20 . In the current scenario, the pre-test probability of having a COVID-19 infection among patients presenting with common symptoms like fever, cough or dyspnea, is exceedingly high in countries facing the epidemic burden.","The cutoff point was defined on receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves of training data by maximizing the sum of sensitivity and specificity. The model performance was evaluated using test dataset on lung lobe-level. Areas under the ROC curve (AUC), sensitivities, specificities, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) were recorded. On patient-level, one was defined as long-term hospital stay once more than one lesion of lung lobe was labeled as long-term stay lesion, if not, as short-term hospital stay.","Fisher exact test was used to determine the differences in proportion of the 3 groups with positive antibody titers by IF and NT between animal handlers and healthy blood donors, SARS patients and healthy blood donors, and animal handlers and SARS patients. Computation was performed using the Predictive Analytics Soft Ware (PASW) Version 18.0 for Windows. Correlation between the IF and neutralizing antibody titers against HCoV-EMC, SARS-CoV and HCoV-OC43 was performed using IBM SPSS Statistics 19, with titers of &lt;1:20 and &lt;1:10 regarded as 1:10 and 1:5 respectively. A p-value of &lt;0.05 was considered as statistically significant.","The presence of galactomannan, a cell wall component released by Aspergillus spp., in serum indicates invasive aspergillosis, as detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Using a cutoff optical density of 0.5, the test has a sensitivity of 97.4%, specificity of 90.5%, positive predictive value of 66.1%, and negative predictive value of 99.4%. A galactomannan assay for the diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis has also been evaluated in BAL fluid. Using a cutoff optical density of 0.5, the test showed sensitivity of 86% and specificity of 89%.","A number of T values were selected for screening based on convergence laws. After 104 different T values were tried, as Figure 1 showed, when assumed T was 11, the daily CFRs 105 were decreasing and had no pronounced increase, when it was 0 to 7; the daily CFRs had 106 pronounced increase after early time (T &gt; 11 were not shown due to continuously decreasing 107 trends). CFRs increased as expected according to laws at later stage in some assumed T 108 values (e.g. T=0), but it decreased at early stage which seemed not satisfy the convergence 109 laws. Actually, it was normal. Convergence laws happened due to the force of the true CFR 110 drawing daily CFRs towards its direction by dominating accumulated death numbers. At early 111 stage, the outcome of death had not yet occurred resulting in daily CFRs decreasing with the 112 growth of case number. Thus, T value exploration by convergence laws should depend on 113 period of death growth. 114","After selecting the best feature subset, we used various machine learning algorithms to build a predictive model. In this research, we used different algorithms including Support Vector Machine (SVM), Neural Networks, Random Forest, Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, and K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) [15] [16] [17] . The Neural Network algorithm achieved the best performance and accuracy. We used grid search to find the best hyperparameters for the neural network. The best neural network results were achieved with two hidden layers with 10 neurons in the first layer and 3 neurons in the second layer. We used sigmoid function as the hidden layer activation function and used stochastic gradient optimizer, constant learning rate and the regularization rate of alpha = 0.01. The SVM model was configured with linear kernel, and regularization parameter C=1.0. The Random Forest algorithm is an ensemble learning method combined of multiple decision tree predictors that are trained based on random data samples and feature subsets [17] . We configured the random forest algorithm with 20 trees in the forest.","[37] and \u03b1 -D-mannose structure was taken from Glyco3D database [38] .
