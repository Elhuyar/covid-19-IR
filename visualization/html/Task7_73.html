The cost and risk of R&amp;D programs and uniquely unpredictable demand for EID vaccines have discouraged vaccine developers, and government and nonprofit agencies have been unable to provide timely or sufficient incentives for their development and sustained supply. We analyze the economic returns of a portfolio of EID vaccine assets, and find that under realistic financing assumptions, the expected returns are significantly negative, implying that the private sector is unlikely to address this need without public-sector intervention. We have sized the financing deficit for this portfolio and propose several potential solutions, including price increases, enhanced public-private partnerships, and subscription models through which individuals would pay annual fees to obtain access to a portfolio of vacc...","AbstractEpidemics of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) now have more than 100,000 confirmed cases worldwide. Diagnosis of COVID-19 is currently performed by RT-qPCR methods, but the capacity of RT-qPCR methods is limited by its requirement of high-level facilities and instruments. Here, we developed and evaluated RT-LAMP assays to detect genomic RNA of SARS-CoV-2, the causative virus of COVID-19. RT-LAMP assays in this study can detect as low as 100 copies of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Cross-reactivity of RT-LAMP assays to other human Coronaviruses was not observed. We also adapted a colorimetric detection method for our RT-LAMP assay so that the tests potentially performed in higher throughput.","Abstract The Internet of Things (IoT) includes three core procedures: full spectrum perception, reliable transmission, and intelligent processing. It can be applied for the prevention and control of SARI (severe acute respiratory infection). By combining sensors, information technology, artificial intelligence, and available dynamic networking devices, IoT could realize long-distance communication between hospitals, patients, and medical devices, which could ultimately improve current medical conditions.","","Respiratory protection against airborne pathogens is crucial for pandemic/epidemic preparedness in the context of personal protection, healthcare systems, and governance. We expect that the development of technologies that overcome the existing challenges in current respiratory protective devices will lead to a timely and effective response to the next outbreak.","","Publisher Summary Natural killer (NK) cells comprise a finite lymphocyte lineage with distinctive gene expression patterns. Natural killer (NK) cells develop in the bone marrow (BM) and are not static but populate secondary and primary lymphoid organs. A unique feature of NK cells is their expression of activating and inhibitory receptors, which allow them to respond either when ligands for activating receptors are upregulated or when ligands for inhibitory receptors are downregulated. The unique transcriptome of NK cells renders them capable of protecting the host from a vast array of disease states. Their undisputed importance in host protection is conferred by their ability to eliminate unhealthy cells. However, in order for NK cells to exert their effects, they need to be strategically located at the right places. This chapter provides an overview of the current understanding of the localization of NK cell populations and their ability to migrate in response to homeostatic and path...","Viral infections, such as Ebola, severe acute respiratory syndrome/Middle East respiratory syndrome and West Nile virus have emerged as a serious health threat with no effective therapies. These infections have little commercial potential and are not a high priority for the pharmaceutical industry. However, the academic community has been active in this area for many years. The challenge is how to take this academic virology knowledge into a drug discovery and development domain. One approach is the use of consortia and public\u2013private partnerships \u2013 this article highlights ongoing efforts in the USA. Public funds, such as those from government sources, can support research efforts that do not to appear to have commercial value. The key to success is finding a way to combine the different cultural and operational values and reward systems into a productive collaboration to identify new antivirals.","In the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic, currently vaccines and specific anti-viral treatment are not yet available. Thus, preventing viral transmission by case isolation, quarantine, and social distancing is essential to slowing its spread. Here we model social networks using weighted graphs, where vertices represent individuals and edges represent contact. As public health measures are implemented, connectivity in the graph decreases, resulting in lower effective reproductive numbers, and reduced viral transmission. For COVID-19, model parameters were derived from the coronavirus epidemic in China, validated by epidemic data in Italy, then applied to the United States. We calculate that, in the U.S., the public is able to contain viral transmission by limiting the average number of contacts per person to less than 7 unique individuals over each 5 day period. This increases the average social distance between individuals to 10 degrees of separation.","Porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) in Thailand was first detected in 2015. We performed a retrospective investigation of the presence of PDCoV in intestinal samples collected from piglets with diarrhea in Thailand from 2008 to 2015 using RT-PCR. PDCoV was found to be present as early as February 2013. Phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that all PDCoV variants from Thailand differ from those from other countries and belong to a novel group of PDCoV that is separate from the US and Chinese PDCoV variants. Evolutionary analysis suggested that the Thai PDCoV isolates probably diverged from a different ancestor from that of the Chinese and US PDCoV isolates and that this separation occurred after 1994.

Microbiological testing for respiratory viruses is important for patient management, infection control and epidemiological studies. Nasopharyngeal specimens are frequently tested, but their sensitivity is suboptimal. This study evaluated the incremental benefit of testing respiratory viruses in expectorated saliva using molecular assays. A total of 258 hospitalized adult patients with suspected respiratory infections were included. Their expectorated saliva was collected without the use of any special devices. In the first cohort of 159 patients whose nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPAs) tested positive for respiratory viruses during routine testing, the viral load was measured using quantitative reverse transcription PCR. Seventeen percent of the patients (27/159) had higher viral loads in the saliva than in the NPA. The second cohort consisted...","Due to the limitation of rapid development of specific antiviral drug or vaccine for novel emerging viruses, an accurate and rapid diagnosis is a key to manage the virus spread. We developed an efficient and rapid method with high specificity for the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), based on one-pot reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (one-pot RT-LAMP). A set of six LAMP primers [F3, B3, FIP, BIP, LF (Loop-F), and LB (Loop-B)] were designed using the sequence of nucleocapsid (N) gene with optimized RT-LAMP enzyme conditions: 100 U M-MLV RTase and 4 U Bst polymerase, implying that the reaction was able to detect four infectious viral genome copies of MERS-CoV within a 60 min reaction time period. Significantly, EvaGreen dye has better signal read-out properties in one-pot RT-LAMP reaction and is more compatible with DNA polymerase than SYBR green I. Isothermally amplified specific N genes were further evaluated using field-deployable micr...","A possible threat in the ophthalmology clinic While the 2019-nCoV transmission route is still unknown, countries have been preparing measures based on past experiences with coronaviruses namely SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. These viruses transmit primarily through droplets and other bodily secretions. In the ophthalmology practice, healthcare workers may be particularly susceptible to these infections. Firstly, ophthalmologists are extremely reliant on physical examination during patient consultation. Of particular concern is the proximity between the patient and ophthalmologist during the slit lamp microscope examination. It has been shown that droplets from a cough or sneeze can be propelled for up to 6?m [8], a range that definitely encompasses the distance between the patient and ophthalmologist. Secondly, during the SARS-CoV epidemic, clinical reports have suggested tears as a medium of infection. In a case series by Loon et al., it was shown that viral RNA of the SARS-CoV can be detecte...","Objectives: To examine heterogeneity of outcomes in protocols of clinical trials of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) and to identify outcomes for prioritization in developing a core outcome set (COS) in this field. Design: This study is a review. Data sources: Databases of ICMJE-accepted clinical trial registry platform were searched on February 14, 2020. Eligibility Criteria: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and non-RCTs of COVID-19 were considered.Conditions of patients include common type, severe type or critical type. Interventions include traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) and Western medicine. We excluded trials that for discharged patients, psychological intervention and complications of COVID-19. Data extraction and synthesis: The general information and outcomes, outcome measurement instruments and measurement times were extracted. The results were analysed by descriptive analysis. Results: 19 registry platforms were searched. A total of 97 protocols were included from 1...","Abstract The application of optical biosensors, specifically those that use optical fibers and planar waveguides, has escalated throughout the years in many fields, including environmental analysis, food safety and clinical diagnosis. Fluorescence is, without doubt, the most popular transducer signal used in these devices because of its higher selectivity and sensitivity, but most of all due to its wide versatility. This paper focuses on the working principles and configurations of fluorescence-based fiber optic and planar waveguide biosensors and will review biological recognition elements, sensing schemes, as well as some major and recent applications, published in the last ten years. The main goal is to provide the reader a general overview of a field that requires the joint collaboration of researchers of many different areas, including chemistry, physics, biology, engineering, and material science.","Abstract Since discovery of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), a novel betacoronavirus first isolated and characterized in 2012, MERS-CoV real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) assays represent one of the most rapidly expanding commercial tests. However, in the absence of extensive evaluations of these assays on positive clinical material of different sources, evaluating their diagnostic effectiveness remains challenging. We describe the diagnostic performance evaluation of 3 common commercial MERS-CoV rRT-PCR assays on a large panel (n = 234) of upper respiratory tract specimens collected during an outbreak episode in Saudi Arabia. Assays were compared to the RealStar\u00ae MERS-CoV RT-PCR (Alton Diagnostics, Hamburg, Germany) assay as the gold standard. Results showed i) the TIB MolBiol\u00ae LightMix UpE and Orf1a assays (TIB MolBiol, Berlin, Germany) to be the most sensitive, followed by ii) the Anyplex\u2122 Seegene MERS-CoV assay (Seegene, Seou...","A novel \u03b2-coronavirus (2019-nCoV) caused severe and even fetal pneumonia explored in a seafood market of Wuhan city, Hubei province, China, and rapidly spread to other provinces of China and other countries. The 2019-nCoV was different from SARS-CoV, but shared the same host receptor the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). The natural host of 2019-nCoV may be the bat Rhinolophus affinis as 2019-nCoV showed 96.2% of whole-genome identity to BatCoV RaTG13. The person-to-person transmission routes of 2019-nCoV included direct transmission, such as cough, sneeze, droplet inhalation transmission, and contact transmission, such as the contact with oral, nasal, and eye mucous membranes. 2019-nCoV can also be transmitted through the saliva, and the fetal\u2013oral routes may also be a potential person-to-person transmission route. The participants in dental practice expose to tremendous risk of 2019-nCoV infection due to the face-to-face communication and the exposure to saliva, blood, an...","Abstract Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) was initially isolated from a patient who was admitted to a private hospital in the Western part of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in 2012. Subsequently, MERS-CoV resulted in many sporadic cases, multiple intrafamilial transmission, and major outbreaks in healthcare settings. Of all the cases reported within the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, 38% of the cases were primary, 45% were healthcare-associated infection, and 14% were household infections. The clinical spectrum of the MERS-CoV infection ranges from asymptomatic infections, mild or moderately symptomatic cases, and severe disease requiring intensive care unit admissions and may result in death. Within healthcare settings, transmissions of MERS-CoV are facilitated by overcrowding, poor infection control measures, unrecognized infections, and superspreader phenomenon. Currently, there is no approved therapy for MERS-CoV and there are no vaccines.","Abstract Background and Aims Multiple issues in management of COVID have emerged, but confusion persists regarding rational interpretation. Aim of this brief review is to review these issues based on current literature. Methods This is a narrative review with Pubmed and Google Scholar search till 23 March 2020. Search terms were, COVID-19, treatment of coronavirus, COVID 19 and following terms; chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, ibuprofen, ACE-inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers, cardiovascular disease, diarrhoea, liver, testis and gastrointestinal disease. Results We discuss evidence regarding role of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine in treatment and prophylaxis, use of inhibitors of the renin angiotensin system, safety of ibuprofen, unusual clinical features like gastrointestinal symptoms and interpretation of tests for cardiac enzymes and biomarkers. Conclusions While our conclusions on management of COVID-19 patients with co-morbidities are based on current evidence, howeve...","Abstract An enhanced polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay to detect the coronavirus associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV) was developed in which a target gene pre-amplification step preceded TaqMan real-time fluorescent PCR. Clinical samples were collected from 120 patients diagnosed as suspected or probable SARS cases and analyzed by conventional PCR followed by agarose gel electrophoresis, conventional TaqMan real-time PCR, and our enhanced TaqMan real-time PCR assays. An amplicon of the size expected from SARS-CoV was obtained from 28/120 samples using the enhanced real-time PCR method. Conventional PCR and real-time PCR alone identified fewer SARS-CoV positive cases. Results were confirmed by viral culture in 3/28 cases. The limit of detection of the enhanced real-time PCR method was 102-fold higher than the standard real-time PCR assay and 107-fold higher than conventional PCR methods. The increased sensitivity of the assay may help control the spread of th...","A novel coronavirus was identified as the cause for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). The complete sequence of SARS genome has provided an opportunity for the development of molecular diagnostic assays. To restrain further outbreak of SARS, the World Health Organization has posted several pairs of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) primers for early diagnosis and urged more research to be done on PCR protocols. Here we report a strategy for the de novo synthesis of PCR templates complimentary to the SARS virus genome, which has the advantage of working on PCR templates without concern about viral infection and also has the advantage that it can be used by those who do not have access to the SARS virus. This highly efficient and safe strategy for obtaining SARS gene fragments is useful for the development of PCR assays, as well as for the preparation of reliable positive controls for PCR testing kits.","Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) helicase is a superfamily 1 helicase containing seven conserved motifs. We have cloned, expressed, and purified a Strep-fused recombinant MERS-CoV nonstructural protein 13 (M-nsp13) helicase. Characterization of its biochemical properties showed that it unwound DNA and RNA similarly to severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV nsp13 (S-nsp13) helicase. We showed that M-nsp13 unwound in a 5\u2032-to-3\u2032 direction and efficiently unwound the partially duplex RNA substrates with a long loading strand relative to those of the RNA substrates with a short or no loading strand. Moreover, the K(m) of ATP for M-nsp13 is inversely proportional to the length of the 5\u2032 loading strand of the partially duplex RNA substrates. Finally, we also showed that the rate of unwinding (ku) of M-nsp13 is directly proportional to the length of the 5\u2032 loading strand of the partially duplex RNA substrate. These results provide insights that enhance our understanding o...","Abstract Severe acute respiratory syndrome associated coronavirus main protease (SARS-CoV Mpro) has been proposed as a prime target for anti-SARS drug development. We have cloned and overexpressed the SARS-CoV Mpro in Escherichia coli, and purified the recombinant Mpro to homogeneity. The kinetic parameters of the recombinant SARS-CoV Mpro were characterized by high performance liquid chromatography-based assay and continuous fluorescence-based assay. Two novel small molecule inhibitors of the SARS-CoV Mpro were identified by high-throughput screening using an internally quenched fluorogenic substrate. The identified inhibitors have K i values at low \u03bcM range with comparable anti-SARS-CoV activity in cell-based assays.","The COVID-19 pandemic is overwhelming healthcare systems worldwide. A significant portion of COVID-19 patients develop pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), necessitating ventilator support. Some health systems do not have the capacity to accommodate this surge in ventilator demand, leading to shortages and inevitable mortality. Some clinicians have, of necessity, jerry-rigged ventilators to support multiple patients, but these devices lack protected air streams or individualized controls for each patient. Moreover, some have not been tested under conditions of ARDS. We have developed the Individualized System for Augmenting Ventilator Efficacy (iSAVE), a rapidly deployable platform to more safely use a single ventilator to simultaneously support multiple critically-ill patients. The iSAVE enables patient-specific volume and pressure control and incorporates safety features to mitigate cross-contamination between patients and flow changes due to patient interdepende...","The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak, which was identified in late 2019, requires special attention because of its future epidemics and possible global threats. Beside clinical procedures and treatments, since Artificial Intelligence (AI) promises a new paradigm for healthcare, several different AI tools that are built upon Machine Learning (ML) algorithms are employed for analyzing data and decision-making processes. This means that AI-driven tools help identify COVID-19 outbreaks as well as forecast their nature of spread across the globe. However, unlike other healthcare issues, for COVID-19, to detect COVID-19, AI-driven tools are expected to have active learning-based cross-population train/test models that employs multitudinal and multimodal data, which is the primary purpose of the paper.","The recent pandemic of COVID-19 has involved tens of thousands of patients in numerous countries and the causative virus, SARS COV-2 is highly transmissible. Molecular diagnostic tools are central to containment of the virus and initiating proper clinical care. Rapidity, user-friendliness, and high degree of sensitivity and specificity are desirable features of diagnostic assays for screening purposes. Herein, we present a single step reverse transcriptase LAMP assay (RT-LAMP), which can detect up to 500 viral copies in 30 minutes. We challenged our assay with a large number of clinical samples collected from 47 confirmed cases and 213 negative patients. Our LAMP assay showed a high degree of sensitivity and specificity compared to two commercialized qRT-PCR assay as gold standard. We present a rapid RT-LAMP assay that could extend the capacity of laboratories to process 2.5 more clinical samples relative to qRT-PCR and potentially could be used for high-throughput screening purposes.","As COVID-19 evolves rapidly, the issues the governments of affected countries facing are whether and when to take public health interventions and what levels of strictness of these interventions should be, as well as when the COVID-19 spread reaches the stopping point after interventions are taken. To help governments with policy-making, we developed modified auto-encoders (MAE) method to forecast spread trajectory of Covid-19 of countries affected, under different levels and timing of intervention strategies. Our analysis showed public health interventions should be executed as soon as possible. Delaying intervention 4 weeks after March 8, 2020 would cause the maximum number of cumulative cases of death increase from 7,174 to 133,608 and the ending points of the epidemic postponed from Jun 25 to Aug 22.","Summary Context Live-animal markets (wet markets) provide a source of vertebrate and invertebrate animals for customers in tropical and subtropical regions of the world. Wet markets sell live poultry, fish, reptiles, and mammals of every kind. Live-poultry markets (mostly chicken, pigeon, quail, ducks, geese, and a wide range of exotic wild-caught and farm-raised fowl) are usually separated from markets selling fish or red-meat animals, but the stalls can be near each other with no physical separation. Despite the widespread availability of affordable refrigeration, many Asian people prefer live animals for fresh produce. Wet markets are widespread in Asian countries and in countries where Asian people have migrated. Live-poultry markets were the source of the H5N1 bird-influenza virus that transmitted to and killed six of 18people in Hong Kong. Starting point Yi Guan and colleagues (Science 2003; 302: 276\u201378) recently reported the isolation of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) ...","Abstract Over 12 years have elapsed since severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) triggered the first global alert for coronavirus infections. Virus transmission in humans was quickly halted by public health measures and human infections of SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) have not been observed since. However, other coronaviruses still pose a continuous threat to human health, as exemplified by the recent emergence of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) in humans. The work on SARS-CoV widens our knowledge on the epidemiology, pathophysiology and immunology of coronaviruses and may shed light on MERS coronavirus (MERS-CoV). It has been confirmed that T-cell immunity plays an important role in recovery from SARS-CoV infection. Herein, we summarize T-cell immunological studies of SARS-CoV and discuss the potential cross-reactivity of the SARS-CoV-specific immunity against MERS-CoV, which may provide useful recommendations for the development of broad-spectrum vaccines against coronavirus...","Given the scale of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the need for reliable, scalable testing, and the likelihood of reagent shortages, especially in resource-poor settings, we have developed a RT-qPCR assay that relies on an alternative to conventional viral reverse transcriptases, a thermostable reverse transcriptase / DNA polymerase (RTX)1. Here we show that RTX performs comparably to the other assays sanctioned by the CDC and validated in kit format. We demonstrate two modes of RTX use - (i) dye-based RT-qPCR assays that require only RTX polymerase, and (ii) TaqMan RT-qPCR assays that use a combination of RTX and Taq DNA polymerases (as the RTX exonuclease does not degrade a TaqMan probe). We also provide straightforward recipes for the purification of this alternative reagent. We anticipate that in low resource or point-of-need settings researchers could obtain the available constructs from Addgene or our lab and begin to develop their own assays, within whatever regulatory framework ...","Background Despite available recommendations on infection control for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), information is limited on actual practices in Asian hospitals during the epidemic. We describe practices observed by mobile SARS containment teams (mobile teams) during outbreak investigations. Methods We retrospectively summarized infection control practices observed in hospitals visited by mobile teams in the Lao People's Democratic Republic (PDR), Taiwan, and Thailand, during March and April 2003. Results Mobile teams investigated 22 reports of SARS in 20 hospitals (1, 5, and 14 hospitals in Lao PDR, Taiwan, and Thailand, respectively). Facilities ranged from urban hospitals with negative-pressure isolation rooms and high-efficiency particulate air filtration to rural hospitals with patient rooms open to outside air circulation and intermittent running water. At the time of mobile team visits, 5 (25%) hospitals implemented infection control practices consistent with World ...","Abstract The 3C-like protease (3CLpro) of SARS-coronavirus mediates the proteolytic processing of replicase polypeptides 1a and 1ab into functional proteins, becoming an important target for the drug development. In this study, Isatis indigotica root extract, five major compounds of I. indigotica root, and seven plant-derived phenolic compounds were tested for anti-SARS-CoV 3CLpro effects using cell-free and cell-based cleavage assays. Cleavage assays with the 3CLpro demonstrated that IC50 values were in micromolar ranges for I. indigotica root extract, indigo, sinigrin, aloe emodin and hesperetin. Sinigrin (IC50: 217\u03bcM) was more efficient in blocking the cleavage processing of the 3CLpro than indigo (IC50: 752\u03bcM) and beta-sitosterol (IC50: 1210\u03bcM) in the cell-based assay. Only two phenolic compounds aloe emodin and hesperetin dose-dependently inhibited cleavage activity of the 3CLpro, in which the IC50 was 366\u03bcM for aloe emodin and 8.3\u03bcM for hesperetin in the cell-based assay.","The number of people infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus causing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), is dramatically increasing worldwide.The first person-to-person transmission in Italy was reported on Feb 21, 2020, and led to an infection chain that represents the largest COVID-19 outbreak outside Asia to date. Here we document the response of the Emergency Medical System (EMS) of the metropolitan area of Milan, Italy, to the COVID-19 outbreak.On Jan 30, 2020, WHO declared the COVID-19 outbreak a public health emergency of international concern.2 Since then, the Italian Government has implemented extraordinary measures to restrict viral spread, including interruptions of air traffic from China, organised repatriation flights and quarantines for Italian travellers in China, and strict controls at international airports' arrival terminals. Local medical authorities adopted specific WHO recommendations to identify and isolate suspected ...","Abstract The causative agent of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) has been identified as a novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV. The development of rapid screening assays is essential for antiviral drug discovery. By using a cell line expressing a SARS-CoV subgenomic replicon, we developed a high-throughput assay and used it to screen small molecule compounds for inhibitors of SARS-CoV replication in the absence of live virus. The assay system involves minimal manipulation after assay set-up, facilitates automated read-out and minimizes risks associated with hazardous viruses. Based on this assay system, we screened 7035 small molecule compounds from which we identified 7 compounds with anti-SARS-CoV activity. We demonstrate that the compounds inhibited SARS-CoV replication-dependent GFP expression in the replicon cells and reduced SARS-CoV viral protein accumulation and viral RNA copy number in the replicon cells. In a SARS-CoV plaque reduction assay, these compounds were confirmed to h...","Abstract The worldwide outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) raises concerns of widespread panic and anxiety in individuals subjected to the real or perceived threat of the virus. Compared to general populations, patients who are institutionalized in a closed unit are also very vulnerable to COVID-19 infection and complications. This crisis touched on difficult issues of not only psychiatric care and ethics, but also psychological impacts to psychiatric care givers. In this Viewpoint, we address both physical and biopsychosocial aspects of this infection, as well as the psychoneuroimmunity of preventive strategies of healthy lifestyle, regular exercise, balanced nutrition, quality sleep and a strong connection with people. Social distancing and wearing masks might help us from pathogen exposure, yet such these measures also prevent us from expressing compassion and friendliness. Therefore, all forms of psychological support should be routinely implemented not only to consider...","Background: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerges in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, spreads worldwide, and threats the human life. The detection of SARS-CoV-2 is important for the prevention of the outbreak and management of patients. Real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay detected the virus in clinical laboratory. Methods: This study utilized primers and single-quencher probes in accordance with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the USA and the National Institute of Infectious Diseases (NIID) in Japan. Moreover, we designed the double-quencher probes (YCH assay) according to the oligonucleotide sequence established by NIID. Using these assays, we conducted a one-step real-time RT-PCR with serial DNA positive control to assess the detection sensitivity. Results: The threshold cycle (Ct) value of RT-PCR was relatively low in CDC and YCH assays compared to NIID assay. Serial dilution assay showed that bot...","Faced with the current large-scale public health emergency, collecting, sorting, and analyzing biomedical information related to the \"coronavirus\" should be done as quickly as possible to gain a global perspective, which is a basic requirement for strengthening epidemic control capacity.

However, several reports have shown that conventional and real-time PCR assays were very specific for SARS CoV but lack sensitivity depending on the assay, specimen, and time course of disease. Objective: To evaluate an automatic nucleic acid extraction system and two standardized real-time PCR assays for rapid diagnosis of SARS CoV during outbreak and post-epidemic periods in Hong Kong. Study design: Specimens from clinically suspected SARS patients collected during outbreak and post-epidemic periods were tested by an automatic nucleic acid extraction system followed by our first generation conventional RT-PCR and two standardized real-time PCR assays (Artus GmbH, Germany and Roche Diagnostics, Germany). Paired serum samples were assayed for increasing titer against SARS CoV. Results: In the SARS epidemic, Art...","Abstract We argue that enhanced Traffic Control Bundling (eTCB) can interrupt the community-hospital-community transmission cycle, thereby limiting COVID-19\u2019s impact. Enhanced TCB is an expansion of the traditional TCB that proved highly effective during Taiwan\u2019s 2003 SARS outbreak. TCB\u2019s success derived from ensuring that Health Care Workers (HCWs) and patients were protected from fomite, contact and droplet transmission within hospitals. Although TCB proved successful during SARS, achieving a similar level of success with the COVID-19 outbreak requires adapting TCB to the unique manifestations of this new disease. These manifestations include asymptomatic infection, a hyper-affinity to ACE2 receptors resulting in high transmissibility, false negatives, and an incubation period of up to 22 days. Enhanced TCB incorporates the necessary adaptations. In particular, eTCB includes expanding the TCB transition zone to incorporate a new sector \u2013 the quarantine ward. This ward houses patients...","Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) emerged in southern China in late 2002. It first spread within Guangdong Province and then to other parts of China. Via air travelers, it quickly reached various countries around the globe, causing several major hospital outbreaks. Within weeks, the causative agent, a previously unknown coronavirus (SARS-CoV), was identified, thanks to an unprecedented international effort led by the World Health Organization (WHO). Its origin was quickly traced to wild animals traded locally for culinary purposes. Masked palm civet and some other species seem to have acted as intermediate hosts. Since then, SARS-like coronaviruses were found in different bat species in China and elsewhere, and bats are now regarded as the wildlife reservoir for SARS-CoV. Fortunately, the SARS outbreak could be contained within months. Until July 2003, it had caused 8096 cases, with 774 deaths. Once adequate measures such as isolating patients and quarantining their contacts wer...","Abstract Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) emerged in southern China in late 2002.

The reactivities of the recombinant proteins to a panel of antibodies containing 33 SARS coronavirus-positive sera and 66 negative sera and to antibodies against other animal coronaviruses were screened. A truncated 195-amino-acid fragment from the C terminus of the nucleocapsid protein (N195) was identified that had a strong ability to detect antibodies against SARS coronavirus. No cross-reaction was found between the N195 protein and antibodies against chicken, pig, and canine coronaviruses. The N195 protein was used to develop a Western blot assay to detect antibodi...","Accreditation is an internationally recognised process through which healthcare organisations are able to improve the safety and quality of services delivered to patients. The focus of accreditation is to help organisations understand what they are doing well and what opportunities are available for improvement. The Canadian approach to accreditation is a rigorous peer review process comprised of a self-assessment against a set of standards, an on-site survey and follow-up action on recommendations that arise from the survey. The accreditation standards can be used effectively to guide the surgical teams in the transformation of the specialty. The 17 standards that are used to evaluate surgical teams relate to the activities that represent the continuum of clinical care as well as aspects related to learning. Within the subsections and standards are opportunities for surgeons and surgical teams to use the standards to effectively deliver services and to continuously improve patient car...","[Image: see text] Infectious diseases are a leading cause of mortality worldwide, with viruses and bacteria in particular having enormous impacts on global healthcare. One major challenge in combatting such diseases is a lack of effective drugs or specific treatments. In addition, drug resistance to currently available therapeutics and adverse effects caused by long-term overuse are both serious public health issues. A promising treatment strategy is to employ cell-membrane mimics as decoys to trap and to detain the pathogens. In this Perspective, we briefly review the infection mechanisms adopted by different pathogens at the cellular membrane interface and highlight the applications of cell-membrane-mimicking nanodecoys for systemic protection against infectious diseases. We also discuss the implication of nanodecoy\u2013pathogen complexes in the development of vaccines. We anticipate this Perspective will provide new insights on design and development of advanced materials against emergi...","COVID-19 is now a pandemic and many of the affected countries face severe shortages of hospital resources. In Brazil, the first case was reported on February 26. As the number of cases grows in the country, there is a concern that the health system may become overwhelmed, resulting in shortages of hospital beds, intensive care unit beds, and mechanical ventilators. The timing of shortage is likely to vary geographically depending on the observed onset and pace of transmission observed, on the availability of resources, and on the actions implemented. Here we consider the daily number of cases reported in municipalities in Brazil to simulate twelve alternative scenarios of the likely timing of shortage, based on parameters consistently reported for China and Italy, on rates of hospital occupancy for other health conditions observed in Brazil in 2019, and on assumptions of allocation of patients in public and private facilities. Results show that hospital services could start to experien...","The need for timely establishment of diagnostic assays arose when Germany was confronted with the first travel-associated outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in Europe. We describe our laboratory experiences during a large contact tracing investigation, comparing previously published real-time RT-PCR assays in different PCR systems and a commercial kit. We found that assay performance using the same primers and probes with different PCR systems varied and the commercial kit performed well.","Publisher Summary This chapter describes three assays to monitor receptor-induced association of the envelope glycoprotein (EnvA) of avian sarcoma/leukosis virus (ASLV) with target bilayers: (1) the original assay for monitoring binding of the EnvA ectodomain (EnvA-PI) to target membranes (liposomes), (2) a modified and miniaturized EnvA-PI-liposome binding assay, and (3) an assay to measure binding of intact sarcoma/leukosis virus subtype A (ASLV-A) virus particles to target membranes. These assays are also useful for studying other receptor-activated viral fusion proteins. When one viral glycoprotein and one \u201csimple\u201d host cell receptor are involved, it should be possible to develop assays directly analogous to those described above for studying Tva-induced binding of the EnvA ectodomain (EnvA-PI) to target membranes. A general prerequisite for a fusion protein/target membrane binding assay is a soluble and correctly oligomeric form of the viral fusion protein ectodomain. The simplest...","Abstract With the 2019-nCoV pandemic spreading quickly in USA and the world, it is urgent that the rehabilitation community quickly understands the epidemiology of the virus and what we can and must do to face this microbial adversary at the early stages of this likely long global pandemic. The 2019-nCoV is a novel virus so the majority of world\u2019s population does not have prior immunity to it. It is more infectious and fatal than seasonal influenza, and definitive treatment and a vaccine are months away. Our arsenal against it are currently mainly social distancing and infection control measures.","Abstract To overcome the limitations of the state-of-the-art influenza surveillance systems in Europe, we established in 2008 a European-wide consortium aimed at introducing an innovative information and communication technology approach for a web-based surveillance system across different European countries, called Influenzanet. The system, based on earlier efforts in The Netherlands and Portugal, works with the participation of the population in each country to collect real-time information on the distribution of influenza-like illness cases through web surveys administered to volunteers reporting their symptoms (or lack of symptoms) every week during the influenza season. Such a large European-wide web-based monitoring infrastructure is intended to rapidly identify public health emergencies, contribute to understanding global trends, inform data-driven forecast models to assess the impact on the population, optimize the allocation of resources, and help in devising mitigation and co..."],"title":["Financing Vaccines for Global Health Security","Development of Reverse Transcription Loop-mediated Isothermal Amplification (RT-LAMP) Assays Targeting SARS-CoV-2","Prospect and application of Internet of Things technology for prevention of SARIs","Polyethylene sector seeks upside from trough","Respiratory Protection against Pandemic and Epidemic Diseases","Spatial transmission of COVID-19 via public and private transportation in China","Chapter Ten The localization and migration of natural killer cells in health and disease","Consortia\u2019s critical role in developing medical countermeasures for re-emerging viral infections: a USA perspective","A Social Network Model of the COVID-19 Pandemic","Retrospective investigation and evolutionary analysis of a novel porcine deltacoronavirus strain detected in Thailand from 2008 to 2015","Additional molecular testing of saliva specimens improves the detection of respiratory viruses","One-Pot Reverse Transcriptional Loop-Mediated Isothermal Amplification (RT-LAMP) for Detecting MERS-CoV","Revisiting the dangers of the coronavirus in the ophthalmology practice","Outcome reporting from protocols of clinical trials of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19): a review","Fluorescence based fiber optic and planar waveguide biosensors.

far better solution would be for governments to ensure there is a globally fair allocation system. With sufficient political will and public sector financing, such a system could be established using existing instruments and institutions. The rudiments of the system would require a global purchasing agent or agents, a substantial but limited-term advanced purchase commitment, and access through the system to financial instruments such as concessional loans or grants and indemnification from liability to offset the risks taken by participating private sector partners.","The promotion of ''risk instruments'' and a ''risk-based regulation'' approach makes it possible to deal with risk-creating events. For the last two decades, in a context of decreasing means and in reaction to public-health crises which have led, according to some, to an overprotective state, a new tendency has emerged of governments using ''risk instruments'' to better allocate means and to decrease the State's hold. Despite their differences, these two approaches are to the same end, which is to define -or perpetually re-define -the limits of the State. ''Risk instruments'' contribute in each ''putting at risk'' situation to determining the State's involvement, the reason for its having competencies and resources, and therefore also the State's limits as opposed to that which concerns the private sector and individuals. The outcome of this defining as ''putting at risk'' and of the application of these risk instruments may be used by the State either to invest, or to disinvest; in the latter case for example entrusting risk management which formerly would have been the realm of institutions to local or private agents or to individuals.","Soon after its founding, DHS created a National Infrastructure Protection Plan (NIPP). The developmental process identified 17 critical infrastructure sectors encompassing both public and private interests. These 17 sectors were considered \"so vital to the united States that their incapacity or destruction would have a debilitating impact on national security, national economic security, and national public health of safety, or any combination of these matters\" (Box 2.4). While terrorism served as an impetus for the creation of the NIpp, public/private cooperation has been enhanced through more efficient responses to major emergencies such as hurricanes. NIpp initiated voluntary private sector councils to advise on how to strengthen security in the sector by cooperation and the institution of best practices. The private sector participates in all the national infrastructure partnerships, except those exclusively concerned with government issues.","With the advent of the digital age and the plethora of Internet of Things (IoT) devices it brings, there has been a substantial rise in the amount of data gathered by these devices in different sectors like transport, environment, entertainment, sport and health sectors, amongst others [11] . To put this into perspective, it is believed that by the end of 2020, over 2314 exabytes (1 exabyte = 1 billion gigabytes) of data will be generated globally [12] from the health sector. Stanford Medicine [12] acknowledges that this increase, especially in the medical field, is witnessing a proportional increase due to the increase in sources of data that are not limited to hospital records. Rather, the increase is being underpinned by drawing upon a myriad and increasing number of IoT smart devices, that are projected to exponentially increase the global healthcare market to a value of more than USD $543.3 billion by 2025 [13] . However, while the potential for the data market is understood, such issues like privacy of information, data protection and sharing, and obligatory requirements of healthcare management and monitoring, among others, are critical. Moreover, in the present case of the Coronavirus outbreak, this ought to be handled with care to avoid jeopardizing efforts already in place to combat the pandemic. On the foremost, since these cut across different countries, which are part of the global community and have their unique laws and regulations concerning issues mentioned above, it is paramount to observe them as per the dictate of their source country's laws and regulations; hence, underlining the importance of working towards not only the promoting of data through its usage but also the need for standardized and universally agreed protocols.","is the (which was not peer-reviewed) The copyright holder for this preprint Our analysis strongly suggests that reliance solely on private sector investment in EID vaccines is insufficient, given the negative returns achieved by an EID-focused megafund, and the negative impact such a pool of assets would have on an otherwise profitable pharmaceutical company. As a result, if EID vaccine candidates are to be developed, continued private-public cooperation will be imperative, and novel approaches to engage and attract capital will be needed. While bond markets are capable of providing access to substantial amounts of capital to help vaccine development efforts, the resources available to the public sector have great potential as well (43) . In 2015, the U.S. spent $9,990 per person on healthcare (44) . If we assume that there are 300 million Americans, just 1.25% of this amount of spending would yield $37.46 billion dollars, greater than the projected $35.25 billion it would take to fund the entire EID portfolio of vaccines. While achieving such an allocation of funding would hardly be as simple as this calculation suggests, this thought experiment illustrates that encouraging the development of vaccines that protect against EIDs of pandemic potential is well within the means of the global public and private sector stakeholders, if there is public support and political will. In fact, there is evidence to indicate that people expect and would support further protection from these threats (45) .","Cooperation between law enforcement and the private security sector differs according to local conditions. ASIS International fosters cooperation between police and security practitioners at chapter meetings across the nation. The New York City Police Department has precinct community councils in which the business community can participate in monthly meetings. A more pertinent program is NYPD Shield in which police and private security executives can meet to discuss current issues of significance, leading to more productive cooperation in dealing with crime patterns or local emergencies. Still imperfect, but improved public/private cooperation between law enforcement and private security has resulted from 9/11.","Financial innovation in humanitarian aid is increasing. The next version of the PEF is in development at the World Bank. Other pre-financed models, such as the African Risk Capacity (ARC) mutual sovereign drought insurance pool, use similar parametric modelling mechanisms to trigger release of funds. When ARC's modelling underestimated the number of drought-vulnerable people in Malawi in 2016, its board eventually approved policy exceptions to allow compensatory payouts. However, the PEF has no such flexibility, because it is bound by the bond contract issued to investors. 12 New parametric-based instruments are being developed. The Famine Action Mechanism (FAM) is a new multilateral organisation partnership with Amazon, Microsoft, Google, and the insurance sector. In theory, it will use artificial intelligence to identify impending food crises and trigger the release of the Bank's $1\u00b75 billion in earmarked funds to avert famine through early response. If the PEF and ARC raise concerns about triggering aid through blackboxed technical schemes, concerns will inevitably multiply as profit-driven private technology giants become stakeholders in humanitarian outcomes.","The \"first\" first responders on 9/11, as in most catastrophes were private-sector civilians. Because 85 percent of our nation's critical infrastructure is controlled not by government but by the private sector, private-sector civilians are likely to be the first responders in any future catastrophes. 7 police chiefs across the nation saw the advantages of better cooperation with the extensive resources of the private security sector. In the ensuing months law enforcement reflected on how an era of growing terrorist countermeasures would strain resources. In an unprecedented 2-day National policy Summit in 2004, police, private security, researchers, and academics convened to find ways where public/private cooperation could work more effectively. The summit was sponsored by International Association of Chiefs of police (IACP) and Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS), a unit within the Department of Justice (DoJ). 8 The final report advised several action items:","The report notes: \"In reality, in many crises, security officers \u2026 are the first responders.\" The action items from the summit will require support if they are to make a difference. perhaps further summits will be needed. But domestic and global crime, terrorism, and environmental emergencies are too great for the public sector to handle alone. Liking it or not, private security is being drawn into a new uncharted phase that demands greater professionalism and reliability. In turn, private security deserves something back, for example, better and faster intelligence on issues that affect them from law enforcement at all levels.","Previous research has demonstrated that a novel 'megafund' financing strategy is capable of generating returns that could attract untapped financial resources to fund the development of a portfolio of drug development programs (23, 24) . In this study, we address this possibility by simulating the financial performance of a hypothetical megafund portfolio of 141 preclinical EID vaccine development programs across 9 different EIDs for which there is currently no approved prophylactic vaccine. Under current business conditions, we determine a private sector solution for the comprehensive development of EID vaccines is not yet feasible, and quantify the gap so as to inform current policy discussions regarding the need for public-sector intervention.","The United States can help to offset China's checkbook diplomacy effortsas well as serve broader U.S. interests in checking China's expanding influence -by offering, where appropriate, similar assistance and resources. This help will be attractive to states that are wary of China's \"debt trap\" diplomacy. The United States has taken initial steps in this direction with the passage of the Better Utilization of Investments Leading to Development (BUILD) Act of 2018, which calls for the United States \"to facilitate market-based private sector development and economic growth in less developed countries through the provision of credit, capital, and other financial support.\" 42 A smaller-scale version of China's BRI, the BUILD Act could have the secondary effect of reducing the likelihood that some of Taiwan's remaining diplomatic allies will sever formal relations with Taiwan to secure development funds from China. Adopting and implementing these policies will probably not stop Beijing's quest to squeeze Taiwan's by poaching all of its diplomatic allies. China has the capacity and the will to outspend and out-pressure Taiwan-and the United Statesin a competition over whether countries have diplomatic ties with Beijing or with Taipei. Nonetheless, working to foster closer relations between Taiwan and other states, and to maintain Taiwan's existing diplomatic relations, may give Taiwan some breathing room and serve American interests as well.","Security products and systems are measured separately from services. These products are closely tied to new construction trends. In times of economic growth, this sector participates. Further, the growth of security technology has clearly been an impact on the long-term decrease in crime within the workplaces, in government facilities, and in communities. electronic systems have received considerable attention in the past and have far surpassed mechanical locks. However, this sector also continues to grow robustly, as seen in Table 2.2. uS security spending exceeded $410 billion in 2014, according to research from ASIS International and the Institute of Finance and Management. 11 This represents total expenditures for private sector, nongovernment organizations, and government at all levels.","To ration the supply of surgical masks, exports of surgical masks have been banned and the government instituted a system where individuals would be allowed to purchase two masks per week, with NHI IC card tracking their purchase history. Real-time display of mask availability in local pharmacies across the country was quickly established by the public and private sector.","Antimicrobial susceptibility of pneumococcal isolates causing bacteraemic community-acquired pneumonia in the public and private sectors in Gauteng, South Africa Objectives: Contradictory and very high rates of pneumococcal resistance have been reported previously from different surveillance studies conducted in South Africa. The aim of this study was to review susceptibility data of isolates from adult patients presenting with bacteremic pneumococcal communityacquired pneumonia (CAP), comparing cases in the public and private sectors in Gauteng, South Africa. Methods: We wished to recruit 100 consecutive adult patients with pneumococcal bacteraemia and CAP. Patients without radiographic evidence of pneumonia, or with other clinical diagnoses (e.g. meningitis) were excluded. Repeat isolates were excluded. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was done according to CLSI guidelines, using disc screening and MIC determination with agar dilution and E-tests. Results: 149 cases were recruited, 97 in the public and 52 in the private sector. Public sector patients were younger (median age 33 years vs. 45 years; p &lt; 0.001), with more HIV infection and less co-morbid illness. Cases in the private sector were more likely to have received antibiotics in the past 3 months. The overall rate of antimicrobial resistance was considerably lower than reported previously in South Africa. Resistance to penicillin was 16% in the public and 23% in the private sector (not significantly different). There were also no significant differences in the susceptibility of the isolates to ceftriaxone, chloramphenicol, tetracycline, rifampicin or ofloxacin. However significantly more resistance was seen in the private sector isolates to erythromycin (28% vs. 4%; P &lt; 0.001) and clindamycin (21% vs. 3%; p = 0.001). Conclusion: A number of clinical differences were seen in public vs. private sector patients with bacteraemic pneumococcal pneumonia in Gauteng, South Africa. Rates of antibiotic resistance were much lower than previously reported from South Africa. The only differences noted were higher rates of resistance to erythromycin and clindamycin in the private sector (possible erm gene mutation as mechanism of macrolide resistance).","Other specific laws calling for increased commercial security measures were passed. Notable among these was the Bank Security Act of 1968. \u00a7 This law was passed because bank crimes had grown steadily during the decade. The increased incidence of bank robberies, burglaries, and extortions prompted Congress to require all federally chartered banking institutions to undertake particular security measures to reduce the risk of successful criminal acts. In retrospect, the measure in itself did not reduce the growing pattern of violent and property crimes against financial institutions covered by the Act: in fact, they kept increasing for years after passage of the law. \u00b6 modified years later to make requirements more reflective of changing circumstances. For example, the original law of 1968 produced regulations for Minimum Security Devices and Procedures (12CFR21). These included specific language related to antitheft technology, which became less relevant with the introduction of new and better cameras and recording media. By the 1990s, bankers possessed greater latitude with regards to designing security systems most appropriate for their needs. While the Bank Security Act is not directly associated with decreasing bank crime patterns, common sense argues that such institutions must implement reasonable security measures to protect employees and the public. perhaps without the vigorous measures that were instituted by this law, bank crime would have increased. This act is an example of the federal government passing a measure that demands a distinctive private sector security response. In the process this law aided the role of security management to grow as a management practice in a particular sphere, in this case financial industries. Other federal measures would follow.","Through this structure, WHO could then establish clear and delineated roles for other actors when preparing for and responding to health emergencies. It could then act as both the primary coordination mechanism and provide technical support to other UN institutions, such as the World Bank, UN Development Programme, UNICEF, UNAIDS, UN Environmental Programme, UN Population Fund, UN Office of Drugs and Crime, Food and Agriculture Organization, many of whom were active participants in the fight against EVD [45]. The design of the structure should also leverage existing inter-agency structures already established between WHO, the UN and other health partners (including the Global Health Cluster and Inter-Agency Standing Committee that both focus on humanitarian and health issues.) [13]. In this sense, a UN global health panel apparatus could act as a hybrid multistakeholder global health body bringing together the respective organizational and partnership networks available between the UN system and WHO. This would enable more robust engagement with key civil society actors, NGOs, foundations, civil-military cooperation, and private sector actors that will be critical in the prevention, detection, and response to future health emergencies and potential pandemics.","In addition to these methods, other smart city data sources include the application of terminal tracking systems that are mostly emphasized in Safe City concepts, where, at the point of entry or departure, relevant data is collected and analyzed. Li et al. [32] highlights that sensors installed in such locations have the potential to receive and distribute data in real-time to digital infrastructures within the network, and their interconnectedness in the network renders them extremely efficient in providing real-time updates on different issues. Urban areas are also known to be amassed with numerous Urban Health sensors, some of which are wearable. Though these are not specifically fashioned to track the present case of virus outbreak, they are able to track other related parameters like heartbeat, blood pressure, body temperature and others variables, that when analyzed can offer valuable insights. Loncar-Turukalo et al. [33] hail these devices for their role in transforming the health care sector especially by allowing for Connected Health (CH) care, where data collected from them can be analyzed and provide insightful information on the health scenario in any given area. Vashist et al. [34] further highlight how emerging features such as spatiotemporal mapping, remote monitoring and management, and enhanced cloud computing capabilities can emanate from such endeavours, leading to better urban management potential.","\uf0b7 The surveillance can be expensive, but the costs needs to be balanced against the cost of keeping draconian restrictions on for extra time or implementing them too late without good evidence for decision making (e.g. national borders closure). Think alternatively, the private sector may be willing to contribute.","In developing countries, healthcare needs are more pressing than those in developed nations. Unfortunately, for various reasons, the provision of care is inadequate, particularly in the public sector; it is even worse in the private sector. WHO (2005) has highlighted the importance of improving, monitoring, and evaluating people's wellness and quality of life, which, as a public health concern, should be the goals in a country's national development. In 1920, Winslow defined public health as follows:","Shining a light on teaching-practice as a way of bridging the growing gap in research-practice is a key aim of the paper. Unfortunately, this coincides with what some are suggesting is a sector on the edge of disruption. Improving teaching and education in business schools, as a science and as a practice, has therefore never been more pressing. Fortunately, there are many ways forward. Gamification, virtual reality, artificial intelligence and social media are all potentially ways to improve the effectiveness of teaching-practice outcomes. These instruments are already in use in many of our institutions and adapted appropriately, can help turn teaching into learning with andragogical rigor. A detailed study of these tools and their role within the commons is beyond this article's scope but such investigations will be fascinating going forward. What our senior executive praxis cases highlight is that wisdom seldom emanates solely from technology enablers. Case D was all about tactile and sensory peer interactions and in these settings, like in Cases B and C, even the educator becomes an \"actor\" in a virtuous knowledge \"theatre\". Learning how to facilitate such theatres is an important horizon for academics traditionally used to standing and delivering.","This crisis-driven expanded interest in vaccines to address epidemic threats is encouraging, but there is still much work to be done. There needs to be a viable, sustainable business model that will align the financial incentives of stakeholders to encourage the necessary investment in vaccine development (19, 20) . While governments and international agencies have striven to create incentives to attract additional private sector investment in vaccine development, these efforts have so far failed in attracting sufficient capital to enhance preparedness against the world's most deadly emerging pathogens (21) .","These results are consistent with the biopharma industry's trend towards fewer companies willing to engage in vaccine R&amp;D, underscoring the infeasibility of a private-sector EID vaccine portfolio given current cost and revenue estimates, and the need for some form of public-sector intervention. A sensitivity analysis of these results to perturbations in our model's key parameters is provided in the Supplementary Materials. We find that the EID vaccine megafund remains financially unattractive even under relatively optimistic cost and revenue assumptions, implying the necessity for some form of public-sector intervention. These findings may explain the dearth of EID vaccines developed over the past decade.","Representatives from the public sector of three countries (Spain, Costa Rica, and Chile) will present their particular experiences in order to illustrate this co-operation, as well as recovery strategies and the current tourism situation. Furthermore, three associations that are highly representative of the private sector will discuss the determining factors affecting three especially sensitive areas of the world: the US, the Middle East, and the Asia-Pacific region.","Also at the global level, the UN Office for DRR [8] issued a press release on the 12th of March 2020 urging disaster management agencies to prioritize biological hazards. The UNDRR asked national disaster management agencies to continue with the development of their preparedness and response capacities to include health emergencies as a top priority, alongside earthquakes, floods, storms and other natural hazards (UNDRR, 2020). It also highlighted the importance of silo-breaking in disaster prevention and management, notably the silos between disaster management and health workers. The UNDRR reiterates that the Sendai Framework emphasizes the need for resilient health systems and the integration of disaster risk management into health care provision at all levels. After all, Sendai turns the focus from disaster response and management to preparedness, surveillance and disaster risk management in the health context (UNDRR, 2020). Yet it is not clear whether COVID-19 is leading to collaboration between the WHO and the UNDRR. We appraise the speed and scale by which COVID-19 response funds are made available. International funding organisations, regional government bodies and private entities have proposed major financial measures. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) made $50 billion in loans available to deal with the coronavirus, including $10 billion of zero-interest loans to the poorest IMF member countries (IMF, 2020). The EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen announced a \u20ac25 billion coronavirus investment fund for the health care sector, labour market and SMEs (EU, 2020). The World Bank Group increases COVID-19 Response to $14 billion to help sustain economies and protect jobs. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) announces $6.5 billion initial response to COVID-19 pandemic (ADB, 2020). The UN announced $15 million dollars from the UN's Central Emergency Fund to help fund global efforts to contain the spread of the COVID-19 coronavirus, particularly vulnerable countries with weak health care systems (UN, 2020). It is important to note that in the SFDRR, investment and finance are at the core of Sendai Framework, in terms of the resilience investment needed for countries and communities.","The Pandemic Emergency Financing Facility (PEF) pandemic bond was facilitated by the World Bank to pre-pool money for rapid response ahead of a disease outbreak. It is a response to a dilemma: when health crises occur, many countries promise financial support but do not pay. The call for cash-on-demand intensified during the 2014-16 west African Ebola pandemic, and the World Bank issued the world's first pandemic bond in July, 2017, raising $425 million from private investors. The financial terms of the pandemic bond are complex, but, in short, large private investors (rather than nationstates) put money in up-front for 3 years. If a qualifying pandemic occurs during that time, some of the money is disbursed for pandemic response. Otherwise, the investors get their money back plus interest of 10% or more. 8 Everyone concerned with public health agrees that pre-committed pandemic funds are a good idea. However, growing uncertainty about how best to pay for health emergencies of international concern has brought previous health and humanitarian risk management strategies into question. In the past, governments and philanthropies mitigated all kinds of risks, from disease outbreaks to droughts. Since the 1970s, however, private sector involvement in civic problem-solving has increased. The pandemic bond is an iteration of the trend of turning to the private sector for global health and humanitarian funding solutions. The predominant ideologies of public health and the financial sectors, however, differ greatly.","Decisions must be made quickly during epidemics based on patchy and uncertain data, and models can be powerful tools to help guide them. Despite the challenges above, ongoing advances in computational power, methods, and new data streams offer genuine hope for better surveillance and useful forecasting systems. New data sources at our disposal include not only the passively observed big data streams from mobile phones but also detailed environmental data and local sensor information from distributed devices, internet search information, pathogen genomic data that can be generated rapidly during an outbreak to inform the response, 7 and crowd-sourced approaches to monitoring rapidly evolving emergencies. 8 Data sharing platforms and standardised aggregation approaches that protect the privacy of personal data are being developed, 9 and increasing internet connectivity allows for rapid data transfer and communication between geographically disparate teams of responders. Methodologically, powerful ensemble modelling approaches are being developed that combine multiple forecasts to minimise uncertainty. 5, 10 We have seen an unprecedented, collaborative approach unfolding in response to the COVID-19 outbreak between academic groups: for example, using Twitter and other platforms to share, analyse, and openly discuss the implications of new data as they come out. (Ironically, managing the disinformation that also proliferates on social media during emergencies will probably become one of the most important issues for epidemic containment moving forward.)","As demonstrated in our simulations, the investment required to reduce the global risk from EIDs is within reach. Securing these resources, however, will require governments to strengthen their commitments to supporting EID vaccine markets, in order to allow private sector stakeholders and untapped capital to engage with these markets substantively. The recent developments around Sanofi Pasteur's Zika collaboration highlight the risks of a variable commitment to preparedness. Due to changing epidemiology and internal disputes over potential product pricing, BARDA and Sanofi have chosen to halt further development of their Zika asset, leaving society vulnerable to future outbreaks (51) .","As cases like this suggest, government buy-in is integral for long-term pipeline sustainability. Governments can catalyze outside investments through a range of strategies, including guaranteed commitments. Fifteen years of guaranteed revenue via purchase commitments, similar to the U.S. government's purchase of smallpox and anthrax vaccines, would do well to encourage development efforts. For example, an annual purchase commitment of $150 million per successful vaccine candidate would represent an NPV of $1.14 billion, exceeding our modeled breakeven NPV of $772 million. Our results suggest that investment in this space is highly unattractive to the private sector, requiring commitments of the aforementioned magnitude for development viability; as highlighted above, either the price per regimen or the demand from outbreaks would have to increase by orders of magnitude to have the same effect. We encourage readers to engage with these assumption parameters critically using our open source software.","In Syria, the healthcare system was comprised of a government-run public system prior to the conflict, which offered most of the primary care services. The private sector mostly focused on urban areas providing the majority of advanced care services. The past decades were categorized by the enhanced capacity of the healthcare system and swiftly developing national health indicators including the increased rate of child immunization and infant mortality rate. However, the commencement of civil war led to the worsening of the healthcare sector through the broad destruction of facilities, shortage of medicines, and healthcare personnel along with lack of secure transportation and secure routes [1].","More far reaching for security operations management was the Homeland Security Act of 2002 (PL 107-296). This Act created the most significant change in government structure since establishment of the Department of Defense through the National Security Act of 1947. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) resulted from the merging of 22 federal agencies with a mandate to establish a safe and secure homeland. The impact on security operations didn't end at the federal level. Additionally, Homeland Security Presidential Directive/HSPD-5 tasked DHS to develop and administer a National Incident Management System (NIMS) and a National response plan (Nrp). The private sector was to participate in the process. Within a few years following 9/11, every state government and the District of Columbia established an entity to find ways to protect communities from terrorist risks. This structure also facilitated a practical objective: state governments were now able to receive funding from DHS and other entities concerned with protection. The net effect of DHS was to channel billions of dollars for security products, services, systems, and research throughout the nation. Furthermore, agencies within DHS encouraged and mandated changes in security practices in the private sector.","Information about the size and subunit composition of the proteins that are present in viruses is most commonly determined by electrophoresis through polyacrylamide gels (review, Maizel, 1971) . In this method, acrylamide is polymerized to form cylinders or slabs, and the mixture of proteins under investigation is added to the top of the gel. When an electric current is applied across the ends of the gel, the proteins in the mixture migrate through it as bands at speeds which are governed, on the one hand, by the net charge of the protein molecules in the buffer conditions used, and, on the other hand, by the pore size of the gel. The smaller protein molecules pass through the pores formed by the polyacrylamide cross-links more easily than the larger proteins, and so they migrate faster. By adjusting the acrylamide concentrations within the range 5-15%, gels with pore sizes suitable for the separation of protein molecules with a wide spectrum of molecular weights can easily be generated. The position of the protein bands is determined either by staining the fixed gel with dyes like Coomassie Brilliant Blue, or by autoradiography, or by cutting it into small segments and counting the amount of radioactivity in each fraction.","\u2022 Establish a coordination group with a multiagency approach. It is important to include hospital administrators, religious authorities, municipal services, cemeteries and crematoriums for a truly integrated response. While not involved in the process, the private sector are key resources and should be engaged recognizing there might be limitations as per local regulations.","\u2022 At the London Nutrition for Growth Summit in June 2013, global leaders committed to giving \u0141 3 billion in funding to tackle the problem of malnutrition in the world\u2019s poorest countries. The summit was primarily supported by The Children\u2019s Investment Fund Foundation and consisted of both private and public sector agencies, including the World Bank. Research by Save the Children identifies lack of nutrients in the first 1000 days of life as a major risk factor for learning difficulties, greatly stunting economic and social development within emerging countries. The charity\u2019s chief executive Justin Forsyth highlighted the importance of the summit in recognising this significant danger of malnutrition and urges them to \u201ccommit to tackle its scourge for good.\u201d This increase in funding is therefore an impressive start to the G8 period. (Financial Times, 8 Jun 2013)","\u2022 The World Bank\u2019s Doing Business annual survey measures the costs to companies of business regulations in each of the 183 countries surveyed. By supporting transparency and spurring improvements in business environments, it aims to promote private sector development and wealth creation within each country \u2013 crucially important to developing countries. It is also one of the lending criteria for low\u2013income countries. Yet there is controversy over the Bank\u2019s methodology and its focus on de\u2013regulation. There are real concerns that some countries try to improve their rankings by diluting vital safety and environmental protection legislation. This criticism has come from some developing countries (including China), aid agencies and trade unions. This prompted a review of the report in June 2013, which recommends overhauling the indicators, and reviewing its economic rationale to ensure fairness. (The Guardian, 31 May 2013)","\u2022 The non\u2013profit International Medica Foundation has developed the first rotavirus vaccine suitable for newborn babies. The vaccine\u2013preventable rotavirus can cause life\u2013threatening diarrhoea. In developing countries, it is more common amongst babies and younger children compared to developed countries. In China alone, it causes 4900 deaths and 329 000 hospitalisations of children and infants, causing more than half a million deaths worldwide. Existing rotavirus vaccinations are expensive to produce, transport and store, carry higher risks of intestinal blockages, and are unsuitable for newborn babies. The new vaccination overcomes these problems, and is suitable for global use. They have been sub\u2013licensed to Shanghai BravoBio Co. Ltd of China, a private biotechnology company based in Shanghai, for use in China. The Foundation is now seeking more private sector partners to extend global coverage. (WSJ, 27 Jun 2013)","Fourth, the three health systems developed plans to sustain routine health-care services, but the integration of services has been problematic. In Japan, as the capacity at designated hospitals becomes overstretched, the coordination between hospitals and local government will be a major challenge. In Singapore, at the beginning of the outbreak, there were difficulties with disseminating information to the private sector. In all locations, intensive-care unit bed capacity is limited.","Medical devices such as surgical staples, vena-caval (Greenfield) filters, metal stents and shunts, and other devices may have sharp edges or points that can be encountered unexpectedly at autopsy. 36 Use of forceps and separate storage in thick-walled bags or jars is recommended for such sharp metal hazards. Needle fragments are a potential hazard to pathologists performing autopsies on drug-addicted patients. Embolized needle foreign bodies have been discovered in soft tissues of the neck and even within internal organs. [37] [38] [39] In high-risk cases, Hutchins and colleagues 40 recommend preautopsy radiographic screening, reduced tissue manipulation during prosection, and delay of autopsy in human immunodeficiency virus-positive cases, in addition to the standard recommendations for protection against injury from sharp instruments.","Not all doctors treating Covid-19 infected patients are as cheerful. Preparedness and intent to fight this Infection with aggressive public health measures by Indian Government is praiseworthy, but to treat Covid-19 patients is a serious matter, which requires training, wearing correct PPE, availability of modern ICU and presence of dedicated team of doctors. In public sectors, as such ICUs need upgradation, and private sector is not yet ready to manage these highly infectious seriously sick patients. A matter of considerable concern is whether continuous supply of PPE could be enough or maintained in public sector hospitals. Even in UK, PPE provided are inadequate, and that some healthcare workers are left with just surgical mask and plastic apron for protection (3) . In China, despite high priority and dedicated funding, many healthcare workers bought protective gear with their own money or borrowed cash or donations from friends in china or other countries (4).","Will financial innovation transform humanitarian responses? It already has. The indignation of the public health sector is unlikely to quash new forms of aid, but health partisans can provide safeguards. They can engage with and interrogate the language and priorities of finance. They can require that the bonds' triggers be publicly negotiated and open access. They can push for disbursement criteria that place the needs of the sick before the demands of investors. They can fight for consultation with communities where pandemics occur. But public health influence on these financial instruments will require involvement in global health and humanitarian politics that has heretofore been considered incidental rather than first-order health prevention. 13 We declare no competing interests.","Hence money deficit will be a major problem for the government to implement this kind of 22 plans, for that government can ask or take ten percentage of salary from organized sector 23 workers (both from government and private), and government contain grains have to be 24 distributed through Public Distribution System (PDS).

Our ongoing action to control the spread has been the collaborative work of the private and public sector, key players at the national and local levels, and shared knowledge amongst different expertise ranging from transportation, immigration, economic affairs, labor, education, and healthcare.","We mentioned earlier that the commons aligned well to a wicked problem or challenge. These multiple stakeholder societal problems are messy, intractable, confusing and incorporate countervailing opinions (Alford &amp; Head, 2017) . Taming such challenges requires A. Kriz, et al. Industrial Marketing Management xxx (xxxx) xxx-xxx transformational insight and ultimately more wicked innovation. Changing top-down national and international systems is complicated. The AMS Review has added a more robust theory and practice section which is one example of changing international efforts. Many of the more effective instruments for positive change are likely to be tactical and bottom-up; i.e. at your own business school, faculty and university level. A simple start for each business school, at the regional commons and quadruple helix level, is more effective engagement with industry, government and community on a place-based level. Some do this well, but most don't. The IMP AAR model combines well with regional innovation systems models (T\u00f6dtling &amp; Trippl, 2005 ) as a way of mapping and understanding each local helix and commons stakeholders. Key stakeholders can then be selected as part of an advisory board to help set KPIs and monitor a new academic balanced scorecard. The advisory board should measure aspects like the number of interns and the number of courses where WIL is operational and effective. Rewards for practice around educational programs and impact need to at least match workload rewards for publishing. Advisory boards should incorporate alumni and executives that have been involved in educational programs. Monitoring skill performance of graduands for key capabilities around immediate employability could also be introduced as a broader regional commons initiative. Instead of simply surveying students on their satisfaction, an omnibus of the region should measure effectiveness. This should incorporate international partners to assess global impact. Rewards for educational excellence, including high quality theory, could be applied and then monitored by the advisory board. Reviewing research quantum and other measures to ensure the commons remains connected should also form part of the brief. As suggested, this process is not new to some business schools, but its broader diffusion would add some competitive tension to the sector. Signalling is indeed a two-way activity. Knowing that a university ranks highly in skills development and employability signals to the best management and marketing students where to enrol.","\u2022 Support should be given to the mother and her family to cope with separation from her neonate, potential prolonged maternal hospitalization, parenting issues, neonatal nutrition, and breast engorgement \u2022 As separation of mother and neonate may last for less than 10 days, breast pumping is recommended so that breastfeeding may begin once isolation has been discontinued","However, despite the indisputable roles that installed devices play in providing relevant health information, their data communication aspect needs to be reviewed. First, communications are seen to be geography-restricted (restricted to a given location), such that they seldom expand or communicate with their like, installed beyond their restricted areas. Secondly, these devices are usually sourced and installed by separate corporations that maintain unique and specific standards for data processing and sharing, and accordingly, tying cities to the sole usage of their product(s). Such strategies are adopted as private corporations try to maximize their economic gains, since the digital solution market is a lucrative one and is expected to continue growing and expanding [6, 7] .","\u2022 Support should be given to the mother and her family to cope with separation from her neonate, potential prolonged maternal hospitalization, parenting issues, neonatal nutrition, and breast engorgement \u2022 As separation of mother and neonate may last for less than 10 days, breast pumping is recommended so that breastfeeding may begin once isolation has been discontinued Neonatal resuscitation","1.

Significant progress has been made in fighting these diseases, and Mr Ki\u2013moon declared that it is possible to eliminate them within five years. He called on the private sector and philanthropists to join the fight, saying that every US$ 1 invested in fighting malaria in Africa, US$ 40 is generated in gross domestic product, strengthening economies and peoples\u2019 livelihoods. (UN News, 5 Jun 2013)","While the significance of such data in advancing efficiency, productivity and processes in different sectors is being lauded, there are criticisms arising as to the nature of data collection, storage, management and accessibility by only a small group of users. The latter particularly includes select ICT corporations that are also located in specific geographies [6, [14] [15] [16] [17] . These criticisms are justified, as in recent years, big data is seen as the new 'gold rush' of the 21st century and limiting its access means higher economic returns and increased influence and control at various scales to those who control data. These associated benefits with big data are clearly influencing geopolitical standings, in both corporate and conventional governance realms, and there is increased competition between powerful economies to ensure that they have the maximum control of big data. As case in point is the amount of 'push and pull' that has arisen from Huawei's 5G internet planned rollout [18] . Though the latter service offers unprecedented opportunities to increase internet speeds, and thereby influence the handling of big data, countries like the U.S. and some European countries that are key proponents and players in global political, economic and health landscapes, are against this rollout, arguing that it is a deceptive way of gathering private data under the guise of espionage. On this, it has been noted that the issue of data control and handling by a few corporations accords with their principles of nationalism, and that these work for their own wellbeing as well as to benefit the territories they are registered in. Therefore, geopolitical issues are expected on the technological front as most large data-rich corporations are located in powerful countries that have influence both economically, health-wise and politically [19] [20] [21] . Such are deemed prized tokens on the international landscape, and it is expected that these economies will continue to work towards their predominant control as much as possible. On the health sector, the same approach is being upheld where critical information and data are not freely shared between economies as that would be seen to be benefiting other in-competition economies, whereas different economies would cherish the maximization of benefits from such data collections.","These changes all resulted from the attack on the morning of September 11, 2001. The South Tower of the World Trade Center imploded less than 1 hour after being struck. About 0.5 hour after that the North Tower collapsed.

In the situation within New york City, the startling reality is that perhaps 15,000 lives were saved by the prompt actions of alert, trained floor fire marshals and also by security officers -the true first responders -who personally assisted countless masses of terrified office workers rushing out of the Towers in a true life and death struggle. That day hit the contract security guard industry hard. Twenty-nine security officers from four providers died in the process. Other proprietary security personnel also were lost. This tragic event with response from security services missed the attention of the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks on the united States where only a brief mention of private security is found in the commission's report. 6 However, the process did recognize the importance of the private sector in contributing to national security.
