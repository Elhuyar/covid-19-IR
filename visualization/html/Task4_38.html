Significant levels of co-circulation of both influenza B lineages (B/Victoria and B/Yamagata) and lineage mismatch between the vaccine and circulating lineage was reported for Brazil in five influenza seasons (2002, 2005, 2008, 2010, and 2013) . [42] [43] [44] Previous studies suggest that even with a partial mismatch over the years, due to the unpredictability of influenza B lineage circulation, the disease burden (in terms of clinical cases, hospitalizations and health care resource utilization) and societal burden can be considerable. 2, 9 For example, a mismatch in the 2007-2008 influenza season in the United States was estimated to have costed health care providers and society well over $100 million and $1 billion, respectively. 45 In another study conducted in Taiwan, it was reported that an epidemic predominated by influenza B/Yamagata lineage occurred during the 2011-2012 season during which the trivalent influenza vaccine contained influenza B/Victoria lineage. Expectedly, the morbidity and mortality of this vaccine mismatched epidemic was substantial (influenza B: 60.7% and 66.9% of confirmed influenza cases and deaths, respectively; 87.2% of samples showed the presence of vaccine opposite lineage). 46 Surveillance data on the age distribution of influenza cases is available only for 2013. This data showed that influenza B virus was predominantly observed in younger individuals aged 5-29 years, with the highest proportions in children aged 5-9 years and 10-19 years. Even though this observation was restricted to only one year with 90% mismatch it is in line with previous reports wherein influenza B has been reported to affect more schoolchildren and the appearance of the new B lineage reinforced this pattern. 4 An implication of this finding is that children and adolescents might benefit the most from the addition of a second influenza B lineage to the seasonal influenza vaccine. Moreover, it could be useful for the entire population as it is widely considered that vaccinating children can reduce influenza illness in family members and other susceptible populations in the community by reducing the risk of exposure and subsequent influenza infection and related complications. 47 11 that influenza B-associated mortality could potentially be a valid indication of disease severity. Thus the evidence presented here for one year underscores the importance of a universal influenza vaccination strategy compared to targeted immunization as universal immunization at high vaccine coverage levels could potentially interrupt transmission reducing the occurrence of outbreaks and severe disease.","By contrast, the outbreak of Ebola infection continues unabated in West Africa. There have been more than 10,000 cases in the current outbreak, around five times more cases of Ebola than had ever been reported prior to this outbreak. Furthermore, the three secondary transmissions that have occurred from the 13 cases cared for outside of West Africa to date (two in the USA and one in Spain) have pushed the Ebola crisis to the top of the agenda of many hospitals around the world. This has led to a degree of politicization, where regional and national decisions are made for political reasons rather than based on evidence, resulting in measures such as mandatory quarantine, airport screening, and immigration bans. 7, 8 Politicization aside, research performed during the current outbreak has provided some new insight into the epidemiology of Ebola. It is most usually transmitted through direct contact with blood or body fluids including droplet sprays (through broken skin or mucous membranes). 9,10 However, transmission can also occur though indirect contact with contaminated environments. 9e12 Indeed, one outbreak report from Sierra Leone identified incorrect personal protective equipment (PPE) for cleaning staff as a likely contributor to transmission. 12 Furthermore, despite being enveloped viruses, Ebola (and indeed MERS-CoV) has the capacity to survive on dry surfaces for days, not hours. 13e15 One study even suggests an Ebola survival time measured in weeks, but this study was done at 4 C, so does not represent field conditions. 15 These in-vitro survival times combined with the potential for blood and body fluid contamination argue for careful attention to cleaning and disinfection when caring for patients with Ebola virus disease. Several studies have evaluated the basic reproductive number (R 0 ) for Ebola infection in field settings, which seems to be w2. One study found that R 0 is significantly higher in nonsurvivors (2.36) than in survivors (0.66), reinforcing the suggestion that contact with patients in the latter stages of disease is the most important risk factor for acquiring Ebola virus. 16 Another area of controversy has been the appropriate type of PPE when dealing with Ebola. Earlier US recommendations were upgraded following the transmissions in Dallas, and now recommend a 'no skin in the game' approach, where all skin is covered. 17 However, having the right PPE policy is only part of the solution e you also need to ensure PPE supply and that staff know how to don and doff it safely. 18, 19 Universal versus targeted interventions Several high-profile studies have suggested that we should move away from 'targeted' interventions, particularly screening and decolonization, towards 'universal' interventions such as chlorhexidine daily bathing for all intensive care unit (ICU) patients. 20, 21 The most persuasive evidence for a universal approach involves the use of chlorhexidine for daily bathing for all ICU patients. It is worth noting, in passing, that this is not a truly universal approach since it is applied to a targeted population! The studies are impressive, especially in terms of design and to a lesser degree in terms of impact (Table I) . 22e25 Similarly, the use of antibiotics for selective digestive decontamination (SDD) or selective oral decontamination (SOD) has been advocated for all ICU patients. Again, the study design and impact are impressive, with reduced transmission and reduced mortality (Table II) . 26e29 However, indiscriminate use of biocides (such as chlorhexidine) and especially antibiotics is not without 'collateral damage'. 30 Several studies have reported increased antibiotic resistance associated with SOD and SDD, and other studies have reported reduced bacterial susceptibility associated with universal use of chlorhexidine. 28,31e34 So we need to consider carefully the downside before wholeheartedly adopting universal decolonization.","There have been three or four pandemics of influenza every century for as long as can be ascertained from historical studies and there is every reason to believe that pandemics will come again in the twenty-first century. If H5N1 virus should acquire the ability to spread readily from person to person, and if its high lethality for humans should continue unabated, it could cause a devastating pandemic. Efforts are being made to prepare defenses against this virus, including vaccines and antiviral drugs, supported by the U.S. government and other governments. Promising vaccines are being developed and tested in clinical trials, and plans are to stockpile such a vaccine for possible use if an epidemic of this virus arises. This effort is complicated by the fact that H5N1 influenza, like all influenzas, continues to evolve, and stockpiled vaccine might not be completely effective against the strain that ultimately might emerge as a pandemic strain. Nevertheless, there is hope that at least partial immunity might be effected by such a vaccine that could ameliorate the symptoms of the disease and protect against the extreme virulence of the virus. As described in Chapter 4, new approaches to flu vaccine development are being tried, including development of a universal flu vaccine that would work against any influenza A strain, but such an approach will clearly require many more years of research before a licensed vaccine for general use could be produced. Efforts are also being directed toward producing and stockpiling antiviral compounds directed against influenza. Unfortunately, most H5N1 isolates tested are resistant to amantadine and related compounds, antiflu agents that have been in use for years and that are readily available. It is thought that this is the result of the wide use of amantadine by Chinese farmers to protect their chicken flocks from influenza, thereby selecting for amantadine-resistant variants of the viruses. This effect may be moderating, however, as some recent isolates are sensitive to amantadine. Inhibitors of the influenza neuraminidase such as oseltamivir (Tamiflu) and zanamivir appear to be reasonably effective against H5N1 virus, but these drugs must be used early in infection if they are to be effective. Production of these compounds is limiting at present, but production is being accelerated in order to stockpile them for possible use if or when a pandemic erupts.","Community and healthcare preparedness in response to coronavirus outbreaks remain ongoing obstacles for global public health. For example, delays between disease development and progression and diagnosis or quarantine can severely impact both patient management and containment [21, 71] . Deficiencies in outbreak preparedness and healthcare network coordination efforts must ultimately be considered in response efforts. It is strongly recommended that universal reagents be maintained and available at global repositories for future outbreaks.","banning all travel and all non-basic economic activities, together with the intensified use of diagnostic tests in suspected cases has proven to yield good results. 3 Also, there is an urgent need to establish a purchasing and supply channel for personal protective equipment, which is currently insufficient for health personnel who are highly exposed to and prone to contagion. The recent finding on the spreading capacity of SARS-CoV-2 by contamination of eyelashes and hair reinforces this need. 4 The proposed suppression policies will not mean the end of CoVID-19 in Spain in the initial 3-4 weeks; therefore, the development of strategies to sustain the gains is critical. A key lesson from the Asian experience is the need to create a robust surveillance system capable of collecting and reporting epidemiological data down to the individual or household level. 5 There are two pillars for the development of such a system: (1) the development and implementation of a universal mobile application for self-reporting of suspected COVID-19 symptoms as well as apps to support contact tracing efforts (eg, TraceTogether mobile app; Singapore); and (2) increased diagnostic capacity to test all individuals with symptoms for early isolation. The identification of an increase in the number of cases in an area would trigger quick remedial measures like the implementation of early and targeted suppression actions.","And the utility of economic statecraft has been systematically underestimated. 7 Today, it is all too common for great powers to resort to economic statecraft and social penetration to further their national interests. nuclear program. 8 The Russian Federation launched cyber warfare to destabilize Ukraine's democratic order. Moreover, Russia misinformed and polarized U.S. voters by extensive propaganda and penetration of social media platforms. 9 As a rising power, aiming at building its own order and sphere of influence, China has been engaging extensively in economic and social penetration of other countries. For instance, China banned rare earth metals exports to Japan and curtailed the import of Japanese autos due to the territory disputes regarding the Senkaku/Diaoyu Island in the East China Sea. China, as noted, also banned banana imports from the Philippines to coerce the Philippines to concede in the South China Sea dispute. 10 More important, economic globalization, the development of supply chains, and breakthroughs of network technology have jointly transformed and updated China's coercive capabilities. Some liberal scholars argue that global networks create mutual dependence that decrease states' incentives to engage in conflict or coercion. However, as political scientists Henry Farrell at George Washington University and Abraham L. Newman at Georgetown University show, global connectivity actually creates new opportunities for great powers to coerce, manipulate, and penetrate. Like Hirschman's emphasis on power asymmetry in economic interdependence, Farrell and Newman also find that modern globalization results in asymmetrical networks, in which some states are far more connected than others. Those states become the \"hubs\" of the global networks and have the capabilities to exploit \"weaponized interdependence.\" Specifically, those great powers can utilize their hub positions to gather information or cut off financial and information flows, discover and exploit vulnerabilities, compel policy change, and deter unwanted actions. 11 Sharp Power and Social Penetration. Financial power, hub positions in the global exchange networks, and information supply chains also enable authoritarian regimes to engage in comprehensive social penetration and manipulation of other societies. Christopher Walker and Jessica Ludwig of the National Endowment for Democracy analyze such phenomena through a lens of \"sharp power,\" defined as authoritarian influence efforts to \"pierce, penetrate, or perforate the information environments and societies in the targeted countries.\" To delegitimize democracies and other universal human-rights regimes, authoritarian regimes seek to incite and amplify existing divisions in democratic societies by manipulating or faking the information that reaches them. They also use financial incentives to induce media or civil societies in democracies to censor opinions that may be critical of those authoritarian regimes.","The deficiencies in this legislation were highlighted by the measles epidemic of 1989-1991, which involved more than 55,000 cases and led to 123 deaths. 35, 76 Substantial numbers of unimmunized preschool children, particularly in inner-city areas, contributed to this event. 76 To ensure that vulnerable children had more reliable access to vaccines, the government refocused their funding resources on helping individual states in building immunization infrastructure. VFC is a state-operated federal entitlement program that provides free Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices-recommended vaccines to children 18 years of age or younger who are uninsured, Alaska Native or Native American, eligible for Medicaid, or receive their vaccines in a federally qualified health center. 77 At the state level, funds are earmarked for vaccine purchase and immunization programs. 35 State funds also have been used to purchase vaccines for children and adolescents not eligible for VFC. A combination of VFC, state/local, and Section 317 program funds (i.e., VFC only, VFC and Underinsured, VFC and Underinsured Select, Universal, and Universal Select) has been used by a number of states to purchase all recommended vaccines for children in the state, including the privately insured. 78 Many states use universal programs that expand the eligibility for VFC vaccines by supplementing VFC purchases at federally discounted prices. The universal purchase states have been successful in raising vaccination rates among the underinsured 79 and increasing access to newer and more expensive vaccines for children without insurance. 75 However, criticisms of the universal purchase programs have been raised, including (1) vaccine manufacturers' claims that universal purchase programs unfairly provide for the purchase of all vaccines at lower government contract prices, thus eliminating the private market for vaccines and decreasing revenue; (2) although immunization charges are reduced under this program, patients still pay for the vaccine administration fee; and (3) some contend that taxpayer money should not be spent to provide free vaccines for children whose insurance would otherwise pay for it. 79 State Medicaid and State Children's Health Insurance Program funds also are provided for vaccine purchase, although the level of Medicaid funding varies from state to state.","It may be useful to combine several components into a universal vaccine, for example, NP and M1 to induce cellular responses and HA and M2e to induce humoral responses. However, there are several challenges to the development of a universal vaccine. As outlined above, most of the viral proteins that potentially induce broad heterosubtypic immunity are poorly immunogenic and require a large dose of antigen, multiple doses, addition of adjuvants, fusion to immunogenic carriers, or the use of vectors or VLPs. Additionally, regulatory challenges include how to determine and define the potency of the vaccine and the need to identify immune correlates of protection and develop validated assays to measure them. In addition, clinical trials will be challenging because it is likely that efficacy will be measured in terms of amelioration of disease rather than preventing infection (Subbarao and Matsuoka, 2013) .","Why should adults care about paediatric vaccination? S57 one by two weeks. A longer duration of viral shedding and higher viral titres in the naso-pharynx compared with adults, associated with promiscuity (day care centres, school) explain the children' major vector role in this respiratory transmission. Any intervention in childhood limiting Influenza virus circulation in the community should provide indirect protection (\"herd immunity\") to adults. Large immunisation programmes in children have been investigated in different settings measuring the protection of contacts (households) or the community at large. So far, routine immunisation of school-age children appear to be effective in preventing the disease burden in the community and adults contacts in several studies. Nevertheless, methodological discrepancies between them render imprecise the estimation of this strategy on effectiveness: which preventable fraction is achievable in adults? The impact in the community depends on the coverage rate achieved, the vaccine efficacy and the contact patterns. Some simulation models taking in account different efficacy figures of Influenza vaccines (most assume a protective efficacy of 70% and a 80% efficacy for infectiousness) and different coverage levels suggest that a coverage rate of 20% of schoolchildren would result in as much mortality reduction in elderly as vaccinating 90% of persons aged 64 and over. Nevertheless, if the universal influenza immunisation strategy in schoolchildren has demonstrated some benefits in term of reduction of the disease burden -either in observational studies or in mathematical models -in adults or elderly, some points must be raised: -Routine vaccination of school aged children has not been shown to decrease by indirect effect the burden of disease in infants and younger children who are highly infectious (thus transmitting the virus) or more at risk of hospitalisation for severe Influenza disease. So far the American recommendation of immunisation first before 23 months of age, then, since 2006 up to 59 months of age is mainly based on a reduction of morbidity, hospitalisation, mortality in the targeted group. -An other source of concern is the low coverage rates achieved postrecommendation in the US, especially for the full primo-vaccination demanding two doses below 9 years of age. -It has not been demonstrated yet that routine vaccination of children below 2 years of age has an indirect impact in the population. -In Europe, the injectable trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine TIV, sole available raises the issues of acceptability by the families, and on a national public health point of view the feasibility of such a programme, the huge increase of resources and the adequate information strategies. -TIV efficacy may vary depending of the child's age, the matching of the strains -wild/vaccine -although mathematical models assume its upper range (70%) and never more conservative hypothesis (the real life). -Clearly the availability of an intra-nasal live attenuated influenza vaccine in Europe could be an opportunity to enlarge the strategies due to its higher protective efficacy and easiness of administration.","The composition of haplotypes changed substantially from early targeted testing to later targeted testing (Figure 4) . The A2a1 and A2a2 haplotypes which had collectively made up 103 out of 157 haplotypes (65.6%) in the early targeted testing were reduced to 44 of 144 haplotypes (30.6%) in the late targeted testing, mostly because of the increased frequency of the A1a and A2a haplotypes, the two most common haplotypes in the population screening. This is probably because the population screening identified clusters of infected individuals who seeded from areas that had not been designated as high-risk e.g. the UK. The later targeted testing was then more likely to find new individuals from these clusters, both because the targeted testing was extended to include more high-risk areas and because the population screening had identified cases that could be used to inform further contact tracking efforts.","When GA was removed, fusion was restored (Fig. 6A, Bar 4), indicating that GA interferes with fusion in a reversible manner. Viral fusion, regardless of fusion protein, proceeds through the creation of hemifusion, an intermediate state in which proximal lipid monolayer leaflets of membranes, in contact with one another, have merged, but the distal monolayers remain distinct. Because inhibition of fusion was universal, independent of viral protein, it is extremely unlikely that GA targeted the fusion proteins themselves. This is consistent with GA inhibiting the creation of the hemifusion intermediate, and universal inhibition would be expected. It is well known that agents conferring positive spontaneous curvature, such as lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC), inhibit fusion induced by viral and non-viral fusion proteins17. Likewise, the cone-shaped lipid oleic acid (OA) has a negative spontaneous membrane curvature, which favors hemifusion when present in the outer bilayer, and its presence relieves the inhibition of fusion18. The addition of OA together with GA abolished the inhibitory effect of GA (Fig. 6B), indicating that GA induces positive membrane curvature.","BCG is a live attenuated strain derived from an isolate of Mycobacterium bovis used widely across the world as a vaccine for Tuberculosis (TB), with many nations, including Japan and China, having a universal BCG vaccination policy in newborns 1 . Other countries such as Spain, France, and Switzerland, have discontinued their universal vaccine policies due to comparatively low risk for developing M. bovis infections as well as the proven variable effectiveness in preventing adult TB; countries such as the United States, Italy, and the Netherlands, have yet to adopt universal vaccine policies for similar reasons.","Randomized controlled comparisons of the efficacy of inactivated and live attenuated vaccine in children have consistently shown that live vaccine provides superior efficacy in this population, with an approximately 50% lower cumulative incidence of influenza in those receiving live vaccine. 160 Similar comparisons in adults have suggested slightly superior efficacy of inactivated vaccine, 161 and large cohort studies are also consistent with the interpretation that inactivated vaccine has slightly better efficacy than live vaccine in adults, particularly in those who have received vaccines in previous years. 162 Previous strategies for prevention of influenza in the United States and other countries have focused on targeting vaccines to persons at higher risk for influenza-related complications (see Table 32 -4) and on individuals in close contact with these high-risk individuals. Such recommendations were complex and in some ways difficult to implement, leading to lower than desired vaccine uptake. In addition, it was recognized that more universal vaccination strategies, particularly of children, might be able to impact the spread of influenza in the community. Currently, the United States and many other countries have adopted a universal vaccination strategy with annual vaccination of all members of the population. This, of course, includes health care providers, and most institutions have adopted a policy of mandatory vaccination of individuals in contact with patients.","Further experimental studies (T cell and B cell assays) are required to determine the potential of the identified epitopes to induce a positive immune response against SARS-CoV-2. This would help to further refine the reported epitope set, based on observed immunogenicity; an important consideration for immunogen design. Overall, as the identified set of epitopes map identically to SARS-CoV-2, they present potentially useful candidates for guiding experimental efforts towards developing universal vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.","Because bacterial culture underestimates microbial diversity in the GI tract, molecular tools have now become the standard approach in gut microbial ecology. 1, 2, [11] [12] [13] [14] For molecular analysis, DNA or RNA is extracted from intestinal samples (eg, feces, biopsy specimen, luminal content). For phylogenetic identification or for molecular fingerprinting, a specific gene is amplified using universal primers (either bacterial, fungal, or archaeal) that target conserved regions within these genes. The conserved regions flank variable gene regions, which when sequenced allow the phylogenetic identification of the present organisms. For bacterial and archaeal identification, the 16S ribosomal RNA (16S rRNA) gene is most commonly targeted. Other targets include the 16S-23S internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region and the chaperonin (cpn60) gene. 12 Molecular fingerprinting Molecular fingerprinting is used to separate a mixture of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplicons that were generated by universal primers to yield a fingerprint, which is representative of the bacterial community within the sample. Different techniques include denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE), temperature gradient gel electrophoresis (TGGE), and terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP). 7, [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] In DGGE and TGGE, differences in nucleotide composition result in unique melting behaviors of the individual PCR amplicons, generating a banding pattern that illustrates the bacterial diversity in the sample. DGGE and TGGE are inexpensive and can be rapidly performed. However, DGGE and TGGE only allow a limited resolution of PCR amplicons because many bacterial phylotypes may have similar melting behaviors. Therefore, these techniques capture only changes in the predominant bacterial groups within the gut community. For identification purposes, bands of interest need to be sequenced. In T-RFLP, amplicons labeled with a fluorescent primer are fragmented in different sizes using sequence specific restriction enzymes, again yielding a characteristic fingerprint of the microbial community. 7 Identification of bacterial groups For identification of individual bacterial phylotypes, PCR amplicons generated using universal bacterial primers need to be separated and sequenced, which can be achieved by construction of 16S rRNA gene clone libraries, 11, 12, 20 or more recently by an automated high-throughput sequencing platform (eg, 454-pyrosequencing). This platform allows several thousand sequences to be analyzed within a few hours, yielding deep phylogenetic information about the intestinal microbiome. 1,2,13","There is only one major gateway into the country and a single payer healthcare system with universal access. SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals were identified both through targeted testing of individuals at high risk of infection and by population screening.","To track some of the trends in the infection prevention and control literature since the last HIS conference in late 2012, I plugged some search terms into Google Trends (a facility that compares the variation in volume of searches for selected terms over time). One infection control trend trumped all others: Ebola (Figures 1 and 2) . Whereas trends in Google searches may not necessarily correlate with trends in the infection prevention and control literature, in this case it is true that the outbreak of Ebola in West Africa has prompted a lot of publications in the literature e as well as consuming an awful lot of professional time for all who are connected with hospital infection prevention and control! Aside from Ebola, other trends in the infection prevention and control literature covered in this article include Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), universal versus targeted interventions, faecal microbiota transplantation, whole genome sequencing, carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE), and some aspects of environmental science. Finally, I attempt to predict some of the trends in the infection prevention and control literature between now and the next HIS conference in 2016.","Significant contributions to global health and infectious disease control have also been made through private-sector support. A leading example is the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (www .gatesfoundation.org), a privately funded effort begun in 2000 focused on reducing health disparities across the world and helping to address the global health challenges outlined by the 2000 Millennium Development Goals (www.un.org/millenniumgoals). Priorities for the Gates Foundation include efforts to reduce HIV infection/AIDS, malaria, tuberculosis, vaccine-preventable diseases, diarrheal diseases, pneumonia, and neglected infectious diseases. Other important global health initiatives supported by both government and nongovernment donors include the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunizations (GAVI Alliance; www.gavialliance.org) and the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria (www.theglobalfund.org). Two large U.S.-led efforts, the President's Malaria Initiative (PMI; www .fightingmalaria.gov) and the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR; www.pepfar.gov) provide targeted prevention and treatment support in countries most heavily affected by these leading killers. In particular, the impact of PEPFAR has been dramatic. Begun in 2004, the program requires country ownership and results-based efforts with goals for sustainability. In 2011 alone, PEPFAR supported treatment of nearly 4 million people, supported antiretroviral therapy for more than 1.5 HIV-infected pregnant women to prevent perinatal infection, and supported diagnostic testing for more than 40 million individuals. 509 Although national and global partnerships are critical to controlling infectious disease threats, local clinical, public health, and laboratory capacity remains the cornerstone for initial disease recognition and response. In the early 1980s, concerns by staff in the CDC's","A universal in all LCMS assays is the rule of \"breadth vs. depth,\" simply stated, increasing the number of targets in an experiment results in a decrease in the overall sensitivity of each measurement. The most common example is that untargeted assays which may observe thousands of peptide ions per experiment invariably have a lower limit of detection (LOD) and quantification (LOQ) compared to assays where a smaller number of ions are targeted. [21] [22] [23] Improvements in each subsequent generation of hardware can mitigate this compromise, but the improvement is limited. Today, the only way to truly offset this rule is to increase the total LCMS run time. A 2014 study by Majchrzykiewicz-Koehorst et al. described an untargeted LCMS assay that could discern three viruses in samples, both in vitro and ex vivo. However, the run time for this experiment was six hours per sample using nanoESI-quadrupole TOF technology. 24 Targeted peptide-centric assays are advantageous when sensitivity is paramount over the quantity of identified targets. Targeted assays often rely on tandem MS with high speed, but relatively low accuracy, quadrupoles. 21 Quadrupoles can be used to select ions for fragmentation with quantification of fragment ions by other quadrupoles in single reaction monitoring (SRM). They can also be used in conjunction with high resolution systems in single ion monitoring (SIM) and parallel reaction monitoring (PRM). SRM relies on fragmentation which requires a priori the mass to charge ratio (m/z) of both the peptide ion of interest and its dominant ions produced during fragmentation. Commonly, the collision energy is optimized for each peptide fragment in order to maximize efficiency and signal. SIM uses higher resolution scans in lieu of fragmentation, which requires a priori only an approximate m/z ratio for the peptide. In SIM targeted assays, the peptide ion's exact mass is extracted post-run during data processing. Two studies have shown that SIM scans with \u226560,000 resolution produce selectivity comparable to SRM. 25, 26 PRM targeted assays combine fragmentation and high resolution molecule monitoring. In contrast to SIM, isolated ions are subjected to fragmentation. Post-run data processing then calculates quantification from the highresolution accurate mass of the fragment ions. For proteins with only one available peptide target, PRM is the most selective technique in modern proteomics. 27, 28 Untargeted assays can be divided into two broad categories, data dependent (DDA) and data independent analyses (DIA). In DDA, the masses of all ions are observed in a relatively wide m/z range (MS1); the MS1 peptide ions meeting user-defined thresholds are subjected to fragmentation. 29 The resulting fragment ions are scanned, typically in a wide range for obtaining the most complete coverage of the peptide fragment ions. Common user-defined thresholds in DDA include selecting for peptides with: (1) sufficient signal for sequencing and (2) isotopic distributions matching models of typical peptides for that m/z. 30 The ion selection is performed in real time and automatically by the instrument, and has required less user input in method design with each generation of hardware. 31,32 DDA data analysis methods requires the least a priori information of all current LCMS methods. Although full de novo identification of peptide sequences is possible, it remains computationally demanding, thus typical post-instrument analysis relies on peptide search engines. Peptide search engines require the user to provide a database containing the protein sequences the user expects. As the MS1 and MS2 data is directly compared to this expected database, results are impacted by the accuracy of the database as well as on the availability of comprehensive proteome sequence information for the organism(s). Much of proteomics research relies on peptide search engines that predate the LCMS instrumentation by decades. Such software can consider multiple scenarios, such as alternative charge states, but cannot account for post translational modifications (PTMs) unless defined by the user a priori. 33 Recent developments in next-generation search engines (i.e., MetaMorpheus 34 , Bolt 35 , Byonic 36 , and MSFragger 37 ) can identify PTMs without the user providing predicted PTMs, but these tools have yet to be widely adopted by the field.","It is not known whether HCoV-EMC is going to be fully established in humans. Extensive efforts have been made and will continue to be needed to fight against this possible epidemic. If we are \u201clucky\u201d enough to control this novel disease, more resources should be allocated to different areas of coronavirus studies. Currently, we know some animal coronaviruses in wildlife only at the nucleotide level. In fact, the number of bat species tested for coronaviruses is only a fraction of the total number (&gt;1,200) of bat species. In addition, there is a lack of biological/biochemical characterization of these animal viruses. Ideally, we should develop an effective universal strategy to treat and prevent human infections caused by animal coronaviruses. The phylogenetic relationships of coronaviruses (Fig. 1) suggest that there have been a number of introductions of animal coronaviruses (e.g., SARS-CoV and 229E) into humans in the past. The great diversity of coronavirus in bats will surely increase the odds of yet another zoonotic event occurring in the future.","As the major vaccine target, the S protein has been evaluated in different types of vaccines against infection by CoVs [29] . Apart from the inactive whole virus particle [30] , live attenuated virus with gene deletion [31] , four more vaccines which mainly contain S protein were studied. These include a virus-like particle which incorporated S protein into hepatitis virus or influenza virus protein [32, 33] ; virus vectors, such as modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) or Adenovirus carrying S protein [34, 35] ; S protein subunit vaccine, like RBD-based protein [29, 36] ; and DNA vaccine which encodes the full length or part of the S protein gene [37, 38] . Most of them have been tested in mouse models and showed the ability to elicit neutralizing antibodies. The first SARS-CoV DNA vaccine was tested in humans only 19 months after the virus sequence was published [38] , while the DNA vaccine GLS-5300, the first MERS-CoV vaccine, went to clinical trials in 2016 [39] . In addition to these conventional vaccines, Liu et al. analyzed the T cell epitopes of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, revealed the potential cross-reactivity of the coronaviruses, and assessed the possibility of developing universal vaccines against coronavirus infections [40] .","As we have shown in this paper, a peptide targeted by EBOV controllers could form the basis of a preventative vaccine for EBOV. ELISPOT analysis of PBMCs taken from the peripheral blood of COVID-19 controllers and progres-285 sors to assess the presence of a differential response to the 53 peptides could lead to a broadly applicable protective CTL vaccine against COVID-19 by incorporating peptides into the vaccine that are more commonly targeted for CD8+ attack by the controllers versus the progressors. The extent of the COVID-19 outbreak should allow many more controllers to be identified then the 30 indi-290 viduals studied by Sakabe. Furthermore, Sakebe did not report progressor data perhaps because of the difficulty in obtaining blood samples from those patients.","For constructing a multi-epitope vaccine construct, the selected best HTL, CTL and B-cell epitopes were joined by using GPGPG, AAG and KK linkers respectively. For the better immunogenic response, four adjuvants namely, \u03b2-defensin, universal memory T cell helper peptide (TpD), PADRE sequence and a M cell ligand were added by using EAAAK linker into the vaccine construct.","systems and their clinicians adopt a universal consolidated framework to recognize the staged progression of COVID-19 illness in order to deploy and investigate targeted therapy likely to save lives. The largest report of COVID-19 from the Chinese Centers for Disease Control and Prevention summarized findings from 72, 314 cases and noted that while 81% were of a mild nature with an overall case fatality rate of 2.3%, a small subgroup of 5% presented with respiratory failure, septic shock and multi-organ dysfunction resulting in fatality in half of such cases, a finding that suggests that it is within this group that the opportunity for life saving measures may be most pertinent. 1 Once the disease is manifest, supportive measures are initiated with quarantines; however a systematic disease modifying therapeutic approach remains empirical.","The possibility of developing a universal CoV vaccine was assessed based on the similarity in T-cell epitopes of SARS- and MERS-CoV that confirmed the potential for cross-reactivity among CoVs.25 SARS-CoV-2 shares high genetic similarity with the SARS-CoV26 such that vaccines developed for SARS-CoV may exhibit cross-reactivity to SARS-CoV-2. The comparative evaluation performed on full-length S protein sequences of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV identified that the most variable residues were located in the S1 subunit of S protein, the critical CoV vaccine target.27 These findings suggest that the specific neutralizing antibodies that are effective against the SARS-CoV might not be effective against the SARS-CoV-2. Even though the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 has key mutations compared to the SARS-CoV, they will still act as a viable target for vaccine development.28 Likewise, the close similarity of SARS-CoV-2 to the SARS-CoV suggests that the receptor of SARS-CoV-2 might be the same as that of SARS-CoV receptor (ACE2).29","Precautions are necessary for invasive procedures involving the insertion of catheters or in-jection of material into spinal or epidural spaces via lumbar puncture (eg, myelogram, spinal or epidural anesthesia). 1 Although most elements of standard precautions evolved from universal precautions that were developed for protection of health care personnel, these new elements of standard precautions focus on protection of patients. Staff members now are advised to wear masks during these invasive procedures. 10, 11 [12] [13] [14] The strategy to contain respiratory infectious diseases has been termed respiratory hygiene/cough etiquette 15 and should be incorporated into infection control practices as a new component of standard precautions. The strategy is targeted at patients and accompanying family members and friends with undiagnosed transmissible respiratory infections and applies to any person who enters a health care facility with signs of illness, including cough, congestion, rhinorrhea, or increased production of respiratory secretions. 16 ","There are now three commercially available respiratory virus panels that rely on targeted multiplex PCR (ResPlex II v2.0 [Qiagen], MultiCode\u00ae-PLx [EraGen Biosciences] and xTAG\u00ae [Luminex]). Balada Llasat et al. very recently evaluated these three systems [58]. The respiratory panel developed by Mahony et al. detects 20 human respiratory viruses or virus subtypes and is now commercially available as the Luminex xTAG system [59]. It relies on multiplex PCR using 14 virus-specific primers, followed by capture of the oligonucleotide \u2018tagged\u2019 PCR products onto universal oligonucleotoide tags on the microspheres, followed by target-specific primer extension, during which a phycoerythrin label is incorporated into the extension product. The microspheres pass through a flow cell and the signals are detected by a red laser to identify the microspheres and a green laser to measure the phycoerythrin localized to the microsphere. The list of detected viruses includes influenza A (subtypes H1, H3 and H5), influenza B, respiratory syncytial virus A and B, metapneumovirus, rhinovirus, parainfluenza 1\u20134, severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus, and four other coronaviruses and adenoviruses of unspecified type. Nolte and colleagues contemporaneously developed a very similar system, utilizing modified nucleotides to label the microsphere-captured primer extension products [60]. The latter system, now commercially available as the MultiCode-PLx is designed to detect 17 respiratory viruses. All three of the commercially available multiplex PCR panels exhibited superior sensitivity compared with virus culture methods [58]. Although all of these systems cast a relatively broad net, they are target-focused, use target-specific primers and are therefore susceptible to drop out, or failure to detect variant viruses.","Several attempts have been made to develop vaccines against human coronavirus infection in the past decades. But the degree of cross-protection provided by such vaccines is greatly limited due to the extensive diversity in antigenic variants even within the strains of a phylogenetic sub-cluster (Graham et al. 2013). As for MERS and SARS coronaviruses, there is no licensed specific antiviral treatment or vaccine available till now. However, few of the advances made in developing vaccines and therapeutics for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV could be exploited for the countering 2019-nCoV. But since the efforts to design and develop any vaccine or antiviral agent to tackle the presently emerging coronavirus pathogen would take some time, therefore till then we need to rely extensively on enforcing highly effective prevention and control measures to minimize the risk of 2019-nCoV transmission and spread to the best feasible extent (Cheng et al. 2020). Majority of the vaccines that are being developed for coronaviruses targets the Spike glycoprotein or S protein (Graham et al. 2013). This is mainly because of the fact that S protein is the major inducer of neutralizing antibodies (Jiang et al. 2005). Several kinds of vaccines and antiviral drugs that are based on S protein have been previously evaluated. Among them, the S protein-based vaccines include full-length S protein vaccines, viral vector-based vaccine, DNA-based vaccine, recombinant S protein-based and recombinant RBD protein-based vaccines. Whereas S protein based antiviral therapies include RBD\u2013ACE2 blockers, S cleavage inhibitors, fusion core blockers, neutralizing antibodies, protease inhibitors, S protein inhibitors, and small interfering RNAs (Du et al. 2009). Even though such therapeutic options have proven efficacy in the in vitro studies, however most of these haven\u2019t undergone randomized animal or human trials and hence are of limited use in our present 2019-nCoV scenario. Remdesivir is a novel nucleotide analog prodrug that was intended to be used for the treatment of Ebola virus disease. It also has anti-coronavirus activity due to its inhibitory action on the SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV replication (Sheahan et al. 2017). At present, efforts are being made to identify and develop monoclonal antibodies that are specific and effective against 2019-nCoV. Combination therapy with 2019-nCoV specific monoclonal antibodies and remdesivir can be considered as the ideal therapeutic option for 2019-nCoV (Cohen 2020). Further evaluation is required before confirming the efficacy of such combination therapy. A variety of different therapeutic and vaccine designing approaches against coronaviruses are being explored and yet to be evaluated in terms of their potency, efficacy and safety, but hopefully the process of evaluation will be accelerated in the coming days (Cyranoski 2020; Lu 2020; Pillaiyar et al. 2020; Zaher et al. 2020).","The first quarter of 2015 was targeted for phase I clinical evaluation of cAd3-EBO at the NIH Clinical Center and a Pre-Investigational New Drug (IND) application was submitted to that end in Aug. of 2013. However, in response to the epidemic, the NIH, FDA, IRBs, and others coordinated efforts to consolidate timelines. An IND application was submitted to the FDA on Aug. 15, 2014 and a phase I trial began 18 days later. The cAd3-EBO vaccine was found to be safe and immunogenic in early phase 1 testing of two doses, 2 \u00d7 10 10 and 2 \u00d7 10 11 particle units (PU), and the day 28 postvaccination results were published 3 months later. 20 All vaccine recipients developed glycoprotein (GP)-specific antibodies; however, GP-specific antibody responses as well as GP-specific T cell responses were greater with the 2 \u00d7 10 11 PU dosing. Antibody titers with the higher dose were in the range associated with protective immunity in the NHP challenge model.","GA\u2019s universal inhibition of viral protein-mediated cell-cell fusion indicates that its inhibitory effect is by a common fusion mechanism. LPC also universally blocks membrane fusion; it does so by conferring spontaneous positive curvature, which prevents hemifusion. This block can be relieved, regardless of fusion protein, by the addition of the negative spontaneous curvature agent OA25,26. The finding that OA relieves the GA-induced inhibition of EBOV GP-mediated fusion implies that, similar to LPC, GA acts by producing positive spontaneous curvature and this prevents hemifusion. A number of rigid amphipathic fusion inhibitors (RAFI) with positive spontaneous curvature have been shown to inhibit fusion induced by unrelated viral fusion proteins27. In the future, it would be interesting to measure the values of the spontaneous curvatures of GA and RAFI and to relate them to the concentration of OA necessary to relieve fusion inhibition. For the inhibition of non-enveloped adenovirus, we suggest that since GA affects lipid bilayer curvature, it would be predicted to affect the endocytic entry of a non-enveloped virus such as adenovirus. In addition, as we report here, GA appears to have potential secondary mechanisms of viral DNA and protein synthesis inhibition, and these would be predicted to be targeted in both enveloped and non-enveloped viruses.","As the numbers of tuberculosis cases dropped in the late 20 th century, several middle high and high-income countries in Europe dropped the universal BCG policy between years 1963 and 2010. We hypothesized that although these countries do not have a universal current vaccination policy, they would also show a trend where the earlier they started their universal policy, the larger fraction of the elderly population would be covered, and the lower the death rate per million people. We analyzed 17 countries that dropped their universal BCG policy. There was also a positive significant correlation (\u03c1=0.54, p=0.02, linear correlation) between the year of the establishment of universal BCG vaccination and the mortality rate (see Figure 2 , right panel). For instance, Spain started their universal policy in 1965 and lasted until 1981 (16 years) and has a high mortality rate (29.5 deaths per million inhabitants). In contrast, Denmark started their policy in 1946 and ended in 1986 (40 years) and has almost 10 times less deaths per million inhabitants with 2.3 deaths.","Efforts to reduce antimicrobial resistance have largely focused on surveillance and infection control in health care settings, along with educational campaigns targeted to health care providers and consumers on judicious antimicrobial use, such as the CDC's \"Get Smart: Know When Antibiotics Work\" campaign. 483 In recent years, impressive gains have been made by U.S. health care settings in reducing several types of HAIs, many of which are drug resistant. 484 As an example, invasive hospital-acquired MRSA infections declined 28% from 2005 through 2008 485 and MRSA bloodstream infections in hospitals decreased nearly 50% between 1997 and 2007. 486 These and other declines in hospital-acquired infections followed targeted, multifaceted efforts undertaken to increase adherence to recommended infection control practices, educate patients and providers, issue facility-specific guidelines for prescription and use of antimicrobial agents, and implement appropriate isolation and cohorting of patients infected or colonized with drug-resistant organisms. In addition, hospital-acquired infections are reported and tracked by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) and through reporting mandates in many states using the CDC's National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN). This secure, Internet-based surveillance system collects data from more than 12,000 facilities in all 50 states on hospital-acquired infections and related issues, including the incidence or prevalence of multidrug-resistant organisms, health care personnel safety and vaccination, and the occurrence of transfusion-related adverse events. Reviews of antibiotic stewardship programs in both large and small hospitals have documented their effectiveness, with facility-specific reductions in antibiotic use of 22% to 36% and related annual cost savings of $200,000 to $900,000. 487, 488 With 50% of antibiotic prescriptions estimated to be unnecessary, 489 education of patients and providers on the importance of and health benefits from responsible use of antibiotics remains paramount.","Detecting carriers of the virus is fundamental to response efforts. It ensures the quarantine of COVID-19 patients to prevent local spread [1] , and more broadly informs national response measures [4] . Nevertheless, as monitoring capacity is limited, testing in most countries is generally focused on acutely ill patients, while potentially infectious carriers at the community remain undiagnosed. As many countries are already experiencing shortages of diagnosis kits and factories struggling to keep with the demand [5] [6] [7] , it has become important to come up with new ways to conserve the reagents used for diagnostic tests. At the same time, as the disease is novel, it is of value to validate any modifications to the testing process before universal adoption [8, 9] .","Pharmacotherapy targeted against the virus holds the greatest promise when applied early in the course of the illness, but its usefulness in advanced stages may be doubtful. 2, 3 Similarly, use of anti-inflammatory therapy applied too early may not be necessary and could even provoke viral replication such as in the case of corticosteroids. 4 It appears that there are two distinct but overlapping pathological subsets, the first triggered by the virus itself and the second, the host response. Whether in native state, immunoquiescent state as in the elderly, or immunosuppressed state as in heart transplantation, the disease tends to present and follow these two phases, albeit in different levels of severity. The early reports in heart transplantation suggest that symptom expression during the phase of establishment of infection are similar to non-immunosuppressed individuals; however, in limited series the second wave determined by the host-inflammatory response appears to be milder, possibly due to the concomitant use of immuno-modulatory drugs. 5, 6 Similarly, an epidemiological study from Wuhan in a cohort of 87 patients suggests that precautionary measures of social distancing, sanitization and general hygiene allow heart transplant recipients to experience a low rate of COVID-19 illness. 7 We do not of course, know if they are asymptomatic carriers, since in this survey-based study universal testing during the early 3 months was not employed. One interesting fact in this study was that many heart transplant recipients have hematological changes of lymphopenia due to the effects of immunosuppressive therapy which may obfuscate the laboratory interpretation of infection in such patients should they get infected.","As obligate parasites, many viruses exploit host-cell machinery to glycosylate their own proteins. Numerous viral envelope proteins, including HIV-1 envelope (Env), influenza hemagglutinin (HA) and Lassa virus glycoprotein complex (GPC), possess genetically encoded N-linked glycan sequons (N-X-S/T motifs, where X is any amino acid except proline). Viral glycosylation has wide-ranging roles in viral pathobiology, including mediating protein folding and stability, and shaping viral tropism. The genetically encoded sequons can be under significant selective pressure as a mechanism for immune evasion by shielding specific epitopes from antibody neutralization. However, we note the currently reported low mutation rate of SARS-CoV-2, and as yet that there have been no observed mutations to N-linked glycosylation sites 4 . Surfaces with an unusually high density of glycans can also enable immune recognition [5] [6] [7] . The role of glycosylation in immune evasion by camouflaging immunogenic protein epitopes has been well studied for other coronaviruses 4,8,9 . As the principal antigen presented on the surface of SARS-CoV-2 virions, the S protein is a key target in vaccine design efforts. It is apparent that the viral spike will be targeted by the full assortment of vaccine strategies from nucleic-acid based approaches 10 , whereby the viral protein is expressed in vivo, to recombinant strategies whereby viral glycoproteins are delivered with appropriate adjuvants. Such strategies aim to elicit neutralizing adaptive immunity with an emphasis on achieving an antibody response at the sites of viral entry.","Wet markets are not the only risk for re-emergence of SARS. At the time of writing this review there have been two re-emergent cases of SARS, both from laboratory infections. One case in Singapore 22 and the other in Taiwan. 23 WHO must continue its efforts to promote scientific responsibility for both SARS and influenza viruses. Laboratory regulations globally are inconsistent. We now live in a global village, so universal guidelines need to be adopted. The situation with H2N2 influenza is a case in point. Although H2N2 influenza has not circulated in human beings since 1968 and everyone under the age of 36 years is susceptible, the H2N2 virus is widely distributed in laboratories and is still used in some laboratories. The re-emergence of H1N1 influenza, in 1977, that continues to circulate in human beings is another unresolved case. This H1N1 virus remained genetically conserved for 27 years. 24 The most likely explanation is that the virus came from a frozen source","Briefly stated, we need to make concerted efforts to be aware of and remain interested in the afflictions of individuals in remote villages. Global surveillance coupled with a sense of community are the starting points. These concepts need to be embraced and continually articulated by leaders of the Public Health System. These should be supplemented by federal research support for serious illnesses even if the illnesses are thought to belong to \"other\" people. The fact is that the boundaries between foreign or exotic and what is traditionally referred to as domestic or local have blurred. We in the developed world cannot afford to be disengaged or appear to show indifference to the health challenge of less fortunate populations living in remote sectors of the world. The noted ethicist Peter Singer argues that given the advances in transportation and communication, coupled with the emergence of transnational companies and universal problems, we must transcend national boundaries to embrace a new ethic of one world (16) . Our ability to care and reach out defines our humanity and importantly may impact the health of our own communities.","is the (which was not peer-reviewed) The copyright holder for this preprint . establishment of universal BCG vaccination and the mortality rate, consistent with the idea that the earlier that a policy was established, the larger fraction of the elderly population would be protected (see Figure 2 , left panel). For instance, Iran has a current universal BCG vaccination policy but it just started in 1984, and has an elevated mortality with 19.7 deaths per million inhabitants. In contrast, Japan started its universal BCG policy in 1947 and has around 100 times less deaths per million people, with 0.28 deaths. Brazil started universal vaccination in 1920 and also has an even lower mortality rate of 0.0573 deaths per million inhabitants.","Today, much uncertainty remains around the ongoing epidemic and how it will unfold in the EU/EEA. Public health bodies and research institutions should continue to work together to continuously evaluate the situation, to address knowledge gaps and to assess the effectiveness of targeted interventions with new tests, treatments and vaccines as they are developed. Nevertheless, given the current knowledge and understanding, it is clear that action should be taken immediately to prepare for potential mitigation phases and coordinate efforts to protect the health of EU/EEA citizens in compliance with Decision 1082/2013/EU on serious cross-border threats to health [5]. As the number of cases in the EU/EEA is rapidly increasing, countries should reinforce their risk communication efforts and review their pandemic preparedness plans to ensure they are ready to avert or respond to more widespread circulation of the virus in the EU/EEA.","To further our understanding of the spread of the virus and to determine how the virus mutates as it spreads, we sequenced the virus from 357 individuals who had tested positive before March 19. The haplotype composition of the viruses from individuals identified through the population screening was different from those tested in the early targeted testing; more had the A1a haplotype and fewer had the A2a haplotypes. Hence, it looks like the haplotypes of the virus that are propagating in the general population come from a different source, perhaps brought in by people coming from countries that had not yet been designated high-risk areas. Furthermore, the sequence diversity in the virus from the population screening is greater than in the original targeted screening that was focused on people coming home from skiing in the Alps. Hence, it is likely that the virus has been carried into Iceland from many countries. The 0.9% frequency of the infection in the population screening indicates that the virus is spreading to the extent that unless we increase the screening effort we are likely to fail in our efforts to contain it.","Given these hurdles, achieving a truly universal vaccine that protects against all types or subtypes of influenza will probably proceed in a stepwise manner, with the first step being a vaccine that is more broadly cross-protective than currently licensed vaccines.","The company Novavax has produced an experimental recombinant nanoparticle vaccine candidate based on the MERS-CoV S protein and it has generated important anti-MERS-CoV antibodies in a mouse model (Coleman et al., 2014a) . Monoclonal antibodies (e.g. MERS-4, MERS-27 and 3B11) directed towards the S protein are capable of neutralising infection by the MERS-CoV and hold future promise for use as a therapeutic and prophylactic Tang et al., 2014) . A replication-competent, propagation-deficient E gene-deleted mutant of MERS-CoV variant EMC/2012 (rMERS-CoV-E) may also prove to be a useful vaccine candidate while a truncated RBD of MERS-CoV has been shown to elicit antibodies in mice (Almaz\u00e1n et al., 2013; Du et al., 2013a) . A conserved peptide in the RdRp of all HCoVs was also identified, and that may provide the basis for an epitope-directed universal vaccine (Sharmin and Islam, 2014) .","Neuraminidases NanA, NanB and NanC based vaccine to prevent pneumococcal infection Rajendra-Prasad Janapatla 1 , Mei-Hua Hsu 1 , Cheng-Hsun Chiu 1,2 *. Background: Routine immunization with the pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCV7/PCV10/PCV13) increased the incidence of non-vaccine serotypes in community and clincal isoaltes, this increased the need for developing pneumococcal protein vaccines that have broader serotype coverage. Since neuraminidases are major virulence proteins they are potential targets for both vaccines and small molecule inhibitors. In this study, we explored the possibility of combining the three neuraminidases together as vaccine antigens to devise a universal protein vaccine to prevent systemic pneumococcal infection. Methods: To evaluate the degree of protection of NanA, NanB and NanC protein antigens against S. pneumoniae intravenous challenge, individual or combination of neuraminidases NanA, NanB and NanC (10 \u03bcg each) were injected subcutaneously. To confirm the presence of anti-neuraminidase antibodies in the antisera, we performed enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). S. pneumoniae cell suspension was used to infect immunized ice by tail vein injection. The antisera against individual neuraminidase (NanA, NanB or NanC) were also tested for their inhibitory effect on the activity of neuraminidases. If a specific antineuraminidase serum neutralizes neuraminidase activity, the exposure of Thomsen-Friedenrich antigen (TA) antigen on RBC cells, and the value of fluorescence intensity will be reduced. Results: We observed high (4-6 logarithm fold) IgG class antibody titres against NanA, NanB, and NanC; this indicates that all the three neuraminidases are immunogenic and ideal as antigens for immunization. We found that the antisera against only full length NanA and NanA-Lectin efficiently inhibited (&gt;90%) neuraminidase activity. However, antisera against lectin domains of NanB and NanC were sufficient to neutralize their enzyme activity. Immunization with combination of NanA, NanB and NanC caused significant increase in survival rates relative to PPV23 vaccine group and negative control, in serotype 3, 6B, 14, 15B, 19A and 23F survival was 60%, 60%, 20%, 60%, 40% and 40%, respectively. Conclusion: In future formulations of pneumococcal virulence proteins and adjuvants will be needed to develop serotype independent protection against pneumococcal infections. We recommend the inclusion of three pneumococcal neuraminidases in future protein vaccine formulations to prevent IPD.","Pertussis is a human respiratory disease due to a bacterium, Bordetella pertussis. Since the generalised use, for newborns and children only, of the first pertussis vaccines, called Pertussis whole-cell (Pw) vaccines, because composed of inactivated bacterial suspensions, Pertussis is still endemic. Why? The use of Pw vaccines led to a dramatic decrease in the incidence of the disease in children but conducted to demonstrate and confirm that Pertussis is not a paediatric disease. Pertussis can infect children, as well as adolescents or adults. The disease is dramatic for newborns but also for persons at risk such as elderly and pregnant women. One of the characteristics of Pertussis is to induce a short immunity, as well as Pw vaccines. A human can be infected two or three times during its life. Twenty years after the introduction of Pw vaccines for children, adults are no more immune and can contaminate newborns too young to be vaccinated. For this reason, the introduction of vaccine boosters was needed. This was possible after the development of Pertussis acellular (Pa) vaccines, composed of purified inactivated bacterial proteins. Since 1995, these vaccines are used for newborns and children but also for adolescents and adults in many developed countries in Australia, North America and Europe. However, vaccine coverage of adolescents and adults is still low and mortality of newborns less than 2 months of age is now again observed in developed countries. Adequate pertussis surveillance and reporting system are important to implement vaccine strategy. They must be reinforced to evaluate the consequences of the changes of (i) pertussis vaccine used (Pa instead of Pw), (ii) vaccine strategy (addition of adolescents and adults boosters), (iii) characteristics of the disease necessitating the development of new specific, sensitive and standardised biological diagnoses, (iv) bacteria circulating since herd immunity will be modified by universal immunisation and might have an impact on the properties of the agent of the disease.","Initially, we compared countries that never had in place a universal BCG vaccination policy (Italy, USA, Lebanon, Nederland, and Belgium), with countries that have a current universal BCG vaccination policy. We included only countries with more than 1 million inhabitants. The mortality rate might be influenced by multiple factors including a country's standard of medical care. In order to account for that, we classified countries according to their GNI per capita in 2018 using the World Bank data (https://datahelpdesk.worldbank.org/knowledgebase/articles/906519-worldbank-country-and-lending-groups). Countries were divided in three categories: low income (L) with an annual income of 1,025 dollars or less, lower middle income with an income between 1,026 and 3,995 dollars, and middle high and high income countries, which included countries with annual incomes over 3,996 dollars. In order to determine if BCG vaccination was protective for COVID-19 infections, we used the number of deaths per million inhabitants per country attributed to COVID-19 (see attached table) . Most of the countries with low-income levels (17/18) reported zero deaths attributed to COVID-19 and have universal BCG policies in place consistent with a protective role of BCG vaccination. However, this might be because of underreporting and we have excluded them from the analysis. Middle high and high-income countries that have a current universal BCG policy (55 countries) had 0.78\u00b1 0.40 (mean\u00b1s.e.m) deaths per million people (see Figure 1 ). In contrast, middle high and high income countries that never had a universal BCG policy (5 countries) had a larger mortality rate, with 16.39 \u00b1 7.33 deaths per million people. This difference between countries was highly significant (p=8.64e-04, Wilcoxon rank sum test).","Two events in 1976, the agency's 30th year, however, might have had the most enduring impact. In spring 1976, an outbreak of influenza at a military base in New Jersey was identified as being caused by a new strain of influenza A, a strain that was quite different than the strain (A/Hong Kong/H3N2) circulating since 1968. The new strain (H sw 1N1) had demonstrated pathogenicity among humans and its ability to be transmitted person to person, circumstances that were believed to always lead to pandemics. As important, this strain was believed to be closely related to the influenza virus that had led to a pandemic in 1918-19, which had killed 500 000 U.S. residents and an estimated 25 million persons globally, affecting particularly young adults. With the CDC in the lead, scientific experts were engaged during the following months to study the problem. They ultimately recommended the policy that led to the National Influenza Immunization Program, which targeted the entire U.S. population. Vigorous efforts by the president, Congress, the vaccine manufacturers, and the public health system enabled the program to begin in October 1976. Within weeks, the CDC's national surveillance program, in collaboration with the states, uncovered an increased reporting of Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome among persons who had been vaccinated during the program. Subsequently, the program was suspended and no epidemic occurred. An association was confirmed in a national case-control study conducted by the agency; the agency was criticized harshly, and other vaccination programs were called into question.","[The] FDA will undertake a new initiative designed to focus on augmenting the tools used to assess the safety, efficacy, and quality of medical products, with a particular focus on MCMs, and to get them from concept through the approval process efficiently.\" An example of how the FDA's regulatory science efforts have assisted the agency in facilitating the licensure of vaccines against emerging diseases and biothreats is the successful public-private partnership during the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic, which resulted in the development and approval of safe and effective vaccines against the pandemic in record time. This included creating vaccine strains needed for vaccine manufacturing within weeks of the very first 2009 pandemic H1N1 influenza cases appearing, developing reagents and tests through international collaborations to measure the vaccine's potency, consulting the FDA's expert vaccine advisory committee to review the Agency's approach to approval of the 2009 H1N1 vaccine s as well as extensive in process quality control and product testing. Licensure of vaccines against the 2009 H1N1 influenza virus occurred in September 2009 based on the FDA's determination that standards to ensure the safety and potency of these vaccines had been met. In parallel to these efforts, NIH and vaccine manufacturers initiated clinical trials to determine the optimal vaccine dosage and number of doses needed to induce a protective immune response against pandemic 2009 H1N1 virus.","Middle high and high-income countries that have a universal BCG policy have some variability in the mortality rate. COVID-19 has increased lethality with age 7 . We wondered if countries that established a universal BCG policy earlier would have a reduced mortality rate, as older people that are more severely affected by COVID-19 would be protected. We analyzed the data from 28 countries where we had access to the start of the universal BCG vaccination policy. There was a positive significant correlation (\u03c1=0.44, p=0.02, linear correlation) between the year of the .

The (M2)-HBc fusion protein spontaneously assem-bled into virus-like particles (VLP) that provided complete protection against a potentially lethal influenza virus A challenge in mice [63, 64] . Similarly, a M2 peptide was conjugated with Neisseria meningitidis outer membrane protein complex (OMPC) and recently evaluated in animal models including monkeys [65] . M2 is a highly conserved transmembrane protein in the virion. These approaches might thus serve as a basis for an universal influenza vaccine with broad spectrum of protective activity [66] .","The Coronavirus family received global attention in November 2002 when the first case of SARS-CoV infection was reported in Guangdong Province, China. Within 3 months, 305 cases with five deaths from respiratory failure had been recorded. This subsequently led to the notification of the World Health Organization (WHO) and the issuance of a global health alert as well as travel advisory. In retrospect, there probably was an initial delay in the identification of this etiological agent of unknown origin which consequently allowed the worldwide spread of the disease [3]. The scientific community though was subsequently quick to respond and begin the race towards vaccine development [4]. The full characterization and genome sequencing of SARS-CoV was published within only 2 months after the WHO had started to coordinate the efforts to determine the epidemiology, pathogenesis, and transmission of the disease. Vaccine studies quickly identified the virus\u2019 spike (S) protein as a possible recombinant antigen component of a future vaccine, and the C-terminal portion of the SARS-CoV nucleocapsid protein was identified as a likely candidate for improved diagnostics tools. A candidate DNA vaccine showing efficacy in neutralization and protective immunity in mice had been identified within 1 year of the outbreak [5]. Vaccine development was fueled by the daunting possibility of a re-emergence of the disease when additional isolated cases of a suspected SARS infection scare were reported in China in 2004 [6]. At that point, there were ten human vaccine trials planned, using inactivated virus, recombinant proteins, adenovirus platforms, or plasmid DNA. The trials were planned to take place in various countries, including China, Canada, France, Austria, the USA, and Italy [7]. The major hurdle, however, was the lack of an appropriate animal challenge model that could reproduce an infection similar to what was observed in humans. Then, with the identification of virus reservoirs and mechanisms of transmission, the SARS outbreaks ended in July 2003, only 4 months after the issuance of the global alert. The outcomes of this vaccine development race were summarized in a phase I clinical trial report published several years later. Two vaccine candidates were developed and analyzed by Sinovac and the NIH/NIAID, respectively. The earliest live-attenuated vaccine clinical trial that took place under a fast track designation approval from regulatory authorities in China was conducted in 2004 [8, 9]. Results indicated that serum conversion was observed in 100 % of the volunteers who received a low dosage vaccine. In the other study, a plasmid DNA vaccine candidate developed by the NIAID\u2019s Vaccine Research Centre was well tolerated and produced the desired immune responses, including neutralizing antibodies [10]. None of the candidates though proceeded into phase II. More recently, a recombinant subunit-based SARS-CoV vaccine was produced by the Sabin Vaccine Institute Product Development Partnership, based on the virus receptor-binding domain [11]. The goal here was to improve safety of the vaccine and cost efficiency of the vaccine development process [12]. The vaccine is being produced under cGMP conditions, but no clinical trials are immediately scheduled."],"title":["Patterns of influenza B circulation in Brazil and its relevance to seasonal vaccine composition","What's trending in the infection prevention and control literature?

Puzzlingly, the impact of the disease is different in different countries. These differences are attributed to differences in cultural norms, mitigation efforts, and health infrastructure. Here we propose that national differences in COVID-19 impact could be partially explained by the different national policies respect to Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) childhood vaccination. BCG vaccination has been reported to offer broad protection to respiratory infections. We compared large number of countries BCG vaccination policies with the morbidity and mortality for COVID-19. We found that countries without universal policies of BCG vaccination (Italy, Nederland, USA) have been more severely affected compared to countries with universal and long-standing BCG policies. Countries that have a late start of universal BCG policy (Iran, 1984) had high mortality, consistent with the idea that BCG protects the vaccinated elderly population. We also ...","ABSTRACTNovel Coronavirus (nCoV) outbreak in the city of Wuhan, China during December 2019, has now spread to various countries across the globe triggering a heightened containment effort. This human pathogen is a member of betacoronavirus genus carrying 30 kilobase of single positive-sense RNA genome. Understanding the evolution, zoonotic transmission, and source of this novel virus would help accelerating containment and prevention efforts. The present study reported detailed analysis of 2019-nCoV genome evolution and potential candidate peptides for vaccine development. This nCoV genotype might have been evolved from a bat-CoV by accumulating non-synonymous mutations, indels, and recombination events. Structural proteins Spike (S), and Membrane (M) had extensive mutational changes, whereas Envelope (E) and Nucleocapsid (N) proteins were very conserved suggesting differential selection pressures exerted on 2019-nCoV during evolution. Interestingly, 2019-nCoV Spike protein contains a ...","Summary This is an informal review of some of the trends in the infection prevention and control literature since the last Healthcare Infection Society (HIS) conference in late 2012. Google Trends was used to investigate how the volume of interest in various infection control topics had changed over time. Ebola trumped all the others in Google searches, reflecting a surge of publications in the literature. Aside from Ebola, other trends in the infection prevention and control literature covered in this article include Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) coronavirus, universal versus targeted interventions, faecal microbiota transplantation, whole genome sequencing, carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae, and some aspects of environmental science. The review ends with an attempt to predict some of the trends in the infection prevention and control literature between now and the next HIS conference in 2016.","This work investigates the formulation and in vivo efficacy of dendritic cell (DC) targeted plasmid DNA loaded biotinylated chitosan nanoparticles for nasal immunization against nucleocapsid (N) protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) as antigen. The induction of antigen-specific mucosal and systemic immune response at the site of virus entry is a major challenge for vaccine design. Here, we designed a strategy for non-invasive receptor mediated gene delivery to nasal resident DCs. The pDNA loaded biotinylated chitosan nanoparticles were prepared using a complex coacervation process and characterized for size, shape, surface charge, plasmid loading and protection against nuclease digestion. The pDNA loaded biotinylated chitosan nanoparticles were targeted with bifunctional fusion protein (bfFp) vector for achieving DC selective targeting. The bfFp is a recombinant fusion protein consisting of truncated core-streptavidin fused with anti-DEC-205 single chain a...","Efficient vaccination against infectious agents and tumors depends on specific antigen targeting to dendritic cells (DCs). We report here that biosafe coronavirus-based vaccine vectors facilitate delivery of multiple antigens and immunostimulatory cytokines to professional antigen-presenting cells in vitro and in vivo. Vaccine vectors based on heavily attenuated murine coronavirus genomes were generated to express epitopes from the lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus glycoprotein, or human Melan-A, in combination with the immunostimulatory cytokine granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF). These vectors selectively targeted DCs in vitro and in vivo resulting in vector-mediated antigen expression and efficient maturation of DCs. Single application of only low vector doses elicited strong and long-lasting cytotoxic T-cell responses, providing protective antiviral and antitumor immunity. Furthermore, human DCs transduced with Melan-A-recombinant human coronavirus 229E effi...","Widespread, non-stop, and often sensational coverage of the coronavirus (COVID-19) has caught many governments flat-footed in efforts to protect the health and safety of their citizens. In response to the current global health event, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic. Mass gatherings present a historic challenge in protecting the health and safety of attendees. The majority of the prominent mass gatherings are religious in nature. Global sporting events, such as the Olympics and the World Cup, pose unique health risks to attendees and host nations. Deferment or cancellation of such mass gatherings may exert an extraordinary economic loss to the host nation. Universal adoption of best practices for infection control is the surest way for governments to prepare for mass gatherings. In these uncertain times, it is up to intergovernmental organizations to be the voice of reason.","The novel coronavirus infection (COVID-19 or Coronavirus disease 2019) that emerged from Wuhan, Hubei province of China has spread to many countries worldwide. Efforts have been made to develop vaccines against human coronavirus (CoV) infections such as MERS and SARS in the past decades. However, to date, no licensed antiviral treatment or vaccine exists for MERS and SARS. Most of the efforts for developing CoV vaccines and drugs target the spike glycoprotein or S protein, the major inducer of neutralizing antibodies. Although a few candidates have shown efficacy in in vitro studies, not many have progressed to randomized animal or human trials, hence may have limited use to counter COVID-19 infection. This article highlights ongoing advances in designing vaccines and therapeutics to counter COVID-19 while also focusing on such experiences and advances as made with earlier SARS- and MERS-CoVs, which together could enable efforts to halt this emerging virus infection.","Human coronaviruses (HCoVs) are large RNA viruses that infect the human respiratory tract. The emergence of both Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome and Middle East Respiratory syndrome CoVs as well as the yearly circulation of four common CoVs highlights the importance of elucidating the different mechanisms employed by these viruses to evade the host immune response, determine their tropism and identify antiviral compounds. Various animal models have been established to investigate HCoV infection, including mice and non-human primates. To establish a link between the research conducted in animal models and humans, an organotypic human airway culture system, that recapitulates the human airway epithelium, has been developed. Currently, different cell culture systems are available to recapitulate the human airways, including the Air-Liquid Interface (ALI) human airway epithelium (HAE) model. Tracheobronchial HAE cultures recapitulate the primary entry point of human respiratory viruses w...","Viruses are evolving at an alarming rate, spreading and inconspicuously adapting to cutting-edge therapies. Therefore, the search for rapid, informative and reliable diagnostic methods is becoming urgent as ever. Conventional clinical tests (PCR, serology, etc.) are being continually optimized, yet provide very limited data. Could high throughput sequencing (HTS) become the future gold standard in molecular diagnostics of viral infections? Compared to conventional clinical tests, HTS is universal and more precise at profiling pathogens. Nevertheless, it has not yet been widely accepted as a diagnostic tool, owing primarily to its high cost and the complexity of sample preparation and data analysis. Those obstacles must be tackled to integrate HTS into daily clinical practice. For this, three objectives are to be achieved: (1) designing and assessing universal protocols for library preparation, (2) assembling purpose-specific pipelines, and (3) building computational infrastructure to s...","Ever since the development of the first vaccine more than 200 years ago, vaccinations have greatly decreased the burden of infectious diseases worldwide, famously leading to the eradication of small pox and allowing the restriction of diseases such as polio, tetanus, diphtheria, and measles. A multitude of research efforts focuses on the improvement of established and the discovery of new vaccines such as the HPV (human papilloma virus) vaccine in 2006. However, radical changes in the density, age distribution and traveling habits of the population worldwide as well as the changing climate favor the emergence of old and new pathogens that bear the risk of becoming pandemic threats. In recent years, the rapid spread of severe infections such as HIV, SARS, Ebola, and Zika have highlighted the dire need for global preparedness for pandemics, which necessitates the extremely rapid development and comprehensive distribution of vaccines against potentially previously unknown pathogens. What ...","BACKGROUND Limited data exist on how SARS-CoV-2 enters and spreads in the general population. METHODS We used two strategies for SARS-CoV-2 testing: targeted testing of high-risk individuals (n=4,551) and a population screening (n=5,502). We sequenced SARS-CoV-2 from 340 individuals. RESULTS On March 22 2020, 528 had tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in the targeted testing (11.6%) and 50 in the population screening (0.9%); approximately 0.2% of the Icelandic population. Large fractions of positives had travelled outside Iceland (38.4% and 34.0%). Fewer under 10 years old were positive than those older: 2.8% vs. 12.3% for targeted testing (P=1.6e-9) and 0.0% vs. 1.0% for population screening (P=0.031). Fewer females were positive in the targeted testing than males (9.5% vs. 14.6%, P=6.8e-9). SARS-CoV-2 came from eight clades, seven A clades and one B clade. The clade composition differed between the testing groups and changed with time. In the early targeted testing, 65.0% of clades were ...","Con el crecimiento de los viajes internacionales y la inmigraci\u00f3n, en Espa\u00f1a ha aumentado el n\u00famero de pacientes con enfermedades infecciosas importadas, muchas de ellas desde zonas tropicales o subtropicales.

Their catalytic activity is carried out using a triad of amino acids, a nucleophile, a base, and an acid. For this superfamily of proteases, we propose the existence of a universal 3D structure comprising 11 amino acids near the catalytic nucleophile and base \u2013 Nucleophile-Base Catalytic Zone (NBCZone). The comparison of NBCZones among 169 eukaryotic, prokaryotic, and viral (chymo)trypsin-like proteases suggested the existence of 15 distinct groups determined by the combination of amino acids located at two \u201ckey\u201d structure-functional positions 54T and 55T near the catalytic base His57T. Most eukaryotic and prokaryotic proteases fell into two major groups, [ST]A and TN. Usually, proteases of [ST]A group contain a disulfide bond between cysteines Cys42T and Cys58T of the NBCZone. In contrast, viral proteases were distributed among seven groups, and lac...","As the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is rapidly progressing, the need for the development of an effective vaccine is critical. A promising approach for vaccine development is to generate, through codon pair deoptimization, an attenuated virus. This approach carries the advantage that it only requires limited knowledge specific to the virus in question, other than its genome sequence. Therefore, it is well suited for emerging viruses for which we may not have extensive data. We performed comprehensive in silico analyses of several features of SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequence (e.g., codon usage, codon pair usage, dinucleotide/junction dinucleotide usage, RNA structure around the frameshift region) in comparison with other members of the coronaviridae family of viruses, the overall human genome, and the transcriptome of specific human tissues such as lung, which are primarily targeted by the virus. Our analysis identified the spike (S) and nucleocapsid (N) proteins as promising targets for deoptimizatio...","The Coronavirus disease -19 (COVID19) that started in Wuhan, China in December 2019 has spread worldwide emerging as a global pandemic. The severe respiratory pneumonia caused by the novel SARS-CoV-2 has so far claimed more than 14,500 lives and has impacted human lives worldwide. Development of universal vaccines against the novel SARS-CoV-2 holds utmost urgency to control COVID19 pandemic that appears to be more severe than any of the previous outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle-East respiratory syndrome (MERS). However, as the novel SARS-CoV-2 displays high transmission rates, the underlying severity hidden in the SARS-CoV2 genomes is required to be fully understood. We studied the complete genomes of 95 strains of SARS-CoV-2 reported from different geographical regions worldwide to uncover the pattern of spread of the novel SARS-CoV-2 across the globe. We show that there is no direct transmission pattern of the virus among neighbouring countries suggest...","A novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) originating in Wuhan, China presents a potential respiratory viral pandemic to the world population. Current efforts are focused on containment and quarantine of infected individuals. Ultimately, the outbreak could be controlled with a protective vaccine to prevent 2019-nCoV infection. While vaccine research should be pursued intensely, there exists today no therapy to treat 2019-nCoV upon infection, despite an urgent need to find options to help these patients and preclude potential death. Herein, I review the potential options to treat 2019-nCoV in patients, with an emphasis on the necessity for speed and timeliness in developing new and effective therapies in this outbreak. I consider the options of drug repurposing, developing neutralizing monoclonal antibody therapy, and an oligonucleotide strategy targeting the viral RNA genome, emphasizing the promise and pitfalls of these approaches. Finally, I advocate for the fastest strategy to develop a treat...","AbstractWuhan Novel Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak has become a global outbreak which has raised the concern of scientific community to design and discover a definitive cure against this deadly virus which has caused deaths of numerous infected people upon infection and spreading. To date, no antiviral therapy or vaccine is available which can effectively combat the infection caused by this virus. This study was conducted to design possible epitope-based subunit vaccines against the SARS-CoV-2 virus using the approaches of reverse vaccinology and immunoinformatics. Upon continual computational experimentation three possible vaccine constructs were designed and one vaccine construct was selected as the best vaccine based on molecular docking study which is supposed to effectively act against SARS-CoV-2. Later, molecular dynamics simulation and in silico codon adaptation experiments were carried out in order to check biological stability and find effective mass production strate...","We investigate the effects of social distancing in controlling the impact of the Covid-19 epidemic using a simple SIR epidemic model. We show that an alternative or complementaryapproach based on targeted isolation of the vulnerable subpopulation may provide a moreefficient and robust strategy at a lower economic and social cost within a shorter timeframe.","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a novel human respiratory disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Asymptomatic individuals in the context of COVID-19 are those subjects who are carriers of the virus but display no clinical symptoms. Current evidence reveals that this sub-population is a major contributing factor in the propagation of this disease, while escaping detection by public health surveillance systems. In this manuscript, we present a mathematical model taking into account asymptomatic carriers. Our results indicate a basic reproduction number as high as 26.5. The first three weeks of the model exhibit exponential growth, which is in agreement with average case data collected from thirteen countries with universal health care and robust communicable disease surveillance systems; the average rate of growth in the number of reported cases is 25\\% per day during this period. The model was applied to every county in the US to give estimates of mild, severe, and critical case...","As the Coronavirus (COVID-19) expands its impact from China, expanding its catchment into surrounding regions and other countries, increased national and international measures are being taken to contain the outbreak. The placing of entire cities in \u2018lockdown\u2019 directly affects urban economies on a multi-lateral level, including from social and economic standpoints. This is being emphasised as the outbreak gains ground in other countries, leading towards a global health emergency, and as global collaboration is sought in numerous quarters. However, while effective protocols in regard to the sharing of health data is emphasised, urban data, on the other hand, specifically relating to urban health and safe city concepts, is still viewed from a nationalist perspective as solely benefiting a nation\u2019s economy and its economic and political influence. This perspective paper, written one month after detection and during the outbreak, surveys the virus outbreak from an urban standpoint and adva...","Abstract The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS CoV) genome has 14 potential open reading frames (ORFs). The first ORF is translated from the full-length genomic mRNA while the remaining ORFs are translated from eight subgeomic RNAs (sgRNAs). In this study, we designed small interference RNAs (siRNAs) targeting sgRNA 2, 3 and 7 and tested their efficiency and specificity in silencing the protein translated from the targeted sgRNA. Our results demonstrated that siRNA 7 could inhibit sgRNA 7, which showed 19/19 nucleotides (nt) matching, and sgRNA 8, which showed 18/19nt matching; but, it did not inhibit the full-length genomic mRNA which showed 17/19nt matching. Overall, each of the siRNAs can inhibit the targeted sgRNA without affecting the full-length genomic mRNA or the other sgRNAs that showed mismatch of two or more nt. Thus, siRNA could be designed so as to knockdown the expression of viral protein(s) from a targeted sgRNA during viral infection, thereby allowing ...","Abstract Both helper dependent expression systems, based on two components, and single genomes constructed by targeted recombination, or by using infectious cDNA clones, have been developed. The sequences that regulate transcription have been characterized mainly using helper dependent expression systems and it will now be possible to validate them using single genomes. The genome of coronaviruses has been engineered by modification of the infectious cDNA leading to an efficient (&gt;20 \u03bcg ml\u22121) and stable (&gt;20 passages) expression of the foreign gene. The possibility of engineering the tissue and species tropism to target expression to different organs and animal species, including humans, increases the potential of coronaviruses as vectors. Thus, coronaviruses are promising virus vectors for vaccine development and, possibly, for gene therapy.","Background Traditional infection control policies have focused on engineering controls, specific protocols, and personal protective equipment (PPE). In light of the variable success in protecting health care workers (HCWs) from Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2003, organizational and individual factors related to self-protective behavior in health care settings may also play an important role. Methods A critical review of the literature was conducted, directed at understanding what organizational and individual factors are important in protecting HCWs from infectious diseases at work. Results Organizational factors, such as a positive safety climate, have been associated with increased HCW adherence to universal precautions. There is some evidence that appropriate training of HCWs could be effective in changing HCW behavior if appropriate follow-up is applied. Very little research into these factors has been conducted with regard to preventing exposures to respiratory tract...","Background: We evaluated if interventions aimed at air travellers can delay establishment of a SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in a previously unaffected country. Methods: For countries with no sustained SARS-CoV-2 transmission and with no shared border with affected regions we simulated arriving infected air travellers. We assessed the effectiveness of syndromic screening at departure and/or arrival &amp; traveller sensitisation to the COVID-2019-like symptoms with the aim to trigger rapid self-isolation and reporting on symptom onset to enable contact tracing. We assumed that syndromic screening would reduce the number of infected arrivals and that traveller sensitisation reduce the average number of secondary cases. We report the minimal expected delay achievable in 50% (75% &amp; 97.5%) of simulations. In the simulations we account for uncertainty in the number of secondary cases in the absence of air traveller targeted interventions and the arrival times of infected cases and also present sensitivity...","The focus of this protocol is mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), with occasional references to other coronaviruses. Many of these protocols can be easily adapted to other coronaviruses. Basic protocols for propagating MHV in DBT and 17CL-1 cells; the storage, and titration of viral stocks; purification of MHV on sucrose gradients; and the generation of recombinant viruses by a cDNA assembly method and by targeted recombination, will be presented. Support protocols for the propagation of DBT, 17CL-1, and L2 cells used for growing and titrating MHV, for the growth of BHK-R cells and FCWF cells. The latter two cell lines are used for regenerating infectious MHV by an in vitro cDNA assembly protocol and by a targeted recombination protocol, respectively, allowing reverse genetic manipulation of these viruses. An additional support protocol for the maintenance of the large plasmids used for generating recombinant MHVs will also be presented.","Summary Background Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a novel infectious disease with global impact. A virus from the family Coronaviridae has been identified as the cause, but the pathogenesis is still unclear. Methods Post-mortem tissue samples from six patients who died from SARS in February and March, 2003, and an open lung biopsy from one of these patients were studied by histology and virology. Only one full autopsy was done. Evidence of infection with the SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and human metapneumovirus was sought by reverse-transcriptase PCR and serology. Pathological samples were examined by light and electron microscopy and immunohistochemistry. Findings All six patients had serological evidence of recent infection with SARS-CoV. Diffuse alveolar damage was common but not universal. Morphological changes identified were bronchial epithelial denudation, loss of cilia, and squamous metaplasia. Secondary bacterial pneumonia was present in one case. A gia...","Balkan endemic nephropathy (BEN), originally described in the late 1950s as a chronic tubulointerstitial kidney disease, is identified by its unique epidemiological features. The most remarkable characteristic of BEN is the focal topographical nature that characterizes its occurrence at the global, national, and even household level. BEN affects only certain endemic rural foci along tributaries of the Danube River in the Balkan countries of Bosnia, Bulgaria, Croatia, Romania, and Serbia. The spatial distribution has remained astonishingly unchanged with time because the disease affects the same endemic clusters as 50 years ago. The natural course of the disease is characterized by universal development of end-stage renal disease and the frequent development of upper urinary tract tumors, posing a substantial disease burden to the afflicted areas. The greatest challenge in the study of BEN has been the elucidation of its cause. The unique features of the disease, in particular its endem...","Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is an emerging pathogen that was first identified in Wuhan, China in late December 2019. This virus is responsible for the ongoing outbreak that causes severe respiratory illness and pneumonia-like infection in humans. Due to the increasing number of cases in China and outside China, the WHO declared coronavirus as a global health emergency. Nearly 35,000 cases were reported and at least 24 other countries or territories have reported coronavirus cases as early on as February. Inter-human transmission was reported in a few countries, including the United States. Neither an effective anti-viral nor a vaccine is currently available to treat this infection. As the virus is a newly emerging pathogen, many questions remain unanswered regarding the virus&amp;rsquo;s reservoirs, pathogenesis, transmissibility, and much more is unknown. The collaborative efforts of researchers are needed to fill the knowledge gaps about this new virus, to develop the proper diagnostic...","The recent outbreak of COVID-19 in Mainland China is characterized by a distinctive algebraic, sub-exponential increase of confirmed cases with time during the early phase of the epidemic, contrasting an initial exponential growth expected for an unconstrained outbreak with sufficiently large reproduction rate. Although case counts vary significantly between affected provinces in Mainland China, the scaling law t^\u03bc is surprisingly universal, with a range of exponents \u03bc = 2.1 \u00b1 0.3. The universality of this behavior indicates that, in spite of social, regional, demographical, geographical, and socio-economical heterogeneities of affected Chinese provinces, this outbreak is dominated by fundamental mechanisms that are not captured by standard epidemiological models. We show that the observed scaling law is a direct consequence of containment policies that effectively deplete the susceptible population. To this end we introduce a parsimonious model that captures both, quarantine of sympto...","","R\u00e9sum\u00e9 La transfusion des produits sanguins labiles demeure une th\u00e9rapeutique essentielle, efficace et vitale, en l\u2019absence d\u2019alternative th\u00e9rapeutique.

Respiratory droplets and contact transmission are the main routes of transmission of new coronaviruses. Compared with SARS and Ebola viruses, new coronavirus infections are infectious during the incubation period. Traditional SEIR (susceptibility-exposure-infection-Removal) There are some differences in conditions for the prediction of the epidemic trend of new coronavirus infection. The outbreak of the new coronavirus infection coincided with the Spring Festival before and after the Chinese Spring Festival.It is necessary to make appropriate optimization and amendments to the traditional model to meet the actual evolution of the epidemic situation. METHODS The traditional SEIR model assumes that the virus-infected person is not infectious during the incubation period and that the infected person did not take isola...","Background: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a global pandemic currently. Many drugs showed potential for COVID-19 therapy. However, genetic factors which can lead to different drug efficiency and toxicity among populations are still undisclosed in COVID-19 therapy. Methods: We selected 67 potential drugs for COVID-19 therapy (DCTs) from clinical guideline and clinical trials databases. 313 pharmaco-genes related to these therapeutic drugs were included. Variation information in 125,748 exomes were collected for racial differences analyses. The expression level of pharmaco-genes in single cell resolution was evaluated from single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data of 17 healthy adults. Results: Pharmacogenes, including CYP3A4, ABCB1, SLCO1B1, ALB, CYP3A5, were involved in the process of more than multi DCTs. 224 potential drug-drug interactions (DDI) of DCTs were predicted, while 112 of them have been reported. Racial discrepancy of common nonsynonymous mutations wa...","Abstract17 years after the SARS-CoV epidemic, the world is facing the COVID-19 pandemic. COVID-19 is caused by a coronavirus named SARS-CoV-2. Given the most optimistic projections estimating that it will take more than a year to develop a vaccine, our best short term strategy may lie in identifying virus-specific targets for small molecule interventions. All coronaviruses utilize a molecular mechanism called -1 PRF to control the relative expression of their proteins. Prior analyses of SARS-CoV revealed that it utilizes a structurally unique three-stemmed mRNA pseudoknot to stimulate high rates of -1 PRF, that it also harbors a -1 PRF attenuation element. Altering -1 PRF activity negatively impacts virus replication, suggesting that this molecular mechanism may be therapeutically targeted. Here we present a comparative analysis of the original SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 frameshift signals. Structural analyses reveal that the core -1 PRF signal, composed of the U UUA AAC slippery site and...","Understanding the molecular features that made SARS-CoV-2 a highly infectious virus is crucial for the development of targeted therapies and an effective vaccine. Following the recent report of a furin-like cleavage site1, unique to SARS-CoV-2, we characterized several additional residues positioned within the crown of the S glycoprotein under positive/diversifying selection along the ancestral lineage of current pandemic strains. Residue V483 in near proximity to the ACE2 binding domain, which may indeed affect the enhanced ability of currently circulating strains to infect host cells. Molecular dynamic simulations revealed long-range covariant movements with furin cleavage, correlated with pre-fusion conformation of SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein monomer. Residue T333 is hinge of this movement that gives further advantage to bind cell receptors facilitating fusion and entry. Evolutionary analysis revealed that current lineage is likely to have emerged from the reservoir after a recombinat...","Abstract Background In 2003, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) resulted in hundreds of infections and deaths globally. We aim to assess immunogenicity and protective efficacy of purified inactivated Vero-cell SARS vaccine in monkeys. Methods The cultures of SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) BJ-01 strain infected Vero cells were inactivated with \u03b2-propiolactone. Sequential procedures, including ultrafiltration, gel filtration and ion exchange chromatography, were performed to obtain purified inactivated SARS vaccine. The purified SARS vaccine was analyzed with electron microscope, HPLC and Western blotting. We immunized three groups of cynomolgus macaques fascicularis with adjuvant-containing purified vaccine, purified vaccine and unpurified vaccine, respectively, and a fourth group served as a control. Antibody titers were measured by plaque reduction neutralization test. The vaccinated monkeys were challenged with SARS-CoV BJ-01 strain to observe protective efficacy. Additionally, th...","The current corona virus disease 2019 outbreak caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 started in Wuhan, China in December 2019 and has put the world on alert. To safeguard Chinese citizens and to strengthen global health security, China has made great efforts to control the epidemic. Many in the global community have joined China to limit the epidemic. However, discrimination and prejudice driven by fear or misinformation have been flowing globally, superseding evidence and jeopardizing the anti-severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 efforts. We analyze this phenomenon and its underlying causes and suggest practical solutions.","Abstract A synthetic peptide corresponding to amino acids (aa) 15\u201328 of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) 3a protein was used to raise polyclonal antibodies in rabbits. This anti-3a N-terminal antibody could detect 3a protein in infected cells, as did an anti-3a C-terminal antibody previously described. The latter targeted the C-terminal cytoplasmic domain of 3a (aa 134\u2013274). The anti-3a N-terminal antibody could detect intracellular 3a as well as 3a expressed on the cell surface. Interestingly, only the anti-3a N-terminal antibody can inhibit SARS-CoV propagation in Vero E6 culture although the binding affinity of the anti-3a N-terminal antibody was lower than the anti-3a C-terminal antibody.","Objective: This paper studied the relationship between personality traits and mental health conditions of medical personnel to provide a basis and reference for the implementation of targeted education on mental health. Methods: A self-report inventory, the Symptom Checklist-90 (SCL-90), was used to investigate the mental health status of 548 medical personnel dealing with the new coronavirus pneumonia in eight provinces and cities of China. Results: The overall mean SCL-90 score and mean values of factors (somatization, obsessive-compulsive, anxiety, phobic anxiety, and psychoticism) of the medical personnel were significantly higher than in the norm group (p &lt; 0.05), while their average interpersonal sensitivity score was significantly lower (p &lt; 0.01). In addition, personal factors affecting the mental health status of medical personnel were identified. ( all p &lt; 0.05). Conclusion: The overall mental health status of medical personnel responding to new coronavirus pneumonia is gener...","Abstract Metagenomics, i.e., the sequencing and analysis of genomic information extracted directly from clinical or environmental samples, has become a fundamental tool to explore the viral world. Against the background of an extensive viral diversity revealed by metagenomics across many environments, new sequence assembly approaches that reconstruct complete genome sequences from metagenomes have recently revealed surprisingly cosmopolitan viruses in specific ecological niches. Metagenomics is also applied to clinical samples as a non-targeted diagnostic and surveillance tool. By enabling the study of these uncultivated viruses, metagenomics provides invaluable insights into the virus-host interactions, epidemiology, ecology, and evolution of viruses across all ecosystems.","AbstractCoronaviruses (CoVs) are important human pathogens with significant zoonotic potential. Progress has been made toward identifying potential vaccine candidates for highly pathogenic human CoVs, including use of attenuated viruses that lack the CoV envelope (E) protein or express E mutants. However, no approved vaccines or anti-viral therapeutics exist. CoVs assemble by budding into the lumen of the early Golgi prior to exocytosis. The small CoV E protein plays roles in assembly, virion release, and pathogenesis. CoV E has a single hydrophobic domain (HD), is targeted to Golgi membranes, and has cation channel activity in vitro. The E protein from the avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) has dramatic effects on the secretory system, which requires residues in the HD. Mutation of the HD of IBV E during infection results in impaired growth kinetics, impaired release of infectious virions, accumulation of IBV S protein on the plasma membrane when compared IBV WT infected cells, a...","Abstract As the global COVID-19 pandemic escalates there is a need within radiation oncology to work to support our patients in the best way possible. Measures are required to reduce infection spread between patients and within the workforce. Departments need contingency planning to create capacity and continue essential treatments despite a reduced workforce. The #radonc community held an urgent online journal club in March 2020 to discuss these issues and create some consensus on urgent next steps. There were 121 global contributors. This document summarises these discussions around themes of infection prevention, rationalisation of workload and working practice in the presence of infection","AbstractThe beginning of 2020 has seen the emergence of COVID-19 outbreak caused by a novel coronavirus, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). There is an imminent need to better understand this new virus and to develop ways to control its spread. In this study, we sought to gain insights for vaccine design against SARS-CoV-2 by considering the high genetic similarity between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, which caused the outbreak in 2003, and leveraging existing immunological studies of SARS-CoV. By screening the experimentally-determined SARS-CoV-derived B cell and T cell epitopes in the immunogenic structural proteins of SARS-CoV, we identified a set of B cell and T cell epitopes derived from the spike (S) and nucleocapsid (N) proteins that map identically to SARS-CoV-2 proteins. As no mutation has been observed in these identified epitopes among the available SARS-CoV-2 sequences (as of 9 February 2020), immune targeting of these epitopes may potentially offer pr...","The beginning of 2020 has seen the emergence of COVID-19 outbreak caused by a novel coronavirus, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).

We aim to devise novel ways to model, visualise and analyse the temporal dynamics of epidemic outbreaks in order to help researchers and other people involved in crisis response to make well-informed and targeted decisions about from which geographical locations and time periods more genetic samples may be required to fully understand the outbreak. Our approach relies on the application of Transcendental Information Cascades to a set of temporally ordered nucleotide sequences and we apply it to real-world data that was collected during the currently ongoing outbreak of the novel 2019-nCoV coronavirus. We assess information-theoretic and network-theoretic measures that characterise the resulting complex network and suggest touching points and temporal pathways that are of interest for deeper investigation by geneticists and epidemiologists.","Abstract Many current and potential drug targets are membrane-bound or secreted proteins that are expressed and transported via the Sec61 secretory pathway. They are targeted to translocon channels across the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) by signal peptides (SPs), which are temporary structures on the N-termini of their nascent chains. During translation, such proteins enter the lumen and membrane of the ER by a process known as co-translational translocation. Small molecules have been found that interfere with this process, decreasing protein expression by recognizing the unique structures of the SPs of particular proteins. The SP may thus become a validated target for designing drugs for numerous disorders, including certain hereditary diseases.","Novel viruses might be responsible for numerous disease cases with unknown etiology. In this study, we screened 1800 nasopharyngeal samples from adult outpatients with respiratory disease symptoms and healthy individuals. We employed a reverse transcription (RT)-PCR assay and CODEHOP-based primers (CT12-mCODEHOP) previously developed to recognize known and unknown corona- and toroviruses. The CT12-mCODEHOP assay detected 42.0 % (29/69) of samples positive for human coronaviruses (HCoV), including HCoV-229 (1/16), HCoV-NL63 (9/17), and HCoV-OC43 (19/36), and additionally HCoV-HKU1 (3), which was not targeted by the diagnostic real-time PCR assays. No other coronaviruses were identified in the analyzed samples.","The outbreak of COVID-19 originated in Wuhan has become a global epidemic of contagious diseases, which poses a serious threat to human life and health, especially for those with underlined diseases. However, Impacts of COVID-19 epidemic on HD center and HD patients are still unknown. In this report, we reviewed the whole course of the epidemic emerged in the HD center of Renmin Hospital, Wuhan University from January 14, 2020, the day the first case was confirmed, to February 17, 2020, the day the epidemic extinction. There are totally 37 cases among 230 HD patients and 4 cases among 33 staff being diagnosed with COVID-19. The epidemiology, clinical presentation and immune profile of dialysis patients contracted COVID-19 were further studied. We found that the two key measures we took in response to the epidemic, one was upgrading level of prevention and protection on January 21 and the other one starting universal screening, isolating, and distributing the infected cases on February ...","AbstractThe outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in China caused by SARS-CoV-2 virus continually lead to worldwide human infections and deaths. It is currently no specific viral protein targeted therapeutics yet. Viral nucleocapsid protein is a potential antiviral drug target, serving multiple critical functions during the viral life cycle. However, the structural information of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein is yet to be clear. Herein, we have determined the 2.7 \u00c5 crystal structure of the N-terminal RNA binding domain of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein. Although overall structure is similar with other reported coronavirus nucleocapsid protein N-terminal domain, the surface electrostatic potential characteristics between them are distinct. Further comparison with mild virus type HCoV-OC43 equivalent domain demonstrates a unique potential RNA binding pocket alongside the \u03b2-sheet core. Complemented by in vitro binding studies, our data provide several atomic resolution features of...","Summary The causative agent of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), which affected over 8000 individuals worldwide and was responsible for over 700 deaths in the 2002\u20132003 outbreak, is a coronavirus that was unknown before the outbreak. Although many different treatments were used during the outbreak, none were implemented in a controlled fashion. Thus, the optimal treatment for SARS is unknown. Since the outbreak, much work has been done testing new agents against SARS using in-vitro methods and animal models. In addition, global research efforts have focused on the development of vaccines against SARS. Efforts should be made to evaluate the most promising treatments and vaccines in controlled clinical trials, should another SARS outbreak occur."],"title":["Correlation between universal BCG vaccination policy and reduced morbidity and mortality for COVID-19: an epidemiological study","Insights into Cross-species Evolution of Novel Human Coronavirus 2019-nCoV and Defining Immune Determinants for Vaccine Development","What's trending in the infection prevention and control literature?
