All patients satisfied the WHO case definition for SARS [16]. The research ethics board approved the study and we enrolled 41 patients with SARS who received mechanical ventilation between 14 May 2003 and 18 July 2003. Patients with pre-existing pneumothorax or chest tube thoracostomy were excluded. The primary study outcome variable was defined as radiographic evidence of new-onset pneumothorax at 30 days after ventilator use. Patients were censored at the first pneumothorax event, at the time of death, liberation from mechanical ventilation or discharge from the SARS ICU. Patients receiving mechanical ventilation were sedated with midazolam or propofol to facilitate mechanical ventilation; meanwhile, the sedatives were adjusted according to the Ramsay sedation score. Moreover, atracurium was used for neuromuscular paralysis to facilitate patient-ventilator synchrony in some patients. The dosage of atracurium was adjusted by peripheral nerve stimulator. When the patient was ready for weaning according to defined criteria, sedation and/or neuromuscular paralysis were discontinued.","In Cox regression analysis, seven different models were used to analyze the adjusted hazard ratio of CRRT treatment. Consistently, the association between CRRT treatment and a reduced risk of mortality remained significant after adjusting for selected confounding factors, such as age, sex, the baseline laboratory findings, or the average values of all tests between the start of invasive mechanical ventilation and the endpoint. The adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) of CRRT treatment fluctuated between 0.283 and 0.424 (Table 2) .","The primary data extracted were the proportions of deceased MERS patients, patients admitted to the ICU and patients undergoing mechanical ventilation. All of these outcomes were dealt with as dichotomous variables, and thus, we calculated the 95% confidence interval (CI) for each included study using the binomial distribution. Whenever possible, we stratified the risk of death by age, sex, underlying medical condition and study design. For the analysis of the effect of each covariate on the outcome, the odds ratio (OR) for death among those with underlying conditions was calculated and compared with those without comorbidities. Stratified analysis could not have been made for the proportions of ICU admission and mechanical ventilation because the dataset of such covariates was not commonly available for these two outcomes. We employed a fixed effects inverse variance weighted model. Weighted means (i.e. pooled estimate) of the abovementioned proportions and the OR for death by each covariate were calculated using the inverse of variance estimates from each study. The heterogeneity among identified studies was statistically assessed by the I2 statistic. To explore the possible sources of heterogeneity, we stratified pooled estimates by study design. A forest plot was used to illustrate the distribution of the outcome and effect size obtained from each published study.","Our approach is flexible enough to create reference cohorts, which will allow estimation of COVID-19 severity using known characteristics and outcomes. As more data on European cases are published, the system can be applied to cases with a more comparable background. First comparisons expose the high rate of patients requiring ventilation over prolonged time periods, thus hospital resources may be in higher demand of ventilation supply than usual. In fact, Liu et al. suggests that early non-invasive mechanical ventilation can promote positive outcomes [9]. This can only be implemented if hospitals prepare for high utilisation of ventilation and intensive care resources. Although fatalities occur mostly among elderly people with chronic comorbidities, serious disease progressions do also occur among younger, healthy patients and more often than would be expected from the experience during influenza epidemics.","Of the 20% of patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU), 69% required mechanical ventilation. There were 8 deaths, or a 6.5% mortality rate. Predictors of poor outcome (death or admission to the ICU) included increased age, male sex, diabetes, increased neutrophil count, creatine kinase, and urea. In a separate study assessing the outcomes of critically ill patients with SARS in the Toronto area, investigators found that 76% required mechanical ventilation. 16 Among those requiring ventilation, the mortality rate was 45%. In this study, transmission of SARS within 6 of the intensive care units that were evaluated prompted closure of 73 medical-surgical ICU beds, leading to 164 health care workers being placed in quarantine.","Of the 20% of patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU), 69% required mechanical ventilation.

Hypoxic respiratory failure and severe ARDS. Give oxygen therapy immediately to patients with ARDS, and closely monitor them for signs of clinical deterioration, such as rapidly progressive respiratory failure. Consider severe hypoxemic respiratory failure when standard oxygen therapy fails. When patients have increased frequency of breathing (&gt; 30 times/min) and hypoxemia (SpO2 &lt; 90% or PaO2 &lt; 60 mmHg) even with oxygen delivered via a face mask and reservoir bag (gas flow of 10~15 L/min, FiO2 0.60\u20130.95), it may be considered as hypoxic respiratory failure.ARDS is a status of severe acute hypoxic respiratory failure caused by increased pulmonary capillary permeability and alveolar epithelial cell damage. It can be divided into mild, moderate and severe conditions according to the Berlin definition [38] (Table 6). HFNO. Under the support of standard oxygen therapy, to maintain SpO2 above 93% stills hard, and the breathing rate increases rapidly, then HFNO should be considered. HFNO can deliver 60 L/min of gas flow and FiO2 up to 1.0. Generally, gas flow is initially set as 30\u201340 L/min and oxygen concentration 50%\u201360%, which is well tolerated and coordinated. Then settings can be adjusted according to the oxygenation status of patients. Compared with standard oxygen therapy, HFNO is able to reduce the chance of tracheal intubation. Patients with hypercapnia (like exacerbation of obstructive lung disease, cardiogenic pulmonary edema), hemodynamic instability, multi-organ failure, or abnormal mental status should not be given HFNO. HFNO may be safe in patients with mild-moderate and non-worsening hypercapnia. However, if the respiratory distress still exists or even worsens dramatically under HFNO (FiO2 &gt; 70%, gas flow &gt; 50 L/min for 1 hour), the respiratory supporting strategy should be changed.NIV. NIV provides a certain positive pressure ventilation effect through the positive pressure formed by the closed mask. HFNO combined with intermittent short-term NIV (1\u20132 h) support may be useful to reduce respiratory power consumption and improve oxygenation. But NIV guidelines recommend the use of respiratory support therapy in hypoxemic respiratory failure or pandemic viral illness. Limited data showed a high failure rate of NIV in MERS patients. Invasive mechanical ventilation should be considered in case the ARDS still exists and even acutely deteriorates in NIV process (about 1 h). Patients with hemodynamic instability, multiple organ failure, or abnormal mental status should not receive NIV.Invasive mechanical ventilation. Under the support of HFNO (the demand for FiO2 &gt; 70% and gas flow &gt; 50 L/min) or NIV, ARDS still exists and even acutely deteriorates, invasive mechanical ventilation should be implemented as soon as possible.Endotracheal intubation should be carried out by trained and experienced provider using airborne precautions, since endotracheal intubation is an operation that may produce a large number of contagious aerosols.The strategy of protective lung ventilation should be implemented in invasive mechanical ventilation: lower tidal volume (4\u20136 ml/kg), lower plateau pressure (&lt; 30 cmH2O), and appropriate PEEP. For patients with moderate-severe ARDS (PaO2/FiO2 &lt; 150), it is recommended to use higher PEEP, apply prone ventilation for more than 12 h per day and adopt deep sedation and analgesia muscle relaxation strategy within the first 48 h of mechanical ventilation. For patients with severe acute hypoxic respiratory failure, we should pay attention to and prevent ventilator-associated lung injury after mechanical ventilation.Extracorporeal Life Support (ECLS). In the process of invasive mechanical ventilation when the patient is still in the state of hypoxia, combined with increased partial pressure of carbon dioxide (excluding ventilation dysfunction, PaCO2 &gt; 60 mmHg), especially after muscle relaxation and prone ventilation, it is necessary to consider to implement ECLS. However, it is suggested that ECLS treatment should only be carried out under the condition that the professional center is with access to expertise. Currently the ECLS in ICU includes VV-ECMO (blood is pumped from femoral vein, and returns to right atrium through internal jugular vein after oxygenation through membrane oxygenator) and VA-ECMO (blood is pumped from femoral vein and directly enters aortic system through femoral artery after oxygenation through membrane oxygenator). For patients with severe refractory hypoxemia, neuromuscular blockade can improve oxygen supply, especially if there is still evidence of ventilator-patient dyssynchrony after the use of sedatives. However, neuromuscular blockade through continuous infusion should not be routinely used in patients with moderate-severe ARDS; Where available, ECMO in conjunction with low tidal-volume mechanical ventilation can be considered in the treatment of patients with severe refractory hypoxemia in whom standard therapy are failing; Routine use of high-frequency oscillatory ventilation (HFOV) in patients with moderate-severe ARDS is not beneficial, but may be harmful. However, HFOV may still be regarded as a rescue therapy for patients with severe ARDS and refractory hypoxemia. ECMO can be used in some severe ARDS patients (lung injury score &gt; 3 or pH &lt; 7.2 due to uncompensated hypercapnia), but it is not recommended for all ARDS patients. It can be considered to use extracorporeal carbon dioxide removal for ARDS patients, if there is more supportive research evidence in the future.","Acute respiratory distress syndrome, or ARDS, is a life-threatening form of lung injury. This lung injury can be the result of primary pulmonary parenchymal injury such as pneumonia or aspiration or from a systemic process such as sepsis or trauma. Increased capillary permeability leading to inflammation is the inciting factor for ARDS. Damage to the capillary endothelium and alveolar epithelium results in protein accumulation within the alveoli, activation of pro-inflammatory cytokines and then pulmonary fibrosis. This cascade leads to loss of functional lung tissue. Chest radiography demonstrates bilateral opacities. As ARDS progresses, lung compliance decreases, hypoxemia ensues and patients can progress to ventilator dependence. (3, 4) In practice, ARDS is defined by the Berlin Definition. This requires that patients have acute At present, there are no studies examining specific ventilatory strategies in patients with COVID-19, however, there is a large body of experience with ARDS patients. Until more COVID-19specific evidence-based medicine is available, expert recommendations support adherence to these ventilatory strategies in COVID-19 patients. (6) Mechanical ventilation is recommended for patients with moderate or severe ARDS who remain hypoxemic or profoundly symptomatic despite supplemental oxygen. In mechanically ventilated patients, a lung-protective ventilation strategy should be employed to decrease ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI). When treating ARDS patients with mechanical ventilation, the target tidal volume is typically 6 mL/kg of predicted body weight with goal plateau pressure &lt;30-cm H 2 O. One interesting finding in COVID-19 ARDS is that some patients are found to be severely hypoxemic, but with surprisingly good lung compliance. In these patients, more liberal tidal volume settings may be considered. PEEP should be adjusted based on FiO 2 , with consideration of higher PEEP (&gt;10 cm H 2 O) in moderate and severe ARDS. Notably, lung protective ventilation (low tidal volume) allows permissive respiratory acidosis with maintenance of a pH \u2265 7.25. Relative hypoxemia with a PaO 2 of 55-80 mmHg or SpO 2 of 88-95% may also be considered to limit high oxygen requirements. (3) In ARDS patients with PaO 2 /FiO 2 \u2264 150 mmHg, consideration should be given to initiation of prone positioning. If significant ventilator dyssynchrony is present, neuromuscular blockade may also be considered. (7) It should be noted that mild ARDS may be managed with noninvasive forms of ventilation.","The outcomes in pregnant SARS patients in Hong Kong appeared to be worse than outcomes in their non-pregnant counterparts. Of the seven cases followed at the designated SARS unit, two died (28%), and four (57%) were admitted to intensive care for mechanical ventilation. This is in contrast to mortality rates of less than 10% and mechanical ventilation rates of less than 20% in non-pregnant, age-matched counterparts. Fortunately, there was no clinical or laboratory evidence of SARS in any of the babies delivered in this series.","The outcomes in pregnant SARS patients in Hong Kong appeared to be worse than outcomes in their non-pregnant counterparts.

The sample size varied between 12 and 1099 COVID-19 patients, whilst the rate of those with severe disease ranged between 14 and 62%. Eight studies included Chinese patients, whilst one was based in Singapore [18] . The clinical severity was defined as the composite of ICU admission, use of mechanical ventilation or death in two studies [11, 13] , ICU admission in two studies [12, 16] , progression towards ARDS in one study [14] , death in three studies [15, 17, 19] , and need of mechanical ventilation in the remaining study [18] . All eight studies provided data on the platelet count, whilst only four studies provided information on the rate of thrombocytopenia [11, 12, 14, 19] , where thrombocytopenia was defined as platelet count &lt; 150 \u00d7 10 9 /L in two studies [11, 14] , whilst was set at &lt; 100 \u00d7 10 9 /L in the other two investigations [12, 19] .","We assume that in this setting hospitalization would be limited to those with severe disease (defined as tachypnea (\u226730 breaths/ min) or oxygen saturation \u226493% at rest, or PaO2/FIO2 &lt;300, and/or lung infiltrates &gt;50% of the lung field within 24-48 hours), 19 and not used as a means of isolation. Thus, we assumed the proportion hospitalized was equivalent to the age-adjusted severe disease proportion calculated for the population and applied this to incident infections from the model simulations. 18 We assumed 26.4% of severe cases would require intensive care and estimated deaths assuming a 10% case fatality risk rate among hospitalizations/severe disease. We conservatively did not account for potential increases in mortality when healthcare resources are exhausted. We assumed hospitalization occurs a median of 3.42 days after symptom onset (lognormally distributed, standard deviation=0.79), 18 hospitalized cases are discharged after a mean of 11.5 days (95% CI, 8.0-17.3), and deaths occur after a mean of 11.2 days (95% CI, 8.7-14.9). 14 Additionally, early reports from the outbreak in China indicate that mechanical ventilation was required by approximately 25% of patients with severe disease, while the remaining 75% required only oxygen supplementation. 19","Women were matched on sex, age, timing of contracting SARS, health care worker status, 173 underlying illness and whether the woman resided in a housing area where there was a large 174 outbreak. Pregnancy appeared to have no effect on clinical symptoms or time to presentation 175 after symptom onset. However, complications and adverse outcomes were more common among 176 pregnant women: women who were pregnant had a longer hospital stay, were statistically 177 significantly more likely to develop renal failure, sepsis, and DIC, and were more likely to 178 require intensive care unit admission. Forty percent of pregnant women required mechanical 179 ventilation, compared to 13% of non-pregnant patients (p=0.07). Pregnant women were also 180 significantly more likely to die (p=0.01). 181 We identified five reports of additional cases of SARS during pregnancy treated in Hong 182 Kong (n=2), United States (n=2), and Canada (n=1). [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] Two of the five women required mechanical ventilation, one required hemodialysis for acute renal failure, and one had seizures 184 and positive cerebrospinal fluid for SARS-CoV, suggestive of a central nervous system infection.","The tool first calculates the daily turnover of acute care beds, critical care beds and mechanical ventilators available for COVID-19 patients by taking the maximally available number of those resources and dividing it by the expected duration of use for COVID-19 patients. Based on published data, the average length of stay in acute care was set at 11 days, the average length of stay in critical care was set at 20 days, and the average length of time for mechanical ventilation was set at 20 days. 1, 5 The tool then calculates the population-weighted expected probabilities of acute care hospitalization and critical care admissions for COVID-19 infections; we assumed that 50% of critical care patients would require mechanical ventilation. 5, 6 Finally, the maximum daily number of incident COVID-19 cases that a healthcare system could manage is calculated by dividing the daily turnover of maximally available acute care beds, critical care beds or mechanical ventilators by the probability of those resources being used among COVID-19 cases.","To explore the mechanisms involved in the later development of the senescent response, a clinically-relevant experimental model, acid aspiration-and mechanical ventilation induced lung injury, was tested. Chlorhydric acid instillation and mechanical ventilation induced a significant increase in lung damage and inflammation, assessed by histological scores (Figure 2A To confirm the incidence of SAHF in patients, lung tissue from autopsies of criticallyill patients with and without lung injury and mechanical ventilation (Supplementary Table 2 ) were stained with antibodies against Macro-H2A.

Tiered Surgical Response to COVID-19 March 19, 2020 7 nasal cannula and BiPAP are ineffective and patients at this stage will need mechanical ventilation. Ingenuity with methods to create new ventilators from spare parts and retrofit old machines such as IPPB into working ventilators will be required. Additionally, if all patients are COVID-19+ as many as 4-patients could be linked in parallel on pressure control settings to attain reasonable minute ventilation and tidal volumes if required. 11 Finally, while ventilators will be in high demand, endotracheal tubes are copious, and if family members are willing, bagging of patients by family members when no ventilator is available may be required.","Four randomised controlled trials [75] [76] [77] [78] published between 1998 and 1999 provided mixed results for the optimal tidal volume in acute respiratory distress syndrome. In the landmark ARMA study, 28 which was published in 2000 by the ARDSnet group, a traditional ventilatory strategy of 12 mL per kg of predicted bodyweight tidal volume in com bination with a plateau airway pressure \u2264 50 cm H 2 O was compared with a lower tidal volume of 6 mL per kg of predicted bodyweight in com bination with a plateau airway pressure of 30 cm H 2 O or less in 861 mechanically ventilated patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome. The study was stopped early, because, despite initially worse oxygenation, low-tidal-volume ventilation was associated with an 8\u00b78% (95% CI 2\u00b74-15\u00b73) absolute reduction in mortality (39\u00b78% vs 31\u00b70%; p=0\u00b7007), and signifi cantly more ventilator-free days (10 [SD 11] vs 12 [11]; p=0\u00b7007). Importantly, less injurious ventilation was associated with more days free of non-pulmonary organ failure (12 [11] vs 15 [11]; p=0\u00b7006). Tidal volume was estimated from predicted bodyweight, which is dependent on height and sex, and calculated as 50 + 0\u00b791 \u00d7 (height in cm -152\u00b74) for men and 45\u00b75 + 0\u00b791 \u00d7 (height in cm -152\u00b74) for women. Lung-protective ventilation is associated with improved outcomes if used early in the course of acute respiratory distress syndrome, 79 and reduced mortality at 2 years. 80 Despite the adoption of a volume-limited and pressurelimited protective ventilatory strategy, critically ill mechanically ventilated patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome receiving a tidal volume of 6 mL/kg and a plateau pressure of 30 cm H 2 O or less can still be exposed to tidal hyperinfl ation, whereby the smaller-than-usual aerated section of the lung (so-called baby lung) 81 receives a larger-than-usual volume of gas, resulting in greater biotrauma and fewer ventilator-free days than those in patients without tidal hyperinfl ation. 82 Similarly, a post-hoc review 83 of the ARDSnet database did not demonstrate a safe upper limit for plateau pressures in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome. Volume-limited and pressure-limited ventilation can cause hypercapnic acidosis, and the overall clinical eff ect of protective ventilation and hypercapnia is uncertain. 84 Hypercapnic acidosis could provide protective eff ects in the setting of high-tidal-volume ventilation, but a benefi cial eff ect is not noted in patients receiving lung-protective ventilation. 85 PEEP prevents lung unit collapse at the end of the respiratory cycle. Benefi cial eff ects include the maintenance of functional residual capacity, improved compliance, and higher mean airway pressure, which result in decreased shunt with enhanced oxygenation, and reduced atelectasis and biotrauma. These advantages should be weighed against the eff ects of raised intrathoracic pressure-namely, decreased venous return and increased right ventricular afterload. 86 Numerous methods of setting the PEEP level have been described, including most recently oesophageal balloon manometry. 87 In the lung-protective era, four randomised controlled trials [87] [88] [89] [90] have been done to answer the question of whether higher or lower pressure is superior, with a suggestion that higher PEEP could be benefi cial. A metaanalysis 91 of three of these trials also showed a possible benefi t for a high PEEP setting in acute respiratory distress syndrome, which was associated with both lower in-hospital mortality (34\u00b71% vs 39\u00b71%; RR 0\u00b790, 95% CI 0\u00b781-1\u00b700; p=0\u00b7049) and less require ment for mechanical ventilation by day 28 (hazard ratio [HR] 1\u00b716, 95% CI 1\u00b703-1\u00b730; p=0\u00b701). 91 The EPVent randomised controlled trial, 87 in which oesophageal-balloon manometry-guided PEEP was compared with use of the ARDSnet PEEP-FiO 2 table, showed that oesophageal-guided PEEP provided increased oxy genation and compliance, which translated into higher PEEP (18 cm vs 12 cm H 2 O on day one) and associated improved adjusted 28 day mortality (RR 0\u00b746, 95% CI 0\u00b719-1\u00b70; p=0\u00b7049). 87 A further meta-analysis that included this additional study showed non-signifi cant improvements in 28 day mortality with higher PEEP (pooled RR 0\u00b790, 95% CI 0\u00b779-1\u00b702), without a signifi cantly higher risk of barotrauma (1\u00b717, 0\u00b790-1\u00b752). 92 The driving pressure, which is defi ned as the diff erence between plateau and end-expiratory pressures, has been suggested as the mediator for the benefi cial eff ects of the three main components of lung-protective ventilationnamely, low tidal volume, low plateau pressure, and high PEEP. 93 On the basis of derivation and validation cohorts from 3562 patients recruited into nine randomised controlled trials, Amato and colleagues 93 reported that an increase in driving pressure of 7 cm H 2 O was associated with increased 60 day mortality (RR 1\u00b741, 95% CI 1\u00b731-1\u00b751; p&lt;0\u00b7001). According to the statistical method of multilevel mediation analysis, none of the three main components of lung-protective ventilation was individually associated with reduced mortality, but they acted via a reduced driving pressure to exert their benefi cial eff ects.","By applying the proposed correction, the number of adjusted cases is significantly higher for most countries. Figure 3a illustrates population age distributions. Figure 3b shows the expected number of fatal outcomes for a 100% infection rate. The vulnerability factor for the US compared to South Korea is 1.07. This means that the population is equally vulnerable to fatal outcomes of COVID-19 infections. Italy, in contrast, has a vulnerability factor of 1.57. This is due to a higher fraction of the population being at a higher risk of death. This would indicate the expected death rate would be 57% higher in Italy compared to South Korea. China, with a younger population relative to South Korea, has a vulnerability factor of 0.63. The expected death rate in China should be lower than in South Korea based on the population risk. After applying the case adjustment, we observe a significant increase in the number of COVID-19 infections. The discrepancy in reported death rates in combination with favorable population scores in the case of China suggests a large number of unreported COVID-19 infections. The adjustment suggests around 702,518 cases compared to 80,932 reported cases. This equates to an 868% higher case count than previously reported. The corrections for Italy and the US are similar, but not as extreme. Italy has an adjusted number of cases of 112,182 cases and the US potentially 6,085 cases. Table 2 shows the adjusted number of cases for a selected number of countries. Iran is the country with the most substantial adjustment of 1,363%, reaching 154,853 cases.","Based on the estimated number of new cases per day, we inferred different outcomes. First, we computed the number of severe cases, defined according to Guan and colleagues 18 . We used their estimations of age-dependent severity risks across four age groups, which were dispatched across our 17 age groups (Table  1) . We also estimated the number of cases which will require hospitalization to ICU using age-dependent risks from Guan and colleagues 18 (Table 1) . Using data from Yang and colleagues 26 , we set the proportion of cases which will require mechanical ventilation to 0.711 (not age-dependent). The number of deaths was estimated using age-dependent deaths risks (10 age groups) provided by the Italian National Institute of Health (Istituto Superiore di Sanit\u00e0) (Table 1) 27 .","In terms of respiratory support, 67.1% of COVID-19 patients received conventional oxygen therapy (COT) as initial support, whereas 89.7% patients of H1N1 patients received mechanical ventilation (p&lt;0.001). However, the failure rates of COT, high-flow nasal canula oxygen therapy (HFNC), and non-invasive mechanical ventilation (NIV) were higher than those in COVID-19 patients. During the entire process of treatment, the proportions of H1N1 patients who received HFNC, NIV, invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV), and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) were significantly higher than those of COVID-19 patients (p&lt;0.05) ( Table 4 ).","With a simple approach, we give a preliminary assessment of individual seriousness of COVID-19 using well-described case series of hospitalised COVID-19 pneumonia patients from the cities of Wuhan, Beijing, Shenzhen and the provinces of Hubei and Zhejiang [5-12]. We defined a reference group from a well-known setting: in 73 German sentinel hospitals, we extracted the data of all inpatients diagnosed with pneumonia (International Classification of Diseases, 10th revision codes J12-J18, primary diagnosis [13]) that were admitted during three consecutive weeks, after the start and before the peak of the influenza epidemic in the years 2015 to 2019. We compared severity parameters that were described for COVID-19 patients (acute respiratory distress syndrome, ventilation, intensive care, case fatality) with those from the German sentinel system. Furthermore, we stratified parameters by potential risk groups such as age, sex and chronic comorbidities. We also compared outcomes and risk factors for critically ill patients (i.e. received intensive care and ventilation) [14]. As the Chinese population is younger, with a larger proportion of males compared with the German population, we applied weights and provided crude and adjusted proportions for the sentinel pneumonia patients (SPP) [15]. This approach, which can be used by other countries using syndromic surveillance, attempts to replicate the uncertainty of initial results for the new coronavirus.","Patient sex, age, actual body weight, APACHE II score and pre-existing comorbidities were recorded at entry. The PaO2/FiO2 ratio, PaO2, PaCO2, FiO2 and lung injury score [17] were recorded on ICU admission and daily during hospitalization. Ventilatory variables including PEEP, peak inspiratory pressure (PIP), mean airway pressure (MAP), tidal volume, tidal volume per kilogram, respiratory rate and minute ventilation were recorded at least once a day during the period of mechanical ventilation. When pneumothorax occurred, the highest pressure or volume of mechanical ventilation before the onset of pneumothorax were most likely to be the cause of pneumothorax [14]. Therefore, we compared the highest value of pressure and volume within a 24-hour period before the event in the patients with pneumothorax, with the overall values during mechanical ventilation in patients without pneumothorax.","The critically illed patients mainly use oxygen therapy such as HFNO, NIV and invasive mechanical ventilation. When using various oxygen treatments in a sequential manner, the airway and breathing circuit need to be kept open, and the effect of oxygen treatment needs to be monitored dynamically. At the same time, skincare products need to be used reasonably to avoid damage to the nose, face and lips by pressure. When using a high-flow nasal catheter to inhale oxygen, the oxygen flow and temperature and humidity should be adjusted appropriately. When using non-invasive mechanical ventilation, patient should receive relevant health education. Patients are instructed to inhale through the nose. The pressure is set from low to high and gradually reaches the target value. The human-machine coordination is maximized. The patient\u2019s consciousness and respiratory function are closely observed. Patients with artificial airway established should use a closed suction tube to reduce virus spread. Nurses should wear goggles or a face shield to avoid occupational exposure.","When faced with COVID-19 patients with hypoxemic respiratory failure secondary to ARDS, it is appropriate to initiate a lung-protective ventilation strategy. (6) Consider volume-control as the initial mode of mechanical ventilation. This ensures adequate tidal volume and minimizes the risk of volutrauma. In accordance with the ARDSnet study protocol (www.ardsnet.org), it is reasonable to choose an initial tidal volume of 6 mL/kg (predicted body weight). Begin with an initial FiO 2 of 1.0 which may then be gradually decreased as tolerated, while monitoring pulse oximetry. It is advisable to reference the widely-published ARDSnet protocol for guidance in determining appropriate PEEP for a given FiO 2 . Decisions regarding a lower versus higher PEEP strategy may be tailored based on underlying cardiac physiology. Initially, it is reasonable to consider a higher PEEP strategy. Initial respiratory rate should be set to approximate the patient's pre-intubation minute ventilation (usually 20-28 breaths per minute); this may then be adjusted based on the patient's arterial pCO 2 (Figure 1) .","Outcomes H1N1-negative n = 28 H1N1-positive compared to H1N1-negative patients had a higher median age (3 years vs. &lt;1 year, p = 0.003), but not codetection group compared to mono-detection group (Figs. 1 and 2 and Table 2 ). Therefore, all subsequent analyses were adjusted for age. H1N1-positive patients presented more frequently fever (OR = 5.30, 95%CI = 1.40-19.98, p = 0.014), cough (OR = 4.04, 95%CI = 1.62-16.35, p = 0.028), tachypnea (OR = 6.26, 95%CI = 1.01-38.99, p = 0.049), and lower leukocyte count (median of 4550 vs. 12,200, p &lt; 0.001) ( Table 4 ). There were no differences between the two groups in terms of organic dysfunction, use of mechanical ventilator and vasoactive amines, hospital and PICU length of stay, and death (Table 5) .","The median time from illness onset (ie, before admission) to discharge was 22\u00b70 days (IQR 18\u00b70-25\u00b70), whereas the median time to death was 18\u00b75 days (15\u00b70-22\u00b70; table 2). 32 patients required invasive mechanical ventilation, of whom 31 (97%) died. The median time from illness onset to invasive mechanical ventilation was 14\u00b75 days (12\u00b70-19\u00b70). Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation was used in three patients, none of whom survived. Sepsis was the most frequently observed complication, followed by respiratory failure, ARDS, heart failure, and septic shock (table 2). Half of non-survivors experienced a secondary infection, and ventilator-associated pneumonia occurred in ten (31%) of 32 patients requiring invasive mechanical ventilation. The frequency of complications were higher in non-survivors than survivors (table 2) . In univariable analysis, odds of in-hospital death was higher in patients with diabetes or coronary heart disease (table 3) . Age, lymphopenia, leucocytosis, and elevated ALT, lactate dehydrogenase, high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I, creatine kinase, d-dimer, serum ferritin, IL-6, prothrombin time, creatinine, and procalcitonin were also associated with death (table 3) .","In total, 36 COVID-19 patients with invasive mechanical ventilation were enrolled in the study. Table 1 showed the baseline characteristics of the cohort patients. There were 30 men (83.3%) and 6 women (16.7%), ranging in age from 44 and 86 years. Common comorbidity factors in COVID-19 patients with invasive mechanical ventilation were hypertension (n=14, 38.9%) and cardiac disease (n=12, 33.3%). The mean/median level of inflammatory markers (including white blood cell count, neutrophil count, hCRP, procalcitonin, and ferritin) and cardiac injury biomarkers (including hs-cTnI and NT-proBNP) were higher than normal.","In mice, measurements of airway function are now feasible, and we measured sRaw in unanesthetized animals because anesthesia affects the airway response. 32 However, it has been questioned that in the airway resistance measurement that uses whole body plethysmography while the animals breathed through the nose, sRaw is dominated by the upper airway resistance. 33 Recently, Hamelmann et al 34 demonstrated that an index of airway resistance (Penh) by body plethysmography which includes both the upper and lower airway is a valid indicator of bronchoconstriction in inhalation challenge through the nose. We confirmed that sRaw reflects the change in the lower airway resistance (Fig 3) . However, our absolute values of airway resistance calculated by assuming a functional residual capacity (FRC) of 1 mL are approximately 6 cm H 2 O/mL/s in the baseline and higher than the previously reported values, 34, 35 in which resistance was measured during mechanical ventilation after anesthesia was induced. Their methods of resistance measurement were different from ours. Their ventilation frequency and the magnitude of tidal ventilation were determined by each setting of a ventilator, and FRC was adjusted by controlling the end-expiratory pressure. Our mice breathed air spontaneously. Thus differences in method of resistance measurement, FRC, ventilation fre-quency, and tidal volume may affect the absolute values of resistance. Further studies may be needed for determination of precise values of airway resistance in mice.","The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03. 22.20041061 doi: medRxiv preprint respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) 6,10,11 . The clinical outcomes among pregnant women with SARS or MERS were worse than those occurring in non-pregnant women 6, 10 . However, our data suggest the contrary to Covid-19. Among the 33 pregnant women with confirmed Covid-19, 39.4% of women presented mild, 57.6% presented moderate, and 3% presented with severe symptoms. For most pregnant women (87.9%), oxygen therapy supplied via a nasal cannula or mask was sufficient for supportive care. Only one (3%) pregnant woman needed the use of mechanical ventilation. At the end of the follow-up, no pregnant women had severe complications or needed to be transferred to the ICU or died. Compared with the general population, in which 5.0% who were admitted to the ICU, 2.3% who needed mechanical ventilation, and 1.4% who died 12 , it seems that the severity and mortality rate of Covid-19 in pregnant women are lower.","In a retrospective observational study reporting on 309 adults who were critically ill with MERS, 2 almost half of patients (151 [49%]) were given corticosteroids (median hydrocortisone equivalent dose [ie, methylprednisolone 1:5, dexamethasone 1:25, prednisolone 1:4] of 300 mg/day). Patients who were given corticosteroids were more likely to require mechanical ventilation, vasopressors, and renal replacement therapy. After statistical adjustment for immortal time and indication biases, the authors concluded that administration of corticosteroids was not associated with a difference in 90-day mortality (adjusted odds ratio 0\u00b78, 95% CI 0\u00b75-1\u00b71; p=0\u00b712) but was associated with delayed clearance of viral RNA from respiratory tract secretions (adjusted hazard ratio 0\u00b74, 95% CI 0\u00b72-0\u00b77; p=0\u00b70005). However, these effect estimates have a high risk of error due to the probable presence of unmeasured confounders.","In the case series of 99 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 infection from Wuhan, oxygen was given to 76%, non-invasive ventilation in 13%, mechanical ventilation in 4%, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) in 3%, continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) in 9%, antibiotics in 71%, antifungals in 15%, glucocorticoids in 19% and intravenous immunoglobulin therapy in 27% [15]. Antiviral therapy consisting of oseltamivir, ganciclovir and lopinavir-ritonavir was given to 75% of the patients. The duration of non-invasive ventilation was 4\u201322 d [median 9 d] and mechanical ventilation for 3\u201320 d [median 17 d]. In the case series of children discussed earlier, all children recovered with basic treatment and did not need intensive care [17].","The clinical outcomes of patients who have TRALI differ considerably from the outcomes of patients who have all causes of ALI/ARDS. One of the largest case series in the TRALI literature reported the clinical outcomes of 36 patients at the Mayo Clinic in the mid-1980s, predating the use of low tidal volume ventilation in the management of patients who have ALI/ARDS [15] . In this investigation, three quarters of the patients required mechanical ventilation, and the vast majority of the patients had rapid clearance (!96 hours) of the pulmonary edema. Two of the 36 patients died, yielding a mortality of 6%. The rapid clearance of the pulmonary edema and mortality differ considerably from all-cause ALI/ARDS, which has an estimated mortality of 30% to 40% [16] .","In additional antiviral therapy, special attention should be paid to ventilator management and other supportive care. Similar to ARDS of any other cause, patients who require invasive mechanical ventilation should be treated with a low-tidalvolume strategy targeting 6 mL/kg of ideal body weight. [39] [40] [41] In cases of severe ARDS, consideration should be given to salvage therapies, including prone positioning and paralytic therapy for the first 48 hours following intubation. [42] [43] [44] Although noninvasive positive pressure ventilation has been tried in patients with ARDS, 45,46 reports from the 2009 H1N1 pandemic suggest that this strategy is not effective in patients with ARDS caused by influenza. 47 Patients with severe viral infection are at risk for secondary bacterial pneumonia, because of both the effects of the virus alone and the risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia from prolonged mechanical ventilation. 48, 49 Invasive tests, such as bronchoscopy, may be helpful to differentiate bacterial coinfection from viral pneumonia alone. 5, 50 In general, the empiric use of antibiotic therapy in patients with viral pneumonia should be avoided and may increase the risk of antibiotic resistance and subsequent nosocomial infection. 51,52 The use of intravenous corticosteroids in the treatment of ARDS has generally not improved outcomes. 53,54 In patients with ARDS related to influenza and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), adjunctive corticosteroids have not improved outcomes and may increase the risk subsequent nosocomial infection. 55, 56 Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) gained attention during the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic after several studies reported low mortality in patients with viral ARDS treated with this modality. 57, 58 The only randomized clinical trial that compared ARDS treatment with ECMO with conventional care, the CESAR trial, enrolled a significant proportion of patients with influenza. 59 However, this trial had several significant methodological limitations; in particular, more patients in the ECMO arm were treated with a low-tidalvolume ventilation strategy compared with patients in the conventional arm. In a retrospective matched cohort study of patients with influenza A (H1N1) and ARDS, the mortality in patients treated with ECMO was similar to propensity score-matched controls not treated with ECMO. 60 ","The two case series 56,57 were conducted in China and included 4 and 138 patients, respectively. All patients were hospitalized and initial diagnosis was made based on WHO Criteria later confirmed by lab-testing of the patient specimens. The case series included an approximately even number of male and female (55% v 45%) patients ranging in age from 19 to 68 years old, with a variety of co-morbidities including cardiovascular disease, chronic kidney or liver disease, COPD, and diabetes (Appendix 3). In one case series 57 , patients (n=4) were treated with a combination of lopinavir/ritonavir, Arbidol (umifenovir), antibiotics, Shufeng Jiedu Capsule (Traditional Chinese Medicine), and intravenous immunoglobulins (Appendix 4). At study end (15 days ),) two patients tested negative for COVID-19 and were subsequently discharged from the hospital and two patients remained hospitalized, one of whom still required mechanical ventilation (Appendix 4). In the larger case series 56 , 124 patients were treated with oseltamivir combined with antibiotic therapy in 89 patients and combined with glucocorticoids in 62 patients (Appendix 4). Over the course of the study, 34 patients treated with oseltamivir were admitted to the ICU, 17 of which required invasive mechanical ventilation. At study end (19 days),) 47 patients had been discharged and 6 patients died, all of whom had been admitted to ICU (Appendix 4).","There were 13 (28.9%) patients treated with high-flow nasal cannula, 6 (13.3%) with non-invasive mechanical ventilation, 20 (44.4%) with invasive mechanical ventilation. For patients with intubation, tidal volumes of 7.0 mL/kg predicted body weight was applied in accordance with lung protective ventilation strategy (17) . Recruitment maneuvers were administered in 6 patients (13.3%). A total of 5 patients (11.1%) received prone position ventilation. In addition, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) and continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) was applied in 9 (20.0%) and 4 (8.9%) patients, respectively. There were 15 (33.3%) patients administrated with vasoconstrictive agents, 19 (42.2%) with sedation and analgesia and 8 (17.8%) with neuromuscular blocking agents (table 4).","Recipients of HSCT have an overall rate of intensive care unit admission of 15.7%, and the most common cause for ICU admission is respiratory failure followed by shock secondary to sepsis. Independent risk factors for the requirement of assisted mechanical ventilation include older age, active malignancy at transplantation, and donor-recipient HLA mismatch. A review demonstrated that the pooled mortality in HSCT recipients requiring invasive mechanical ventilation is 86.4%. Noninvasive positive-pressure ventilation in select patients with reversible acute respiratory failure is used because observational studies show a survival benefit in HSCT recipients and patients with cancer. In critically ill HSCT recipients, it is also important to comply with the current evidence-based precepts of critical care medicine. For example, in patients with acute respiratory syndrome undergoing mechanical ventilation, a tidal volume of 6 mL/kg of ideal body weight should be targeted.","Improved diagnostics have demonstrated an expanded spectrum of disease that includes less severe cases than previously reported. We now understand that MERS-CoV causes an acute respiratory disease syndrome and one third of patients present with gastrointestinal symptoms [14]. Fever has been seen in 62\u201387 % of patients, cough in 55\u201387 %, and gastrointestinal symptoms in 26\u201335 %. Seventy-six to 96 % percent of patients have had comorbid illnesses, most commonly chronic renal failure, diabetes and heart disease [7\u201315]. This may be partially related to the epidemiology of increased disease transmission in healthcare settings rather than a true host risk factor. Laboratory findings have been non-specific and consistent with other viral infections. Thrombocytopenia (75 %) and lymphopenia (58 %) have been commonly described in these patients [7, 9\u201313, 15]. Forty three percent had acute kidney injury [7, 11\u201313, 17] and 76\u2013100 % had CXR abnormalities with bibasilar infiltrates as the most common finding [8\u201313, 15, 18]. The outcomes in these more severely ill patients remain poor. Between 50\u201390 % required ICU care [10, 11, 13, 15] and 67\u2013100 % in the ICU setting required invasive ventilation for a median of 7\u201316 days [8, 10, 12]. In addition to mechanical ventilation, several patients have received extracorpeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) to support ventilation. From non-randomized data from the World Health Organization, five out of six patients receiving ECMO died [9]. Fifty-eight to 75 % required renal replacement therapy [11, 12, 17] and 30\u201360 % of hospitalized patients died [7\u201315]. The severity of illness can be partially explained by the widespread lung disease caused by MERS-CoV and it appears that mortality in those patients requiring intensive care is extremely high. Although no autopsy data is available, in explanted lung, infection with MERS-CoV causes widespread infection and alveolar disease [19, 20].","Clinical efficacy of NPPV: NPPV can reduce the rate of tracheal intubation; therefore, theoretically, it can significantly reduce the risk of infection of medical personnel during tracheal intubation and artificial airway management for COVID-19 pneumonia patients. [7] A recent retrospective epidemiological study of 99 COVID-19 pneumonia patients in China [2] revealed that NPPV is the most commonly used mechanical ventilation method for acute respiratory failure. The rates of using non-invasive and invasive mechanical ventilation are 13% and 4%, respectively; however, the efficacies of these ventilation methods need to be further investigated. There are little clinical data on NPPV for SARS, [4, 5] of which most are small-sample, single-center retrospective studies from China, and the NPPV failure rate is approximately 20-40%. Cheung et al [8] in their study of 20 Hong Kong patients with SARS and acute respiratory failure (oxygen flow &gt;6 L/min, percutaneous oxygen saturation [SpO 2 ] 93-96%) revealed that NPPV could prevent tracheal intubation in 70% of patients and significantly reduce the time spent in the intensive care unit (ICU). Reports on NPPV for the treatment of MERS are also limited. [9] Because the degree of lung and extrapulmonary injuries in patients with MERS are significantly higher than that in patients without MERS, [9] the failure rate of NPPV is relatively high (60-70%). In addition, current evidence and clinical guideline [10] do not recommend NPPV for treating acute hypoxic respiratory failure and pandemic viral illness. Therefore, we believe that NPPV should currently not be used as a first-line treatment to correct respiratory failure in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. For strictly selected early-stage patients with mild-to-moderate (partial pressure of arterial oxygen [PaO2]/fraction of inspired oxygen [FiO 2 ] &gt; 200 mmHg) hypoxic respiratory failure and especially for units with limited numbers of invasive ventilators, it is recommended that NPPV be attempted for short periods of time (1-2 hours) [1, 8, 11] and to intubate immediately if no improvement is observed. In addition, early-stage identification of high-risk factors (shock, metabolic acidosis; multiple organ failure; PaO 2 /FiO 2 \u2264175 mmHg at 1 h after NPPV treatment; severe hypoxemia with PaO 2 /FiO 2 \u2264147 mmHg; Simplified Acute Physiology Score II [SAPS II] &gt;34; tidal volume [VT] &gt;9.5 mL/kg; elevated PaCO 2 ; respiratory rate &gt;30 breaths/min) for NPPV failure in the treatment of hypoxic respiratory failure can improve the safety of NPPV treatment. [11] NPPV should be avoided in patients with hemodynamic instability, multiple organ failure, disorders of consciousness, or mucus drainage disorders. [1] NPPV aerosol dispersion and disease transmission problems: Notably, NPPV can lead to aerosol transmission during use. In vitro simulation experiments have shown that NPPV can lead to the dispersion of exhaled aerosols within 1 m of patients. In addition, the dispersion range increases with increased air leakage and increased inspiratory pressure, [12, 13] such that the WHO considers NPPV to be an important form of aerosol transmission in patient wards. However, clinical studies on the use of NPPV for SARS did not clearly demonstrate that NPPV increases the risk of infection transmission between infected patients and medical staffs. [4, 8] Conversely, NPPV masks may also reduce aerosol exhalation during coughing and talking. [4, 5] Recent studies have shown that NPPV is a low-risk airborne route with good interface fitting. [1, 14] Therefore, it is still unclear whether NPPV increases the risk of aerosol diffusion and disease transmission, especially with respect to transmission to medical personnel. [4] The use of NPPV for COVID-19 pneumonia still requires strict control of the medical environment and vigilance and monitoring of the infection risk to medical personnel. Table 1 shows specific prevention and control measures for preventing aerosol production and disease transmission in patient wards during NPPV. [7, 15] Clinical efficacy of HFNC: HFNC is a new form of noninvasive respiratory support [16] that can be adjusted to a maximum gas flow of 60-80 L/min and a FiO 2 of 0.21-1.0. No clinical data exist regarding the use of HFNC for SARS, MERS, or COVID-19, and the clinical efficacy of HFNC needs to be further investigated. However, for patients with non-infectious mild-to-moderate hypoxic respiratory failure, compared with conventional oxygen therapy, HFNC can reduce the rate of tracheal intubation and mortality. [17] Therefore, HFNC treatment for COVID-19 pneumonia can be attempted when hypoxemia cannot be treated using conventional oxygen therapy devices, NPPV cannot be tolerated, or in the following situations [1] : mild-to-moderate hypoxemia (100 mmHg \u2264 PaO 2 /FiO 2 &lt; 300 mmHg); no indications for emergency tracheal intubation; and relatively stable vital signs. HFNC should be avoided in patients with hemodynamic instability, multiple organ failure, or disorders of consciousness. The therapeutic response should be closely monitored (1-2 hours) after HFNC treatment.","For secondary outcomes, including days in ICU and hospital, and days on mechanical ventilation, 3 RCTs reported relevant data showed non-significant reductions between H-IVIG/immune plasma group and control group (14, 17, 19) . A and B (15, 18) , decreases influenza B viral loads (15) and cytokines levels in H1N1 (17), there was no clinical benefit observed in patients receiving H-IVIG/immune plasma infusion.","The incubation period is two to seven days and approximately 95% will develop symptoms by 10 days. This is followed by an influenza like (ILI) prodrome (stage 1) of high fever (N 38\u00b0C), malaise, headache, myalgia and chills without upper respiratory tract symptoms. About 10% to 20% of patients have diarrhoea. The prodrome may last for three to seven days after which involvement of the LRT (stage 2) occurs and this begins with a non-productive cough and dyspnoea. This may progress to acute hypoxaemia with radiologic progression to pneumonia. About 20% of patients progress to stage 3 and develop features of ARDS that may require mechanical ventilation. The chest radiograph shows diffuse interstitial infiltrates characteristics of ARDS. Risk factors for poor outcomes include older age, underlying comorbidities such as diabetes, atypical symptoms and elevated lactate dehydrogenase on admission [18, 19] .","There are few robust randomised controlled trials to guide the choice of mode of mechanical ventilation. The authors of a 2015 Cochrane review, summarising three randomised controlled trials consisting of 1089 patients in total, concluded that evidence was insuffi cient to promote the use of either volume-controlled or pressurecontrolled ventilation over the other. 99 Airway-pressurerelease ventilation is used for its ability to maintain a high mean airway pressure-and thus maintain alveolar recruitment-while permitting spontaneous ventilation. Unfortunately, the evidence base is limited by suboptimum control groups in the studies done and concerns about possible high tidal volume and mean airway pressure. 100 Non-invasive ventilation can be tried in mild acute respiratory distress syndrome. A small study 101 of 40 patients showed reduced requirement for invasive mechanical ventilation and a non-signifi cant reduction in mortality with this approach. This result should be tempered by those of a much larger meta-analysis of 540 patients, documenting failure of non-invasive ventilation in almost 50% of patients. 102 The advent of high-fl ow nasal oxygen allows for simpler, more tolerable respiratory support. In an observational study, 18 (40%) of 45 patients with moderate acute respiratory distress syndrome (mean PaO 2 /FiO 2 137 mm Hg) treated with high-fl ow nasal oxygen required invasive mechanical ventilation. 103 As with non-invasive ventilation, more severe illness was associated with an increasing likelihood of treatment failure.","Tidal liquid ventilation is a technique of respiratory support during which gaseous functional residual capacity (FRC) and tidal volume are replaced with a perfluorocarbon (PFC) liquid. 121 Liquid ventilation has been shown to improve lung mechanics and ventilation-perfusion matching effectively, decrease intrapulmonary shunt, and thereby support pulmonary gas exchange and cardiovascular stability in animal models of ALI/ARDS. [122] [123] [124] Moreover, studies have demonstrated that partial liquid ventilation (during which the lung FRC is partially or completely filled with PFC, and gaseous tidal breaths are delivered) and tidal liquid ventilation are associated with a decrease in oxidative lung damage in animal models of ARDS/ALI. 125, 126 A prospective randomized controlled trial of partial liquid ventilation compared with conventional mechanical ventilation in adult patients with ARDS/ALI failed to show a significant improvement in the number of ventilator-free days or in mortality in patients treated with partial liquid ventilation. 127 In addition, transient and self-limited episodes of bradycardia, hypoxia, and respiratory acidosis occurred more frequently in the group treated with partial liquid ventilation. In summary, although liquid ventilation may be more effective than conventional mechanical ventilation in selected laboratory models, this advantage has not been shown in clinical studies.","The risks of death, ICU admission and mechanical ventilation were stratified by study design and are shown in Fig. 4, in which the pooled estimate for each study design was compared. The risk of death in the hospital outbreak and surveillance studies was significantly smaller than in ICU case and retrospective studies. Risks of ICU admission and mechanical ventilation were the highest among ICU case studies, followed by case report and retrospective studies. Hospital outbreak studies yielded the smallest pooled risks of ICU admission and mechanical ventilation. When comparing surveillance-based data between KSA and ROK (Fig. 2), the risk of death in ROK (i.e., 14.5\u201322.0% [8, 33, 34]) tended to be lower than that in KSA (i.e., 46.0% by Alsahafi and Cheng [35]), perhaps reflecting the presence of the contact tracing effort in the ROK. "," Treatment principle: based on symptomatic treatment, actively prevent and treat complications, treat basic diseases, prevent secondary infection, and timely apply organ function support.Respiratory support: apply noninvasive mechanical ventilation for two hours, if the condition is not improved, or the patient is intolerable to noninvasive ventilation, accompanied with increased airway secretions, severe coughing, or unstable hemodynamics, the patient should be transferred to invasive mechanical ventilation in time. The \u201clung-protective ventilation strategy\u201d with low tidal volume should be adopted in invasive mechanical ventilation to reduce ventilator-associated lung injury. If necessary, ventilation in the prone position, recruitment maneuver, or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) can be used.Circulation support: improve microcirculation based on full fluid resuscitation, use vasoactive drugs, and apply hemodynamic monitoring if necessary.Others: according to the degree of dyspnea and the progress of chest imaging, use glucocorticoids appropriately for a short time (3\u20135 days) with the recommended dose no more than what is equivalent to methylprednisolone 1\u20132 mg/kg\u00b7day. ","In The Lancet, Fei Zhou and colleagues 2 provide further insight into the clinical course and mortality risk for adults with COVID-19 severe enough to require hospitalisation. They report findings from 191 patients with COVID-19 from Wuhan during the first month of the outbreak, and follow them through to discharge (n=137) or death (n=54). The follow-up until discharge or death is a point of difference from other case series to date. Their cohort had many characteristics in common with other reports 3-5 -a median age of 56\u00b70 years (IQR 46\u00b70-67\u00b70), a high percentage (62%) of men, and nearly half (48%) of patients with comorbidities. In-hospital death was associated with, on admission, older age (odds ratio 1\u00b710, 95% CI 1\u00b703-1\u00b717; p=0\u00b70043), a higher Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score (5\u00b765, 2\u00b761-12\u00b723; p&lt;0\u00b70001), and blood d-dimer greater than 1 \u03bcg/mL (18\u00b742, 2\u00b764-128\u00b755; p=0\u00b70033), findings known to be associated with severe pneumonia. 6, 7 The study also presents early data on changes in clinical and laboratory findings over time, which could help clinicians to identify patients who progress to more severe disease. In-hospital mortality was high (28%), much higher than in other reports that had incomplete follow-up data, 3, 5, 8 and was very high among the 32 patients requiring invasive mechanical ventilation, of whom 31 (97%) died. This might reflect a higher proportion of patients admitted with severe disease in the early stages of the outbreak. In another report from Wuhan, mortality was 62% among critically ill patients with COVID-19 and 81% among those requiring mechanical ventilation. 9 While the world awaits further information from other locations, including from outside China, the current message is that mortality is high among the minority of people with COVID-19 who get severe disease.","In this study, we reported a case series of pregnant women with Covid-19 and newborns born to these women. The primary composite endpoint occurred in one (3%) pregnant woman who needed the use of mechanical ventilation, while no pregnant women admitted to the ICU or died. For the secondary outcomes, the percentages of pregnant women with mild, moderate, and severe symptoms were 13 (39.4%),19(57.6%), and 1(3%). One (3.6%) newborn developed ARDS and was admitted to the NICU. There were no moralities among newborns.","Laboratory indexes of blood sample, liver function, inflammation index, renal function and myocardial enzyme were carried out at Medical Inspection Department of the First Affiliated Hospital, College of Medicine at Zhejiang University. Factors which are possible to correlate to clinical features and therapeutic outcomes in H7N9 patients with ARDS were analyzed: 1) baseline characteristics including age, underlying conditions, and symptoms; 2) data from the laboratory examination and imaging scan; 3) Combined treatments by basic therapy, antiviral therapy, antibiotic therapy, vasoactive drugs, glucocorticoid therapy, mechanical ventilation, ECMO, ALSS, and CRRT.","Accurate incidence outcomes reporting for pediatric ARDS are limited by the changing definition for ARDS. Studies using the 1994 American European Consensus Conference (AECC) definition (2) outlined epidemiology and outcomes for both acute lung injury (ALI) and ARDS as separate entities (6). However, both the Berlin definition (3) and the PALICC recommendations (5) no longer identify ALI as a separate entity, instead categorizing ARDS as mild, moderate, or severe. Since these guidelines are recent, few studies have been conducted to determine the incidence of ARDS utilizing these new criteria (7, 8). In addition, management for ARDS has also changed over the years, with improved outcomes demonstrated with lung-protective mechanical ventilation strategies (9, 10).","Supportive therapy includes bedrest, adequate nutrition, monitoring vital signs and oxygen saturation, prevention of dehydration and maintaining water, electrolyte, and acid-base balance. For severe cases, it may be necessary to proactively prevent complications and secondary Y. Yang, et al. Journal of Autoimmunity xxx (xxxx) xxxx infections, treat underlying diseases and provide organ function support according to the patients' condition such as that reported by Chen et all that involved the administration of intravenous immunoglobulin therapy to 27 of such patients [37] . Supplemental oxygen should be administered to patients with decreased oxygen saturation. In Huang's study [26] , four (10%) patients needed invasive mechanical ventilation, and two received extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). In Chen's study [37] , 75 of 99 patients received oxygen therapy, 13 patients required non-invasive mechanical ventilation, four patients needed an invasive ventilator to assist ventilation, and three patients were treated with ECMO. In Wang's study [83] , of the 36 patients in the ICU, four patients received high-flow oxygen therapy, 15 patients received non-invasive ventilation, and 17 patients received invasive ventilation (four patients switched to ECMO). In Guan's study, 418 of 1099 patients received oxygen therapy, 67 patients received mechanical ventilation, and ECMO was adopted in 5 severe cases [85] .","Radiation Oncologists will also have to prepare for treatment interruptions caused by development of COVID-19 in cancer patients. Patients who test positive for the novel coronavirus will, at a minimum, require a 14-day quarantine per CDC recommendations. 15 At the other end of the spectrum, cancer patients with immunosuppression may require hospitalization and isolation precautions, thereby preventing the continuation of radiation treatments. Data from a report of the clinical characteristics of patients with COVID-19 showed that 6.1% of patients required intensive care, mechanical ventilation or died. 16 Although it is yet unclear how the virus will behave in the US, the situations in China and Italy suggest the burden on hospitals and intensive care units will be significant. Additionally, this study demonstrated that pneumonia and lymphocytopenia were prominent at 91.1% and 83.2%, respectively, which would impact decisions to hold off on treatments pending improvements in the patient's clinical status and immune recovery. 16 These treatment interruptions would be of utmost concern in tumors for which treatment package time significantly impacts outcomes such as head and neck and cervical tumors. 17, 18 However, this is also of concern in lung tumors and other thoracic tumors, for both tumor control and the lungs potentially lying in the path of treatment beams. Treatments would likely need to be paused while monitoring the course of COVID-19 in this setting. Treatment delays may also be due strains on the healthcare system in the setting of a pandemic due to travel restrictions, availability of workforce, and/or lack of access to hospital care. 19 If possible, travel restrictions for the general public should be tailored for patients with cancer, such as being done currently in Italy. 20 Little data exists currently to guide radiation treatment decisions in the setting of a pandemic. However, we may borrow insight from the response of Radiation Oncology clinics during Hurricane Maria. As per Gay et al, mitigating the impact of a natural disaster on cancer patients requires 4 components or \"PCOC\": prepare, communicate, operate, compensate. 21 In preparing, consideration should be made for scenarios which may require delayed treatment starts, or shorter fractionation regimens (i.e. hypofractionation), given that COVID-19 poses a substantial immediate risk for elderly patients. Again, there is a paucity of data to guide these decisions and priority should be given to higher risk tumors (H&amp;N, Cervix, Lung, etc.), which are nicely referenced in the Hurricane Maria review. Overall, the immediate risk of COVID-19 will have to be weighed against the long-term risks associated with their specific cancer diagnosis."],"title":["Pneumothorax and mortality in the mechanically

RESULTS Thirty-three pregnant women with Covid-19 and 28 newborns were identified. One (3%) pregnant woman needed the use of mechanical ventilation. No pregnant women admitted to the ICU. There were no moralities among pregnant women or newborns. The percentages of pregnant women...","Abstract Since its outbreak in December 2019, a series of clinical trials on Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) have been registered or carried out. However, the significant heterogeneity and less critical outcomes of such trials may be leading to a waste of research resources. This study aimed to develop a core outcome set (COS) for clinical trials on COVID-19 in order to tackle the outcome issues. The study was conducted according to the Core Outcome Measures in Effectiveness Trials (COMET) handbook (version 1.0), a guideline for COS development. A research group was set up that included experts in respiratory and critical medicine, traditional Chinese medicine, evidence-based medicine, clinical pharmacology, and statistics, in addition to medical journal editors. Clinical trial registry websites (chictr.org.cn and clinicaltrials.gov) were searched to retrieve clinical trial protocols and outcomes in order to form an outcome pool. A total of 78 clinical trial protocols on COVID-19 w...","COVID-19 is a coronavirus outbreak that initially appeared in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, in December 2019, but it has already evolved into a pandemic spreading rapidly worldwide(1,2). As of 18 March 2020, a total number of 194909 cases of COVID-19 have been reported, including 7876 deaths, the majority of which have been reported in China (3242) and Italy (2505)(3). However, as the pandemic is still unfortunately under progression, there are limited data with regard to the clinical characteristics of the patients as well as to their prognostic factors(4). Smoking, to date, has been assumed to be possibly associated with adverse disease prognosis, as extensive evidence has highlighted the negative impact of tobacco use on lung health and its causal association with a plethora of respiratory diseases(5). Smoking is also detrimental to the immune system and its responsiveness to infections, making smokers more vulnerable to infectious diseases(6). Previous studies have shown that smoke...","Background\uff1aIn January 19, 2020, first case of 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) pneumonia (COVID-19) was confirmed in Chongqing municipality, China.

More data were needed to understand the clinical characteristics of the disease. Objectives: To study the epidemiology, clinical features and outcomes of patients with COVID-19. Methods: we performed a single center, retrospective case series study in 221 patients with laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia at a university hospital. Measurements and Main Results: The median age was 55.0 years and 48.9% were male and only 8 (3.6%) patients had a history of exposure to the Huanan Seafood Market. Compared to the non-severe pneumonia patients, the median age of the severe patients was significantly older, and they were more likely to have chronic comorbidities. Most common symptoms in severe patients were high fever, anorexia and dyspnea. On admission, 33.0% patients showed le...","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic that originated in Wuhan, China has spread to more than 60 countries. We estimated the age-specific case fatality ratio (CFR) by fitting a transmission model to data from China, accounting for underreporting of cases and the time delay to death. Overall CFR among all infections was 1.6% (1.4-1.8%) and increased considerably for the elderly, highlighting the expected burden for populations with further expansion of the COVID-19 epidemic around the globe.","OBJECTIVE: Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is an emerging and easily clustering infectious disease. We describe an outbreak of SARS in a chest ward of a medical center in southern Taiwan and seek to identify the risk factors of those SARS patients who required mechanical ventilation. We focus on previous health patients. DESIGN: This retrospective case series was collected during the SARS outbreak. Degrees of severity were established, based on whether intubation and mechanical ventilation was necessary. SETTING: A 2500-bed medical center in southern Taiwan. PATIENTS: Forty-four patients exhibited symptoms that met the modified World Health Organization (WHO) definition of SARS. These included of three subgroups: health-care workers (n=16), relatives (n=14), and patients already admitted for other ailments (n=14). Of these, 20 eventually required mechanical ventilation. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Laboratory analyses showed statistically significant differences between intubated...","INTRODUCTION: Pneumothorax often complicates the management of mechanically ventilated severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) patients in the isolation intensive care unit (ICU). We sought to determine whether pneumothoraces are induced by high ventilatory pressure or volume and if they are associated with mortality in mechanically ventilated SARS patients. METHODS: We conducted a prospective, clinical study. Forty-one mechanically ventilated SARS patients were included in our study. All SARS patients were sedated and received mechanical ventilation in the isolation ICU. RESULTS: The mechanically ventilated SARS patients were divided into two groups either with or without pneumothorax. Their demographic data, clinical characteristics, ventilatory variables such as positive end-expiratory pressure, peak inspiratory pressure, mean airway pressure, tidal volume, tidal volume per kilogram, respiratory rate and minute ventilation and the accumulated mortality rate at 30 days after mechani...","Background The illness progress of partial patient of COVID-19 is rapid and the mortality rate is high.we aim to describe the clinical features in death cases with COVID-19.

The blood type distributi...","Background: A range of case fatality ratio (CFR) estimates for COVID 19 have been produced that differ substantially in magnitude. Methods: We used individual-case data from mainland China and cases detected outside mainland China to estimate the time between onset of symptoms and outcome (death or discharge from hospital). We next obtained age-stratified estimates of the CFR by relating the aggregate distribution of cases by dates of onset to the observed cumulative deaths in China, assuming a constant attack rate by age and adjusting for the demography of the population, and age and location-based under ascertainment. We additionally estimated the CFR from individual linelist data on 1,334 cases identified outside mainland China. We used data on the PCR prevalence in international residents repatriated from China at the end of January 2020 to obtain age-stratified estimates of the infection fatality ratio (IFR). Using data on age stratified severity in a subset of 3,665 cases from Ch...","Objective To determine the correlation between menstruation status/sex hormones and prognosis of COVID-19, and to identify potential protective factors for female patients. Design, Setting, and Participants A cross-sectional study of COVID-19 patients who were hospitalized at Tongji and Mobile Cabin Hospitals from Jan 28, 2020 to March 8, 2020. Sex differences in severity and composite endpoints (admission to intensive care unit (ICU), use of mechanical ventilation, or death) of COVID-19 patients were compared. The correlation analysis and cox/logistic regression modeling of menstruation status/sex hormones and prognosis were conducted.

Duration of fever, cough relief time and auxiliary oxygen therapy or noninvasive mechanical ventilation rate were the secondary outcomes. The patients with chest CT imaging and laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 infection, aged 18 years or older were randomly assigned to receive favipiravir or arbidol. Safety data w...","With the increasing threat of pandemic influenza and catastrophic bioterrorism, it is important for intensive care providers to be prepared to meet the challenge of large-scale airborne epidemics causing mass casualty respiratory failure. The severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak exposed the vulnerability of health care workers and highlighted the importance of establishing stringent infection control and crisis management protocols. Patients who have acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome who require mechanical ventilation should receive a lung protective, low tidal volume strategy. Controversy remains regarding the use of high-frequency oscillatory ventilation and noninvasive positive pressure ventilation. Standard, contact, and airborne precautions should be instituted in intensive care units, with special care taken when aerosol-generating procedures are performed.","Different forms of lung injury can activate senescence pathways. Senescence has been involved in chronic lung diseases, but its role in the acute phase is less known. Acute lung injury activates a large variety of pathogenetic mechanisms that can lead to respiratory insufficiency. In some cases, mechanical ventilation may help to maintain gas exchange, but positive airway pressures can cause regional overdistension of alveolar units and further damage. Here, we report that acute lung injury and alveolar overstretching activate a lung senescent program aimed to limit apoptosis. A systematic pooling of transcriptomic data from animal models of lung injury demonstrates the enrichment of a specific senescence signature. In a clinically relevant, murine model of acid aspiration and mechanical ventilation, we observed the activation of the Tp53/Cdkn1a (p21) senescence pathway, increases in senescence-associated heterochromatin foci in alveolar cells and markers of DNA damage, chromatin reorg...","BACKGROUND: While the risk of severe complications of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and its determinants have been explored in previous studies, a systematic analysis of published articles with different designs and populations has yet to be conducted. The present study aimed to systematically review the risk of death associated with MERS as well as risk factors for associated complications. METHODS: PubMed and Web of Science databases were searched for clinical and epidemiological studies on confirmed cases of MERS. Eligible articles reported clinical outcomes, especially severe complications or death associated with MERS. Risks of admission to intensive care unit (ICU), mechanical ventilation and death were estimated. Subsequently, potential associations between MERS-associated death and age, sex, underlying medical conditions and study design were explored. RESULTS: A total of 25 eligible articles were identified. The case fatality risk ranged from 14.5 to 100%, with the p...","Background: To investigate the prevalence and outcomes of acute gastrointestinal injury (AGI) in critically ill patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Methods: In this clinical retrospective study, demographic data, laboratory parameters, AGI grades, clinical severity and outcomes were collected.

To date, the clinical characteristics of COVID-19-infected cancer patients are largely unknown. Patients and methods In this retrospective cohort study, we included cancer patients with laboratory confirmed COVID-19 from three designated hospitals in Wuhan, China. The clinical data were collected from medical records from Jan 13, 2020, to Feb 26, 2020. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to assess the risk factors associated with severe events defined as a condition requiring admission to an intensive care unit, the use of mechanical ventilation, or death. Results 28 COVID-19-infected cancer patients were included; 17 (60.7%) patients were male. Median age was 65.0 years (IQR:56.0-70.0). Lung cancer was the most frequent cancer type (7, 25.0%). 8 (28.6%) patients were suspected to be from hospital-associated transmission. The followi...","Objectives: To examine heterogeneity of outcomes in protocols of clinical trials of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) and to identify outcomes for prioritization in developing a core outcome set (COS) in this field.

We sought to delineate the clinical characteristics of these cases. Methods: We extracted the data on 1,099 patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV ARD from 552 hospitals in 31 provinces/provincial municipalities through January 29th, 2020. Results: The median age was 47.0 years, and 41.90% were females. Only 1.18% of patients had a direct contact with wildlife, whereas 31.30% had been to Wuhan and 71.80% had contacted with people from Wuhan. Fever (87.9%) and cough (67.7%) were the most common symptoms. Diarrhea is uncommon. The median incubation period was 3.0 days (range, 0 to 24.0 days). On admission, ground-glass opacity was the typical radiological finding on chest computed tomography (50.00%). Significantly more severe cases were diagnosed by symptoms plus reverse-transcriptase polymerase-chain-reaction without...","Summary Acute respiratory distress syndrome presents as hypoxia and bilateral pulmonary infiltrates on chest imaging in the absence of heart failure sufficient to account for this clinical state. Management is largely supportive, and is focused on protective mechanical ventilation and the avoidance of fluid overload. Patients with severe hypoxaemia can be managed with early short-term use of neuromuscular blockade, prone position ventilation, or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. The use of inhaled nitric oxide is rarely indicated and both \u03b22 agonists and late corticosteroids should be avoided. Mortality remains at approximately 30%.","Background: The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) continues to expand across the world. Though both the number of cases and mortality rate in children and adolescents is reported to be low in comparison to adults, limited data has been reported on the outbreak with respect to pediatric patients. To elucidate information, we utilized crowdsourced data to perform a preliminary epidemiologic analysis of pediatric patients with COVID-19 Methods: In this observational study, data was collected from two open-access, line list crowdsourced online databases. Pediatric cases of COVID-19 were defined as patients \u226419 years of age with a laboratory confirmed diagnosis. The primary outcomes were case counts and cumulative case counts. Secondary outcomes included days between symptoms onset and first medical care and days between first medical care and reporting. Tertiary outcomes were rate of travel to Wuhan, rate of infected family members and rates of symptoms. Results: A total of 8...","The need for accurate statistics has never been felt so deeply as the novel COVID-19 pathogen spreads around the world and quantifying its severity is a primary clinical and public health issue. In Italy, the magnitude and increasing trend of the case-fatality risk (CFR) is fueling the already high levels of public alarm. In this paper, we highlight that the widely used crude CFR is an inaccurate measure of the disease severity since the pandemic is still unfolding. With the goal to improve its comparability over time and across countries at this stage, we then propose a demographic adjustment of the CFR that addresses the bias arising from differential case ascertainment by age. When applied to publicly released data for Italy, we show that until March 16 our adjusted CFR was similar to that of Wuhan, the most affected Chinese region, where COVID-19 has now been contained. This indicates that our adjusted CFR improves its comparability over time, making an important tool to chart the ...","Resumen Introducci\u00f3n Las t\u00e9cnicas moleculares han permitido un mejor conocimiento de la etiolog\u00eda de las infecciones respiratorias infantiles.

Through experience with the first 11 patients, we were able to finalise standard dose regimens, including pulsed methylprednisolone. One patient recovered on antibacterial treatment alone, 17 showed rapid and sustained responses, and 13 achieved improvement with step-up or pulsed methylprednisolone. Four patients required short periods of non-invasive ventilation. No patient required intubation or mechanical ventilation. There was no mortality or treatment morbidity in this series.","","Background: To control COVID\u221219 outbreak in Japan, sports and entertainment events were canceled in Japan for two weeks from 26 February to 11 March. It has been designated as voluntary event cancellation (VEC). Object: This study predicts the effectiveness of VEC enduring and after its implementation. Method: We applied a simple susceptible\u2212infected\u2212recovery model to data of patients with symptoms in Japan during 14 January to VEC introduction and after VEC introduction to 8 March. We adjusted the reporting delay in the latest few days. Results: Results suggest that the basic reproduction number, R0, before VEC introduced as 2.50 with a 95% confidence interval (CI) was [2.43, 2.55] and the effective reproduction number, Rv, after VEC introduced as 1. 88; its 95% CI was [1.68,2.02]. Discussion and Conclusion: Results demonstrated that VEC can reduce COVID\u221219 infectiousness by 35%, but R0 remains higher than one.","Background: To control COVID\u221219 outbreak in Japan, sports and entertainment events were canceled in Japan for two weeks from 26 February to 13 March.

As such, data are urgently needed about risk factors associated with clinical outcomes. Methods A retrospective chart review of 323 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in Wuhan was conducted. Patients were classified into three disease severity groups (non-severe, severe, and critical), based on their initial clinical presentation. Clinical outcomes were designated as favorable and unfavorable, based on disease progression and response to treatments. Logistic regression models were performed to identify factors associated with clinical outcomes, and logrank test was conducted for the association with clinical progression. Results Current standard treatments did not show significant improvement on patient outcomes in the study. By univariate logistic regression model, 27 risk factors were significantly associated with clinical outcomes. ...","Abstract Objectives. To describe the clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). Methods. Between March 28 and June 30 '2003, 29 patients with probable SARS seen at Shin Kong Wu Ho-Su Memorial Hospital, Taipei, were analysed. Results. Presenting symptoms included fever (100%), cough (69.0%), chills or rigor (62.1%), and shortness of breath (41.4%). Mean days to defervescence were 6.8\u00b12.9 days, but fever recurred in 15 patients (51.7%) at 10.9\u00b13.4 days. Common laboratory features included lymphopenia (72.4%), thrombocytopenia (34.5%) and elevated C-reactive protein (CRP), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (93.1, 62.1, 44.8%, respectively). All patients except one had initial abnormal chest radiographs and 20 (69.0%) had radiological worsening at 7.5\u00b12.6 days. Nine patients (31.0%) subsequently required mechanical ventilation with four deaths (13.8%). Most patients with clinical deterioration responded t...","Approximately 20% of patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) develop respiratory failure that requires admission to an intensive care unit (ICU). Old age, comorbidity, and elevated lactate dehydrogenase on hospital admission are associated with increased risk for ICU admission. ICU admission usually is late and occurs 8 to 10 days after symptom onset. Acute respiratory distress syndrome occurs in almost all admitted patients and most require mechanical ventilation. ICU admission is associated with significant morbidity, particularly an apparent increase in the incidence of barotrauma and nosocomial sepsis. Long-term mortality for patients admitted to the ICU ranges from 30% to 50%. Many procedures in ICUs pose a high risk for transmission of SARS coronavirus to health care workers. Contact and airborne infection isolation precautions, in addition to standard precautions, should be applied when caring for patients with SARS. Ensuring staff safety is important to maintain ...","Since late December 2019 a new epidemic outbreak has emerged from Whuhan, China. Rapidly the new coronavirus has spread worldwide. China CDC has reported results of a descriptive exploratory analysis of all cases diagnosed until the 11th February 2020, presenting the epidemiologic curves and geo-temporal spread of COVID-19 along with case fatality rate according to some baseline characteristics, such as age, gender and several well-established high prevalence comorbidities. Despite this, we intend to increase even further the predictive value of that manuscript by presenting the odds ratio for mortality due to COVID-19 adjusted for the presence of those comorbidities and baseline characteristics such as age and gender. Besides, we present a way to determine the risk of each particular patient, given his characteristics. We found that age is the variable that presents higher risk of COVID-19 mortality, where 60 or older patients have an OR = 18.8161 (CI95%[7.1997; 41.5517]). Regarding c...","Background In December 2019, novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) infected pneumonia occurred in Wuhan, China. The number of cases has increased rapidly but information on the clinical characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia without comorbidities compared to normal controls in Chinese Han population is limited. Our objective is to describe the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia without comorbidities compared to normal controls in the Chinese Han population. Methods Retrospective, multi-center case series of the 69 consecutive hospitalized patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, from February 7 to February 28, 2020; final date of follow-up was February 29, 2020. Results The study population included 69 hospitalized patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia without comorbidities and 14,117 normal controls. 50.7% patients were male and 49.3% were female; 1.5% patients were asymptomatic cases, 63.8% patients were mild cases, and 36.2% patients were seve...","Objectives: To study the effectiveness of noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) in the treatment of acute respiratory failure (ARF) in severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), and the associated infection risk. Methods: All patients with the diagnosis of probable SARS admitted to a regional hospital in Hong Kong from March 9 to April 28, 2003, and who had SARS-related respiratory distress complications were recruited for NIPPV usage. The health status of all health-care workers working in the NIPPV wards was closely monitored, and consent was obtained to check serum for coronavirus serology. Patient outcomes and the risk of SARS transmission to health-care workers were assessed. Results: NIPPV was applied to 20 patients (11 male patients) with ARF secondary to SARS. Mean age was 51.4 years, and mean acute physiology and chronic health evaluation II score was 5.35. Coronavirus serology was positive in 95% (19 of 20 patients). NIPPV was started 9.6 days (mean) from symptom o...","Adjusting for delay from confirmation-to-death, we estimated case and infection fatality ratios (CFR, IFR) for COVID-19 on the Diamond Princess ship as 2.3% (0.75%-5.3%) and 1.2% (0.38-2.7%). Comparing deaths onboard with expected deaths based on naive CFR estimates using China data, we estimate IFR and CFR in China to be 0.5% (95% CI: 0.2-1.2%) and 1.1% (95% CI: 0.3-2.4%) respectively.","Summary Indoor ventilation with good air quality control minimises the spread of airborne respiratory and other infections in hospitals. This article considers the role of ventilation in preventing and controlling infection in hospital general wards and identifies a simple and cost-effective ventilation design capable of reducing the chances of cross-infection. Computational fluid dynamic (CFD) analysis is used to simulate and compare the removal of microbes using a number of different ventilation systems. Instead of the conventional corridor air return arrangement used in most general wards, air return is rearranged so that ventilation is controlled from inside the ward cubicle. In addition to boosting the air ventilation rate, the CFD results reveal that ventilation performance and the removal of microbes can be significantly improved. These improvements are capable of matching the standards maintained in a properly constructed isolation room, though at much lower cost. It is recomme...","Abstract Introduction Influenza is a common respiratory infectious disease affecting population worldwide yearly.

The number of affected pregnant women is increasing, but scarce information is available about the clinical features of COVID-19 in pregnancy. This study aimed to clarify the clinical features and obstetric and neonatal outcomes of pregnant patients with COVID-19. Methods In this retrospective, single-centre study, we included all pregnant women with COVID-19 who were admitted to Tongji Hospital in Wuhan, China. Clinical features, treatments, and maternal and fetal outcomes were assessed. Findings Seven patients, admitted to Tongji Hospital from Jan 1, to Feb 8, 2020, were included in our study. The mean age of the patients was 32 years (range 29\u201334 years) and the mean gestational age was 39 weeks plus 1 day (range 37 weeks to 41 weeks plus 2 days). Clinical manifestations were fever (six [86%] patients), cough (one [1...","Background: The coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) pandemic threatens to overwhelm the healthcare resources of the country, but also poses a personal hazard to healthcare workers, including physicians. To address the potential impact of excluding physicians with a high risk of adverse outcomes based on age, we evaluated the current patterns of age of licensed physicians across the United States. Methods: We compiled information from the 2018 database of actively licensed physicians in the Federation of State Medical Boards (FSMB) across the US. Both at a national- and the state-level, we assessed the number and proportion of physicians who would be at an elevated risk due to age over 60 years. Results: Of the 985,026 licensed physicians in the US, 235857 or 23.9% were aged 25-40 years, 447052 or 45.4% are 40-60 years, 191794 or 19.5% were 60-70 years, and 106121 or 10.8% were 70 years or older. Age was not reported in 4202 or 0.4% of physicians. Overall, 297915 or 30.2% of physicians we...","BACKGROUND: Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is a viral respiratory disease. Most people infected with MERS-CoV develop severe acute respiratory illness. It was first reported in Saudi Arabia in 2012 and has since spread to several other countries. We report the clinical course of MERS-CoV infection in a pregnant woman who acquired the infection during the last trimester. CASE PRESENTATION: The patient is a 33-year-old female working as a critical care nurse. She was 32 weeks pregnant when she presented with respiratory symptoms after direct contact with a MERS-COV patient. Although the patient was in respiratory failure, necessitated mechanical ventilation, and intensive care (ICU) admission, a healthy infant was delivered. The mother recovered. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported case of a laboratory-confirmed Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus in a pregnant woman. CONCLUSIONS: Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-Co...","Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) has caused a major epidemic worldwide. A novel coronavirus is deemed to be the causative agent. Early diagnosis can be made with reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) of nasopharyngeal aspirate samples. We compared symptoms of 156 SARS-positive and 62 SARS-negative patients in Hong Kong; SARS was confirmed by RT-PCR. The RT-PCR\u2013positive patients had significantly more shortness of breath, a lower lymphocyte count, and a lower lactate dehydrogenase level; they were also more likely to have bilateral and multifocal chest radiograph involvement, to be admitted to intensive care, to need mechanical ventilation, and to have higher mortality rates. By multivariate analysis, positive RT-PCR on nasopharyngeal aspirate samples was an independent predictor of death within 30 days."],"title":["Effect of continuous renal replacement therapy on
