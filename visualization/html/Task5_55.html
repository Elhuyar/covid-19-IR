in the near future the surge capacity that is a health care system's ability to rapidly expand beyond normal services to meet the increased demand for qualified personnel, medical care, and public health in the event of largescale public health emergencies or disasters, should be strengthened. Therefore, a host of issues including education, communication, and institutional response require innovative solutions. For this purpose, innovative educational programs to create and maintain the readiness of an appropriately trained workforce are necessary in order to help HCWs change their focus from the traditional clinically oriented view of infectious disease treatment to a more integrated, problem solving, infection control management approach.","We produced a document that described our strategy for supporting high-quality palliative care under conventional capacity, contingency capacity, and crisis capacity. Table 1 depicts the strategy for the Emergency Department, Table 2 for the Intensive Care Units, and During the drafting of this content other topics that needed consideration were identified, including the fact that palliative care specialty staffing is often a limit in Conventional capacity situations and would certainly be challenged in Contingency and Crisis capacity situations. However, we noted that other specialty palliative care workforce exists, but are assigned to other clinical or non-clinical duties, such as non-palliative care services, teaching, or research. During Contingency and Crisis capacity, our strategy includes the re-allocation of these staff to support the palliative care response in order to create the greatest good for the greatest number of patients. This approach would increase the size and reach of a palliative care team. Additionally, given that we have a multi-hospital system, we also developed plans for redeploying specialty palliative care workforce across sites to level-load palliative care resources.","During the pandemic, the public mostly rely on community pharmacies to get adequate supply of supply the demand\", as suggested in FIP's \"Information and interim guidelines for pharmacists 130 and the pharmacy workforce\" for COVID-19 outbreak [2] .

Adequate training of pharmacists is essential 167 for the successful delivery of PC services. with key words. In this section, we will discuss the content that needs to be included in these six 195 domains in detail.","Learners inevitably play a role in large-scale responses, and preparations must strike a balance between patient safety and residents' personal safety. While an emergency plan is focused on patient care, it must also support workforce sustainability in the event of quarantine, March 19, 2020 9 illness or injury. Resident participation in emergency preparedness plans is essential in hospitals with training programs. Planning for trainee allocation or quarantine has not been extensively studied. A hospital and graduate medical education department must decide the role trainees will play before their deployment is required, which will likely involve graduated promotion at the highest response level. The role of medical students should be carefully considered with the default response being for them to be dismissed to isolation with the general public. The benefit provided to the affected population by students would be minimal compared to the risk of their exposure.","On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) a global pandemic, which classifies the outbreak as an international emergency [1]. At the time of drafting this editorial, COVID-19 has swept through more than 115 countries and infected over 200,000 people around the globe [2\u20134]. More than 7000 individuals have died during the early phase of the pandemic, implying a high estimated case-fatality rate of 3.5% [2\u20134]. The rapidly spreading outbreak imposes an unprecedented burden on the effectiveness and sustainability of our healthcare system. Acute challenges include the exponential increase in emergency department (ED) visits and inpatient admission volumes, in conjunction with the impending risk of health care workforce shortage due to viral exposure, respiratory illness, and logistical issues due to the widespread closure of school systems [5]. Subsequent to the WHO declaration, the United States Surgeon General proclaimed a formal advisory to cancel elective surgeries at hospitals due to the concern that elective procedures may contribute to the spreading of the coronavirus within facilities and use up medical resources needed to manage a potential surge of coronavirus cases [6]. The announcement escalated to a nationwide debate regarding the safety and feasibility of continuing to perform elective surgical procedures during the COVID-19 pandemic [7, 8]. Many health care professionals erroneously interpreted the Surgeon General\u2019s recommendation as a \u201cblanket directive\u201d to cancel all elective procedures in the Country [9]. This notion was vehemently challenged in an open letter to the Surgeon General on behalf of United States hospitals [10]. The letter outlined a significant concern that the recommendation could be \u201cinterpreted as recommending that hospitals immediately stop performing elective surgeries without clear agreement on how we classify various levels of necessary care \u201c[10]. Notably, the Surgeon General\u2019s recommendation was based on a preceding statement by the American College of Surgeons (ACS) with a call to prioritize appropriate resource allocation during the coronavirus pandemic as it relates to elective invasive procedures.","Macau confirmed its first case of the 2019-nCoV infection on 22 January 2020 1 and as of Feb 8, 2020, there were 10 confirmed cases in the city. 2 The 2019-nCoV is a novel strain of coronavirus that was first detected in the city of Wuhan, in the province of Hubei China. With cases confirmed earlier in its neighboring cities of Shenzhen and Zhuhai in mainland China, the small city is vulnerable to the spread of the virus and has escalated the health emergency preparedness and response arrangements soon after the reports about a cluster of pneumonia-like illnesses with unknown causes in Wuhan came into light in the end of December 2019. On January 5, 2020, the local government swiftly took the lead in coordinating and communicating actions across various sectors. 3 To support infection prevention and control overseen by the health department, departments of economy and finance, police service and customs, information, tourism, gaming, social welfare, consumer protection, municipal affairs, education formed partnerships to step up border control and surveillance, execute isolation and quarantine measures, promote personal and environmental hygiene, ensure medical and daily supply stability and monitor the pricing, deliver public and tourist education, and disseminate accurate up-to-date information on a unified platform. This echoed the recommendations made in the 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nConV): Strategic Preparedness and Response Plan published by the World Health Organization on February 3, 2020. 4 During the previous 6 weeks, the stages of \"preparedness\", \"high risk of imported cases\", \"imported cases\" and possibly \"local transmission\" in an infection outbreak had been experienced. The highest alert is now on to try to avoid or minimize the last stage of \"community transmission\", a highly challenging task considering the possible existence of super spreaders. 5 At a professional level, while many doctors and nurses were fighting the uphill battle in the frontline, pharmacists at community settings also played an important part in the prevention of the spread of the 2019-nCoV outbreak and contributed to the overall emergency management. Apart from ensuring the stable supply of key medicines and becoming the information hub about the coronavirus infection, being the most common first point of contact, community pharmacists were also charged with the responsibility of early detection and appropriate referral. They also played a key role in implementing the government arrangement of \"The Guaranteed Mask Supply for Macao Residents Scheme\" which highlighted the importance of public-private partnerships and data exchange at times of emergency. On January 30, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the emergence of 2019-nCoV a public health emergency of international concern calling on all countries to take urgent measures to contain the respiratory disease 6 as the spread has already extended to at least 24 countries. 7 It is speculated that pharmacists in many cities and countries are finding their ways to contribute to the collaborative forces in combating the spread of the virus. On February 5, 2020, the International Pharmaceutical Federation (FIP) issued the \"Coronavirus 2019-nCoV outbreak: Information and interim guidelines for pharmacists and the pharmacy workforce\" to provide relevant information and guidelines on coronavirus outbreaks for pharmacists and the pharmacy workforce. 8 This paper aimed to improve the understanding of community pharmacists' role in case of 2019-CoV outbreak by sharing the experiences in Macau in consultation with the FIP guideline.","This collaborative process aims to prevent or identify and solve pharmaceutical and health-related problems-a continuous quality improvement process regarding the use of medicines (Wiedenmayer et al., 2006) . The philosophy of pharmaceutical care promoted in the early 1990s is no longer new. Many studies, initiatives, and interventions, especially in developed countries, have been conducted to improve patient care and health outcomes. In an attempt to provide health and pharmaceutical care to patients and society, the healthcare and pharmaceutical sectors in developing countries, particularly low-and middle-income countries (LMICs), are facing challenges. These challenges include the shortage of human resources in the pharmacy workforce; inefficient health systems; the rising costs of medicines and healthcare; limited financial resources; the huge burden of disease; and changing social, epidemiological, technological, economic, and political situations (Mohamed Ibrahim, Palaian, Al-Sulaiti, &amp; El-Shami, 2016) .","We propose that the palliative care team response will occur in two waves: first communication and second symptom management. Our experience with discussing goals of care with the family of a COVID positive patient highlighted some expected and unexpected challenges. We describe these challenges along with recommendations for approaching these conversations. We also propose a framework for proactively mobilizing the palliative care workforce to aggressively address goals of care in all patients, with the aim of reducing the need for rationing of resources.","The following examples highlight the ethical challenges that have arisen in resource allocation of critical care services. The 2010 Haiti earthquake, which killed 230,000 and displaced approximately 2 million, prompted the development of one of the first ever neonatal-PICUs in the country via non-governmental organization support. Limitation of care decisions were made in the setting of cardiac arrest or respiratory failure necessitating intubation in children with chronic disease. The delivery of quality ICU care was challenging, but was most successful and beneficial for otherwise healthy children who presented with early, acute, reversible disease (74). In South Africa, in an attempt to provide a reasonable process for fair and equitable utilization of scarce resources, the local PICU team at Red Cross War Memorial Hospital developed explicit admission exclusion criteria (Table 1) (75).","The characteristics of strong infectivity, a long incubation period and uncertain detection of COVID-19, combined with the background of large-scale population flow and other factors, led to the urgent need for scientific and technological support to control and prevent the spread of the epidemic. During the struggle against epidemic, GIS and spatial big data technology have played an important role in identifying the spatial transmission of the epidemic, in spatial prevention and control of the epidemic, in spatial allocation of resources, and in spatial detection of social sentiment, among other things. Here, we discuss ten of these challenges and responses, viz ., 1) rapid construction of a big data information system for the epidemic; 2) rapid problem-oriented big data acquisition and integration; 3) convenient multi-scale dynamic mapping for epidemics; 4) comparison between spatial tracking and the spatiotemporal trajectory of big data; 5) spatiotemporal prediction of the transmission speed and scale of the epidemic; 6) spatial segmentation of the epidemic risk and prevention level; 7) spatial dynamic balancing of supply and demand for medical resources; 8) assessment of the supply of materials and transportation risk; 9) rapid estimation of the population flow and distribution; and 10) monitoring the spatial spread of social sentiment and detection.","Unfortunately, in resource-constrained settings, investment in this critical health protection infrastructure is a low priority compared with other health priorities. Health protection investment is analogous to an insurance policy e in good times when it is infrequently called upon it may be deemed unnecessary by policymakers. But this is a dangerous misperception. Furthermore, compared with other public health interventions, health protection interventions are highly cost-effective. 12 Disinvestment in health protection is risky as it is not easy to build up health protection infrastructure, skills, and workforce rapidly. Consequently, the risk of COVID-19 is most likely to be greatest in developing countries that are most likely to lack the means and health protection systems to protect themselves. The burden of infection may, therefore, be heaviest in these countries.","2. Fellows' involvement increases procedure time, and thus increases the potential for exposure. Our practice is to preserve critical resources and minimize the risk of exposure; thus, we limit trainees' involvement during endoscopic procedures. 25 As board-certified internists, however, fellows may provide essential physician support in a time of crisis, such as during a surge. They may contribute to the COVID-19 management workforce.","The copyright holder for this preprint . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.28.20046086 doi: medRxiv preprint rate of admission and minimize the mortality of severe patients. In Wuhan city and other priority areas of Hubei Province, the focus was on actively treating patients, reducing deaths, and preventing exports. In other provinces, the focus was on preventing importations, curbing the spread of the disease and implementing joint prevention and control measures. In this fight, medical resources from all over China have been mobilized to support the medical treatment of patients in Wuhan. A total of 343 medical teams were organized, and 42,200 medical staff members from 29 provinces and Xinjiang production and construction corps were used to assist Wuhan and Hubei Province. Less than 10 days to construct two temporary hospitals. As of 28 In addition, new technologies such as big data and artificial intelligence are used to enhance contact tracing and focus group management and resource allocation, to identify the source of suspected cases, to conduct epidemiological investigations in the community. The data and information system for epidemic prevention and control based on the people's public security big data system is an important \"weapon\" for Wuhan to win the battle of epidemic prevention and control. Additionally, the Wuhan government proposed a large step to ensure that 100% of confirmed patients should be received to the hospital, that 100% of suspected cases were undergoing nucleic acid-based testing, 100% of fever patients were detected, 100% of close contacts persons were isolation, and community villages implemented 100% 24-hours closed management. In particular, the fact of five \"hundred percent\" told us during February 16-19, 2020, these powerful actions to correct the statement of former Wuhan official epidemiology investigation data (98.6%) [9] .","Several specific actions can mitigate future threats to the health of the global population. First, we need to fully implement the International Health Regulations (IHR) in countries of all income levels. Reports from WHO and the Global Preparedness Monitoring Board have shown that responses to urgent crises have improved under the IHR (2005), but important deficiencies in coverage still exist. 3, 4 We must scale up laboratory capacity and other surveillance capabilities, augment the readiness of health systems to care for large numbers of seriously ill patients while safe guarding the health-care workforce, and improve communication and coordination strategies and implementation. 5 Procurement and supply chain management must also be enhanced to ensure adequate stocks of personal protective equipment and essential medications and to enable equitable access to new diagnostics, therapeutics, and vaccines during health emergencies. 6 Second, we need to accelerate progress towards achieving the priorities and targets of the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction, 7 which was adopted by UN member nations in 2015. The Sendai Framework applies an all-hazards approach to increasing international, regional, national, and local resilience to withstand a broad spectrum of disasters, including epidemics, pandemics, and epizootics. Preparedness for emerging infectious diseases requires strengthening health systems and developing response plans that account for the social, environmental, political, and institutional factors that can either support or disrupt emergency management efforts. 8 The Sendai Framework complements the IHR by integrating infrastructure, climate change, and economic considerations into disaster management plans and promoting inclusive policies that protect vulnerable populations during all phases of mitigation, preparedness, response, and recovery. 7 Third, plans for preventing, detecting, and controlling outbreaks of emerging infectious diseases need to be built on a One Health foundation that emphasises the interconnectedness of humans, animals, and ecosystems. 9 Transdisciplinary, multisectoral strategies are necessary when seeking to solve complex problems that threaten global public health and safety. 10 More specifically in relation to diseases such as COVID-19, One Health focuses on the danger existing at the human-wildlife interface. The ability to detect viruses in livestock and wildlife is a crucial component of early warning systems for human pandemics. 11 ","Like any other health professional, pharmacist at community settings also may play an important role in the identification and prevention of the spread of the COVID-19 outbreak. Therefore, community pharmacies may contribute to avoid or minimize the last stage of \"community transmission\". In this way, on February 5th, 2020, the International Pharmaceutical Federation (FIP) issued the \"Coronavirus 2019-nCoV outbreak: Information and interim guidelines for pharmacists and the pharmacy workforce\" to provide relevant information and guidelines on coronavirus outbreaks for pharmacists and the pharmacy workforce. 2 The FIP also notes that \"community pharmacies in outbreak-affected and unaffected countries are often the first point of contact with the health system for those with health related concerns or simply in need of information and reliable advice\". 2 In addition, a recent article concluded that: \"community pharmacists have a key role in preventing the spread of 2019-CoV virus. They are charged with key responsibilities of informing, advising and educating the community, maintaining a stable supply of pharmaceuticals and personal hygiene products, and screening of suspected cases and making appropriate referral as required\". 3 Consequently, we present a route proposal that shows how the community pharmacist may develop his responsibility to contribute to the early detection and appropriate referral of possible cases of the COVID-19, whit the goal to contribute to prevention of the overall community spread of the virus in Colombia (Fig. 1) .","The best practices in innovation refer to the methods and techniques of human, financial, and material resources of the health system, the use of technology, the organizational and structural models of health-care services as well as their funding. Innovative e-health applications have a high added value because they have a wide range of applications from complete and personalized care to independent living and distant care.","Facing global epidemics of infectious diseases and rising multidrug resistance, microbiology laboratories provide pivotal information trough surveillance, from local to global levels, as specified in the International Health Regulations (1). At international level, the World Health Organization (WHO) operates laboratory networks that are part of epidemic preparedness and response programs as well as monitor communicable disease elimination and eradication programs (2, 3). In the European Union (EU), the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), a public health agency financed by the EU, is tasked with detection, surveillance, and risk assessment of threats to human health from communicable diseases (4, 5). ECDC has a multidisciplinary workforce providing scientific advice, epidemic intelligence, disease surveillance, outbreak response support, preparedness support, microbiology support health communication, and training activities in collaboration with public health experts and national agencies in EU countries. It does not operate its own microbiology laboratories but relies instead on laboratory information provided at national level. EU countries report notifiable diseases to ECDC using EU case definitions (6). ECDC is mandated to \u201cfoster the development of sufficient capacity within the Community for the diagnosis, detection, identification, and characterization of infectious agents which may threaten public health, by encouraging cooperation between expert and reference laboratories\u201d (4). This mandate builds upon decades of professional collaboration in Europe between infectious disease experts, microbiologists, and epidemiologists.","show that hospital services could start to experience shortages of hospital beds, ICU beds, and 27 ventilators in early April, the most critical situation observed for ICU beds. Increasing the 28 allocation of beds for COVID-19 (in lieu of other conditions) or temporarily placing all resources 29 under the administration of the state delays the anticipated start of shortages by a week. This 30 suggests that solutions adopted by the Brazilian government must aim at expanding the available 31 capacity (e.g., makeshift hospitals), and not simply prioritizing the allocation of available 32 We conducted forward simulations of the demand for hospital beds, ICU beds, and mechanical 77 ventilators by health macro-region in Brazil.

A more accurate estimate of the potential lives saved through pediatric critical care interventions would justify its role in healthcare systems globally (19). Data on critical care capacity, and access to both critical care resources and health care professionals, are essential for health system planning, but generally lacking. Efforts should be made to adjust critical care guidelines from high-income countries to resource-limited settings. Cost-effectiveness analyses of current and proposed critical care practices need to be emphasized (73). Efficacy must be measured and validated for critical care interventions, with limited resources targeted to those practices that save lives, time, and resources. Currently, available critical care mortality prediction tools and triage scoring systems require revalidation in region-specific contexts (131, 132) and low-cost critical care technology is much needed to support critical care in resource-limited settings.","Artificial intelligence technology can play a key role in almost every aspect including traffic management, infection detection, logistics supply chain, etc. This is a very important feature of a modern data-driven smart city. If the status of each citizen is listed, all can be accurately tracked and any population can be accommodated. Therefore, the flow of population can be controlled in a more orderly manner. Artificial intelligence technologies can be used to employ smart devices to support diagnosis and treatment, and can be used in telecommunications, online training and intelligent manufacturing to ensure minimal disruption to people's lives. Some hospitals use smart systems. Train stations can install powerful thermal imagers to measure the body temperature of passengers. Overall, efficiency and speed are very important in the control process, and conflicting research needs to be conducted (9-11).","In conclusion, older physicians represent a large proportion of the US physician workforce, particularly in states with the worst COVID-19 outbreak. Therefore, their exclusion from patient care will be impractical. Optimizing care practices by limiting direct patient contact of physicians vulnerable to adverse outcomes from COVID-19, potentially by expanding their participation in telehealth may be a strategy to protect them. .

While the priority of many leaders is to obtain additional resources, the role of palliative care is to ensure patients are able to make informed decisions so that we are using these resources appropriately. Nevertheless, given the rate of spread of this illness, the need for resource rationing may be inevitable. As recommended by Dr. Diane Meier, palliative care can be part of the development of these standards, but should not be part of the rationing workforce. In addition, palliative care teams can develop scripting for intensivists for code status discussions and recommended intervals for reviewing goals of care. ICU teams may be concerned that performance of CPR will likely not benefit patients with progressive respiratory failure and risks exposing health care workers to this deadly disease. Providers and families alike need to be reminded that putting a DNR in place does not ensure patient death. As a matter of public health, states and institutions may want to revisit policies which do not allow two physicians to write a DNR order when CPR is medically inappropriate.","The most comprehensive attempt to describe the underlying components of the safety climate in health care institutions found 6 different components 23 : (1) senior management support for safety programs, (2) absence for workplace barriers to safe work practices, (3) cleanliness and orderliness of the worksite, (4) minimal conflict and good communications among staff, (5) frequent safety-related feedback and training by supervisors, and (6) availability of PPE and engineering controls. 23 In addition, 2 of these factors, senior management support for safety programs and frequent safety-related feedback and training, were significantly associated with lower rates of exposures to blood and body fluids. Although it seems that we have a good understanding of what specific elements contribute to the safety climate, no studies have attempted to implement measures to try to improve a safety climate where a poor climate exists. The study cited above recommended that safety climate surveys sponsored jointly by the infection control and occupational health and safety committees should be administered in hospitals using the safety climate scale. 23 The authors made several suggestions as to how they could be used. None of the recommendations, however, have been evaluated in terms of their ability to improve worker safety, once applied. Another challenge to improving safety climates in hospitals comes with the recent emphasis on downsizing organizations and outsourcing of the workforce. Studies in the United States have shown that hospital-based HCWs are having to work faster and harder than ever in an environment of higher patient acuity and increased patient turnover and with less time for training and education. [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] This is likely happening in Canada, and other countries, as well. How these larger organizational changes affect safety climate remains to be studied.","Firstly, countries need to take immediate preventive and control measures based on potential transmission risks, rather than allowing them to remain unchecked. Considering the population density and climatic conditions of different countries, zoning management is important and this needs to be adjusted in time according to the risk level of the epidemic to avoid the negative effects of strict management. Secondly, governments of countries need to strive for a unified and equitable allocation of resources and to improve the efficiency of resource distribution through coordinated management. At global scale, beyond the WHO, collaborative international organizations such as the United Nations (UN) should unite different subordinate departments to cooperatively develop global management plans, thereby suggesting countermeasures for countries. Thirdly, the education, participation and support of all members of society is essential to defeating the epidemic. As such, governments have the responsibility and obligation to take measures that foster the willingness of the broader population to collaborate. It is also very important to publish accurate information about infection status in a timely manner and to actively seek collaboration with the international community.","Their data offer valuable insights to help modify infection control practices to avoid occupational injuries. Shorter rotating shifts in high-intensity protective gear may reduce the incidence of skin ulceration and preemptive measures have the potential to preserve the workforce and reduce the risk of infection among hospital workers.","Reduced number and impaired function of circulating/resident stem cells have been associated with poor cardiopulmonary outcomes in patients and experimental models of lung diseases. In this regard, exogenous administration of stem cells such as endothelial progenitor cells, bone marrow-or adipose-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs), and umbilical cord blood cells could offer protection. However, such cell-based therapy presents a number of unique challenges before they can be effectively employed in the clinical setting. The hostile environment characterized by inflammation and high oxidative stress within the diseased lungs could threaten survival and impair homing of the injected stem/progenitor cells. Genetic modification of these cells to overexpress ACE2 or Ang-(1-7) could improve survival and enhance their potential to effectively repair lung injury. In fact, we have shown that ACE2 priming of endothelial progenitor cells not only enhances their function but also increases their therapeutic efficacy to render protection against stroke. 38 CONCLUSIONS A dysregulated pulmonary angiotensin system contributes to the pathogenesis and progression of lung diseases. Discovery of the protective ACE2/Ang-(1-7)/Mas axis has provided a novel and more promising target for disease treatment than the classical approach of using ACEi or ARBs. Innovative pharmaceutical strategies that can effectively activate this beneficial ACE2/Ang-(1-7)/Mas axis hold great promise for treating pulmonary pathologies.","In this study, we analyzed the spatial representation of the disease, material, population and social psychology at three scales: individual, JID: GEOSUS [m5GeSdc; March 28, 2020; 14:39 ] group and regional. At the individual scale, the comparison between spatial epidemic tracking and the spatiotemporal trajectories of patients was carried out. At the group scale, the estimation of population flow and the spatial distribution was carried out. At the regional scale, the segmentation of spatial risk, the analysis of balance between the supply and demand of medical resources, and the spatial differentiation analysis of material transportation capacity and social sentiment were carried out. From the perspective of GIS technology, this study revolutionized the data acquisition methods through big data technology, which achieved rapid data acquisition and integration from traditional data to big data of various organizations. The analysis platform was quickly constructed through an innovative construction technology system, which provided the technical platform for timely epidemic analysis. The production of epidemic maps was quickly completed through multi-scale dynamic template technology, which allowed timely dissemination of epidemic dynamic information. From the perspective of spatial simulation and analysis, this study simulated the spatial transmission process of the epidemic scientifically by increasing detailed regional variables and changing the population flow and R 0 (basic reproduction number) according to the prevention and control measures. The calculation of the overlap between the spatial tracking of the virus and that of patient trajectories was realized based on the exposure index of fused spatial and text information via text spatialization technology. The estimation of population flow and spatial distribution was realized via the combination of big data and traditional geographic data, which identified the problems in the key risk areas and the spatial mismatching of medical resources in a timely manner, to bring about a rapid supply of information about the delimitation of prevention areas and resource deployment in epidemic control. The monitoring of social sentiment from social media was realized through the construction of a knowledge database on public opinion, which provided important foundational information on public opinion to guide the government.","Hospitals and health systems must develop agile ways to transmit timely and critical information in times of crises. A designated communication team that is integrated into the work so they have a strong understanding of the clinical care being provided and the communication needs of the workforce, patients, and public is recommended. Crisis communications should ideally occur via several media, such as a telephone hotline, the hospital Web page, social media platforms, or text-based messages. Important metrics, including the number of cases being triaged, investigated, or managed; bed capacity and availability; and new or emerging data on treatments or care strategies, should be provided. Similarly, timely communication of national updates on travel restrictions, policies for self-monitoring and quarantine, and trends in infection rates must occur. To this end, health care leaders must remember that patients and their families are as much in need of actionable information as hospital personnel. Comprehensive communication strategies for both internal and external stakeholders are key.","\u2022 Computer/communications security (e.g., Internet/intranet security). protecting assets relating to attacks on information resources and misuse of information technology (IT) is a large task. It has grown in significance for managers and currently ranks highest among 26 concerns.

For most people, the workplace is a safe place. But occasionally, violence intrudes into an otherwise nonviolent environment. Despite such events being uncommon, the issue cannot be dismissed by managers; indeed, it is at or near the top of any list of workplace concerns. 14 Diligent managers must take measures to make employees feel safe on the job, and at the same time deter disgruntled employees, terminated workers, enraged customers or clients, and others from untoward action. \u2022 Employee selection/screening.

But they are not averse to catching the infection from some other host. However, medical workers in India are facing logistic concerns with respect to their rented accommodations as most of the landlords of house rented to medical professionals are asking them to vacate the premise in order to avoid catching the novel coronavirus in their body. The governments of respective states are addressing the issue, but if healthcare workers do not report to the respective work locations, we may not be able to contain the drastic rise in the number of deaths and infected case due to COVID-19 outbreak. And looking at the global trends, it is important for the Indian workforce to exercise utmost precautions, guided by best medical practices and proper medical supervision.","The Institute of Medicine Committee also developed a set of policy recommendations. These concentrated in two areas: the need for vastly increased resources for interdisciplinary training in infectious diseases because of the depleted workforce resources in this area; and the need to develop new surveillance and public health response systems, since the committee had determined that emerging infections did, indeed, constitute a major public health threat to the United States.","In addition to direct government contributions, innovative finance mechanisms have been successful in raising funds for vaccines in the past and should be used to fund the development of COVID-19 vaccines. 8, 9 The International Finance Facility for Immunisation (IFFIm) raises funds with vaccine bonds, which turn long-term contributions by donors into available cash. 8 IFFIm was created to support Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, but could be used to finance CEPI's COVID-19 vaccine efforts. With advanced market commitments, donors make funding commitments to vaccine manufacturers and, in exchange, companies sign a legally binding commitment to provide the vaccines at a price affordable to low-income and middle-income countries. Gavi's board expressed support for the use of Gavi's IFFIm and advanced market commitments to improve COVID-19 vaccine development and access. 10 The need for COVID-19 vaccines is global, although the need is differentially distributed within populations. Vaccines would likely be prioritised for health-care workers and people at greatest risk of severe illness and death. High-income countries must not monopolise the global supply of COVID-19 vaccines. This risk is real: during the 2009 influenza A/H1N1 pandemic, rich countries negotiated large advance orders for the vaccine, crowding out poor countries. 11 Such an outcome would result in a suboptimal allocation of an initially scarce resource.","In the laissez-faire approach, we assume that 33% of workers or all workers aged 50 and above do not show up for work during the peak epidemic month of June 2020 5 . This estimate is consistent with Sadique et al (2007) finding that 34% of workers expect to miss work in peak flu epidemic if mortality rates are high. The net effect on labor supply accounts for redundant workforce due to lower demand and sickness and corresponds to 36.2% less employment in June 2020.","Year holidays: assumed no physical distancing control measures, school-going individuals did not have any contacts at school because of school holidays from Jan 15, to Feb 10, 2020, and 10% and later 75% of workforce would be working during the holidays from Jan 25, to Jan 31, 2020, and from Feb 1, to Feb 10, 2020, respectively; and third scenario, intense control measures in Wuhan to contain the outbreak: assumed school closure and about 10% of workforce (eg, health-care personnel, police, and other essential government staff) would be working even during the control measures (figures 1, 2).

It is a system to establish a Quality Policy and achieve quality objectives in an organization. \u2022 Quality management system (QMS): it is a management system, which directs and controls an organization with regard to quality. QMS has a set of requirements that deal with each aspect of the activities of the organization that affect quality. \u2022 Quality requirements: ISO family of standards represents an international consensus on good management practices with the aim of ensuring that the organization can time and again","Suppressive social distancing should be practices wherever possible including remote working [43] In anticipation of self-isolation discuss what working roles could be conducted from home and review what may be required in local governance and information technology to allow home working e.g. can laptops be provided which offer access to hospital data or to treatment planning systems. If working from home is possible then consider allowing staff to do this even when not medically recommended (self-isolation) as this reduces infection risk and the risks of workforce depletion. The NHS in England have reduced guidance that allows for some relaxation of normal data governance to facilitate this sort of working during the crisis and other jurisdictions should follow suit [44] .","The extension of non-medical prescribing rights to pharmacists is intended to enhance patient care in various ways, such as improving access to timely care and maximising use of health professionals' knowledge and skills, thereby improving the efficiency of healthcare delivery. 11, 21, 22 There is evidence to show that non-medical prescribers, such as pharmacists, are as effective as medical prescribers and can achieve comparable outcomes across a range of clinical measures (e.g. blood pressure control), medication adherence, health-related quality of life and patient satisfaction. 23 In countries where community pharmacists do not currently have prescribing rights, there are numerous challenges to overcome in expanding the scope of their current practice, including socio-political barriers and resourcing issues. 21 In such cases, extending prescribing rights for pharmacists may not be realistic or actionable in the midst of the current pandemic. However, there are other related activities that may be amenable to more immediate modifications in pharmacists' current working practices and help to reduce the burden on general practice. These include the dispensing of repeat prescriptions and emergency supplies of medications at the request of patients.","One of the critical lessons from the SARS experience was the absolute necessity to be able to coordinate the international resources that are available in an outbreak and to get them focussed on identifying priorities and solving problems. The WHO established the means to do this for SARS and it has since been further developed and integrated into global preparedness, especially after the West Africa Ebola epidemic. Organisations such as the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN), the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), the Global Research Collaboration For Infectious Disease Preparedness (GloPID-R) and the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID) have been supported by the WHO Research Blueprint and its Global Coordinating Mechanism to provide a forum where those with the expertise and capacity to contribute to managing new threats can come together both between and during outbreaks to develop innovative solutions to emerging problems. This global coordination has been active in the novel coronavirus outbreak. WHO's response system includes three virtual groups based on those developed for SARS to collate real time information to inform real time guidelines, and a first candidate vaccine is ready for laboratory testing within 4 weeks of the virus being identified.","Accordingly, efficient workforce utilization along with appropriate planning for peak disease activity is crucial. Each unit should create a back-up list for all positions that could be utilized in the event of a possible increase in disease activity or a decrease in workforce due to illness.","On another hand, it also ignores spillovers effects to other sectors supplying goods and services, which could increase the actual effect. This negative effect on GDP lasts from April 2020 to May 2022 in the herd immunity approach, but happens only in June 2020 in the laissez-faire approach. These demand shocks also make redundant almost 8% of the US workforce. Both demand shock, sickness and other restrictive measures affect the labor supply concurrently which somewhat reduces the total effect. To calculate the total effect of sickness, home quarantines and school closures net of demand effects we assume that these factors act independently from each other except sickness and home quarantines.","Currently, SARS-CoV-2 is wildly spreading around the world, efficient and accurate diagnosis of NCP is crucial for prevention and control. Our deep learning model potentially provides an accurate early diagnostic tool for NCP, especially when nucleic acid test kits are short of supply, which is a common problem during outbreaks. This could help reduce the missed diagnosis rate and diagnosis time, ensure prompt patient isolation and early treatment, improve prognosis and largely prevent transmission. The high efficiency of our model to differentiate NCP and IP could be very beneficial to reduce misdiagnosis rate and optimize the allocation of medical resources, particularly in areas with high prevalence of both NCP and IP.","The coronavirus disease-19 pandemic threatens to overwhelm the healthcare resources of the country, 1 but also poses a personal hazard to healthcare workers, including physicians. 2 Physicians are at an elevated risk of acquiring the disease through exposure to patients who may be symptomatic with the disease or its asymptomatic carriers across the spectrum of clinical specialties. Notably, the physician workforce is not only at risk of losing time spent in clinical care due to these exposures, but at a personal risk from severe disease that requires hospitalization and is associated with high morbidity and mortality. Notably, physicians 60 years of age and older are at a particularly elevated risk, with 80% of deaths in China concentrated in this age group. 3, 4 In the early experience in the US, nearly half of all hospitalizations and intensive care unit admissions, and nearly 80% of deaths have occurred in this age group as well. 4 To address the potential impact of excluding physicians with a high risk of adverse outcomes based on age, we evaluated the current patterns of age of licensed physicians across the United States.","Paramount in the care of COVID-19 patients is preservation of staff. We cannot deal with a prolonged mass casualty event when many of our staff are sidelined due to quarantine or illness. Above and beyond standard precautions, this specific type of pandemic requires screening outpatients for symptoms and testing before entering hospitals, seeing only outpatients with MN-TS concerns, and avoiding burnout and unprotected exposure to infected patients. Leveraging telehealth encounters can improve both provider and patient safety and lead to excellent patient satisfaction. Standard precautions are not only indicated for any encounter with a Person Under Investigation (PUI) or a +COVID-19 patient, but should also be considered for quarantined patients, personal protective equipment (PPE) availability permitting. Social distancing applies to the workplace as well, and therefore routine gatherings, such as meetings, academics, morning report, etc., should be cancelled or converted to tele-or video-teleconferences. These practices avoid the \"COVID-19 grenade,\" whereby one staff member becomes positive and sidelines critical proportions of the workforce.","The spatial distribution of medical resources is generally balanced according to factors such as population density, but the spatially uneven outbreak of the epidemic and their rapid development result in a spatiotemporal imbalance of the supply and demand for medical resources. In this case, the key to epidemic prevention and control is knowing the spatiotemporal dynamics of the supply and demand for medical resources to optimize the allocation of materials. Based on the factors of online hospital help information, local cases and forecasts, and existing resource data, we analyzed the current dynamic situation of medical protective equipment across the country through cross-validation and sampling verification (phone inquiry and web inquiry) and attained the following: 1) the prompt identification of a shortage of medical protective equipments in 462 hospitals, including 336 in Hubei Province and the rest in Sichuan Province, Anhui Province, Guangdong Province, Jiangsu Province and Hunan Province, among others; and 2) based on the number of confirmed cases, the number of hospitals that lacked sufficient medical protective equipments and the urban population, the shortage of medical supplies was divided into four levels on a regional scale and three levels on a city scale (the result for Hubei Province is shown in Figure 7 , and the national result is shown in Figure 8 ). The above achievements provided an important scientific basis for the national allocation of medical care resources for the prevention and control of the epidemic. JID: GEOSUS [m5GeSdc; March 28, 2020; 14:39 ] ","A third consideration was the provision of palliative care service support after routine working hours. Our primary approach is to have an on-call palliative care attending physician provide coaching to primary team as well as telephonic support to patients and families. The palliative care attending physician would be available for in-person visits, but these would be limited when possible to preserve our palliative care workforce.","How can we prepare for the next epidemic that places our workforce at risk? How do we prepare physicians and nurses and comfort them and their worried families that we are doing our best to protect them? How do we respond in the face of the next epidemic early and appropriately? Academic centers have additional responsibilities to explore the fears of medical, nursing, and pharmacy students whose learning may be put on hold during an epidemic. Alternatively, the students may be in a panic way and plans for managing their exposures and concerns need to be formally addressed and managed. We suggest that institutions recognize the fear and uncertainty among health care workers when a new epidemic hits. Creating telephone hot lines with trained professionals would seem to be an important first step. Thereafter, a Psychological Support Response Team should be formed to outline appropriate procedures to manage the stresses expected and to define specific goals of intervention and therapy. Trained counselors who can explore the origins of individual fears need to be on the team and supported by infectious disease experts who can discuss the facts related to the disease, its incubation period, the risk of transmission and outcomes. Because we will continue to see new epidemics, hospitals might consider developing guidelines now that could be utilized in future introductions of new pathogens.","During the epidemic, rapid integration of the government and social forces into the Internet framework can maximize effective management of the psychological crisis. We established a pyramid structure of psychological crisis management with government as the core leader. At the bottom of the pyramid are communities, which mainly provide psychosocial support. Psychological assistance (such as hotline, online consulting) is used to identify and help the target groups who need intervention. Through the Huayitong app and Psyclub applet (two integrated APPs for online registration, appointment, payment and other functions for West China Hospital and Sichuan psychological consultant platform), telephone hotline and WeChat platform, we quickly organized physicians at all levels of the West China Hospital (including retired professors) and psychologists from all over Sichuan Province to form psychological rescue teams to formulate solutions (e.g. developing technical guidelines and training programs, starting online consultation and setting up problem feedback mechanisms). Psychological rescue teams conduct crisis interventions for confirmed patients and front-line staff. The expert team at the top of the pyramid provide health education and training during the whole process (Fig. 2) . How to quickly identify the emotional and stress problems of individuals is an important part of basis for psychological intervention. We screened the mental health status of suspected cases, medical staffs and general population via WeChat platform and/or telephone by using questionnaires (e.g. Mood Index Questionnaire, Patient Health Questionaire-9) as the evaluation tool. 13, 14 Proper intervention strategies were chosen based on the screening results. Follow-up is performed regardless of whether the individual reports mental health problems or not. The process and content of psychological intervention is shown in Fig. 3 and Table 1 .","This extraordinary aid keeps the ratio of the health workers to patients in Hubei at above 0.6 despite the number of remaining confirmed cases has ten-fold increased up to 50 000 on 18 Feb (Fig. 1C) . Results also show that the number of acute care beds from more than 45 designated hospitals plus two newly built ones in Wuhan has been consecutively increasing up to 23 532 (as of Feb 24) under the government-directed re-allocation (Fig. 1D) . This supply thus enabled the severe and critical patients to be treated timely and effectively 6 . More importantly, there have been over 10 temporary hospitals (named Fangcang hospitals) reconstructed from gymnasium and exhibition centers, which provide more than 26 000 makeshift beds for mild patients (Fig. 1D) . These combinations guaranteed nearly 100% percent of COVID-19 patients to be treated in hospitals even if the number of remaining confirmed cases has ten-fold increased up to 38 000 on 18 Feb (Fig. 1D) . In contrast, a lot of patients had to stay at home in the early stage of the outbreak in Wuhan due to the shortage of beds such that many transmissions in households occurred 6 . Accordingly, the effective implementation of comprehensive control measures and infection-treatment practices is critical for combatting any new pathogens, not only interrupting the transmissions but also saving the patients. Timely supplied medical resources, including re-allocation of acute care beds, rapid construction of new hospitals and generous aid of health workers by other less-severe areas, apparently help the epicenter of the outbreak Hubei (Wuhan) to accomplish a unique and also encouraging outcome for life-saving such that the mortality and recovery rates of nearly 50 000 COVID-19 patients exponentially decays and grows, respectively. Other crucial factors contributing to this success may include the improved and optimized diagnosis and treatment strategies 8 , which are critical for saving severe and critical patients 5, 6, 9 . This speculation appears to be supported by the exponential growth of the COVID-19 recovery rate outside Hubei (Fig. 1B) where medical resources are relatively sufficient 10 . Collectively, the achievement made in Hubei (or Wuhan) may provide useful guidance for many countries to be better prepared for the potential pandemic 2 that may overwhelm local health care systems. ","Our world was completely subverted by the emergency. No plans or protocols had the time to be tested and verified, at least on a large scale. The rapidity of the evolving scenario made it necessary to adopt easy and pragmatic solutions even for critical and delicate matters. Not surprisingly, the usual, despicable age criterion started to be implicitly adopted in the decisional algorithm for the allocation of scarce resources to the mounting number of patients."],"title":["The Initial Hospital Response to an Epidemic","Creating a Palliative Care Inpatient Response Plan for COVID19 \u2013 The UW Medicine Experience","Recommendations and guidance for providing pharmaceutical care services during COVID-19 pandemic: A China perspective","Maximizing the Calm Before the Storm: Tiered Surgical Response Plan for Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19)","How to risk-stratify elective surgery during the COVID-19 pandemic?","Community pharmacist in public health emergencies: Quick to action against the coronavirus 2019-nCoV outbreak","Chapter 18 Assessment of Medication Dispensing and Extended Community Pharmacy Services","Goals of Care in a Pandemic: Our Experience and Recommendations","A Review of Pediatric Critical Care in Resource-Limited Settings: A Look at Past, Present, and Future Directions","COVID-19: Challenges to GIS with Big Data","Wuhan novel coronavirus (COVID-19): why global control is challenging?","Considerations in performing endoscopy during the COVID-19 pandemic","China's fight against COVID-19: What we have done and what we should do next?","Will COVID-19 generate global preparedness?","How to link patients with suspicious COVID-19 to health system from the community pharmacies?

Healthcare workers are at increased risk to become infected because of contact to infected patients, infected co-workers and their community outside the hospital. The ideal organisational strategy to protect the healthcare workforce in a situation in which social distancing cannot be maintained at the workplace remains to be determined. In this study, we have mathematically modelled strategies for the employment of hospital workforce with the goal to simulate health and productivity of the workers. Therefore, deterministic models were extended to account for stochastic influences potentially occurring in rather small populations. The models were also designed to determine if desynchronization of medical teams by dichotomizing the workers may protect the workforce. Our studies model workforce productivit...","COVID-19 is now a pandemic and many of the affected countries face severe shortages of hospital resources. In Brazil, the first case was reported on February 26. As the number of cases grows in the country, there is a concern that the health system may become overwhelmed, resulting in shortages of hospital beds, intensive care unit beds, and mechanical ventilators. The timing of shortage is likely to vary geographically depending on the observed onset and pace of transmission observed, on the availability of resources, and on the actions implemented. Here we consider the daily number of cases reported in municipalities in Brazil to simulate twelve alternative scenarios of the likely timing of shortage, based on parameters consistently reported for China and Italy, on rates of hospital occupancy for other health conditions observed in Brazil in 2019, and on assumptions of allocation of patients in public and private facilities. Results show that hospital services could start to experien...","Abstract As the global COVID-19 pandemic escalates there is a need within radiation oncology to work to support our patients in the best way possible. Measures are required to reduce infection spread between patients and within the workforce. Departments need contingency planning to create capacity and continue essential treatments despite a reduced workforce. The #radonc community held an urgent online journal club in March 2020 to discuss these issues and create some consensus on urgent next steps. There were 121 global contributors. This document summarises these discussions around themes of infection prevention, rationalisation of workload and working practice in the presence of infection","Abstract: We propose that the palliative care team response will occur in two waves: first communication and second symptom management. Our experience with discussing goals of care with the family of a COVID positive patient highlighted some expected and unexpected challenges. We describe these challenges along with recommendations for approaching these conversations. We also propose a framework for proactively mobilizing the palliative care workforce to aggressively address goals of care in all patients, with the aim of reducing the need for rationing of resources.","Background: The coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) pandemic threatens to overwhelm the healthcare resources of the country, but also poses a personal hazard to healthcare workers, including physicians. To address the potential impact of excluding physicians with a high risk of adverse outcomes based on age, we evaluated the current patterns of age of licensed physicians across the United States. Methods: We compiled information from the 2018 database of actively licensed physicians in the Federation of State Medical Boards (FSMB) across the US. Both at a national- and the state-level, we assessed the number and proportion of physicians who would be at an elevated risk due to age over 60 years. Results: Of the 985,026 licensed physicians in the US, 235857 or 23.9% were aged 25-40 years, 447052 or 45.4% are 40-60 years, 191794 or 19.5% were 60-70 years, and 106121 or 10.8% were 70 years or older. Age was not reported in 4202 or 0.4% of physicians. Overall, 297915 or 30.2% of physicians we...","Abstract The global spread of COVID-19 is placing unprecedented demands on healthcare services. In this time of crisis, innovative and adaptive methods of practising will be required across all health professions. In order to maximise the use of current available resources, it is vital that existing services are comprehensively reviewed and full use is made of any unrealised potential among healthcare providers. Community pharmacy is one of a number of health professions that has a key role to play in responding to the current pandemic. As the scope of community pharmacy practice varies considerably across countries, it is important to examine ways in which the profession can assist with the public health response to COVID-19 and maintaining the continuity of healthcare services. This article seeks to highlight roles and activities that community pharmacists can undertake to help in relieving pressure on other areas of the health service, such as general practice. This information coul...","Abstract This document outlines recommendations for physiotherapy management for COVID-19 in the acute hospital setting. It includes: recommendations for physiotherapy workforce planning and preparation; a screening tool for determining requirement for physiotherapy; and recommendations for the selection of physiotherapy treatments and personal protective equipment. It is intended for use by physiotherapists and other relevant stakeholders in the acute care setting caring for adult patients with suspected and/or confirmed COVID-19.","Abstract The outbreak of the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has caused more than 100,000 people infected and thousands of deaths. Currently, the number of infections and deaths is still increasing rapidly. COVID-19 seriously threatens human health, production, life, social functioning and international relations. In the fight against COVID-19, Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and big data technologies have played an important role in many aspects, including the rapid aggregation of multi-source big data, rapid visualization of epidemic information, spatial tracking of confirmed cases, prediction of regional transmission, spatial segmentation of the epidemic risk and prevention level, balancing and management of the supply and demand of material resources, and social-emotional guidance and panic elimination, which provided solid spatial information support for decision-making, measures formulation, and effectiveness assessment of COVID-19 prevention and control. GIS has d...","Abstract To overcome the limitations of the state-of-the-art influenza surveillance systems in Europe, we established in 2008 a European-wide consortium aimed at introducing an innovative information and communication technology approach for a web-based surveillance system across different European countries, called Influenzanet. The system, based on earlier efforts in The Netherlands and Portugal, works with the participation of the population in each country to collect real-time information on the distribution of influenza-like illness cases through web surveys administered to volunteers reporting their symptoms (or lack of symptoms) every week during the influenza season. Such a large European-wide web-based monitoring infrastructure is intended to rapidly identify public health emergencies, contribute to understanding global trends, inform data-driven forecast models to assess the impact on the population, optimize the allocation of resources, and help in devising mitigation and co...","ABSTRACT Within weeks, COVID-19 has transformed our practice of palliative care and clinical medicine as we know it. Telemedicine has emerged as a critical technology to bring medical care to patients while attempting to reduce the transmission of COVID-19 among patients, families, and clinicians. It is also increasingly necessary to preserve scarce resources like personal protective equipment. In this article, we share just-in-time tips to support palliative care clinicians and program leaders in providing the best care possible by telemedicine. These quick, practical tips cover telemedicine set-up, patient considerations, and clinician considerations. Next steps include ensuring equitable access to affordable telemedicine technology for vulnerable populations through creative solutions and financing, and dedicated attention to telemedicine evaluation and quality improvement.","Background Despite available recommendations on infection control for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), information is limited on actual practices in Asian hospitals during the epidemic. We describe practices observed by mobile SARS containment teams (mobile teams) during outbreak investigations. Methods We retrospectively summarized infection control practices observed in hospitals visited by mobile teams in the Lao People's Democratic Republic (PDR), Taiwan, and Thailand, during March and April 2003. Results Mobile teams investigated 22 reports of SARS in 20 hospitals (1, 5, and 14 hospitals in Lao PDR, Taiwan, and Thailand, respectively). Facilities ranged from urban hospitals with negative-pressure isolation rooms and high-efficiency particulate air filtration to rural hospitals with patient rooms open to outside air circulation and intermittent running water. At the time of mobile team visits, 5 (25%) hospitals implemented infection control practices consistent with World ...","Respiratory protection against airborne pathogens is crucial for pandemic/epidemic preparedness in the context of personal protection, healthcare systems, and governance. We expect that the development of technologies that overcome the existing challenges in current respiratory protective devices will lead to a timely and effective response to the next outbreak.","Public health preparedness requires effective surveillance of and rapid response to infectious disease outbreaks. Inclusion of research activities within the outbreak setting provides important opportunities to maximize limited resources, to enhance gains in scientific knowledge, and ultimately to increase levels of preparedness. With rapid advances in laboratory technologies, banking and analysis of human genomic specimens can be conducted as part of public health investigations, enabling valuable research well into the future.","The COVID-19 pandemic has upended clinicians' sense of order and control, creating the potential for stress in the short term and burnout over the long term. This commentary offers suggestions to encourage a culture that will sustain the clinician workforce during the pandemic.","Ten years have elapsed since the World Health Organization issued its first global alert for an unexplained illness named severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). The anniversary provides an opportunity to reflect on the international response to this new global microbial threat. While global surveillance and response capacity for public health threats have been strengthened, critical gaps remain. Of 194 World Health Organization member states that signed on to the International Health Regulations (2005), &lt;20% had achieved compliance with the core capacities required by the deadline in June 2012. Lessons learned from the global SARS outbreak highlight the need to avoid complacency, strengthen efforts to improve global capacity to address the next pandemic using all available 21st century tools, and support research to develop new treatment options, countermeasures, and insights while striving to address the global inequities that are the root cause of many of these challenges.","Abstract Individuals who visit community pharmacies are regarded as customers rather than patients. The public tends to view community pharmacists as businesspeople. Several factors influence individuals' willingness to patronize and to continue visiting such pharmacies. On the supply side, community pharmacists' responsibilities and duties center on the health and well-being of society. In this chapter, an assessment of community pharmacy practices in developing countries is particularly interesting in terms of medication dispensing and extended pharmacy services that promote public wellness. Community pharmacists in developing countries, who are supposedly strategically positioned in the community to provide public health, are not taking advantage on this opportunity. Although several studies have noted the services provided by community pharmacists, in general, the practice is far from meeting expectations due to several barriers. Pharmacists need to realize their opportunities and ...","","Abstract Background The novel coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19), which was first detected in Wuhan City, has now became a pandemic that affecting patients around the world. Particularly, the community patient population are at high risk of infection and are facing potential failure of proper medication use during the pandemic. Objective To discuss community pharmacists\u2019 role and the content of pharmaceutical care (PC) during the novel coronavirus pandemic to promote effective prevention and control and safe drug use of the community patient population. Method Collect and summarize the experience Chinese community pharmacies gained from providing pharmacy services during the COVID-19 outbreak, and taking the PC needs into consideration, analyze and discuss the methods and strategies that community pharmacies and pharmacists shall use to provide PC during the pandemic.

We propose advanced infection control measures (A-IC) used in conjunction with basic infection control measures (B-IC) help reduce pathogen transmission. B-IC include standard and transmission-based precautions. A-IC are initiatives implemented within our center to enhance effectiveness of B-IC. Objective Study effectiveness of combining B-IC and A-IC to prevent transmission of MERS-CoV to HCWs. Methods A retrospective observational study was undertaken. A-IC measures include administrative support with daily rounds; infection control risk assessment; timely screening, isolation, and specimen analysis; collaboration; epidemic planning; stockpiling; implementation of contingency plans; full personal protective equipment use for advanced airway management; use of a real-time electronic isolation flaggin...","Abstract Objective MERS-CoV infection is uncommonly identified among patients visiting healthcare facilities &amp; we were vigilant in screening all patients entering our hospital to prevent cross infection among patients, visitors &amp; healthcare providers and aiming to prevent potential outbreaks with MERS-CoV infection. In spite of our efforts on practicing Failure Mode Effect Analysis for MERS-CoV infection management we ended up having an outbreak with MERS-CoV. Based on our experience, we actively implemented policies, procedures &amp; practices on early identification &amp; appropriate isolation practices along with supplemental infection prevention &amp; control measures for preventing future outbreaks at our healthcare facility. Methods Retrospectively we analyzed our failure in preventing the outbreak of MERS-CoV infection among our hospitalized patients by identifying the outbreak &amp; actively intervening as a team to control the outbreak with the support of Hospital Higher management, Administr...","Abstract A novel approach modifying cells to express viral markers to elicit protective immunity responses (decoy cellular vaccination) in the prevention of COVID-19 disease is currently being explored. Our approach entails utilizing SARS-CoV-2 Spike antigen-expressing, non-replicating cells as carriers and presenters of immunogenic antigens, so called \u201cI-cells\u201d. By using irradiated cells as presenting vehicles of SARS-CoV-2 viral antigens(s) in a cellular context, these presented viral proteins can be recognized by the host immune system, thus, an efficient protective immune response might be elicited. Another advantage of this strategy is that the manufacturing process is scalable and yields uniform cell products allowing for \u201coff-the-shelf\u201d frozen supply availability. To prevent engraftment and proliferation of the cells after administration, the cells will be irradiated post-harvesting abolishing in vivo replication potential. Specifically, immunoreactive Spike-1 proteins from SARS...","Background COVID-19 is leading to the implementation of social distancing policies around the world and in the United States, including school closures. The evidence that mandatory school closures reduce cases and ultimately mortality mostly comes from experience with influenza or from models that do not include the impact of school closure on the healthcare labor supply or the role of the healthcare labor force in reducing the per infection mortality from the pathogen. There is considerable uncertainty of the incremental effect of school closures on transmission and lives saved from school closures. The likely, but uncertain, benefits from school closure need to be weighed against uncertain, and seldom quantified, costs of healthcare worker absenteeism associated with additional child care obligations. Methods We analyze data from the US Current Population Survey to measure the potential child care obligations for US healthcare workers that will need to be addressed if school closures...","","The 2009 influenza A (H1N1) pandemic highlighted the importance of quality hospital care of the severely ill, yet there is evidence that the impact of the 2009 pandemic was highest in low\u2010 and middle\u2010income countries with fewer resources. Recent data indicate that death and suffering from seasonal influenza and severe illness in general are increased in resource\u2010limited settings. However, there are limited clinical data and guidelines for the management of influenza and other severe illness in these settings. Life\u2010saving supportive care through syndromic case management is used successfully in high\u2010resource intensive care units and in global programs such as the Integrated Management of Childhood Illness (IMCI). While there are a variety of challenges to the management of the severely ill in resource\u2010limited settings, several new international initiatives have begun to develop syndromic management strategies for these environments, including the World Health Organization's Integrated M...","The recent Ebola and Zika epidemics demonstrate the need for the continuous surveillance, rapid diagnosis and real-time tracking of emerging infectious diseases. Fast, affordable sequencing of pathogen genomes \u2014 now a staple of the public health microbiology laboratory in well-resourced settings \u2014 can affect each of these areas. Coupling genomic diagnostics and epidemiology to innovative digital disease detection platforms raises the possibility of an open, global, digital pathogen surveillance system. When informed by a One Health approach, in which human, animal and environmental health are considered together, such a genomics-based system has profound potential to improve public health in settings lacking robust laboratory capacity. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The online version of this article (doi:10.1038/nrg.2017.88) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.","COVID-19 has spread with unequal efficiency in various parts of the world. In several European countries including Italy, the increase in the number of COVID-19 cases has followed a consistent, exponential pattern of spread. However, some countries, notably Taiwan and Hong Kong, have achieved a different outcome and have managed to bring the COVID-19 outbreak in their countries rapidly under control, without entering the exponential pattern and with very few cases. They have used several different approaches to COVID-19 outbreak control, including the innovative use of smartphone technology and the widespread use of surgical face masks. We show through our models, that Canada has followed the same, consistent COVID-19 exponential growth pattern that is seen in Italy. Both nationally and in its most heavily affected provinces, there is exponential growth of COVID-19 cases, making it possible to make predictions for the future, if no further interventions are made in public health policy...","Hospital-acquired infections (HAIs) are serious problems for healthcare systems, especially in developing countries where public health infrastructure and technology for infection preventions remain undeveloped. Here, we characterized how strategy and technology could be mobilized to improve the effectiveness of infection prevention and control in hospitals during the outbreaks of Ebola, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in Asia and West Africa. Published literature on the hospital-borne outbreaks of SARS, Ebola, and MERS in Asia and West Africa was comprehensively reviewed. The results showed that healthcare systems and hospital management in affected healthcare facilities had poor strategies and inadequate technologies and human resources for the prevention and control of HAIs, which led to increased morbidity, mortality, and unnecessary costs. We recommend that governments worldwide enforce disaster risk management, even when no ou...","Policies and public health efforts have not addressed the gendered impacts of disease outbreaks.1 The response to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) appears no different. We are not aware of any gender analysis of the outbreak by global health institutions or governments in affected countries or in preparedness phases. Recognising the extent to which disease outbreaks affect women and men differently is a fundamental step to understanding the primary and secondary effects of a health emergency on different individuals and communities, and for creating effective, equitable policies and interventions. Although sex-disaggregated data for COVID-19 show equal numbers of cases between men and women so far, there seem to be sex differences in mortality and vulnerability to the disease.2 Emerging evidence suggests that more men than women are dying, potentially due to sex-based immunological3 or gendered differences, such as patterns and prevalence of smoking.4 However, current sex-disaggrega...","Summary WHO interim guidelines recommend offering extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) to eligible patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) related to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The number of patients with COVID-19 infection who might develop severe ARDS that is refractory to maximal medical management and require this level of support is currently unknown. Available evidence from similar patient populations suggests that carefully selected patients with severe ARDS who do not benefit from conventional treatment might be successfully supported with venovenous ECMO. The need for ECMO is relatively low and its use is mostly restricted to specialised centres globally. Providing complex therapies such as ECMO during outbreaks of emerging infectious diseases has unique challenges. Careful planning, judicious resource allocation, and training of personnel to provide complex therapeutic interventions while adhering to strict infection control measures are all c...","The novel coronavirus, COVID-19, has sparked an outflow of scientific research seeking to understand the virus, its spread, and best practices in prevention and treatment. If this international research effort is going to be as swift and effective as possible, it will need to rely on a principle of open science. When researchers share data, code, and software and generally make their work as transparent as possible, it allows other researchers to verify and expand upon their work. Furthermore, it allows public officials to make informed decisions. In this study, we analyzed 535 preprint articles related to COVID-19 for eight transparency criteria and recorded study location and funding information. We found that individual researchers have lined up to help during this crisis, quickly tackling important public health questions, often without funding or support from outside organizations. However, most authors could improve their data sharing and scientific reporting practices. The contr...","Recent outbreaks of infectious pathogens such as Zika, Ebola, and COVID-19 have underscored the need for the dependable availability of vaccines against emerging infectious diseases (EIDs). The cost and risk of R&amp;D programs and uniquely unpredictable demand for EID vaccines have discouraged vaccine developers, and government and nonprofit agencies have been unable to provide timely or sufficient incentives for their development and sustained supply. We analyze the economic returns of a portfolio of EID vaccine assets, and find that under realistic financing assumptions, the expected returns are significantly negative, implying that the private sector is unlikely to address this need without public-sector intervention. We have sized the financing deficit for this portfolio and propose several potential solutions, including price increases, enhanced public-private partnerships, and subscription models through which individuals would pay annual fees to obtain access to a portfolio of vacc...","OBJECTIVE: Recognizing increasing interest in community disease surveillance globally, the goal of this study was to investigate whether respiratory viruses circulating in the community may be represented through clinical (hospital) surveillance in Nigeria. RESULTS: Children were selected via convenience sampling from communities and a tertiary care center (n = 91) during spring 2017 in Ilorin, Nigeria. Nasal swabs were collected and tested using polymerase chain reaction. The majority (79.1%) of subjects were under 6 years old, of whom 46 were infected (63.9%). A total of 33 of the 91 subjects had one or more respiratory tract virus; there were 10 cases of triple infection and 5 of quadruple. Parainfluenza virus 4, respiratory syncytial virus B and enterovirus were the most common viruses in the clinical sample; present in 93.8% (15/16) of clinical subjects, and 6.7% (5/75) of community subjects (significant difference, p &lt; 0.001). Coronavirus OC43 was the most common virus detected i...","Global gene expression analysis is beginning to move from the laboratories of basic investigators to large-scale clinical trials. The potential of this technology to improve diagnosis and tailored treatment of human disease may soon be realised, now that several comprehensive studies have demonstrated the utility of gene expression profiles for the classification of tumours into distinct, clinically relevant subtypes and the prediction of clinical outcomes. In addition, new data from the emerging proteomics platforms add another layer of molecular information to the study of human disease, as scientists attempt to catalogue a complete inventory of the proteins encoded by the genome and to establish a 'biosignature' profile of human health and disease. As a result, it is anticipated that, together, these technologies will facilitate the comprehensive study of genes, gene products and signalling pathways so that the objective of personalised molecular medicine can be achieved. This paper...","Summary Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a respiratory tract infection caused by a newly emergent coronavirus, that was first recognized in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. Currently, the World Health Organization (WHO) has defined the infection as a global pandemic and there is a health and social emergency for the management of this new infection. While most people with COVID-19 develop only mild or uncomplicated illness, approximately 14% develop severe disease that requires hospitalization and oxygen support, and 5% require admission to an intensive care unit (1). In severe cases, COVID-19 can be complicated by the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), sepsis and septic shock, and multiorgan failure. This consensus document has been prepared on evidence-informed guidelines developed by a multidisciplinary panel of health care providers from four spanish scientific societies (Spanish Society of Intensive Care Medicine [SEMICYUC], Spanish Society of Pulmonologists [SEPAR],...","Ever since the development of the first vaccine more than 200 years ago, vaccinations have greatly decreased the burden of infectious diseases worldwide, famously leading to the eradication of small pox and allowing the restriction of diseases such as polio, tetanus, diphtheria, and measles. A multitude of research efforts focuses on the improvement of established and the discovery of new vaccines such as the HPV (human papilloma virus) vaccine in 2006. However, radical changes in the density, age distribution and traveling habits of the population worldwide as well as the changing climate favor the emergence of old and new pathogens that bear the risk of becoming pandemic threats. In recent years, the rapid spread of severe infections such as HIV, SARS, Ebola, and Zika have highlighted the dire need for global preparedness for pandemics, which necessitates the extremely rapid development and comprehensive distribution of vaccines against potentially previously unknown pathogens. What ...","Abstract Concept of \u201crisk analysis\u201d in food safety management needs to be understood to assess, manage, and communicate risks for proper implementation of food safety policies, food laws, and standards, in a country. Science-based approaches, which are an integral part of risk analysis to improve modern food safety systems, are intimately linked to processes such as good quality practices. Risk analysis strengthens the ability of traditional food safety systems to meet current challenges. Risk analysis is just one part of an effective food safety system. Other components of food safety system like food safety policies, food legislation, food inspection, laboratory analysis, epidemiological surveillance of food-borne diseases, monitoring systems for chemical and microbiological contamination in foods, and information, education and communication, also need to be improved continuously. \u201cFood safety controls\u201d are now being replaced by \u201crisk-based controls\u201d in all stages of food production...","The COVID-19 pandemic is overwhelming healthcare systems worldwide. A significant portion of COVID-19 patients develop pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), necessitating ventilator support. Some health systems do not have the capacity to accommodate this surge in ventilator demand, leading to shortages and inevitable mortality. Some clinicians have, of necessity, jerry-rigged ventilators to support multiple patients, but these devices lack protected air streams or individualized controls for each patient. Moreover, some have not been tested under conditions of ARDS. We have developed the Individualized System for Augmenting Ventilator Efficacy (iSAVE), a rapidly deployable platform to more safely use a single ventilator to simultaneously support multiple critically-ill patients. The iSAVE enables patient-specific volume and pressure control and incorporates safety features to mitigate cross-contamination between patients and flow changes due to patient interdepende...","Summary Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) emerged recently as a new infectious disease that was transmitted efficiently in the healthcare setting and particularly affected healthcare workers (HCWs), patients and visitors. The efficiency of transmission within healthcare facilities was recognised following significant hospital outbreaks of SARS in Canada, China, Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan and Vietnam. The causative agent of SARS was identified as a novel coronavirus, the SARS coronavirus. This was largely spread by direct or indirect contact with large respiratory droplets, although airborne transmission has also been reported. High infection rates among HCWs led initially to the theory that SARS was highly contagious and the concept of \u2018super-spreading events\u2019. Such events illustrated that lack of infection control (IC) measures or failure to comply with IC precautions could lead to large-scale hospital outbreaks. SARS was eventually contained by the stringent application of I...","The two largest Brazilian cities, Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo, have declared community transmission of COVID-19 on mid March, 2020. In this study we estimated the most vulnerable areas in Brazil for COVID-19, both in terms of risk of introduction and risk of mortality associated with social vulnerability. We explore the most likely routes of spread through the country, from the already exposed cities, according to human mobility statistics. The resulting maps should help authorities in their efforts to prioritize actions and if resource allocation to mitigate the effects of the pandemic.","Background: Since December 2019, Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) emerged in Wuhan city and rapidly spread throughout China. The mortality of novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP) in severe and critical cases is very high. Facing this kind of public health emergency, high efficient administrative emergency responsive mode in designated hospital is needed. Method: As an affiliated hospital of Sun Yat-sen University, our hospital is the only designated one for diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19 in Zhuhai, a medium-sized city. Novel coronavirus pneumonia department, which is administrative led by the president of hospital directly, has been established at early stage of epidemic crisis in my hospital. In NCP department, there are core members of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine (PCCM) specialist and multidisciplinary team. Don't stick to national guidelines of NCP, based on professional opinion by respiratory professor and expert group, we focused on individualized treatment and timel...","The past century witnessed a rapid development of respiratory medicine in China. The major burden of respiratory disease has shifted from infectious diseases to chronic noninfectious diseases. Great achievements have been made in improving the national standard of clinical management of various respiratory diseases and in smoking control. The specialty of respiratory medicine is expanding into pulmonary and critical care medicine. Nevertheless, respiratory diseases remain a major public health problem, with new challenges such as air pollution and nosocomial infections. This review describes the history, accomplishments, new challenges, and opportunities in respiratory medicine in China.","Abstract During the first few months of 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic has reached Europe. Health systems all over the world are trying to control the outbreak in the shortest possible time. Exotic disease outbreaks are not uncommon in animal health and randomised surveillance is frequently used as support for decision-making. This editorial discusses the possibilities of practicing One Health, by using methods from animal health to enhance surveillance for COVID-19 to provide an evidence base fort decision-making in communities and countries.","Rapid screening and low-cost diagnosis play a crucial role in choosing the correct course of intervention e.g., drug therapy, quarantine, no action etc. when dealing with highly infectious pathogens. This is especially important if the disease-causing agent has no effective treatment, such as the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (the pathogen causing COVID-19), and shows no or similar symptoms to other common infections. We report a silicon-based integrated Point-of-Need (PoN) transducer (TriSilix) that can chemically-amplify and detect pathogen-specific sequences of nucleic acids (NA) quantitatively in real-time. Unlike other silicon-based technologies, TriSilix can be produced at wafer-scale in a standard laboratory; we have developed a series of methodologies based on metal-assisted chemical (wet) etching, electroplating, thermal bonding and laser-cutting to enable a cleanroom-free low-cost fabrication that does not require processing in an advanced semiconductor foundry. TriSilix is, t...","Widespread, non-stop, and often sensational coverage of the coronavirus (COVID-19) has caught many governments flat-footed in efforts to protect the health and safety of their citizens. In response to the current global health event, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic. Mass gatherings present a historic challenge in protecting the health and safety of attendees. The majority of the prominent mass gatherings are religious in nature. Global sporting events, such as the Olympics and the World Cup, pose unique health risks to attendees and host nations. Deferment or cancellation of such mass gatherings may exert an extraordinary economic loss to the host nation. Universal adoption of best practices for infection control is the surest way for governments to prepare for mass gatherings. In these uncertain times, it is up to intergovernmental organizations to be the voice of reason.","Abstract Pathogenic viruses are viruses that can infect and replicate within human cells and cause diseases. The continuous emergence and re-emergence of pathogenic viruses has become a major threat to public health. Whenever pathogenic viruses emerge, their rapid detection is critical to enable implementation of specific control measures and the limitation of virus spread. Further molecular characterization to better understand these viruses is required for the development of diagnostic tests and countermeasures. Advances in molecular biology techniques have revolutionized the procedures for detection and characterization of pathogenic viruses. The development of PCR-based techniques together with DNA sequencing technology, have provided highly sensitive and specific methods to determine virus circulation. Pathogenic viruses potentially having global catastrophic consequences may emerge in regions where capacity for their detection and characterization is limited. Development of a loc...","The recent spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) exemplifies the critical need for accurate and rapid diagnostic assays to prompt public health actions. Currently, several quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) assays are being used by clinical, research, and public health laboratories for rapid detection of the virus. However, it is currently unclear if results from different tests are comparable. Our goal was to evaluate the primer-probe sets used in four common diagnostic assays available on the World Health Organization (WHO) website. To facilitate this effort, we generated RNA transcripts to create standards and distributed them to other laboratories for internal validation. We then used these RNA transcript standards, full-length SARS-CoV-2 RNA, and RNA-spiked mock samples to determine analytical efficiency and sensitivity of nine primer-probe sets. We show that all primer-probe sets can be used to detect SARS-CoV-2, ...","ABSTRACTCOVID-19 has caused a major epidemic worldwide, however, much is yet to be known about the epidemiology and evolution of the virus. One reason is that the challenges underneath sequencing HCoV-19 directly from clinical samples have not been completely tackled. Here we illustrate the application of amplicon and hybrid capture (capture)-based sequencing, as well as ultra-high-throughput metatranscriptomic (meta) sequencing in retrieving complete genomes, inter-individual and intra-individual variations of HCoV-19 from clinical samples covering a range of sample types and viral load. We also examine and compare the bias, sensitivity, accuracy, and other characteristics of these approaches in a comprehensive manner. This is, to date, the first work systematically implements amplicon and capture approaches in sequencing HCoV-19, as well as the first comparative study across methods. Our work offers practical solutions for genome sequencing and analyses of HCoV-19 and other emerging ...","The rapid spread of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) presents China with a critical challenge. As normal capacity of the Chinese hospitals is exceeded, healthcare professionals struggling to manage this unprecedented crisis face the difficult question of how best to coordinate the medical resources used in highly separated locations. Responding rapidly to this crisis, the National Telemedicine Center of China (NTCC), located in Zhengzhou, Henan Province, has established the Emergency Telemedicine Consultation System (ETCS), a telemedicine-enabled outbreak alert and response network. ETCS is built upon a doctor-to-doctor (D2D) approach, in which health services can be accessed remotely through terminals across hospitals. The system architecture of ETCS comprises three major architectural layers: (1) telemedicine service platform layer, (2) telemedicine cloud layer, and (3) telemedicine service application layer. Our ETCS has demonstrated substantial benefits in terms of the effective...","OBJECTIVES: Timely implementation of influenza infection control and treatment can significantly reduce the impact on Hospital resources and patient management when demand is at peak. Turnaround times of Laboratory based screening tests for the diagnosis of influenza may have an impact on the implementation of infection control measures and treatment. In this study the objectives included determining the correlation between the Abbott ID NOW point-of-care testing (POCT) instrument using the Influenza A&amp;B2 test and the laboratory based GeneXpert Flu+RSV kit. In addition the impact of the POCT instrument on the prescription of antivirals and antibiotics was evaluated by comparing with practice when the instrument was not in place. RESULTS: The results of the correlation study with a cohort of 54 patients revealed the Abbott ID NOW POCT has 92% sensitivity for the detection of Influenza A, while specificity was 100% for both Influenza A and B. The impact of the POCT instrument on the freq...",""],"title":["Modelling strategies to organize healthcare workforce during pandemics: application to COVID-19","Demand for hospitalization services
