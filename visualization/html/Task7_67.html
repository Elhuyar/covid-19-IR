Results: We organized data sharing of published social contact surveys via online repositories and formatting guidelines. We analyzed this social contact data in terms of weighted social contact matrices, next generation matrices, relative incidence and R0. We incorporated location-specific isolation measures (e.g. school closure or telework) and capture their effect on transmission dynamics. All methods have been implemented in an online application based on R Shiny and applied to COVID-19 with age-specific susceptibility and infectiousness. Using our online tool with the available social contact data, we illustrate that social distancing could have a considerable impact on reducing transmission for COVID-19. The effect itself depends on assumptions made about disease-specific characteristics and the choice of intervention(s). Keywords: social contact ...","Abstract On the Internet, there is a lot of open access information related to infectious diseases, e.g., official announcement, media news, bulletin boards, blogs, and other social media. If proper data retrieval and screening methods were applied on these Internet-based data, it would be very useful to improve the timeliness of early detection for infectious diseases. In China, we practice early warning using Internet-based data with routine intelligence screening assessment every day, and respond to any unusual event in a timely manner. Through this mechanism, the surveillance and early warning of Internet-based data for infectious disease and public health emergency plays an important supplemental role to the traditional surveillance systems.","ABSTRACT Treatment of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is experimental, and the effectiveness of ribavirin-steroid therapy is unclear. Forty SARS patients with progressive disease after ribavirin treatment and 1.5 g of pulsed methylprednisolone were given either convalescent plasma (n = 19) or further pulsed methylprednisolone (n = 21) in a retrospective non-randomised study. Good clinical outcome was defined as discharge by day 22 following the onset of symptoms. Convalescent plasma was obtained from recovered patients after informed consent. Patients in the plasma group had a shorter hospital stay (p 0.001) and lower mortality (p 0.049) than the comparator group. No immediate adverse effects were observed following plasma infusion.","Relevant pandemic-spread scenario simulations provide guiding principles for containment and mitigation policy developments. Here we devise a simple model to predict the effectiveness of different mitigation strategies. The model consists of a set of simple differential equations considering the population size, reported and unreported infections, reported and unreported recoveries and the number of Covid-19-inflicted deaths. For simplification, we assume that Covid-19 survivors are immune (e.g. mutations are not considered) and that the virus can only be passed on by persons with undetected infections. While the latter assumption is a simplification (it is neglected that e.g. hospital staff may be infected by detected patients with symptoms), it was introduced here to keep the model as simple as possible. Moreover, the current version of the model does not account for age-dependent differences in the death rates, but considers higher mortality rates due to temporary shortage of intens...","Abstract There are many diseases for which a microbial aetiology is suspected. The hypothesis that a disease has an infectious cause is supported by: clinical features (similar to those of known infectious diseases, e.g. fever, leucocytosis), epidemiology (case clustering in time or location), histology (inflammation of affected tissues, e.g. granulomata) or characteristic microbial structures, treatment (clinical response to antimicrobial treatment), and prevention of disease by vaccines targeting microbial antigens. Proof that a microbe causes a disease requires more rigorous evidence. Future attempts to identify novel microbes associated with human disease may use sequence-based approaches. High-throughput sequencing may allow identification of unique microbial nucleic acid sequences in a background of host DNA. The complete sequencing of the human genome and multiple microbial genomes make this approach more feasible. DNA microarrays are also likely to be used in the search for nov...","Abstract Complex trapping blocking (CTB) enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) and indirect ELISAs for the detection of antibodies to canine parvovirus (CPV), canine coronavirus (CCV) and rotavirus in sera of dogs were established. Double antibody sandwich ELISAs for the detection of CPV-, CCV- and rotavirus antigens in fecal samples were also developed. Both the serological and antigen-detection ELISAs were used to screen samples from dogs in The Netherlands, with or without a history of acute diarrhea. It was shown that the results of the respective serological ELISAs correlated well and that CPV was the major cause of virus-induced acute diarrhea in dogs in The Netherlands.","A new coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, has recently emerged to cause a human pandemic. Whereas molecular diagnostic tests were rapidly developed, serologic assays are still lacking, yet urgently needed. Validated serologic assays are important for contact tracing, identifying the viral reservoir and epidemiological studies. Here, we developed serological assays for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing, spike- and nucleocapsid-specific antibodies. Using serum samples from patients with PCR-confirmed infections of SARS-CoV-2, other coronaviruses, or other respiratory pathogenic infections, we validated and tested various antigens in different in-house and commercial ELISAs. We demonstrate that most PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals seroconverted, as revealed by sensitive and specific in-house ELISAs. We found that commercial S1 IgG or IgA ELISAs were of lower specificity while sensitivity varied between the two, with IgA showing higher sensitivity. Overall, the validated assays d...","A standard SEIR-type compartment model, parameterised for New Zealand, was used to simulate the spread of Covid19 in New Zealand and to test the effectiveness of various control strategies. Control aims can be broadly categorised as either suppression or mitigation. Suppression aims to keep cases to an absolute minimum for as long as possible. Mitigation aims to allow a controlled outbreak to occur, with the aim of preventing significant overloads on healthcare systems and gradually allowing the population to develop herd immunity. Both types of strategy are fraught with uncertainty. Suppression strategies can succeed in delaying an outbreak, but only for as long as such control measures can be sustained. Once controls are eased or restricted, an epidemic is likely to follow as no herd immunity has been acquired. The success or failure of mitigation strategies can depend sensitively on the timing and efficacy of control measures, and require the ability to bring rapidly growing outbrea...","The COVID-19 virus has spread worldwide in a matter of a few months. Healthcare systems struggle to monitor and report current cases. Limited capabilities in testing result in difficult to guide policies and mitigate lack of preparation. Since severe cases, which more likely lead to fatal outcomes, are detected at a higher percentage than mild cases, the reported death rates are likely inflated in most countries. Such under-estimation can be attributed to the under-sampling of infection cases and results in systematic death rate estimation biases. The method proposed here utilizes a benchmark country (South Korea) and its reported death rates in combination with population demographics to correct the reported COVID-19 case numbers. By applying a correction, we predict that the number of cases is highly under-reported in most countries. In the case of China, it is estimated that more than 700.000 cases of COVID-19 actually occurred instead of the confirmed 80,932 cases as of 3/13/2020.","An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and a rapid immunochromatographic test for detection of immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies in severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) patients were developed by utilizing the well-characterized recombinant proteins Gst-N and Gst-U274. The ELISA detected IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV in all 74 convalescent-phase samples from SARS patients while weakly cross-reacting to only 1 of the 210 control sera from healthy donors. This finding thus led to a kit sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of 100, 99.5, and 99.6%, respectively. The test thus provided a positive predictive value (PPV) of 98.7% and a negative predictive value (NPV) of 100%. In addition, the ELISA gave a positive delta of 5.4 and a negative delta of 3.6, indicating an excellent differentiation between positives and negatives. The same recombinant proteins were also applied to a newly developed platform for the development of a 15-min rapid test. The resulting rapid test has an excel...","The number of confirmed COVID-19 cases admitted in hospitals is continuously increasing in the Philippines. Frontline health care workers are faced with imminent risks of getting infected. In this study, we formulate a theoretical model to calculate the risk of being infected in health care facilities considering the following factors: the average number of encounters with a suspected COVID-19 patient per hour; interaction time for each encounter; work shift duration or exposure time; crowd density, which may depend on the amount of space available in a given location; and availability and effectiveness of protective gears and facilities provided for the frontline health care workers. Based on the simulation results, we recommend the following: (i) decrease the rate of patient encounter per frontline health care worker, e.g., maximum of three encounters per hour in a 12-hour work shift duration; (ii) decrease the interaction time between the frontline health care worker and the patient...","As the international community responds to an outbreak of coronavirus-induced pneumonia in Wuhan, China, early and open data sharing \u2014 which are vital for its control \u2014 depend on the trust that the data will not be used without proper attribution to those who generated it.","Abstract Medicine shortages have been spreading in European countries. In many cases, the unavailability of medicinal products has a substantial impact on the capability of National Healthcare Systems in ensuring the continuity of care. Shortages originate from multifactorial causes. In particular, they can be due to supply-related factors (e.g., manufacturing issues, regulatory issues, logistics, distribution) and demand-related ones (e.g., fluctuating drug demand, parallel market, tendering, price and reimbursement policies). However, some extraordinary geopolitical events (e.g., Brexit) may also affect medicines\u2019 availability. The capability of European Regulatory Authorities and other stakeholders, which are involved in the pharmaceutical distribution chain and the healthcare assistance services, to define suitable problem-solving strategies has been limited for years by the fragmentation of the European regulatory framework, starting from the lack of a univocal definition of a med...","The ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic demands rapid identification of immunogenic targets for the design of efficient vaccines and serological detection tools. In this report, using pools of overlapping linear peptides and functional assays, we present two immunodominant regions on the spike glycoprotein that were highly recognized by neutralizing antibodies in the sera of COVID-19 convalescent patients. One is highly specific to SARS-CoV-2, and the other is a potential pan-coronavirus target.","","Abstract Background An ongoing epidemic of respiratory diseases caused by a novel coronavirus (COVID 2019, SARS-CoV2) started in Wuhan, Hubei, in China at the end of December 2019. The French government decided to repatriate the 337 French nationals living in Wuhan and place them in quarantine in their home country. We decided to test them all for SARS-Cov2 twice in order to reduce anxiety among the population and decision-makers. Methods We investigated the presence of SARS-CoV-19 in asymptomatic carriers by testing all repatriated patients within the first 24 h of their arrival in France and at day 5. Viral RNA was extracted from pooled nasal and oropharyngeal swab fluids or sputum in the absence of nasal/oropharyngeal swabs. Detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA was then carried out using several real-time reverse transcription (RT)-PCR assays. Results We tested 337 passengers at day 0 and day 5. All the tests for SARS-CoV2 were negative. By optimising the sampling process, sending samples se...","The spread of a novel pathogenic infectious agent eliciting protective immunity is typically characterised by three distinct phases: (I) an initial phase of slow accumulation of new infections (often undetectable), (II) a second phase of rapid growth in cases of infection, disease and death, and (III) an eventual slow down of transmission due to the depletion of susceptible individuals, typically leading to the termination of the (first) epidemic wave. Before the implementation of control measures (e.g. social distancing, travel bans, etc) and under the assumption that infection elicits protective immunity, epidemiological theory indicates that the ongoing epidemic of SARS-CoV-2 will conform to this pattern. Here, we calibrate a susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) model to data on cumulative reported SARS-CoV-2 associated deaths from the United Kingdom (UK) and Italy under the assumption that such deaths are well reported events that occur only in a vulnerable fraction of the populati...","","AbstractThe rapid sharing of sequence information as seen throughout the current SARS-CoV-2 epidemic, represents an inflection point for genomic epidemiology. Here we describe aspects of coronavirus evolutionary genetics revealed from these data, and provide the first direct RNA sequence of SARS-CoV-2, detailing coronaviral subgenome-length mRNA architecture.","Abstract Background The Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) emerged in 2012 and attracted an international attention as the virus caused multiple healthcare associated outbreaks. There are reports of the role of asymptomatic individuals in the transmission of MERS-CoV, however, the exact role is not known. Method The MEDLINE/PubMed and Scopus databases were searched for relevant papers published till August 2018 describing asymptomatic MERS-CoV infection. Results A total of 10 papers were retrieved and included in the final analysis and review. The extent of asymptomatic MERS infection had increased with change in the policy of testing asymptomatic contacts. In early cases in April 2012\u2013October 2013, 12.5% were asymptomatic among 144 PCR laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV cases while in 2014 the proportion rose to 25.1% among 255 confirmed cases. The proportion of asymptomatic cases reported among pediatric confirmed MERS-CoV cases were higher (41.9%\u201381.8%). Overall, the...","Early recognition and rapid initiation of infection control precautions are currently the most important strategies for controlling severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). No rapid diagnostic tests currently exist that can rule out SARS among patients with febrile respiratory illnesses. Clinical features alone cannot with certainty distinguish SARS from other respiratory illnesses rapidly enough to inform early management decisions. A balanced approach to screening that allows early recognition of SARS without unnecessary isolation of patients with other respiratory illnesses will require clinicians not only to look for suggestive clinical features but also to routinely seek epidemiologic clues suggestive of SARS coronavirus exposure. Key epidemiologic risk factors include 1) exposure to settings where SARS activity is suspected or documented, or 2) in the absence of such exposure, epidemiologic linkage to other persons with pneumonia (i.e., pneumonia clusters), or 3) exposure to hea...","","BACKGROUND: There is an ongoing debate regarding the type of respiratory protection that should be recommended for use for healthcare workers. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was conducted in three countries: China, Pakistan and Vietnam. RESULTS: In China and Pakistan, the infection control guidelines were developed to be in line with the recommendations from the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, while in the Vietnamese guidelines the recommendations correspond with the WHO suggestions only. The guidelines from all three countries document the need for training and fit testing; however there is no system to monitor the training and fit testing programs. Across the three countries, there was some inconsistency with regard to the types of products (i.e. masks vs. respirators) recommended for influenza, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and tuberculosis. CONCLUSIONS: Available evidence should be examined and a compre...","Abstract The etiological agent of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) has been identified as a novel coronavirus SARS-CoV. Similar to other coronaviruses, spike (S)-glycoprotein of the virus interacts with a cellular receptor and mediates membrane fusion to allow viral entry into susceptible target cells. Accordingly, S-protein plays an important role in virus infection cycle and is the primary target of neutralizing antibodies. To begin to understand its biochemical and immunological properties, we expressed both full-length and ectodomain of the protein in various primate cells. Our results show that the protein has an electrophoretic mobility of about 160\u2013170 kDa. The protein is glycosylated with high mannose and/or hybrid oligosaccharides, which account for approximately 30 kDa of the apparent protein mass. The detection of S-protein by immunoassays was difficult using human convalescent sera, suggesting that the protein may not elicit strong humoral immune response in virus-i...","Two months after the emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the possibility of established and widespread community transmission in the European Union and European Economic Area (EU/EEA) is becoming more likely. We provide scenarios for use in preparedness for a possible widespread epidemic. The EU/EEA is moving towards the \u2018limited sustained transmission\u2019 phase. We propose actions to prepare for potential mitigation phases and coordinate efforts to protect the health of citizens.","","A newly developed severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was further validated to confirm cutoff values and evaluate its diagnostic performance with clinical samples. In parallel, an immunochromatographic test was also evaluated. A total of 227 clinical serum specimens collected from SARS patients were used in the study, together with 385 samples from healthy donors. By use of an immunofluorescent (IF) test as the \u201cgold standard, \u201d both the ELISA and the immunochromatographic test were able to detect immunoglobulin G antibodies to SARS not only from late-convalescent-stage samples (&gt;21 days from the onset of clinical symptoms), as previously established, but also from early-acute-phase samples (1 to 10 days from onset). The ELISA, using an optical density (OD) of 0.25 as its cutoff value, produced the best sensitivity while maintaining high specificity. It detected SARS-specific antibodies in 58, 70, 75, and 95%, respectively, of the...","Abstract Human coronavirus, hCoV-19, is highly pathogenic with severe pneumonia associated with rapid virus replication. Arising in Wuhan China December 2019, the current COVID-19 epidemic has rapidly grown with person-to-person infection expanding to become a global health emergency now on pandemic scale. In mitigation of this current COVID-19 pandemic, according to Anderson et al. 2020 [1], governments will not be able to minimise both deaths from COVID-19 and the economic impact of viral spread. Keeping mortality as low as possible will be the highest priority for individuals; hence governments must put in place measures to ameliorate the inevitable economic downturn. The current global picture shows small chains of transmission in many countries and large chains resulting in extensive spread in a few countries, such as Italy, Iran, South Korea, and Japan. Most countries are likely to have spread of COVID-19, at least in the early stages, before any mitigation measures have an impac...","With the worldwide outbreak of COVID-19, an accurate model to predict how the coronavirus pandemic will evolve becomes important and urgent to help policy makers in different countries address the epidemic outbreak and determine policies to control spread more efficiently and effectively. Unlike the classic public health and virus propagation models, this new projection model takes government intervention and public response into account to make reliable projections of the outbreak 10 days to 2 weeks in advance.","Countries across the world observed dramatic rises in COVID-19 cases and deaths in March 2020. In the United States, delays in the availability of diagnostic testing have prompted questions about the extent of unobserved community transmission. Using a simulation model informed by reported cases and deaths, we estimated that tens of thousands of people (median: \u200b22,876, 95% posterior predictive interval: 7,451 - 53,044) were infected by the time a national emergency was declared. Our results also indicate that fewer than 10% of locally acquired, symptomatic infections in the US were detected throughout much of late February. These results point to the need for immediate, large-scale efforts to mitigate the impacts of SARS-CoV-2 on the US.","Individual quarantine and active monitoring of contacts are core disease control strategies, particularly for emerging infectious diseases such as Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). To estimate the comparative efficacy of these interventions to control COVID-19, we fit a stochastic branching model, comparing two sets of reported parameters for the dynamics of the disease. Our results suggest that individual quarantine may contain an outbreak of COVID-19 with a short serial interval (4.8 days) only in settings with high intervention performance where at least three-quarters of infected contacts are individually quarantined. However, in settings where this performance is unrealistically high and the outbreak of COVID-19 continues to grow, so too will the burden of the number of contacts traced for active monitoring or quarantine. In such circumstances where resources are prioritized for scalable interventions such as social distancing, we show active monitoring or individual quarantine...","Abstract The Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is a newly identified pathogen able of human transmission that causes a mortality of almost 40%. As in the case of SARS-CoV, MERS virus lacking E protein represents a potential vaccine. In both cases, abolishment of channel activity may be a contributor to the attenuation observed in E-deleted viruses. Herein, we report that purified MERS-CoV E protein, like SARS-CoV E protein, is almost fully \u03b1-helical, has a single \u03b1-helical transmembrane domain, and forms pentameric ion channels in lipid bilayers. Based on these similarities, and the proposed involvement of channel activity as virulence factor in SARS-CoV E protein, MERS-CoV E protein may constitute a potential drug target.","","Traveller screening is being used to limit further global spread of 2019 novel coronavirus (nCoV) following its recent emergence. Here, we analyze the expected impact of different travel screening programs given remaining uncertainty around the values of key nCoV life history and epidemiological parameters. Even under best-case assumptions, we estimate that screening will miss around half of infected travellers. Breaking down the factors leading to screening successes and failures, we find that most cases missed by screening are fundamentally undetectable, because they have not yet developed symptoms and are unaware they were exposed. These findings emphasize the need for measures to track travellers who become ill after being missed by a travel screening program. We make our model available for interactive use so stakeholders can explore scenarios of interest using the most up-to-date information. We hope these findings contribute to evidence-based policy to combat the spread of nCoV,...","","DNA microarrays may be used to identify microbial species present in environmental and clinical samples. However, automated tools for reliable species identification based on observed microarray hybridization patterns are lacking. We present an algorithm, E-Predict, for microarray-based species identification. E-Predict compares observed hybridization patterns with theoretical energy profiles representing different species. We demonstrate the application of the algorithm to viral detection in a set of clinical samples and discuss its relevance to other metagenomic applications.","Background: The overall objective of this rapid review was to identify infection protection and control recommendations from published clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) for adults aged 60 years and older in long-term care settings Methods: Comprehensive searches in MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, and relevant CPG publishers/repositories were carried out in early March 2020. Title/abstract and full-text screening, data abstraction, and quality appraisal (AGREE-II) were carried out by single reviewers. Results: A total of 17 relevant CPGs were identified, published in the USA (n=8), Canada (n=6), Australia (n=2), and the United Kingdom (n=1). All of the CPGs dealt with infection control in long-term care facilities (LTCF) and addressed various types of viral respiratory infections (e.g., influenza, COVID-19, severe acute respiratory syndrome). Ten or more CPGs recommended the following infection control measures in LTCF: hand hygiene (n=13), wearing personal protective equipment...","We computed reproduction number of COVID-19 epidemic in Iran using two different methods. We estimated R0 at 3.6 (95% CI, 3.2, 4.2) (generalized growth model) and at 3.58 (95% CI, 1.29, 8.46) (estimated epidemic doubling time of 1.20 (95% CI, 1.05, 1.44) days) respectively. Immediate social distancing measures are recommended.","The novel coronavirus, COVID-19, has sparked an outflow of scientific research seeking to understand the virus, its spread, and best practices in prevention and treatment. If this international research effort is going to be as swift and effective as possible, it will need to rely on a principle of open science. When researchers share data, code, and software and generally make their work as transparent as possible, it allows other researchers to verify and expand upon their work. Furthermore, it allows public officials to make informed decisions. In this study, we analyzed 535 preprint articles related to COVID-19 for eight transparency criteria and recorded study location and funding information. We found that individual researchers have lined up to help during this crisis, quickly tackling important public health questions, often without funding or support from outside organizations. However, most authors could improve their data sharing and scientific reporting practices. The contr...","","Abstract Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) is caused by a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV). Coronaviruses including SARS-CoV encode an envelope (E) protein, a small, hydrophobic membrane protein. We report that, in planar lipid bilayers, synthetic peptides corresponding to the SARS-CoV E protein forms ion channels that are more permeable to monovalent cations than to monovalent anions. Affinity-purified polyclonal antibodies recognizing the N-terminal 19 residues of SARS-CoV E protein were used to establish the specificity of channel formation by inhibiting the ion currents generated in the presence of the E protein peptides.","AbstractSARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV share a common human receptor ACE2. Protein-protein interaction structure modeling indicates that spike-RBD of the two viruses also has similar overall binding conformation and binding free energy to ACE2. In vitro assays using recombinant ACE2 proteins and ACE2 expressing cells confirmed the two coronaviruses\u2019 similar binding affinities to ACE2. The above studies provide experimental supporting evidences and possible explanation for the high transmissibility observed in the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak. Potent ACE2-blocking SARS-CoV neutralizing antibodies showed limited cross-binding and neutralizing activities to SARS-CoV-2. ACE2-non-blocking SARS-CoV RBD antibodies, though with weaker neutralizing activities against SARS-CoV, showed positive cross-neutralizing activities to SARS-CoV-2 with an unknown mechanism. These findings suggest a trade-off between the efficacy and spectrum for therapeutic antibodies to different coronaviruses, and hence highlight the po...","Abstract This document outlines recommendations for physiotherapy management for COVID-19 in the acute hospital setting. It includes: recommendations for physiotherapy workforce planning and preparation; a screening tool for determining requirement for physiotherapy; and recommendations for the selection of physiotherapy treatments and personal protective equipment. It is intended for use by physiotherapists and other relevant stakeholders in the acute care setting caring for adult patients with suspected and/or confirmed COVID-19.","Two neutralizing human scFv, b1 and h12 were identified initially using ELISA,employing highly purified virus as the coating antigen. The biosensor technique based on imaging ellipsometry was employed directly to detect two neutralizing monoclonal antibodies and serial serum samples from 10 SARS patients and 12 volunteers who had not SARS. Further, the kinetic process of interaction between the antibodies and SARS-CoV was studied using the real-time function of the biosensor. The biosensor is consistent with ELISA that the antibody h12 showed a higher affinity in encountering the virus than antibody b1. The affinity of antibody b1 and antibody h12 was 9.5 \u00d7 10(6) M(\u22121) and 1.36 \u00d7 10(7) M(\u2212 1), respectively. As a label free method, the biosensor based on imaging ellipsometry proved to be a more competent mechanism for measuring serum samples from SARS patients and the affinity between these antibodies and the SARS coronavirus.","The newly identified 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) has caused more than 11,900 laboratory-confirmed human infections, including 259 deaths, posing a serious threat to human health. Currently, however, there is no specific antiviral treatment or vaccine. Considering the relatively high identity of receptor-binding domain (RBD) in 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV, it is urgent to assess the cross-reactivity of anti-SARS CoV antibodies with 2019-nCoV spike protein, which could have important implications for rapid development of vaccines and therapeutic antibodies against 2019-nCoV. Here, we report for the first time that a SARS-CoV-specific human monoclonal antibody, CR3022, could bind potently with 2019-nCoV RBD (KD of 6.3 nM). The epitope of CR3022 does not overlap with the ACE2 binding site within 2019-nCoV RBD. These results suggest that CR3022 may have the potential to be developed as candidate therapeutics, alone or in combination with other neutralizing antibodies, for the prevention a...","","AbstractThe SARS-CoV-2 epidemic has rapidly spread outside China with major outbreaks occurring in Italy, South Korea and Iran. Phylogenetic analyses of whole genome sequencing data identified a distinct SARS-CoV-2 clade linked to travellers returning from Iran to Australia and New Zealand. This study highlights potential viral diversity driving the epidemic in Iran, and underscores the power of rapid genome sequencing and public data sharing to improve the detection and management of emerging infectious diseases.","","","To learn how outbreaks of infectious disease are detected and to describe the entities and information systems that together function to identify outbreaks in the U.S., the authors drew on multiple sources of information to create a description of existing surveillance systems and how they interact to detect outbreaks. The results of this analysis were summarized in a system diagram. The authors reviewed a sample of recent outbreaks to determine how they were detected, with reference to the system diagram. The de facto U.S. system for detection of outbreaks consists of five components: the clinical health care system, local/state health agencies, federal agencies, academic/professional organizations, and collaborating governmental organizations. Primary data collection occurs at the level of clinical health care systems and local health agencies. The review of a convenience sample of outbreaks showed that all five components of the system participated in aggregating, analyzing, and sha..."],"title":["SOCRATES: An online tool leveraging a

Because of its reproducibility and flexibility, it is the most common serological assay used in the viral diagnostics lab. The general scheme is to capture virus antigens or virus-specific antibodies on a solid surface and to expose the bound complex with a substrate. ELISAs specific for IgM and IgG antibodies can distinguish between recent infection and previous exposure or vaccination. Detection of virus antigen indicates an acute stage of virus infection. The microtiter plate format can test multiple patient samples with different dilutions of antibodies to determine a serological titer, and sequential sampling of patient' s serum over the course of an acute infection can allow detection of seroconversion. An increase in titers of IgG antibodies twofold to fourfold over 2 weeks is diagnostic of an active primary infection. ELISAs are frequently used in serosurveys where populations are screened to determine the efficacy of immunization programs or previous exposure to a newly identified virus.","\u2610Types of facilitators and barriers that were considered \u2610Methods by which information regarding the facilitators and barriers to implementing recommendations were sought (e.g., feedback from key stakeholders, pilot testing of guidelines before widespread implementation) NR \u2610Information/description of the types of facilitators and barriers that emerged from the inquiry (e.g., practitioners have the skills to deliver the recommended care, sufficient equipment is not available to ensure all eligible members of the population receive mammography) \u2610Types of cost information that were considered (e.g., economic evaluations, drug acquisition costs)","\u2610Types of facilitators and barriers that were considered \u2610Methods by which information regarding the facilitators and barriers to implementing recommendations were sought (e.g., feedback from key stakeholders, pilot testing of guidelines before widespread implementation) \u2610Information/description of the types of facilitators and barriers that emerged from the inquiry (e.g., practitioners have the skills to deliver the recommended care, sufficient equipment is not available to ensure all eligible members of the population receive mammography) \u2610How the information influenced the guideline development process and/or formation of the recommendations 19.

As shown in Fig. 4A , sera from two patients were able to specifically neutralize SARS pseudoviruses; the same convalescent sera could not neu-tralize HIV-1 or VSV-G pseudoviruses and no neutralizing activity was observed with a normal serum. To determine neutralizing antibody titers in virus-infected patients, we performed the assay with serially diluted sera from seven patients. As shown in Fig. 4B , antibody levels were quite similar in all patients with 50% neutralization titer between 1:15 and 1:25.","If well tracked, early introductions of an emerging pathogen provide a unique opportunity to characterize its transmission, natural history, and the effectiveness of screening. The careful monitoring of cases and low probability of infection from the general community enables inferences, critical to modeling the course of the outbreak, that are difficult to make during a widely disseminated epidemic. In particular, we are able to make assumptions about when and where cases were likely infected that are impossible when the pathogen is widespread. Furthermore, during these early phases, uninfected and asymptomatic contacts are often closely tracked, providing critical information on transmission and natural history. Combined, this data on early introductions can be used to give insights into disease natural history 9 , transmission characteristics 10 , and the unseen burden of infection 11 .","Reduced-Form Approach The reduced-form econometric approach that we apply here is a \"top down\" approach that describes the behavior of aggregate outcomes y in data (here, infection rates). This approach can identify plausibly causal effects 23, 24 induced by exogenous changes in independent policy variables z (e.g. school closure) without explicitly describing all underlying mechanisms that link z to y and without observing intermediary variables x (e.g. behavior) that might link z to y nor other determinants of y unrelated to z (e.g. demographics), denoted w.

Latest WHO guidelines now recommend universal screening to defi ne the epidemiology of this novel coronavirus. 12 Available molecular tests for detection of active cases of infection and screening of contacts are experimental and their sensitivity and specifi city require defi nition. Serological tests for the novel coronavirus are urgently needed for accurate assessment of infection in asymptomatic contacts and for large-scale serosurveys to improve understanding of the epidemiology and global geographical distribution of this virus. Validated standard treatment protocols and case investigation forms are also needed. Findings of controlled studies of cases and contacts could provide information that leads to the source of infection.","\u2610A statement that the guideline will be updated NR Describe the procedure for updating the guideline. \u2610Explicit time interval or explicit criteria to guide decisions about when an update will occur \u2610Methodology for the updating procedure \u2610Methods by which information regarding the facilitators and barriers to implementing recommendations were sought (e.g., feedback from key stakeholders, pilot testing of guidelines before widespread implementation) \u2610Information/description of the types of facilitators and barriers that emerged from the inquiry (e.g., practitioners have the skills to deliver the recommended care, sufficient equipment is not available to ensure all eligible members of the population receive mammography)","Limitations of this study includes the relatively small number of patients and inconsistent 117 series of sera which ideally should have been collected at a predetermined regular time interval 118 to determine when IgM and IgG can be detected after infection in COVID-19 by these assays. 119 We also did not take into account other factors which could cause the delay in development of In conclusion, we provided proof of concept that the available SARS-CoV antibody 133 assays can reliably detect antibodies in patients with COVID-19 which could be used in this 134 current outbreak situation for serosurveys and as a diagnostic tool for under resourced countries.","The other major immunodominant protein of SARS-CoV is the S protein which has been used in IFAs, ELISAs and WB analysis as well as for the generation of pseudotyped particles to develop a biosafe VNT (Fukushi et al., 2008; Hofmann et al., 2004) . The majority of neutralizing antibodies were found to be directed against the S protein (Buchholz et al., 2004) . For IFA, it was possible to use both full-length S, stably expressed in mammalian cells (Tan et al., 2004) , and a fragment (amino acids (aa) 441-700) expressed in insect cells using baculovirus (Manopo et al., 2005) . By contrast, because of the technical difficulties in expressing the full-length protein in bacteria, only fragments were used in ELISAs and WB analysis. In general, antibodies directed against the S protein appeared later in infection than those directed against the N protein (Tan et al., 2004; Woo et al., 2005) , indicating that S protein-based assays may be preferable for use with convalescent sera. Overall, reactivity of SARS patient sera with S protein differed grossly between different studies and types of assays, ranging from very low (13%) in one study (Leung et al., 2004) to 100% in several other studies (Table 2) . There was a marked difference between detection rates with IFAs (100%), ELISAs (13-96%) and WB analysis (40-100%) ( Table 2 ). The advantage of an IFA can be explained by its use of transfected cells that facilitate correct folding and post-translational modifications (e.g., glycosylation) of the S protein, whereas an ELISA and WB analysis use only denatured linear forms without proper glycosylation. For glycoprotein 120 (gp120) of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), it was shown that altered glycosylation patterns influence the host immune response (Grundner et al., 2004) . Therefore patients that produce mainly antibodies recognizing conformational epitopes or glycosylation-dependent epitopes of the S protein could be tested as false negatives in an ELISA or WB analysis. That ELISAs and WB analysis are only able to use S protein fragments, as mentioned above, provides a plausible explanation for the variable results found between different assays.","recommendations \u2610Criteria for assessing impact of implementing the recommendations \u2610Advice on the frequency and interval of measurement \u2610Operational definitions of how the criteria should be measured \u2610A statement that the guideline will be updated \u2610Explicit time interval or explicit criteria to guide decisions about when an update will occur \u2610Methodology for the updating procedure \u2610Types of facilitators and barriers that were considered \u2610Methods by which information regarding the facilitators and barriers to implementing recommendations were sought (e.g., feedback from key stakeholders, pilot testing of guidelines before widespread implementation)","\u2610Information/description of the cost information that emerged from the inquiry (e.g., specific drug acquisition costs per treatment course) \u2610How the information gathered was used to inform the guideline development process and/or formation of the recommendations 21.

Videos uploaded by news agencies with information on current status of the disease in terms of mortality and extent of spread only, without any information on prevention, treatment, or measures to combat the disease were classified as news update. This classification has been used in evaluation of information during previous epidemics 10, 19, 20 We used modified DISCERN score to assess the reliability of the videos 15 . This score allocates one point each for clarity, reliable source of information, lack of bias, reference supplementation and mention of uncertainty (Table 1) Table 1 .The kappa coefficient of agreement was used to determine degree of agreement between the two researchers.","Ethical challenges. The unprecedented challenge represented by COVID-19 has brought novel and dramatic ethical dilemmas, ranging from policy issues (e.g. focusing on containment and mitigation vs. herd immunity), as well as clinical dilemmas (e.g. considering all patients alike vs triaging patients according to age, comorbidities and expected prognosis, similar to other catastrophic circumstances).","The use of neutralizing monoclonal antibodies directed against the SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV spike glycoprotein is another approach that may provide protection from severe disease. The success in the development and use of humanized monoclonal antibodies against respiratory syncytial virus (family Paramyxoviridae) to protect infants from severe disease indicates that this approach is certainly worth investigating. Studies have shown that patient convalescent serum and monoclonal antibodies directed against the SARS-CoV spike glycoprotein efficiently neutralize infectious virus. Further studies are essential to evaluate any concerns about potential antibody-mediated enhancement of disease and to determine if neutralization escape mutants arise rapidly after challenge with infectious virus. Studies evaluating monoclonal antibodies directed against a variety of structural proteins, and monoclonal antibodies directed against conserved sites in the spike glycoprotein will provide important information on the efficacy of passive immunity to protect against emerging coronaviruses.","Results: IFA, ELISA and CFA values between laboratories using the same methods were within close range and all three methods correctly identified the Q fever patients. In house and commercial IFAs were well comparable quantitatively. In titres reached some differences could be observed. All tests were reasonably specific (92-100%), however the sensitivity showed more variation. IFA was the most sensitive test for both phase 1 and 2, with a sensitivity of 100% if IgG and IgM responses were combined. For phase 2 antibodies the CFA performed well (100%) but the sensitivity for phase 1 was only 61%. The phase 1 IgG ELISA was more sensitive (67%) than phase 1 CFA, while phase 2 IgG and IgM ELISAs were less sensitive than CFA (using the manufacturer's instructions). Discussion: The higher sensitivity of the IFA was supported in the serial dilution, however these observations were based on a limited number of samples and should be refined using a larger set of sera. The IFA appears the method of choice if high sensitivity is required (e.g. early phase of illness). ELISAs can be an alternative or for screening of large sample numbers.","\u2610Description of the external reviewers (e.g., number, type of reviewers, affiliations) \u2610Outcomes/information gathered from the external review (e.g., summary of key findings) \u2610How the information gathered was used to inform the guideline development process and/or formation of the recommendations (e.g., guideline panel considered results of review in forming final recommendations)","Presbyacusis in animals has been studied in guinea pigs, rats, mice, dogs, and cats. Degeneration of the hair cells in the organ of Corti and loss of neurons from the spiral ganglion are the common denominators in all such instances, and presumably is the aging change common to all mammalian species. Stria vascularis atrophy has not been seen in these animals.","A number of key gaps remain in epidemiology, including transmission, population-based incidence or prevalence rates, and geographic and demographic distributions of infections. Based on the limited human seroprevalence data so far, it seems likely that population prevalence is low, but the baseline should be established. It is also not clear whether seropositivity is a reliable indicator of prior infection. The finding of variable low antibody titers at 1 year postinfection (Choe et al. 2017) indicates that methods other than traditional serosurveys may be required (Reusken et al. 2013a, Malik et al. 2016). If serology is not reliable, this raises the question of how to screen populations. There are methods that are both more sensitive and more specific for antibody detection (Mishra et al. 2018), as well as assays of cellular immunity (Zhao et al. 2017), but are costlier and more difficult for population screening.","Although laboratory-based surveillance remains a cornerstone of influenza surveillance, the need for more timely surveillance data has never been greater. With the routine and daily movement of persons between communities, an infectious disease can rapidly spread around the world in a matter of days. In addition, much has been learned about how infectious diseases like influenza spread and what methods can and should be used to help minimize spread and potential impacts. Successful results of most mitigation strategies (e.g., cough etiquette, hand washing, staying home when sick, and vaccination reminders) are best achieved if implemented in the community as early as possible.","Every 30-40 yr an influenza pandemic occurs. With global travel and commerce, the risk that a local outbreak can rapidly become widespread is high. Mitigation of the threat of a pandemic will require coordinated efforts of multiple countries and health and governmental authorities. Locally, prevention and treatment measures must be planned for to minimize threat to transplant recipients.","Finally, we compared the performance of the different ELISAs for the detection of antibodies among PCR-confirmed COVID-19 patients to that of PRNT, as the gold standard for CoV serology ( Table 3) . PRNT50 correlated strongly with the different ELISAs, with the commercial IgA showing the strongest correlation followed by the S and N ELISAs indicating their capacity to detect SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies. However, a larger patient cohort is needed to assess the sensitivity of these platforms.","\u2610Methods by which the cost information was sought (e.g., a health economist was part of the guideline development panel, use of health technology assessments for specific drugs, etc.) \u2610Information/description of the cost information that emerged from the inquiry (e.g., specific drug acquisition costs per treatment course) \u2610How the information gathered was used to inform the guideline development process and/or formation of the recommendations \u2612Recommendations in a summarized box, typed in bold, underlined, or presented as flow charts or algorithms \u2610Specific recommendations grouped together in one section DOMAIN 5: APPLICABILITY","Basic public health measures, such as social distancing, proper hand hygiene, and self-isolation are thus not possible or extremely difficult to implement in refugee camps. If no immediate measures to improve conditions are put in place, the concern about an outbreak of COVID-19 in the camps cannot be overstated. Sitespecific epidemiological risk assessments must be done to determine the extent of the risk of COVID-19 introduction and transmission in such settlements, together with case management protocols and rapid deployment of outbreak response teams if needed.","The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.18.20038059 doi: medRxiv preprint Figure 4 : Sensitivity of the two commercial ELISAs for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG (A,C,E) and IgA (B,D,F) antibodies. Kinetics of antibody responses in 9 COVID-19 patients from Germany (A,B). Correlation between antibody responses detected by the ELISAs and the plaque reduction neutralization assay (PRNT50; C,D). (E,F) The kits were tested for specificity using18 serum samples from HCoV (4x HCoV-229E, 3x HCoV-HKU1, 4x HCoV-NL63, 7x HCoV-OC43) as well as MERS-CoV (n=3) and SARS-CoV (n=3) infected persons.","Besides the mathematical differences between M 1 (t) and M 0 p (t), CFR, estimating M 0 p (t) and CFR(t) from aggregate populations implicitly incorporate a number of confounding factors that lead to variability in these estimates. In Fig. 4 , we plot the population-level mortality-ratio estimates M 0 p against the CFR for different regions and observe large variations and very little correlation between countries [25] . As of March 26, 2020, the value of M 0 p in Italy is almost 45% and can increase further if the current conditions (e.g., treatment methods, age group proportion of infecteds, etc.) do not change. Differences between the mortality ratios in China and Italy (see Figs. 1(b) and (c) ) might be a result of varying medical treatment strategies, different practices in data collecting (e.g., post-mortem testing), and differences in the age demographics between the countries.","ELISAs have been popular for antibody detection in many different diseases, but have some disadvantages compared to indirect immunofluorescent antibody testing. Takano et al. (2013a) developed three new immunochromatographic assays using recombinant feline coronavirus nucleocapsid protein. Two of the three tests were plagued by non-specific binding, while a third assay incorporating a protein A blotting step proved equal in specificity and sensitivity to standard ELISAs in detecting antibodies in plasma, serum, whole blood and ascitic fluid, while presumably being simpler to run.","This relationship can be used to determine how many people will require hospitalisation (and possibly die) in the coming weeks if we are able to accurately determine current levels of herd immunity. There is thus an urgent need for investment in technologies such as virus (or viral pseudotype) neutralization assays and other robust assays which provide reliable read-outs of protective immunity, and for the provision of open access to valuable data sources such as blood banks and paired samples of acute and convalescent sera from confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 to validate these. Urgent development and assessment of such tests should be followed by rapid implementation at scale to provide real-time data. These data will be critical to the proper assessment of the effects of social distancing and other measures currently being adopted to slow down the case incidence and for informing future policy direction.","Fever 1 and symptoms of respiratory illness (not necessarily pneumonia; e.g., cough, shortness of breath) Fever 1 or symptoms of respiratory illness (not necessarily pneumonia; e.g., cough, shortness of breath) and Close contact 3 with a confirmed MERS case while the case was ill. Footnotes 1 Fever may not be present in some patients, such as those who are very young, elderly, immunosuppressed, or taking certain medications. Clinical judgment should be used to guide testing of patients in such situations. 2 Countries considered in the Arabian Peninsula and neighboring include: Bahrain; Iraq; Iran; Israel, the West Bank, and Gaza; Jordan; Kuwait; Lebanon; Oman; Qatar; Saudi Arabia; Syria; the United Arab Emirates (UAE); and Yemen. 3 Close contact is defined as a) being within approximately 6 feet (2 meters), or within the room or care area, of a confirmed MERS case for a prolonged period of time (such as caring for, living with, visiting, or sharing a healthcare waiting area or room with, a confirmed MERS case) while not wearing recommended personal protective equipment or PPE (e.g., gowns, gloves, NIOSH-certified disposable N95 respirator, eye protection); or b) having direct contact with infectious secretions of a confirmed MERS case (e.g., being coughed on) while not wearing recommended personal protective equipment. See CDC's Interim Infection Prevention and Control Recommendations for Hospitalized Patients with MERS(https:// www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/mers/infection-prevention-control.html). Data to inform the definition of close contact are limited; considerations when assessing close contact include the duration of exposure (e.g., longer exposure time likely increases exposure risk) and the clinical symptoms of the person with MERS (e.g., coughing likely increases exposure risk). Special consideration should be given to those exposed in healthcare settings. ","Symptomatic cases were isolated and treated at designated hospitals regardless of test results. Asymptomatic positives were isolated at centralized facilities. Close contacts and travelers from Hubei testing negative were isolated at home or a central facility, and monitored for 14 days. PCR testing was required for all close contacts at the beginning of isolation, and release was conditional on a negative PCR result. Basic demographics, signs and symptoms, clinical severity, and exposure history were recorded for all confirmed cases.","Enforcement of current wildlife protection policy and continued community infrastructure development appears to significantly reduce high-risk contact between humans, wildlife and livestock. Closer collaboration between local animal and human health authorities within the current epidemic disease prevention programmes will provide educational and training opportunities to promote risk-mitigation knowledge, skills and best practice in local communities. For example, cave monitoring and management is a low-cost and efficient method to help restrict human activities (e.g. recreation and mining) that lead to contact with bats in caves. This is of particular importance given the emergence of 2019-nCoV, which appears likely to be a bat-origin coronavirus.10,11"],"title":["CHAPTER 4 Keeping Track of Viruses","Guidelines for preventing respiratory illness in older adults aged 60 years and above living in long-term care: A rapid review of clinical practice guidelines","Guidelines for preventing respiratory illness in older adults aged 60 years and above living in long-term care: A rapid review of clinical practice guidelines","Guidelines for preventing respiratory illness in older adults aged 60 years and above living in long-term care: A rapid review of clinical practice guidelines","Guidelines for preventing respiratory illness in older adults aged 60 years and above living in long-term care: A rapid review of clinical practice guidelines","Guidelines for preventing respiratory illness in older adults aged 60 years and above living in long-term care: A rapid review of clinical practice guidelines","Guidelines for preventing respiratory illness in older adults aged 60 years and above living in long-term care: A rapid review of clinical practice guidelines","Guidelines for preventing respiratory illness in older adults aged 60 years and above living in long-term care: A rapid review of clinical practice guidelines","Guidelines for preventing respiratory illness in older adults aged 60 years and above living in long-term care: A rapid review of clinical practice guidelines","Guidelines for preventing respiratory illness in older adults aged 60 years and above living in long-term care: A rapid review of clinical practice guidelines","AGA Institute Rapid Recommendations for Gastrointestinal Procedures During the COVID-19 Pandemic","Estimating unobserved SARS-CoV-2 infections in the United States","Guidelines for preventing respiratory illness in older adults aged 60 years and above living in long-term care: A rapid review of clinical practice guidelines","Guidelines for preventing respiratory illness in older adults aged 60 years and above living in long-term care: A rapid review of clinical practice guidelines","Guidelines for preventing respiratory illness in older adults aged 60 years and above living in long-term care: A rapid review of clinical practice guidelines","The ALPHA Project: An architecture for leveraging public health applications","Epidemiology and Transmission of COVID-19 in Shenzhen China: Analysis of 391 cases and 1,286 of their close contacts","Guidelines for preventing respiratory illness in older adults aged 60 years and above living in long-term care: A rapid review of clinical practice guidelines","42 An Overview of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome in the Middle East","Guidelines for preventing respiratory illness in older adults aged 60 years and above living in long-term care: A rapid review of clinical practice guidelines","Development of a safe neutralization assay for SARS-CoV and characterization of S-glycoprotein","Epidemiology and Transmission of COVID-19 in Shenzhen China: Analysis of 391 cases and 1,286 of their close contacts","The Effect of Large-Scale Anti-Contagion Policies on the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Pandemic","Applying lessons from SARS to a newly identified coronavirus","Guidelines for preventing respiratory illness in older adults aged 60 years and above living in long-term care: A rapid review of clinical practice guidelines","Cross-reaction of sera from COVID-19 patients with SARS-CoV assays.","Serological assays for emerging coronaviruses: Challenges and pitfalls","Guidelines for preventing respiratory illness in older adults aged 60 years and above living in long-term care: A rapid review of clinical practice guidelines","Guidelines for preventing respiratory illness in older adults aged 60 years and above living in long-term care: A rapid review of clinical practice guidelines","Regaining perspective on SARS-CoV-2 molecular tracing and its implications","Asymptomatic coronavirus infection: MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19)","YouTube as source of information on 2019 novel coronavirus outbreak: A cross sectional study of English and Mandarin content","Cardiovascular Considerations for Patients, Health Care Workers, and Health Systems During the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Pandemic","Coronaviruses: Molecular Biology\u2606","Abstracts accepted for publication only","Guidelines for preventing respiratory illness in older adults aged 60 years and above living in long-term care: A rapid review of clinical practice guidelines","CHAPTER 4 The Eye and Ear","What Have We Learned About Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus Emergence in Humans?
